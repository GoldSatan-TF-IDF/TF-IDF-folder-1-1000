elizabeth george believing the lie in loving memory of anthony mott brilliant raconteur adored companion always antonio to me this lifes five windows of the soul distorts the heavens from pole to pole and leads you to believe a lie when you see with not thro the eye william blake october fleet street the city of london zed benjamin had never been called into the office of the editor before and he found the experience simultaneously disconcerting and thrilling the disconcerting half of it resulted in massive sweating of the armpits the thrilling half of it produced a heartbeat he could actually feel for some reason in the pads of his thumbs but since from the first hed believed it essential to see rodney aronson as just another bloke at the source he attributed both the sweating of armpits and the pulsing of thumbs to the fact that hed switched from his one summer suit to his one winter suit rather too early in the season he made a mental note to change back to the summer suit in the morning and he only hoped his mother hadnt taken it out to be cleaned once she saw hed made the switch that would be zed thought exactly like her his mum was helpful and earnest she was too much of both he sought a distraction easy enough to find in rodney aronsons office while the editor of the newspaper continued to read zeds story zed began to read the headlines on the old issues of the tabloid that were framed and hung along the walls he found them distasteful and idiotic their stories a form of pandering to the worst inclinations in the human psyche rent boy breaks silence was a piece on a kerbcrawling encounter between a sixteenyearold boy and a member of parliament in the vicinity of kings cross station an unseemly romantic interlude unfortunately interrupted by the advent of vice officers from the local nick mp in sex triangle with teenager preceded the rent boy breaking his silence and mp wife in suicide drama followed hard on its heels the source had been on top of all these stories first on the scene first with the scoop first with the money to pay informants for salacious details to juice up a report that in any legitimate paper would either be written with discretion or buried deep inside or both this was particularly the case for such hot topics as prince in bedroom brouhaha kissandtell equerry shocks palace and another royal divorce all of which zed knew very well from gossip in the canteen had topped the sources previous circulation figures by over one hundred thousand copies each this was the sort of reportage for which the tabloid was known everyone in the newsroom understood that if you didnt want to get your hands dirty sifting through other peoples nasty bits of laundry then you didnt want to work as an investigative reporter at the source which was admittedly the case for zedekiah benjamin he definitely didnt want to work as an investigative reporter at the source he saw himself as a columnistforthefinancial times kind of bloke someone with a career providing enough respectability and name recognition to support his real passion which was writing fine poetry but jobs as respectable columnists were as scarce as knickers under kilts and one had to do something to put food on the table since writing excellent verse wasnt about to do it thus zed knew it behooved him to act at all times like a man who found the pursuit of the social gaffes of celebrities and the peccadilloes of members of the royal family journalistically and professionally fulfilling still he liked to believe that even a paper like the source could benefit from a slight elevation from its usual position in the gutter from where it had to be said no one was gazing at the stars the piece that rodney aronson was reading demonstrated this in zeds mind a tabloid story did not have to swim in lubricious facts in order to capture the readers interest stories could be uplifting and redemptive like this one and still sell newspapers true stories like this one werent likely to make the front page but the sunday magazine would do although a twopage spread at the centre of the daily edition wouldnt have gone down bad either just as long as photographs accompanied it and the story made a jump to the following page zed had spent ages on this piece and it deserved a gallon of newsprint he thought it had exactly what readers of the source liked but with refinement sins of the fathers and their sons were featured ruined relationships were explored alcohol and drug usage was involved and redemption was achieved here was a feature about a wastrel caught in the deadly embrace of methamphetamine addiction who at the eleventh hour of his life more or less managed to turn himself around and live anew birthing himself through an unexpected devotion to societys lowest of the low here was a story with villains and heroes with worthy adversaries and enduring love here were exotic locations family values parental love and above all its a snore rodney aronson tossed zeds story to one side of his desk and fingered his beard he dislodged a flake of chocolate therein and popped it into his mouth hed finished a cadbury hazelnut while he was reading and his restless eyes took in his desktop as if seeking another indulgence which he didnt need considering a girth barely hidden by the overlarge safari jacket he favoured for workday attire what zed thought hed somehow misheard and he rooted round in his mind for anything that rhymed with snore as a means of reassuring himself that his editor hadnt just condemned his piece to the bottom corner of page or worse snore rodney said snore as in sleep as in put me to sleep you promised me a hot investigative piece if i sent you up there you guaranteed me a hot investigative piece as i recall if i went to the expense of putting you up in a hotel for god knows how many days five zed said because it was a complicated piece and there were people who needed to be interviewed so that the objectivity one wants to maintain all right five and im going to want a word about your choice of hotel by the way because ive seen the bill and im wondering if the bloody room came with dancing girls when someone is sent the hell up to cumbria for five days at the expense of the paper promising that a whizbang story will be the outcome rodney picked up the piece and used it to gesture with what the hell exactly have you investigated here and what in gods names this title all about the ninth life what is this something from one of your highbrow litracher classes maybe creative writing eh fancy yourself a novelist do you zed knew the editor hadnt been to university that was part of the canteen gossip as well sotto voce had come the advice soon after zeds joining the staff of the source for gods sake and for your own good dont cross rod with anything that reminds him you have a first or a second or a whatever in something even vaguely associated with higher education mate cannot cope and thinks youre taking the piss so keep it shut when it comes to that kind of thing thus zed trod carefully with his reply to rodneys question about the title of his piece i was thinking of cats actually you were thinking of cats uh having nine lives got it in a basket but were not writing about cats are we no of course not but zed wasnt sure what the editor wanted so he altered direction and plunged on with his explanation what i meant was that the blokes been eight times in rehab see in three different countries and nothing worked for him and i mean nothing oh maybe hes been clean for six or eight months or once for a year but after a bit its back to the meth and hes wasted again he ends up in utah where he meets a very special woman and suddenly hes a new man and he never looks back presto changeo thats about it saved by the power of love eh rodneys voice sounded affable zed took heart from this thats exactly it rodney thats whats so incredible hes completely cured he comes home not to the fatted calf but the fatted what zed backpedaled swiftly biblical allusion obviously a very bad way to go stupid remark that so he comes home and he starts a programme to help the unhelpable was that a word zed wondered and not who youd expect him to help young blokes and girls with their lives ahead of them but rejects old blokes living rough societys detritus rodney glanced his way zed hurried on with social rubbish getting its next meal from the inside of wheelie bins while they spit out their rotting teeth he saves them he thinks theyre worth saving and they respond theyre cured as well a lifetime of booze and drugs and living rough and theyre cured of it zed took a breath he waited for rodneys reply it came evenly enough but the tone was suggestive of a lack of enthusiasm for zeds defence of his reportage theyre rebuilding a bloody tower zed nobodys cured of anything and when the towers finished the lot of them will go back to the street i dont think so why because its a pele tower and thats what gives the story its power its a metaphor zed knew the very idea of metaphor put him onto dangerous ground with the editor so he madly rushed on consider the use of the towers and youll see how it works they were built for protection against border reivers those nasty blokes who invaded from scotland eh and for our purposes the border reivers represent drugs okay meth coke hash smack blow whatever the pele tower itself represents redemption and recovery and each floor of the tower which in the past contained something different and by this i mean the ground floor was for animals and the first floor was for cooking and household activities and the second floor was for living and sleeping and then the roof was for fighting off the reivers by showering them with arrows and oh i dont know hot oil or something and when you look at all this and take it to mean what it ought to mean and could mean in the life of a person whos been on the street for what ten or fifteen years then rodneys head dropped onto his desk he waved zed off zed wasnt sure what to make of this it looked like dismissal but he wasnt about to slink off with his tail between god another metaphor he thought he crashed on saying its what makes this story a cut above its what makes this story a sunday piece i see it in the magazine four full pages with photos the tower the blokes rebuilding it the befores and the afters that sort of thing its a snore rodney said again which by the way is another metaphor and so is sex which this story has none of sex zed repeated well the wife is glamorous i suppose but she didnt want the story to be about her or about their relationship she said hes the one who rodney raised his head i dont mean sex as in sex stupid i mean sex as in sex he snapped his fingers the sizzle the tension the makethereaderwantsomething the restlessness the urge the rising excitement the makeherwetandmakehimhard only they dont know why they even feel that way am i being clear your story doesnt have it but its not meant to have it its meant to be uplifting to give people hope were not in the bloody uplifting business and we sure as hell arent in the business of hope were in the business of selling papers and believe me this pile of bushwa wont do it we engage in a certain type of investigative reporting here you told me you knew that when i interviewed you isnt that why you went to cumbria so be an investigative reporter investibloodygate i did bollocks this is a love fest someone up there seduced your pants off absolutely no way and you softpedaled did not happen so this again rodney gestured with the story represents the hard stuff eh this is how you go for the storys big vein well i can see that not exactly i suppose but i mean once one got to know the bloke one lost ones nerve one investigated zippo this seemed a rather unfair conclusion zed thought so what youre saying is that an expose of drug abuse of a wasted life of tormented parents whove tried everything to save their kid only to have him save himself this bloke who was about to choke on the silver spoon rodney thats not investigative thats not sexy the way you want it to be sexy the son of some hooray henry wastes himself on drugs rodney yawned dramatically this is something new you want me to tick off the names of ten other useless bags of dog droppings doing the same thing it wont take long zed felt the fight drain out of him all the time wasted all the effort spent all the interviews conducted all he had to admit it the subtle plans to alter the direction of the source and make it into a paper at least marginally worthwhile and thereby put his name in lights since lets face it the financial times wasnt hiring at the moment all for nothing it wasnt right zed considered his options and finally said okay i take your point but what if i give it another go what if i go up there and do some more digging about what for gods sake that was surely the question zed thought about all the individuals hed spoken to the reformed addict his wife his mother his sisters his father the poor sots he was saving was there someone somewhere doing something hed missed well there had to be for the simple reason that there always was im not sure zed settled on saying but if i nose around everyones got secrets everyone lies about something and consider how much weve already spent on the story it wont be such a waste if i give it another try rodney pushed his chair back from his desk and seemed to roll zeds offer round in his head he jabbed a finger onto a button on his phone and barked to his secretary wallace you there and when she responded get me another cadbury hazelnut again and then to zed your time your dime and thats the only way im going for it zed blinked that put things in an entirely different light he was on the bottom rung of the ladder at the source and so were his wages he tried to do the maths on a train ticket a hired car a hotel perhaps a downatheel b amp b or some old lady letting out rooms on a back street in where not by one of the lakes that would cost too much even at this time of year so it would have to be and would he be paid for the time he spent in cumbria he doubted it he said cn i have a think on it i mean you wont spike the story straightaway right i have to look at my funds if you know what i mean look all you want rodney smiled a strange and unnatural stretching of his lips that spoke of how seldom he used them in this manner like i said your time your dime thanks rodney zed wasnt quite sure what he was thanking the other man for so he nodded got to his feet and headed for the door as he reached for the knob rodney added in a friendly tone if you decide to make the trip i suggest you lose the beanie zed hesitated but before he could speak rodney continued its not a religion thing kid i could give a bloody crap about your religion or anyone elses this is a recommendation coming from a bloke whos been in the business since you were in nappies you can do it or not but the way i see it you dont want anything to distract people or give them a reason to think youre anything but their confessor best friend shoulder to cry on psychowhosis or whatever so when you show up in anything takes their attention away from the story they want to tell or better yet and for our purposes dont want to tell youve got a problem and i mean any of it turbans rosary beads swinging from your neck beanies fulllength beards dyed in henna daggers at the waist are you with me my point is that an investigative reporter blends in and with the beanie look theres nothing you can do about the height and the hair unless you colour the hair and im not asking you to do that but the beanie takes it over the top as if in reflex zed touched his yarmulke i wear it because dont care why you wear it dont care if you wear it its a word from the wise is all your choice zed knew the editor was saying this last bit to avoid a lawsuit indeed he knew the editor had phrased everything hed said about the yarmulke for the very same reason the source was not exactly a bastion of political correctness but that was not the point rodney aronson knew which side of his professional bread bore the butter just take it on board rodney told him as the office door opened and his secretary entered bearing a familysize chocolate bar will do zed said absolutely st johns wood london time was of the essence so he left at once he planned to take the tube and switch to the bus at baker street a taxi all the way to st johns wood would have been better with the added benefit of giving him leg room but he could ill afford it so he hoofed it down to blackfriars station waited interminably for a circle line train and when it arrived crammed to the gills he was forced to ride next to the carriage doors where the only way to fit inside was to hunch his shoulders and rest his chin on his chest in the manner of a penitent with a crick in his neck he stopped at a cashpoint before catching the bus for the final leg of his journey his purpose was to check his bank account in the vain hope that hed somehow miscalculated the last time hed balanced his chequebook he had no savings other than what was contained in that single account he saw the amount and felt his spirits sink a trip to cumbria would clean him out and he had to think was it worth it it was after all only a story give it up and hed merely be assigned another but there were stories and there were stories and this one he knew it was something special undecided still he arrived home ninety minutes earlier than usual and because of this he rang the bell at the buildings entrance to announce himself so his mother didnt panic when she heard a key in the lock at a time of day when no one was due at the flat he said its me mum and she said zedekiah wonderful which rather puzzled him until he got inside and saw the source of his mothers delight susanna benjamin was in the midst of finishing up a modest afternoon tea but she wasnt alone a young woman sat in the most comfortable chair in the lounge the chair zeds mother always reserved for guests and she blushed prettily and dropped her head for a moment as zeds mother made the introductions she was called yaffa shaw and according to susanna benjamin she had membership in the same book discussion group as zeds mother who proclaimed this a marvelous coincidence for some reason zed waited for more and soon was given it in the form of i was telling yaffa only just now that my zedekiah always has his nose in a book and not only one but four or five at once tell yaffa what youre reading now zed yaffa is reading the new graham swift well were all reading the new graham swift for the book group zed sit sit darling have a cup of tea oh my goodness its cold ill get some fresh shall i before zed could manage an answer to this his mother was gone he heard her in the kitchen banging about she turned on the radio for good measure he knew it would take her a deliberate quarter of an hour to produce the tea because he and his mother had been through this before the last time it had been the girl working on the till at tesco the time before that and a far better bet the oldest niece of their rabbi in london to attend a summer course offered by an american university whose name zed could not remember after yaffa who was watching him doubtless in hope of conversation there would be another this would not cease till hed married one of them and then the prodding for grandchildren would begin not for the first time zed cursed his older sister her professional life and her decision not only not to reproduce but also not to marry she had the career in science that had been intended for him not that hed wanted a career in science but if shed only cooperated and given their mother a soninlaw and grandchildren he wouldnt be coming home time and again to yet another potential mate lured onto the premises through one pretext or another he said to yaffa you and mum the same book discussion group is it she blushed more deeply not exactly she admitted i work in the bookshop i make recommendations to the group your mum and i we were talking i mean the way people do you know oh how he knew and above all the things he knew was the fact that he knew exactly how susanna benjamin operated he could picture the conversation the sly questions and the trusting replies he wondered how old the poor girl was and whether his mother had managed to work her fertility into the equation he said i wager you didnt expect to find she even had a son she didnt say only now thingsre a bit difficult because zed darling his mother sang out from the kitchen darjeelings fine tea cake as well what about a scone dear yaffa youll have more tea yes you young people will want to chat i know that was exactly what zed didnt want what he wanted was time to think and to weigh the pros and cons of going into debt to take himself up to cumbria for the time needed to sex up his story and when in cumbria if he actually went there he was going to have to determine exactly what constituted the sex the zing the snap the whatever it was supposed to be to excite the readers of the source who it was highly probable had the collective intelligence of gravestones how to excite a gravestone give it a corpse zed chuckled inwardly at the extended metaphor he was only glad he hadnt used it in conversation with rodney aronson here we are my dears susanna benjamin rejoined them bearing a tray of fresh tea scones butter and jam my zedekiahs a big boy isnt he yaffa i dont know where he got his height what is it exactly dear heart this last to zed he was six feet eight inches tall and his mother knew that as well as she knew where the height came from which was his paternal grandfather whod been only three inches shorter when he didnt reply she went blithely on with and what feet he has look at those feet yaffa and hands the size of rugby balls and you know what they say she winked milk and sugar zedekiah you want both yes and to yaffa two years on the kibbutz he was this son of mine then two years in the army mum zed said oh dont be so bashful she poured more tea into yaffas cup the israeli army yaffa what do you think of that he likes to hide everything such a humble boy hes always been that way yaffas like that too zedekiah every bit of information must be dragged out of the girl born in tel aviv father a surgeon two brothers working in cancer research mother a clothing designer my boy clothing designer isnt that wonderful of course i couldnt afford a single thing she designs because her clothes are sold in what did you call them yaffa dear boutiques yaffa said although shed gone so red in the face that zed feared a stroke or seizure was in the offing knightsbridge zed his mother intoned just think of it she designs all the way in israel and the clothing comes here zed sought a way to interrupt the flow so he said to yaffa what brought you to london studies susanna benjamin replied shes going to university here science zedekiah biology chemistry yaffa said chemistry biology geology its all the same because think of the brain in this sweet head of hers zed and isnt she pretty have you ever seen a prettier little thing than our yaffa sitting here not recently zed said with a meaningful look at his mother he added its been at least six weeks in the hope that the sheer embarrassment of having her intentions brought out into the open would force her to wind down that was not to be susanna added he likes to make fun of his mother yaffa hes a tease my zedekiah youll get used to that used to that zed cast a look at yaffa who was shifting uneasily in her chair this told him there was more to be revealed and his mother revealed it forthwith yaffas taking your sisters old bedroom susanna said to her son shes come to look at it and shes said its just what she needs now shes having to move from her other lodgings wont it be lovely to have another young face in the flat shell be joining us tomorrow and you must tell me what you like for breakfast yaffa starting the day out with a proper meal is going to help you with your studies it did for zedekiah didnt it zed firstclass degree in literature my son did i tell you he writes poetry yaffa something tells me hes likely to write a poem about you zed stood abruptly hed forgotten he had his teacup in hand and the darjeeling sloshed out thankfully most of it went onto his shoes saving his mothers carpet but he would have liked to dump it onto her neatly coifed grey head his final decision was as instantaneous as it was necessary he said im off to cumbria mum she blinked cumbria but didnt you just more to the story and ive got to go after it very timesensitive as things turn out but when are you leaving soon as i pack my bag which he decided ought to take him five minutes or less en route to cumbria the fact that he wanted and needed to leave posthaste before his mother built the chuppah right in the lounge forced zed to catch a train that would get him to cumbria by a most circuitous route that couldnt be helped once he packed his bag and tucked his laptop into its case he was gone effectuating a very clean getaway the bus the tube euston station slapping down a credit card to pay for his ticket four sandwiches a copy of the economist the times and the guardian wondering how long it was going to take him to find something anything to sex up his story wondering even more how long it was going to take him to break his mother of bringing women in off the street like his procurer by the time he was able to board the train he was ready for the distraction of work he opened up his laptop and as the train left the station he began to search through his notes which hed meticulously recorded during every interview which hed meticulously typed into the laptop every night he also had with him a set of handwritten notes he would check those as well for there had to be something and he would find it he reviewed the subject of his story first nicholas fairclough thirtytwo years old the formerly dissolute son of bernard fairclough first baron of ireleth in the county of cumbria born into wealth and privilege there was that silver spoon hed squandered throughout his youth the good fortune that hed been handed by fate he was a man graced with the face of an angel but in possession of the inclinations of lots nextdoor neighbour a series of rehabilitation programmes had seen him as an unwilling participant from his fourteenth year onward they read like a travelogue as progressively more exotic and remote locations were chosen by his parents in an attempt to entice him into healthy living when he wasnt taking the cure somewhere he was using his fathers money to travel in a lifeowesmealiving style that led him time and again directly back into addiction everyone threw in the towel on the bloke after wiping their washed hands upon it father mother sisters even a cousin cum brother had now that was something he hadnt thought about zed realised the cousincumbrother angle it had seemed a nonstory and nicholas himself had certainly emphasized that during interviews but there was a chance that zed might have missed something he could now use he flipped through his notebook first and found the name ian cresswell employed by fairclough industries in a position of some quite serious responsibility first cousin to nicholas eight years older born in kenya but come to england in late childhood to be a resident in the fairclough home now that was something wasnt it something that could be moulded somehow zed looked up thoughtfully he glanced at the window it was pitchdark outside so all he saw was his own reflection a redheaded giant with worry lines becoming incised on his forehead because his mother was attempting to marry him off to the first willing woman she was able to find and his boss was ready to deposit his wellwritten prose into the rubbish and he himself just wanted to write something marginally worthwhile and so what did he have in these notes he asked himself what what zed fished out one of his four sandwiches and began to devour it as he checked his paperwork he was looking for a clue for the way he could spin his story or at least for a hint that further digging in one area or another might produce the sizzle that rodney aronson said was required the cousinsasbrothers angle was possible reading however zed found that his thoughts were dominated by old testament tales which took him into the land of biblical allusion and metaphor where he could ill afford to wander but if the truth were told it was difficult to read what hed uncovered in his interviews with all the principal characters without thinking of cain and abel my brothers keeper burnt offerings of the fruits of ones labour and being pleasing or notsopleasing to whoever was standing in place of god in the story which would probably be lord fairclough baron of ireleth and if one truly wanted to be biblical about things the peer could be isaac faced with esau and jacob and their battling birthrights to contend with although how anyone on earth could have mistaken the skin of a dead lamb or whatever it had been for hairy arms had always been way way beyond zeds willingness to believe the whole idea of birthrights however drove zed deeper into his notes to see if he had any information about who actually stood to inherit what should something untoward happen to lord fairclough in addition to who stood to run fairclough industries should the baron meet an untimely end now that would be a story wouldnt it bernard fairclough mysteriously what dies or disappears lets say he falls down the stairs becomes incapacitated has a stroke or whatever a little digging turns over the fact that days before his untimely end or whatever it was hes met with his solicitor and what a new will is drawn up his intentions as to the family business are made crystal clear lifetime settlements are made language is inserted into his will his trust his papers as to what would it be an indication of an inheritance a declaration of someones disinheritance a revelation of what the son is not his actual son the nephew is not his actual nephew theres a second family in the hebrides theres a mad and deformed elder sibling long hidden in the attic the cellar the boathouse theres something explosive something kapow something sexy of course the problem was that if zed wanted to admit the entire truth of the matter the only remotely sexy thing about his story of nicholas faircloughs ninth life was the mans wife and she was sexy in spades he hadnt wanted to make too much of that fact in his meeting with rodney aronson because hed been fairly certain of rodneys reaction which would have come from the photographhertits school of thought zed had kept fairly mum on the topic of the wife because shed wished to remain in the background but now he wondered if there was something about her that he might explore he went to that set of notes and saw that words like caramba and yikes had indicated his initial reaction upon laying his eyes on her hed even nonsensically written south american siren by way of describing her every inch of her a woman demanding notice from an man if eve had looked remotely like alatea fairclough zedekiah had concluded at the end of their only interview it was no wonder adam took the apple the only question was why he hadnt eaten the whole damn crop and the tree as well so was she the story the sex the sizzle she was stunning in all the right ways but how did one turn stunning into story shes the reason im alive today says the husband but so what run a picture of her and any bloke whose parts are in working order is going to know why nicholas fairclough took the cure besides she had nothing to say beyond what nicks done hes done himself im his wife but im not important in his real story had that been a hint zed wondered his real story was there more to uncover he thought hed dug but perhaps hed been too smitten with the subject of his piece and perhaps hed been too smitten with his subject because he wanted to believe such things were possible redemption salvation turning ones life around finding true love perhaps that was the line to follow true love had nicholas fairclough really found it and if he had did someone envy it one of his sisters perhaps because one of them was unmarried and the other divorced and how did they feel anyway now that the prodigal had returned further rustling through his notes further reading another sandwich a wander through the train to see if there was a buffet car what a ludicrous thought in these days of marginal profits because he was dying for a coffee then it was back to his seat where he finally gave up the ghost altogether and then popped back up with the idea of ghosts because the family home was what had got him started in the first place on this piece and what if the family home was haunted and the haunting had led to the drug addiction which had led to the search for a cure which had led to he was back to the bloody wife again the south american siren and the only reason he was back to her was caramba and yikes and hed be better off crawling back home and forgetting this whole damn thing except home meant his mother and yaffa shaw and whoever was going to follow yaffa shaw in a neverending procession of women he was meant to marry and get children on no there was a story here somewhere the kind of story that his editor wanted if he had to dig further to find something juicy hed get out his shovel and aim for china anything else was unacceptable failure was not an option october bryanbarrow cumbria ian cresswell was setting the table for two when his partner arrived home he himself had taken off early from work a romantic evening in mind hed bought lamb which was in the oven with a fragrant blanket of seasoned bread crumbs browning over the shoulder of it and hed prepared fresh vegetables and a salad in the fire house hed uncorked wine polished glasses and moved before the fireplace two chairs and the old oak game table from one corner of the room it wasnt quite cold enough for a coal fire although the ancient manor house was always rather chilly so he lit a bank of candles and fixed them to the cast iron grate then he lit two more and placed them on the table as he did so he heard the kitchen door open followed by the sound of kavs keys being tossed into the chipped chamber pot on the window seat a moment later kavs footsteps crossed the kitchen flagstones and the squeak of the old ranges door caused ian to smile it was kavs night to cook not his and kav had just discovered the first surprise ian more footsteps across the slate flagstones and then into and across the hallan ian had left the door to the fire house open and he said in here and waited kav paused at the doorway his gaze went from ian to the table with its candles to the fireplace with its candles to ian again his gaze went then from ians face to ians clothes and it lingered exactly where ian wanted it to linger but after a moment of the kind of tension that at one time would have sent the two of them directly to the bedroom kav said i had to work with the blokes today we were shorthanded im filthy ill have a wash and get changed and backed out of the room without another word this was enough to tell ian that his lover knew what the scene before him presaged this was also enough to tell ian what direction their coming conversation was as usual going to take an unspoken message of this kind from kaveh would at one time have been enough to stymie him but ian decided that wouldnt be the case tonight three years of concealment and one year in the open had taught him the value of living as he was meant to live it was thirty minutes before kaveh rejoined him and despite the fact that the meat was ten minutes out of the oven and the vegetables were well on their way to becoming a culinary disappointment ian was determined not to feel affronted by the time it had taken the other man to return he poured the wine forty quid for the bottle not that it mattered considering the occasion and he nodded to the two glasses he picked his own up said its a good bordeaux and waited for kav to join him for a toast for clearly ian thought kaveh saw that a toast was ians intention else why would he be standing there with his glass lifted and an expectant smile on his face for a second time kavs gaze took in the table he said two places did she ring you or something i rang her ian lowered his glass and what i asked for another night and she actually cooperated for once arent you having some wine kav i got it in windermere that wine shop we were in last i had words with bloody old george kav inclined his head in the direction of the road he caught me on the way in hes complaining about the heating again he said hes entitled to central heating entitled he said hes got plenty of coal whys he not using it if the cottage is too cold he says he doesnt want a coal fire he wants central heating he says if he doesnt have it hes looking for another situation when he lived here he didnt have central heating for gods sake he had the house itself i think he saw that as compensation well hes going to have to learn to cope and if he cant do that hell have to find another farm to rent anyway i dont want to spend this evening talking about george cowleys grievances against us the farm was for sale we bought it he didnt full stop you bought it a technicality soon to be taken care of i hope when therell be no i no yours and mine no me no you only we ian took up the second glass and carried it to kav kav hesitated for a moment then he accepted it jesus god i want you ian said and then with a smile want to feel how much hmmm no lets let it build bastard i thought thats how you like it ian first time youve smiled since you walked in the door tough day not really kav said just a lot of work and not enough help you no they both drank then eyes on each other kav smiled again ian moved toward him kav moved away he tried to make it look as if his attention had been caught by the gleam of cutlery or the low bowl of flowers on the table but ian wasnt deceived what he thought in reaction was what any man would think when hes twelve years older than his lover and hes given up everything to be with him at twentyeight there would be any number of reasons kaveh could give in explanation of why he wasnt ready to settle down ian wasnt prepared to hear them however because he knew there was only one that served as the truth this truth was a form of hypocrisy and the presence of hypocrisy was central to every argument theyd had in the last year know what today is ian asked raising his glass again kav nodded but he looked chagrined day we met id forgotten too much going on up at ireleth hall i think but then he indicated the table ian knew he meant not only the setup but also the trouble hed gone to with the dinner when i saw this it came to me and i feel like a bloody wretch ian ive nothing for you ah no matter ian told him what i want is right here and its yours to give youve already got it havent you you know what i mean kaveh walked to the window and flicked the heavy closed curtains open a crack as if to check where the daylight had gone to but ian knew that he was trying to work out what it was he wanted to say and the thought that he might want to say what ian didnt want to hear caused his head to begin its telltale throbbing and a flash of bright stars to course across his vision he blinked hard as kaveh spoke signing a book in a registry office doesnt make us any more official than we already are thats bollocks ian said it makes us more than official it makes us legal it gives us standing in the community and whats more important it tells the world we dont need standing we already have it as individuals and whats more important ian repeated it tells the world well thats just it isnt it kaveh said sharply the world ian think about it the world and everyone in it carefully ian set his wineglass on the table he knew he should get the meat and carve it get the veg and serve them sit eat and let the rest go go upstairs afterwards and have each other properly but on this night of all nights he couldnt bring himself to do anything more but say what hed already said to his partner more than a dozen times and what hed sworn he wouldnt say tonight you asked me to come out and i did for you not for myself because it didnt matter to me and even if it had there were too many people involved and what i did for you was as good as stabbing them through their throats and that was fine by me because it was what you wanted and i finally realised i know all this three years is long enough to hide you said you said tonight you decide in front of them you said it kav and in front of them i decided then i walked out with you have you any idea of course i do dyou think im a stone i have a bloody idea ian but were not talking about just living together are we were talking about marriage and were talking about my parents people adjust ian said thats what you told me people yes other people they adjust but not them weve been through this before in my culture their culture youre part of this culture now all of you thats not how it works one doesnt just flee to a foreign country take some magic pill one night and wake up the next morning with an entirely different system of values it doesnt happen that way and as the only son the only child for gods sake i have oh christ ian you know all this why cant you be happy with what we have with how things are because how things are is a lie youre not my lodger im not your landlord dyou actually think theyll believe that forever they believe what i tell them he said i live here they live there this works and it will continue to work anything else and they wont understand they dont need to know so that they can do what keep presenting you with suitable iranian teenagers to marry fresh off the boat or the plane or whatever and eager to give your parents grandbabies thats not going to happen its happening already how many have they arranged for you to meet so far a dozen more and at what point do you just cave in and marry because you cant take the pressure from them any longer and you start to feel your duty too much and then what do you expect to have one life here and another in manchester her down there whoever she is waiting for the babies and me up here and goddamn it look at me ian wanted to kick the table over sending the crockery flying and the cutlery spinning across the floor something was building within him and he knew an explosion was on its way he headed for the door for the hallan that would take him to the kitchen and from there outside kavehs voice was sharper when he said wherere you going out the lake wherever i dont know i just need to get out come on ian dont be this way what we have what we have is nothing that isnt true come back and ill show you but ian knew where showing you would lead which was where showing you always led which was to a place having nothing to do with the change he sought he left the house without looking back en route to bryanbarrow cumbria tim cresswell slouched in the back seat of the volvo he tried to close his ears to the sound of his little sister begging their mother once again to let them live with her please please extra pretty please mummy was the way she put it she was tim knew trying to charm their mother into thinking she was actually missing something without her children in constant attendance not that anything gracie might say or the way she might say it would do any good niamh cresswell had no intention of allowing them to live with her in grangeoversands she had fish to fry that had nothing to do with any responsibility she might feel towards her offspring tim wanted to tell gracie this but what was the point she was ten years old and too young to understand the workings of pride loathing and revenge i hate daddys house gracie was adding in hopeful good measure therere spiders everywhere its dark and creaky and full of draughts and its got all these corners where therere cobwebs and things i want to live with you mummy timmy does s well she squirmed round in her seat you want to live with mummy s well dont you timmy dont call me timmy you stupid twit was what tim actually wanted to say to his sister but he couldnt ever get mad at gracie when she looked at him with that expression of trusting love on her face when he saw it though he wanted to tell her to harden up the world was a shit hole and he couldnt understand why she hadnt yet worked that out tim saw that his mother was watching him in the rear view mirror waiting to hear how he would answer his sister he curled his lip and turned to the window thinking that he could almost not blame his father for dropping the bomb that had destroyed their lives his mother was a real piece of work she was the bloody cow was acting true to character even now all pretence about why they were heading back to bryan beck farm what she didnt know was that hed picked up the phone in the kitchen the exact same moment shed taken up the phone in her bedroom so hed heard it all his fathers voice asking would she mind keeping the kids another night and his mothers voice agreeing to do so pleasantly agreeing for once which should have told his father something was up because it certainly told tim as much so he was unsurprised when his mother came out of the bedroom less than ten minutes later dressed to the nines and breezily told him to pack up because his father had phoned and he and gracie had to go back to the farm earlier that evening than usual something nice he has planned for you she said he didnt say what so get yourselves together be quick about it she went on to search for her car keys which tim realised he should have pinched not for his own sake but for gracies she damn well deserved another night with their mother if thats what she wanted she was saying see theres not even enough hot water for a proper bath mummy and the water trickles out and its brown and disgusting not like your house where i cn have bubbles i do so like bubbles mummy why cant we live with you you know very well niamh cresswell finally said no i dont countered gracie most kids live with their mums when their parents get divorced they live with their mums and they visit their dads and you got bedrooms for us anyways gracie if you want so much to have all the details about the situation you can ask your father why its different for you two oh right tim thought like dad was actually going to give gracie the facts on why they lived on some creepedout farm in some creepedout house on the edge of a creepedout village where there was nothing to do on a saturday night or a sunday afternoon but smell the cow shit listen to the sheep or and this would be if one was truly lucky chase the village ducks from their stupid duck house and their holding pen into the stream across the lane bryanbarrow was the end of nowhere but it was just perfect for their fathers new life and about that life gracie didnt understand she wasnt meant to she was meant to think that they took in lodgers only there was only one gracie and after you go to bed where do you think he really sleeps and in what bed exactly and what do you think they do there when the door is closed tim tore at the back of his hand he dug in his nails till he broke the skin and felt tiny crescents of blood bubbles form his face was a blank he knew because hed perfected that expression of absolutely nothing going on in his head that and the hands and the damage he could do to them and his overall appearance kept him where he wanted to be which was far away from other people and far away from everything else his efforts had succeeded even in getting him out of the local comprehensive now he attended a special school near ulverston which was miles and miles and miles from his fathers house all the better to cause a mindboggling inconvenience to him every day naturally and miles upon miles from his mothers house and that was the way he wanted it because there near ulverston no one knew the truth of what had happened in his life and he needed it that way tim watched the passing scenery silent the drive from grangeoversands to his fathers farm spun them north in the fading daylight up through the lyth valley there the landscape was patchwork paddocks and pastures that were the green of shamrocks and emeralds and that like a wave rolled into the distance to swell up to the fells on these great outcroppings of slate and limestone burst forth with grey scree fanning out beneath them between the pastures and the fells stood groups of woodland alders that were yellow with the autumn and oaks and maples that were gold and red and here and there erupted buildings that marked the farms great hulking stone barns and slatefronted houses with chimneys from which wood smoke curled some miles along the landscape altered as the wide lyth valley began to close in with that closure came the advent of woods and the leaves from their trees banked the road which began to wind between drystone walls it had started to rain now but when didnt it rain in this part of the world this part of the world was known for its rain and the result was moss thickly growing on the stones of the walls ferns shoving themselves out of crevices and lichens underfoot and on the bark of the trees its raining gracie said unnecessarily i hate that old house when it rains mummy dont you timmy its horrible there all dark and damp and creepy and horrible no one replied gracie dropped her head their mother made the turn into the lane that would take them up to bryanbarrow quite as if gracie had not spoken at all the road here was narrow and it proceeded upwards in a series of hairpin bends that carved a route through woodland of birch and chestnut trees they passed lower beck farm and a disused field that was thick with bracken they coursed along bryan beck itself crossed it twice climbed a bit more and finally swung into the approach to the village which lay below them nothing much more than the juncture of four lanes giving onto a green that it had a public house a primary school a village hall a methodist chapel and a c of e church made it a gathering place of sorts but only on evenings and sunday mornings and even then those gathered in the village either drank or prayed gracie began to cry as they crept over the stone bridge she said mummy i hate it here mummy please but her mother said nothing and tim knew she wouldnt there were certainly feelings to consider in this matter of where tim and gracie cresswell would live but the feelings were not those of tim and gracie cresswell that was the way it was and the way it would be at least till niamh gave up the ghost or finally just gave up whichever came first and tim wondered about this last he did it seemed that hate could kill a person although when he thought about it hate hadnt yet killed him so perhaps it wouldnt kill his mother either unlike so many farms in cumbria which maintained a distance from villages and hamlets bryan beck farm sat just at the edge of the village and it comprised an ancient elizabethan manor house an equally ancient barn and an even more ancient cottage beyond these the farms pastures opened up and in these grazed sheep although they were not the property of tims father but rather belonged to a farmer who rented the land from him they lent the farm an authentic look tims father liked to say and were in keeping with the tradition of the lakes whatever that was supposed to mean ian cresswell was no bloody farmer and as far as tim was personally concerned the stupid sheep were a great deal safer with his father keeping his distance from them by the time niamh had pulled the volvo into the drive gracie was in full blub mode she seemed to think if she sobbed loud enough their mother would turn the car around and take them back to grangeoversands instead of what she had planned which was to give them the boot just to mindfuck their father and then dash off to milnthorpe to bodyfuck her poor twit of a boyfriend in the kitchen of his stupid chinese takeaway mummy mummy gracie was crying his cars not even here im scared to go inside if his cars not here cause hes not home and grace stop it this instant niamh snapped youre acting like a twoyearold hes gone to the shops thats all therere lights on in the house and the other cars here i expect you can work out what that means she wouldnt say the name naturally she might have added your fathers lodger is at home with that nasty emphasis that communicated volumes but that would be to acknowledge kaveh mehrans existence which she had no intention of doing she did say timothy meaningfully and inclined her head towards the house this meant he was to drag gracie from the car and march her through the garden gate to the door because niamh didnt intend to do it he shoved his door open he tossed his rucksack over the low stone wall and then jerked open his sisters door he said out and grabbed her arm she shrieked no and i wont and began to kick niamh unfastened gracies safety belt and said stop making a scene the whole village will think im killing you i dont care i dont care gracie sobbed i want to go with you mummy oh for the love of god then niamh was out of the car as well but not to help tim manage his sister instead she grabbed up gracies rucksack opened it and threw it over the wall it landed this was a mercy at least on gracies trampoline where its contents spilled out into the rain among those contents was gracies favourite doll not one of those hideously misshapen fantasy women with feet in the wearhighheels position and nippleless tits at attention but a baby doll so scarily realistic that to toss it out to land on its head in the middle of a trampoline should have been considered child abuse at this gracie screamed tim shot his mother a look niamh said what did you expect me to do and then to gracie if you dont want it ruined i suggest you fetch it gracie was out of the car in a flash she was into the garden and up onto the trampoline and cradling her doll still weeping only now her tears mixed with the falling rain tim said to his mother nice one that she said talk to your father about it that was of course her answer to everything talk to your father as if he who he was and what hed done comprised the excuse for every rotten thing niamh cresswell did tim slammed the door and turned away he went into the garden while behind him he heard the volvo take off bearing his mother to wherever because he didnt much care she could fuck whatever loser she wanted to fuck as far as he was concerned in front of him gracie sat howling on her trampoline had it not been raining she would have jumped upon it wearing herself out because thats what she did and she did it every day just as what he did was what he did and he did it every day as well he scooped up his rucksack and watched her for a moment pain in the arse she was but she didnt deserve what shed been handed he went over to the trampoline and reached for her rucksack gracie he said lets go inside im not she said im not im not she clutched her doll to her bosom which caused a little tear in tims own chest he couldnt remember the dolls name he said look ill check for spiders gracie and ill get rid of cobwebs you can put whatsername in her cot bella shes called bella gracie sniffed all right bellashescalledbella you can put bellashescalledbella in her cot and ill ill brush your hair okay the way you like it ill do it up the way you like it gracie looked at him she rubbed her arm over her eyes her hair which was a source of unending pride for her was getting wet and soon enough it would be frizzy and unbrushable she fingered a long and luxurious lock of it she said french braids so hopefully that he couldnt deny her he sighed all right french braids but you got to come now or i wont kay she scooted to the edge of the trampoline and handed him bellashescalledbella he stowed the doll headfirst into gracies rucksack and carried this along with his to the house gracie followed scuffling her feet in the gravel on the garden path everything changed when they got inside though they went in through the kitchen at the east side of the house where a roast of some kind stood on the top of the primitive range in the fireplace its juices congealing in the pan beneath it a pot next to this pan held sprouts gone cold a salad was wilting on the draining board tim and gracie hadnt had their dinner but by the look of things here neither had their father ian tim felt his insides harden at the sound of kaveh mehrans voice cautious it was a little tense tim said roughly no its us a pause then timothy gracie as if it might actually be someone else mimicking his voice tim thought there was noise from the fire house something being dragged across the flagstones and onto the carpet a bleak what a mess and tim experienced a wonderful moment in which he understood theyd probably had a fight his dad and kaveh going after each others jugular with blood everywhere and wouldnt that be a treat he headed towards the fire house gracie followed to tims disappointment all was well within no overturned furniture no blood no guts the noise had come from kaveh dragging the heavy old games table from in front of the fireplace back to where it belonged he looked downinthemouth though and that was enough for gracie to forget that she herself was a walking emotional smashup she hurried over to the bloke straightaway oh kaveh she cried is something wrong whereupon the bugger dropped onto the sofa shook his head and put his face in his hands gracie sat on the sofa next to kaveh and put her arm round his shoulders wont you tell me she asked him please tell me kaveh but kaveh said nothing obviously tim thought he and their dad had had an argument of some sort and their dad had taken off in a temper good he decided he hoped they both were suffering if his dad drove off the side of a cliff that would be excellently fine by him has something happened to your mummy gracie was asking kaveh she even smoothed the blokes greasy hair has something happened to your dad cn i get you a cup of tea kaveh does your head hurt dyou have a tummy ache well tim thought gracie was taken care of her own cares forgotten shed bustle round playing nurse he dropped her rucksack inside the fire house door and himself crossed to the rooms other door where a small square hall offered an uneven staircase to the first floor of the house his laptop occupied a rickety desk beneath the window in his bedroom and the window itself looked out on the front garden and the village green beyond it it was nearly dark now and the rain was coming down in sheets the wind had picked up piling the leaves from the maples beneath benches on the green and tossing them helterskelter into the street lights were on in the terrace of houses across the green and in the ramshackle cottage where george cowley lived with his son tim could see movement behind a thin curtain he watched for a moment a man and his son and it looked to him like they were conversing but what did he know really of what was going on and then he turned to his computer he logged on the connection was slow it was like waiting for water to freeze below him he could hear the murmur of gracies voice and in a moment the sound of the stereo being turned on she was thinking that music would make kaveh feel better tim couldnt think why as music did sodall for him finally he got onto his email and checked for messages there was one especially that he sought hed been waiting anxiously to see how things were going to develop and there was no way he could have assessed this from his mothers laptop absolutely no way toyyou had finally made the proposition that tim had been angling for he read it over and thought for a while it was little enough to ask for what tim expected to get in return so he typed the message hed been waiting to type these many weeks of playing toyyou along yeah but if i do it i need something in return he hit send and couldnt help smiling he knew exactly what he wanted in exchange for the favour that was being asked of him lake windermere cumbria ian cresswell had cooled off long before he reached the lake as reaching the lake necessitated a twentyminute drive but the cooling off only applied to ians need to explode the feelings beneath that need had not changed and betrayal was first among them our situations are different didnt appease ian any longer it had been fine at first hed been so besotted with kav that the fact that the younger man might not himself do what hed successfully demanded of ian had barely registered in ians mind it had been enough to walk out of the house in the company of kaveh mehran it had been enough to leave behind his wife and his children in order he declared to himself to kaveh and to them for gods sake to finally and openly be who he was no more slithering off to lancaster no more nameless groping and nameless fucking and feeling the momentary relief of taking part in an act that was for once not such a miserable chore hed done that for years in the belief that protecting others from what hed admitted to himself when it was too late to do anything about it was more important than owning himself as he knew now he was meant to be owned kaveh had taught him that kaveh had said its them or its me and had knocked on the door and walked into the house and said do you tell them or do i tell them ian and instead of saying who the hell are you and whatre you doing here ian had heard himself make the declaration and out hed walked leaving niamh to explain to the kids if she cared to explain and he wondered now what the hell hed been thinking what sort of madness had overcome him whether he had actually been suffering from a mental disease of one kind or another he wondered this not because he didnt love kaveh mehran and still wanted him in a manner that felt like a form of insane obsession he wondered it because he hadnt stopped to consider what that moment had done to them all and he wondered it because he hadnt stopped to consider what it might mean if kaveh didnt do the same for ian as ian had done for him to ian kavehs making the declaration seemed simple enough and far less damaging than what ian had done oh he understood that kavs parents were foreigners but they were foreigners in culture and religion only theyd lived in manchester for more than a decade so they were hardly adrift in an ethnic sea of which they had no understanding it had been more than a year now that theyd lived together he and kaveh and it was time for kaveh to speak the truth about what he and ian cresswell were to each other the fact that kaveh could not embrace that simple fact and share it with his parents the unfairness of it all made ian rail that need to rail was what he wanted to get out of his system for he well knew that railing would accomplish exactly nothing the gates stood open at ireleth hall when he arrived which generally meant that someone was visiting ian didnt want to see that someone or anyone else however so instead of heading towards the medieval house that loomed above the lake he took a side route that led directly down to the water and to the stone boathouse built on its shore here he kept his scull it was sleek low in the water tricky to climb into from the stone dock that ran round three sides of the boathouses dim interior and just as tricky to climb out of this trickiness was intensified at the moment by the lack of illumination in the boathouse itself generally the light provided by the waterside doorway was sufficient but the day had been overcast in the first place and now it was getting dark that however couldnt be allowed to matter because ian needed to be out on the lake digging the hatchet blades into the water increasing his speed and burning his muscles till the sweat pouring from him allowed him to experience nothing but effort alone he untied the sculls dock line and held the shell close to the docks edge there were three stone steps into the water not far from the lakeside entry to the boathouse but hed found that using them was risky over time the lake water had encouraged algae to grow upon them and no one had cleaned the steps in years ian could have done it easily enough but only when he used the scull did he actually think about the matter of seeing to the steps and when he used the scull it was generally because he needed to use it and he needed to use it as soon as possible this evening was no different with the dock line in one hand and the other on the gunwale of the shell to hold it steady he lowered himself gingerly into the scull balancing his weight precariously so that he didnt flip the craft and fling himself into the water he sat he coiled the line and placed it into the bow he fixed his feet into the stretchers and he pushed off from the dock he was facing outward so it was a simple matter to ease the scull towards the archway and onto the lake the rain which had begun during his drive to ireleth hall was falling more determinedly now and had he not wanted to work the tension out of his body ian knew he would not have continued at that point but rain was a small matter and it wasnt raining as hard as it could besides he didnt intend to be out that long just for the time it took him to send himself flying over the water north in the direction of windermere when hed worked up enough sweat hed return to the boathouse he fixed the long oars into their rectangular locks he adjusted the position of the looms he gave an experimental movement of his legs to ensure that the seat ran smoothly on its slides and then he was ready to set out less than ten seconds saw him some distance from the boathouse and heading to the centre of the lake from there he could see the shape of ireleth hall with its tower its gables and its many chimneys telling the tale of the centuries that had gone into its making lights shone from the drawing rooms bay windows and from the firstfloor bedroom of the owners of the place on the south side of the building the massive geometrical shapes of the topiary garden gloomy against the evening sky rose above the stone walls that enclosed them and some one hundred yards away from this and partly hidden from ireleth hall itself more lights poured from every floor of another tower twin to the structure that was the earliest part of ireleth hall but in this case a folly built to resemble the stern and square pele towers of cumbria and used to house one of the most useless females that ian cresswell had ever encountered he turned from the sight of the hall the tower and the topiary garden country home of his uncle a man whom he loved but did not understand i accept you so you must accept me bernard fairclough had said to him because we all live lives of accommodation ian wondered about this however just as he wondered about debts to be paid and to whom such payment needed to go it was one other thing on his mind this evening it was one other thing that kept him out on the water the lake was not a lonely place because of its size the largest body of water in cumbria a few small towns and villages sprang up intermittently on its shores and in scattered areas within the rest of the undeveloped landscape the occasional slatefronted house stood either a country home long ago converted into a highpriced hotel or a private domicile that usually spoke of a wellheeled individual with the funds to live in more than one place because as autumn gave way to winter the lakes became unwelcoming to those who werent prepared for heavy wind and snow thus ian felt no sense of isolation out on the water true he was the only one rowing at the moment but there was comfort along the shore where boats used by members of a local club and boats kayaks canoes and sculls belonging to inhabitants of the lakeside houses had not yet been removed from the water for the coming winter he couldnt have said how long he rowed it couldnt have been long he thought as it didnt seem as if hed gained much distance hed not yet come upon the beech hill hotel from which hed be able to see clearly the hulk of belle isle lying low in the water that usually marked the halfway point of his workout but he realised he must have been more exhausted than he thought from his discussion with kaveh because he found his muscles were growing weary telling him it was time for turning back he sat for a moment still unmoving he could hear traffic noises from the a which ran along the east shore of the lake but aside from the rain hitting the water and against his windcheater that was it birds were abed and everyone of sense was indoors ian breathed deeply a shiver shuddered through him someone walking on his grave he thought wryly either that or the weather which was far more likely even in the rain he caught the scent of wood smoke from a chimney nearby and in his mind he pictured a warming blaze himself in front of it with his legs stretched out and next to him kaveh in a similar chair holding in his hand a similar glass of wine taking part in a desultory endofday conversation of the kind millions of couples had in millions of homes all over the planet that he told himself was what he wanted that and the peace that came with it it didnt seem so much to ask just a life moving forward as other lives did some minutes passed in this way with limited sounds ian at rest the scull moving gently with the rhythm of the water had it not been raining he might even have dozed but as it was he was becoming progressively wetter and it was time to head back to the boathouse he reckoned hed been on the water for more than an hour and it was in complete darkness that he made his final approach to the shore by this time trees were mere shapes on the land angular conifers as solid as standing stones wispier birches linedrawn against the sky and among them maples with palmate leaves trembling as the rain beat upon them a path among them led down to the boathouse a fanciful structure when seen from the water for even now despite the weather and the hour the shape of it formed a mass of crenellation slate and limestone and its weatherside doorway rose in a gothic arch more suitable to a church than to a shelter for boats the light had burned out above this doorway ian saw it should have come on with the fall of darkness illuminating the exterior of the boathouse even if it did little enough to shed light on the buildings insides but where a yellow glow would have at least in better weather attracted moths there was nothing at all along with the algae on the jetty steps it was something else to be seen to he aimed for the arched opening and glided within the boathouse was nowhere near the main house nor was it near the tower folly so there was nothing no hint of distant light to break the gloom and the darkness was absolute there were three other craft stored there a wellused fishing rowingboat a speedboat and a canoe of uncertain vintage and even more uncertain seaworthiness were tied up haphazardly along the front and the right side of the dock it was necessary to work ones way among them to get back to the far end where the scull had been tied and ian was able to do this by feel although he caught his hand between the rowingboat and the scull and he swore as the fiberglass of one smashed his knuckles into the wood of the other the same thing happened against the stone dock and he felt the blood this time he said goddamn and pressed his knuckles against his side for a moment the damn things hurt like the dickens and told him that whatever else he did he needed to do it with care there was a torch in his car and he had enough sense of humour remaining to congratulate himself for having left it there where it would do him absolutely no bloody good more carefully this time he reached out for the dock found it and then sought the cleat to tie up the scull at least he thought he could make a cleat hitch in light or in dark in rain or in shine he did so and released his feet from the stretchers then he shifted his weight and reached for the dock to heave himself up and out of the shell as these things do it happened when the balance of his weight was on a single stone of the dock and his body was momentarily arched out of the scull and over the water the stone that should have taken his weight and now apparently too long in place on the dock to do so became dislodged he fell forward and the scull tied only at its bow shot backwards down he went into the frigid water on his way however his head slammed into the slate from which the dock had long ago been fashioned he was unconscious when he hit the water and within a few minutes he was also dead october wandsworth london their arrangement was the same as it had been from the first she would communicate in some way and he would go to her sometimes it was a quarter smile just an upturn of her lips gone so quickly that anyone unaware of what it meant would not even have noticed sometimes it was the word tonight murmured as they passed in a corridor at other times she said something openly if perhaps they met on the stairway or in the officers mess or if perhaps they saw each other in the underground car park arriving by chance at the same moment in the morning but in any case he waited until she gave the word he didnt like it this way but there was no other she would not under any circumstances come to him and even had she been willing to do so she was his superior officer so he was hers to command it did not work the other way round hed tried it only once early on in their arrangement hed thought it might mean something if she spent the night with him in belgravia as if their relationship had turned some sort of corner although he wasnt exactly certain that he wanted it to do so shed said firmly in that way she had of making things so pellucid there were no further avenues of discussion available to him that will never happen thomas and the fact she called him thomas rather than the more intimate tommy by which his every friend and colleague referred to him said more than the other larger truth that he knew she would not say the house in eton terrace was still redolent of his murdered wife and eight months after her death on the front steps of the building he hadnt been able to bring himself to do a single thing about that he was insightful enough to realise that there was little likelihood of any womans sleeping in his bed while helens clothes still hung in the wardrobe while helens scent bottles still stood on the dressing table where helens hairbrush still held strands of helens hair until helens presence was eradicated from the house he could not realistically hope to share it with anyone else even for a night so he was caught and when isabelle said that word tonight he went to her drawn by a force that was at once a physical need and a form of oblivion however brief he did as much on this evening in the afternoon theyd had a meeting with the head of ipcc on the matter of a complaint registered that past summer by a solicitor on the behalf of her client a paranoid schizophrenic who had run into traffic in a london street while being pursued by the police the resulting internal injuries and fractured skull demanded monetary compensation and the solicitor meant to have it the police complaints commission was investigating the matter and this constituted meeting upon meeting with everyone involved explaining his or her take on the story with cctv footage viewed with eyewitnesses interviewed and with the london tabloids breathlessly eager to snatch up the story and run with it as soon as the ipcc made a determination as to guilt innocence malfeasance accident circumstances beyond anyones control or whatever else they chose to conclude the meeting had been tense he was as tightly strung as isabelle at its conclusion shed said to him as they walked through the corridors to return to their offices in victoria block id like to have you tonight thomas if youve the energy dinner and a shag very good steaks very nice wine very clean sheets not egyptian cotton as i expect yours are but fresh all the same and then the smile and something in her eyes that hed not yet been able to interpret these three months after theyd first coupled in the soulless bedroom of her basement flat damn if he didnt want her he thought it had to do with an act the nature of which allowed him to believe hed mastered her when the truth was she had quickly mastered him the arrangement was simple enough she would go to the shops and he could either go straight to the flat and let himself in with his key or go to his own home first on one pretext or another killing time till making the drive to that dismal street at the halfway point between wandsworth prison and a cemetery he chose the latter it allowed him the semblance of being his own man to further this illusion he took his time with his preparations reading his mail having a shower and a shave returning a phone call from his mother on the matter of rainwater heads along the west side of the house in cornwall should they be replaced or repaired did he think winters coming darling and with the rains getting heavier it was a pretext call on her part she wanted to know how he was but she didnt like to ask directly she knew very well that the rainwater heads had to be repaired they could not possibly be replaced it was a listed building after all it would probably be falling down round their ears before theyd receive permission to alter it they chatted on of family matters how was his brother doing he asked which was family code for is he still coping without turning back to cocaine heroin or whatever other substance he might use to remove himself from reality the answer was perfectly well darling this was family code for im monitoring him as always and youve no cause to worry about it how was his sister meant had judith yet given up the idea of permanent widowhood to which the answer terribly busy as always was code for she has no intention of risking another dreadful marriage believe me so went the conversation till all topics were exhausted and his mother said i do so hope well see you for christmas tommy and he assured her that she would after that with no other reason to hold him in belgravia he worked his way over to the river and south from there to wands worth bridge he reached the house in which isabelle lived just after half past seven parking was murder in the area but he got lucky when a van pulled away from the kerb some thirty yards down the street at isabelles door he fished out his key he had it in the lock and was letting himself in when she opened the door from within and quickly stepped outside onto the flagstones of the area at the base of the stairs from the pavement above them she shut the door behind her she said we cant tonight somethings come up i would have rung your mobile but i couldnt im sorry he was nonplussed stupidly he looked over her shoulder at the panels of the closed door he said whos here because that much was obvious enough another man he reckoned and in that he was right although it was not a man he expected bob she said her former husband how could this he wondered possibly be a problem and he enquired pleasantly thomas its awkward sandras with him the boys as well bobs wife the twin sons that were isabelles own children of her fiveyear marriage they were eight years old and hed had yet to meet them as far as he knew theyd not even been into london to see her he said this is good isabelle hes brought them to you then you dont understand she said i wasnt expecting i know that obviously so ill meet them well have dinner and ill leave he doesnt know about you who bob ive not told him this was all a surprise he and sandra have come into town for some sort of dinner a big affair theyre dressed to the nines theyve brought the boys and they thought we could have a visit the boys and i while theyre at this event they didnt phone you first what if you hadnt even been at home what would he have done with them then have them wait in the car while he went to dinner she looked irritated you know thats hardly important thomas the fact is i am at home and theyre here in london ive not seen the boys in weeks this is the first time hes actually allowing me to be alone with them and i have no intention of what he looked at her more evenly now she was pinched round the mouth he knew what this meant she was wanting a drink and the last thing shed now be able to do was to have one what is it you suppose id do isabelle corrupt them with my dissolute ways dont be difficult this has nothing to do with you tell them im your colleague then a colleague with the key to my door for the love of god if he knows i have the key to your door he doesnt and he wont i told him i thought i heard someone knock and ive come to check if anyones at the door are you aware youre contradicting yourself again he looked beyond her shoulder to the door he said isabelle is there someone else in there not bob at all not his wife not the boys she drew herself taller she was six feet tall nearly his height and he knew what it meant when she made the most of that fact what are you suggesting she demanded that ive another lover god in heaven i cannot believe youre doing this you know what this means to me these are my children youll meet them and bob and sandra and god only knows who else when im ready and not before now ive got to get back inside before he comes to see whats happening and youve got to go well talk about this tomorrow and if i walk in anyway you leave me out here i use the key i come inside what then even as he spoke the words he couldnt believe it of himself his dignity seemed to have gone the way of his brains his patience and his selfcontrol she knew it he could see that in her eyes no matter what else she was able to hide from him so well she said lets forget you said that and she went inside leaving him to cope with what looked every moment more like a tantrum thrown by a fiveyearold god what had he been thinking he wondered thomas lynley detective inspector of new scotland yard titled member of the landed gentry graduate of oxford university with a firstclass degree in being a fool october marylebone london he managed to avoid her quite successfully for two days although he was able to tell himself that he wasnt attempting to avoid her at all because he spent those days hanging about the royal courts of justice there his testimony had been called for in the ongoing trial of a serial killer with whom hed come into very close and nearly fatal contact the previous february after those two days however his presence being no longer required in the vicinity of courtroom number one he politely refused three requests from journalists for interviews which he knew would end up touching upon the one subject he could not face touching upon the death of his wife and he returned to new scotland yard there isabelle unsurprisingly asked him if hed been avoiding her since hed phoned in his necessary absences not to her but to the departmental secretary he said of course not and what possible reason had he to avoid her and hed been at court as had been his longtime partner ds barbara havers surely isabelle didnt think ds havers was also trying to avoid her he shouldnt have said this last because it gave too much away and what it gave away was the truth of the matter which was naturally that he hadnt particularly wished to have a conversation with isabelle till hed sorted out in his own head the reasons for his reaction at the door to her flat isabelle said that frankly avoiding her was precisely what shed expect ds havers to be doing as she made a regular habit of that to which hed replied be that as it may im not trying to do so she said youre angry and youve a right to be tommy i behaved badly he turned up with the children and i was completely unnerved but see it from my position please its not beyond bob to phone one of the higherups here and drop the word are you aware that acting detective superintendent ardery is having it off with a subordinate officer just thought you might want to know and hed do that tommy he would do that and you know what would happen if he did he thought she was being overly paranoid but he didnt say as much to do so would lead them into an argument if not here in her office to which shed summoned him then somewhere else he said you could be right and when she said so he knew that it was another way of saying tonight then so that they could see to what theyd had to postpone steaks wine a shag that would be very energetic and very very good which he realised was the hell of it for him isabelle in bed was inventive and exciting and in bed was the only place she allowed him even a moment of control over her he was considering her proposition when dorothea harriman the lithesome and wellturnedout departmental secretary popped into the doorway which hed left open she said detective inspector lynley and when he turned ive just had a call im afraid youre wanted by whom dee he assumed he was meant to return to the old bailey for some reason himself ah not the old bailey then himself would be the assistant commissioner sir david hillier when hillier beckoned one set off to do his bidding now he asked that would be the case and hes not here youre to go straight to his club at this hour whats he doing at his club harriman shrugged not a clue but youre meant to be there as soon as possible traffic permitting hed like you there in fifteen minutes his secretary made that clear that seals it then doesnt it he turned back to isabelle and said if youll excuse me guv when she gave a curt nod he went on his way everything still unresolved between them sir david hilliers club was near portland place and it was a ludicrous idea that lynley would be able to get there from new scotland yard within fifteen minutes but the mention of time suggested urgency so he took a cab and told the driver to ratrun and for gods sake to do everything possible to avoid piccadilly circus a regular source of congestion that got him to twins hilliers club in twentytwo minutes something of a record considering the time of day twins had been fashioned from three of the few remaining town houses in the area not razed by someones idea of redevelopment in the nineteenth century it was marked only by a discreet bronze plaque to the right of the doorbell and by an azure flag with the eponymous founders of the club memorialised upon it theyd been conjoined or so at least it seemed by their depiction on the flag as far as lynley knew no one had delved deeply enough into the history of the place to learn whether this was an apocryphal account of the clubs genesis he was admitted not by a doorman but rather by an elderly woman in black with a crisp white pinafore apron pinned to her chest she looked like someone from another century and as things developed she moved like that as well he stated his business in an entry hung with victorian paintings of uncertain quality that loomed above a marble draughtsboard floor the woman nodded and negotiated something like a threepoint turn before leading him to a door to the right of an impressive staircase broken by a mezzanine there a sculpture of venus on the half shell stood backed by a window that arched to display the upper part of a garden evidenced by the remains of a tree strangled by ivy the woman knocked opened and admitted him into a darkly panelled dining room closing the door behind him the room was empty of diners at this hour but occupied by two men at one of the linencovered tables they had a porcelain coffee service between them there were three cups one of the men was the assistant commissioner and the other was a bespectacled bloke who was perhaps too welldressed for the time of day and the present environment although for that matter so was hillier they seemed of an age but unlike hillier the other man had a receding hairline that he emphasised rather than hid by combing his remaining locks straight back where they lay flat against his skull in defiance of fashion and looks his hair was uniform in colour mousy brown would have best described it and thus seemed to be dyed also in defiance of fashion his spectacles were thick rimmed with enormous black frames and these in combination with an astoundingly overlarge upper lip unmatched to his lower made him look like someone begging to be caricatured this in fact suggested to lynley that he knew of the man although he couldnt have stated his name hillier did that lord fairclough he said bernard this is di lynley fairclough stood he was far shorter than both lynley and hillier perhaps five feet five inches and he carried something of a gut on him his handshake was firm and during the ensuing meeting nothing he said or did indicated that he was anything but strong willed and confident davids told me about you fairclough said i hope we can work well together his accent placed him from the north and its nature surprised lynley for it spoke of an education decidedly not undergone in a hallowed public school he glanced at hillier it was completely like the ac to rub elbows with someone in possession of a title it was completely unlike the ac on the other hand to do this elbowrubbing with someone whose title had come not via the blood but rather like his via the honours list lord fairclough and i were knighted on the same day hillier said as if he felt an explanation for their association was required he added fairclough industries as a means of clarification as if the name of faircloughs source of wealth if he had any would be apparent at once ah lynley said fairclough smiled the fairloo he said as means of clarification that did it of course as it would do bernard fairclough had come to prominence first because of a most unusual lavatory invented and then widely produced by fairclough industries hed sealed his place in the firmament of those receiving titles from a grateful nation however by establishing a charitable foundation whose focus was raising funds to research a cure for pancreatic cancer however fairclough had never been able to escape his association with the lavatory and much amusement had been generated by tabloids referring to his knighthood and subsequent elevation to the peerage with such declarations as it was a royal flush hillier gestured at the table lynley was meant to join them without asking hillier poured him a cup of coffee and as lynley sat and fairclough resumed his own place at the table slid the cup in his direction along with the milk and sugar bernards asked a favour of us hillier said its an entirely confidential matter which explained their meeting at twins lynley thought which also explained their meeting at twins at a time of day when the only members in the building were probably either dozing over newspapers in the library or playing squash in a basement gym lynley nodded but said nothing he glanced at fairclough who removed a white handkerchief from his pocket and patted it against his forehead this bore a moderate sheen of sweat it was not overly warm in the room he said my nephew ian cresswell my late sisters son drowned ten days ago south end of lake windermere sometime after seven in the evening his body wasnt found till the next afternoon my wife was the one who found him im sorry to hear it it was of course an automatic response to being given such information hearing it faircloughs face remained a blank valerie likes to fish he told lynley a remark that sounded apropos of nothing till he went on with she takes a small rowingboat out a few times each week odd hobby for a woman but there it is shes fished for years we keep the boat along with several other craft in a boathouse on the property and thats where ians body was facedown in the water open gash on his head although at that point there was no blood what seems to have happened lost his footing getting out of a single scull its how he took his exercise that the scull he went down hit his head on the dock its stone and fell into the water couldnt swim or unconscious the latter a terrible accident according to the inquest you think otherwise fairclough turned in his seat he seemed to look at a painting over a fireplace at the far side of the room this was a circus scene painted in the style of hogarth part of the rakes progress with assorted human oddities from the circus in place of the rake it was another vote for the conjoined twins theyd have been circus material certainly fairclough studied the scene depicted before he finally said he fell because two large stones came loose on the dock they dislodged i see hillier said bernard thinks theres a chance the stones had some help tommy the boathouse has stood for more than one hundred years and it was built to stand a hundred more so was the dock yet if the coroner has ruled an accident i dont actually disbelieve him fairclough said quickly but he looked at hillier as if asking the ac to finish hillier complied bernard wants to be certain it was an accident as anyone might there are family concerns what sort of family concerns the other men were silent lynley looked from one to the other he said i can hardly make certain of anything if im in the dark lord fairclough its bernard fairclough said although hilliers look in his direction suggested that such familiarity was going to breed the usual its bernie actually among the family but bernard will do fairclough reached for his coffee cup hillier had topped it up but it seemed that fairclough wanted the cup more for something to do with his hands than for drinking he turned it examined it and finally said i want to be certain that my son nicholas wasnt involved in ians death lynley let a moment hang while he absorbed this information and what it could imply about the father the son and the deceased nephew he said have you reason to believe nicholas might be involved no then again that glance towards hillier which prompted the ac to say nicholas has had a wed have to call it a troubled youth he seems to have got over it but as hes seemed to get over it before bernards fear is that the boy a man now fairclough cut in hes thirtytwo hes married as well when i look at him things seem to have changed he seems to have changed but it was drugs all sorts but particularly methamphetamine and it went on for years you see since he was round thirteen hes lucky even to be alive at this point and he swears he knows it but thats what he always said isnt it time after time lynley heard all this with a dawning of understanding as to how he fitted into what was going on hed never spoken of his brother to hillier but hillier had snouts in every part of the met and how unlikely was it that among the information he gathered was that which told the ac of peter lynleys battles with addiction bernard continued then he met a woman from argentina shes a real beauty and he fell in love but she laid down the law shed have nothing to do with him till he got the monkey off his back permanently so he did so apparently to lynley this seemed all the more reason that nicholas fairclough was uninvolved but he waited for more and it came in fits and starts it seemed that the dead man had grown up in the fairclough home playing the role of an older brother whose perfection had created footsteps too large for the younger nicholas ever to hope hed be able to walk in ian cresswell had successfully completed schooling at st bees in cumbria and from there achieved further success at university this put him in position to serve as the chief of finances for fairclough industries as well as the man in charge of bernard faircloughs personal financial affairs these affairs it seemed were considerable no decisions been made as to wholl take over the daily running of the firm when im no longer around fairclough said but obviously ian was very high on the list of contenders did nicholas know this everyone knew it does he stand to gain then from ians death as ive said no decision had or has been made so if everyone knew where ian stood everyone whoever everyone was had a motive for murder lynley thought if murder it was yet if the coroner had deemed it an accident fairclough should have been relieved which he clearly was not lynley wondered idly if despite his words fairclough in fact wanted his son to be the cause of his own cousins death it was perverse but in his time at the met lynley had seen his share of perversity exactly who is everyone lynley enquired i take it there are others besides nicholas with a vested interest in fairclough industries there were as it turned out there were two older sisters and a former soninlaw but it was nicholas about whom fairclough had concerns lynley could leave the rest of them alone not a single one of them was a killer they lacked the bottle for it nicholas it seemed did not and besides with his history one wished to be sure he had no involvement in this matter one merely wished to be sure id like you to take this on hillier told lynley youll have to go up to the lakes and all of it has to be done with complete discretion a police investigation managed with complete discretion lynley thought he wondered how he was meant to accomplish that hillier elucidated no one will know youve gone there and the local police wont know youre doing this we dont want to give the impression that the ipccs about to get involved no feathers ruffled but no stone unturned you know how to manage that the fact was that he didnt and there was something else that made him uneasy he said superintendent ardery is going to want to ill handle superintendent ardery ill handle everyone so im to work on this completely alone no one at the yard can be involved hillier said this seemed to be code for the fact that lynley was meant to do nothing at all if nicholas fairclough turned out to be a killer he was to leave him to the hands of his father to the hands of god or to the hands of the furies all of this amounted to an investigation lynley wanted no part of but he knew he wasnt being requested to make a trip up to cumbria he was being told to do so fleet street the city of london rodney aronson had clawed his way to his present position as editor of the source through means both fair and foul and one of those means was the cultivation of an impressive collection of snouts he was where he wanted to be in his life which was sitting in an impressive if somewhat chaotic office where he could wield absolute power but this did not prevent him from feeling grievances he hated arrogance he hated hypocrisy he hated stupidity but most of all he hated incompetence following a story was not rocket science neither was chivvying it along following merely required three things research shoe leather and doggedness chivvying required a willingness to see ones fellow humans squirm and if necessary be squashed if this latter requirement itself required a bit of slithering on the part of the reporter what of it the end product was the story and if the story was big enough with an appropriate amount of sensation attached to it big sales were the result big sales translated into increased advertising which translated into increased revenue which translated into orgasmic delight from the sources chairman the cadaverous peter ogilvie at all costs ogilvie needed to be kept well oiled with good news in the form of profits as to whose head or reputation rolled in pursuit of these it mattered not granted the story of nicholas faircloughs putative redemption from the clutches of drugs had been a snore of monumental proportions they could have used it in operating theatres in place of anaesthetic such a soporific had it been now however things were looking up now it seemed rodney might not have to defend the expenditure of zed benjamins initial trip to cumbria to develop the story no matter the incredible cost the reporter had incurred but that thought brought forward the whole issue of journalistic stupidity rodney could not see how idiot benjamin could have failed yet a second time to nose his way into a story when the damn smell of it was right in front of him another five days tramping round cumbria had resulted in nothing but an extension of the tedious panegyric hed already created about nicholas fairclough his dopedup past his reformed present and his doubtless sanctified future other than that there was nada to interest the typical source reader there was zero nought and double nought with nuts receiving the news from a headhanging benjamin that there was nothing more he could possibly add to what hed written rodney knew he should kick the bloke out on his ear he couldnt explain to himself why he hadnt done so and he thought at first he might be getting soft but then one of his snouts phoned in passed along a delectable tip and rodney reckoned he might not have to sack benjamin after all what the snout had to say constituted an instructive moment and since rodney aronson loved instructive moments nearly as much as he loved anything containing cacao he sent for the redhaired giant and enjoyed a kit kat that he washed down with an espresso from his personal machine this latter a gift from butterball betsy a wife who knew many ways to please that most of them were gustatory didnt bother him rodney had finished the kit kat and was making himself a second espresso when zed benjamin lumbered into the room damn if he still wasnt wearing the beanie rodney thought with a sigh he had little doubt that the dumbo had yarmulked his way round cumbria a second time successfully putting everyone off yet again rodney shook his head in resignation the folly he had to endure as editor of the source sometimes truly offset its delights he decided not to mention the headgear again hed done so once and if benjamin wouldnt take his advice there was nothing for it but to let him sink under the weight of his own nonsensical inclinations hed learn or he wouldnt and rodney knew which alternative was more likely end of story shut the door he said to the reporter take a seat give me a second here he admired the creamy nature of his concoction and turned off the machine he carried his drink to the desk and sat death is sex he said i reckoned youd work that out for yourself but it seems you cant got to tell you zedekiah this line of work might not be for you zed looked at him he looked at the wall he looked at the floor he finally said death is sex so slowly that rodney wondered if the mans brains had gone the way of his footwear because for some reason he was wearing not respectable shoes but instead very oddlooking sandals with tire treads for soles along with striped socks that appeared to be handmade from remnants of yarn i told you the story needed sex you went up there a second time and tried to find it that you failed to find it i can understand more or less but what i cant understand is how you failed to see the moment of potential rescue when it came you shouldve been in here like a flash yelling eureka or cowabunga or praise jesus im saved well probably not that last all things considered but the point is you got handed a way into the story and this would be a way to save it and to justify the expense the paper went to in sending you up there in the first place and you missed it completely the fact that i had to discover it myself concerns me zed it really does she still wouldnt talk to me rodney i mean she talked but she didnt talk she says shes not whats important shes his wife they met they fell in love they married they came back to england and theres an end to her part of the tale from what i can tell shes entirely devoted to him but everything hes done hes done himself she did tell me that it would benefit him encourage was the word she used if the story featured his recovery alone and not her part in it she said something like you need to understand how important it is for nicholas to be acknowledged as having achieved this on his own she meant his recovery i did get that the reason for her wanting the recognition to go to him has to do with his relationship with his dad and i shaded the story that way but there didnt seem to be anything more i know youre not completely stupid rodney cut in but im beginning to think youre deaf death is sex is what i said you did hear that didnt you well yeah i did and shes sexy the wife youd have to be blind not to forget the wife shes not dead is she dead well no i mean i reckoned you were using a metaphor rodney rodney gulped down the rest of his espresso this gave him time not to strangle the young man which was what he badly wanted to do he finally said believe me when i use a fucking metaphor youre going to know it are you aware remotely or otherwise that the cousin of your hero is dead recently dead as a matter of fact that he died in a boathouse where he fell into the water and drowned that the boathouse im speaking of is on the property of your heros father drowned while i was there no way zed declared you may think im blind rod youll get no argument from me but i would have hardly missed that fact when did he die and which cousin are we talking about is there more than one zed shifted in his chair well not that i know of ian cresswell drowned yes indeedy doodah rodney said murdered accident according to the inquest but thats hardly the point because the deaths nicely suspicious and suspicion is our bread and butter metaphor by the way in case youre thinking otherwise our purpose is to fan the fire another metaphor i think im on a roll here and see what comes crawling out of the woodwork mixed zed muttered what never mind is that what you want me to do then i take it im to suggest theres reason to believe foul play is involved with nicholas fairclough the player i can see how it fits the former drug addict falls off the wagon of recovery and does in his cousin for some obscure reason and as of this writing gentle readers he apparently has walked away scotfree zed slapped his hands against his thighs as if he was about to rise and do rodneys bidding directly but instead of getting up to leave he said they grew up as brothers rodney the original story does indicate that and they didnt hate each other but of course i could make it sound like cain going after abel if that suits you do not rodney said take that tone with me what tone you bloody well know what tone i should kick your arse from here to down under but im going to do you a favour instead im going to say three little words that i hope to god will make your pointed ears prick up are you listening zed i dont want you to miss them here they come now new scotland yard that rodney saw to his satisfaction appeared to stop zed benjamin in his selfrighteous tracks the reporter frowned he thought he finally said what about new scotland yard theyre in are you saying theyre investigating the drowning im saying something better than that theyre sending a bloke up there wearing brothelcreepers if you receive my meaning and hes not a bloke from the ipcc so its not an internal investigation what is it then a special assignment completely hushhush mums the word and on the big qt hes apparently been given the job of making a list and checking it twice and reporting back when hes finished why thats the story zed thats the sex behind the death rodney wanted to add that it was also what zed himself would have learned had he put in the effort that rodney himself would have put in had he been in the same position with his story shitcanned by his editor and potentially with his job on the line so im not to make something up to add sex to the story zed said as if he needed clarification what youre saying is that its already there at the source rodney intoned religiously we dont need to make things up we just need to find them in the first place and can i ask howd you know this about the met i mean howd you find out if its all hushhush it was one of those moments when paternal superiority was called for and rodney loved those kinds of moments he rose from behind his desk went round to the front of it and lifted a bulky thigh to rest it on the corner it wasnt the most comfortable position considering the chafing of his skin against his trousers but rodney liked to think it communicated a degree of journalistic savoir faire that would underscore the importance of what he had to say next zedekiah ive been in this business since i was a kid ive sat where youre sitting and this is what i learned were nothing without the snouts we cultivate and ive cultivated them from edinburgh to london and all points in between particularly in london my friend ive got snouts in places that other people dont even recognise as being places i scratch their backs with great regularity they scratch mine whenever they can benjamin looked suitably impressed indeed he looked humbled he was in the presence of his journalistic better and it seemed that he finally knew it rodney went on enjoying his moment nicholas faircloughs dad has a tie to the met hes the one asking for an investigation can i reckon you know what that means zed he thinks it wasnt an accident that ian cresswell drowned and if it wasnt an accident weve got a story fact is weve got a story either way because weve got the met up there nosing round and that suggests something might have gone on and all we ever need for a story is a suggestion amen to that rodney said get back to cumbria my good man on the double chalk farm london detective sergeant barbara havers arrived home in an uneasy mood that she didnt want to name having found a parking space not too far from eton villas she should have been grateful but she couldnt summon up the appropriate feeling of joy attendant on not having to hike to her front door as usual the mini coughed a few times after barbara cut the ignition but she barely took note through the windscreen a splattering of rain began to fall but she hardly clocked that either instead her thoughts remained where theyd been largely fixed save for one brief distraction during her long drive home from the met those thoughts battled in her head with a voice that judged them childish but that didnt matter and it certainly wasnt enough to quash them although she would at this point have been grateful had that only been the case no one had noticed barbara thought not a single sodding individual well all right detective superintendent ardery had noticed but she hardly counted as shed given the initial order although shed claimed it was only a suggestion and from barbaras nearly four months of experience with isabelle ardery she knew the superintendent noticed everything ardery seemed to make noticing a habit she seemed in fact to have raised it to a fine art so whenever she took note of something it mattered not unless her taking note was connected intimately to ones performance at work if it was connected to anything else one could say that isabelle ardery was merely engaging in her irritating habit of sitting in judgement upon the superficial with the number one superficial within the superintendents gaze being barbara haverss personal appearance as to the rest of the team when barbara had arrived back at the yard from her final appointment with the dentist theyd gone about their business without a word a raised eyebrow or anything else barbara had told herself she didnt care and there was truth in this since she really didnt care about the notice of most of her colleagues but the notice of one of them she cared about deeply and it was this caring that sat uneasily upon her asking to be acknowledged or at least dealt with by the downing of something of a pastry orientation french would be nice but it was too late in the day to score a chocolate croissant although not too late in the day to snag an entire torte which of course would have been austrian but at this hour who was quibbling about such minor details as country of origin yet barbara knew that that direction would lead her straight into the evils of an extended carb wallow from which she might not emerge for weeks so instead of pausing at a bakery en route to her home shed decided to engage in retail therapy in camden high street there shed made the purchase of a scarf and a blouse whereupon shed celebrated the fact that shed just behaved in a manner entirely different from her usual mode of reacting to disappointment stress frustration or anxiety but this celebration lasted only till she parked the mini at that point her final encounter with thomas lynley forced its way into her consciousness after their time at the old bailey that day theyd parted lynley heading back to the yard and barbara heading to the dentist theyd not seen each other again until the end of the day when they met in the ascending lift barbara was taking it from the underground car park and when it stopped at the lobby lynley got on she could see that he was preoccupied hed been preoccupied outside courtoom number one earlier in the day but shed reckoned that had to do with having to testify to his near encounter with the grim reaper in the back of a ford transit kitted out as a mobile murder scene some months earlier this preoccupation seemed different though and when he vanished into superintendent arderys office after the lift doors opened barbara reckoned she knew the reason why lynley thought she didnt know what was going on between ardery and him barbara could understand the reason for this conclusion no one else at the met had a clue that he and the superintendent were dancing inside each others knickers two or sometimes three nights a week but no one else at the met knew lynley as well as barbara did and while she couldnt imagine anyone actually wanting to shag the superintendent bloody hell it had to be like going to bed with a cobra shed spent the last three months of their affair telling herself that if nothing else lynley deserved it hed lost his wife to a street murder at the hands of a twelveyearold hed spent five months afterwards wandering the coast of cornwall in a sodding daze hed returned to london barely functioning if he wanted the questionable diversion of plugging isabelle arderys drainpipes for a time so be it they could both be in big trouble if anyone found out about it but no one was going to find out about it because they were discreet and barbara wasnt going to say a word besides lynley wasnt going to hook himself up permanently to someone like isabelle ardery the man had something like three hundred years of family history to contend with and if nothing else he knew his duty and it had very little to do with an interlude in which he bonked a woman on whom the title countess of asherton would hang like a hundredweight his type was meant to reproduce obligingly and send the family name hurtling into the future he knew this and hed act accordingly still it did not sit easily with barbara that lynley and the superintendent were lovers that relationship comprised the malodorous elephant present in every encounter barbara had with him she hated this not him not the affair itself but the fact that he wouldnt talk to her about it not that she expected him to not that she really wanted him to not that she would actually be able to think of something reasonable to say should he turn to her and make a comment alluding to it but they were partners she and lynley or at least they had been and partners were meant to what she asked herself but that was a question she preferred not to answer she shoved open her car door the rain wasnt bad enough to use a brollie so she pulled up her jackets collar grabbed the bag that held her new purchases and hurried towards home as was her habit she glanced at the basement flat of the edwardian house behind which her tiny bungalow sat the day was falling towards dusk and lights were on she saw her neighbour move past the french windows all right she thought she was ready to admit it the truth was she needed someone to notice shed endured hours in the dentists chair and her reward had been isabelle arderys nod and her words see to the hair next sergeant and that had been it so instead of heading down the side of the house to the back garden where her bungalow sat beneath a towering false acacia barbara headed over to the flagstones that marked the outside area of the basement flat and there she knocked on the door the notice of a nineyearold was better than nothing she decided hadiyyah answered although barbara heard the girls mother say darling i do wish you wouldnt do that it could be anyone just me barbara called out barbara barbara hadiyyah cried mummy its barbara shall we show her what weve done of course silly girl do ask her to come in barbara stepped inside to the scent of fresh paint and it took less than a moment to see what mother and daughter had accomplished the lounge of the flat had been repainted angelina upman was putting her mark upon it shed arranged decorative cushions on the sofa as well and there were fresh flowers in two different vases one low artistic arrangement on the coffee table another on the mantel above the electric fire isnt it lovely hadiyyah gazed up at her mother with such adoration that barbara felt her throat close mummy knows how to make things special and its simple really isnt it mummy angelina bent and kissed the top of her daughters head she lifted the little girls chin and said to her you my darling are my biggest admirer for which i thank you but a more disinterested eye is required she shot a smile at barbara what do you think barbara have hadiyyah and i made a success of our redecorating its meant to be a surprise hadiyyah added barbara think of it dad doesnt even know theyd chosen to cover the heretofore dingy cream walls with the pale green of early spring it was a colour well suited to angelina and she had to have known that sensible decision barbara thought against it she looked even more attractive than she already was light haired blue eyed delicate a sprite i like it she said to hadiyyah did you help pick out the colour well hadiyyah shifted on her feet she was standing next to her mother and she looked up at angelina and sucked a tiny part of her upper lip she did angelina lied blithely she had the final say her future in interior design is laid out in front of her i daresay although its not likely her father will agree itll be science for you hadiyyah pet pooh hadiyyah said i want to be with a glance at her mother a jazz dancer thats what this was news to barbara but not surprising shed learned that life as a professional dancer had been what angelina had ostensibly been attempting for the fourteen months during which shed disappeared from her daughters life that she hadnt disappeared alone was something hadiyyah had not been told angelina laughed a jazz dancer is it well keep that a secret you and i and to barbara will you have a cup of tea with us barbara hadiyyah put the kettle on we need to put our feet up after our days labours no no cant stay barbara said just stopped by to barbara realised that they hadnt noticed either hours upon hours in the blasted dental chair and no one and that meant she pulled herself together god what was wrong with her she wondered she remembered the bag in her hand the scarf and blouse within it bought something in the high street i reckoned hadiyyahs approval is all i need to wear it tomorrow yes yes hadiyyah cried lets see barbara mummy barbara has been making herself over shes been buying new clothes and everything she wanted to go to marks and spencer at first but i wouldnt let her well we bought a skirt there didnt we barbara but that was all because i told her only grannies ever go to marks and spencer not exactly true darling angelina said well you always said i say many silly things youre to take no notice of barbara show us put it on in fact oh yes will you put it on hadiyyah said you must put it on you cn use my room which is chaos unleashed angelina said use haris and mine barbara meanwhile well make the tea thus barbara found herself in the last place she actually would have chosen to be in the bedroom of angelina upman and hadiyyahs father taymullah azhar she closed the door behind her with a tiny expulsion of breath all right she told herself she could do this all she had to do was take the blouse from the bag unfold it whip off the pullover she had on she didnt have to look at anything but what was directly in front of her which naturally she found impossible to do and she didnt want to begin to think why what she saw was what she expected to see the signs of a man and woman who were partners to each other and specifically partners in the one way necessary to create a child not that they were attempting to create another since angelinas birth control pills were on the bedside table next to a clock radio but contained within the fact of them was also the fact of what they meant so bloody what barbara asked herself what the dickens had she expected and what business was it of hers anyway taymullah azhar and angelina upman were doing the deed better said they had resumed doing the deed at some point after angelinas sudden reappearance in azhars life the fact that shed left him for another man was now apparently forgiven and forgotten and there was an end to it everyone got to live happily whatever barbara told herself it behooved her to do likewise she buttoned the blouse and tried to smooth out its wrinkles she took out the scarf shed bought to go with it and she wound this inexpertly round her neck she moved to a mirror on the back of the door and gazed at herself she wanted to retch she should have gone for the torte she decided it would have cost less and been infinitely more satisfying are you changed barbara hadiyyah asked from behind the closed door mummy wants to know do you need any help no got it barbara called im coming out you ready have your sunglasses on be prepared to be dazzled silence greeted her then hadiyyah and her mother spoke at once a striking choice barbara came from angelina while oh no you forgot about the jawline and the neckline came from hadiyyah this latter in something of a wail to which she added theyre sposed to mirror each other barbara and you forgot another fashion disaster barbara thought there really was a reason shed spent the last fifteen years of her life wearing sloganfronted teeshirts and drawstring trousers angelina hastened to say hadiyyah thats not true but shes meant to choose rounded and shes chosen darling shes only failed to use the scarf as its meant to be used one can still create the effect by rounding the scarf one doesnt want to be limited by believing that only a single kind of neckline here barbara let me show you but mummy the colour is perfect and im pleased you see that angelina said firmly she removed the scarf from around barbaras neck and with a few deft and maddening moves she rearranged it this put her closer to barbara than shed been before and barbara caught the scent of her she was fragrant like a tropical flower she also had the most flawless skin barbara had ever seen there angelina said look in the mirror now barbara tell me what you think its very easy to do ill show you barbara went back into the bedroom within sight of those pills which this time she refused to look at she wanted to dislike angelina a woman whod left her daughter and her daughters father to have a lengthy fling for which shed actually been forgiven but she found that she couldnt this went some distance she supposed in explaining how and why azhar had apparently forgiven her she saw her reflection and she had to admit it the bloody woman knew how to tie a scarf and now it was tied properly barbara could see that it wasnt actually the appropriate concomitant garment to the blouse damn it all she thought when would she learn she was about to emerge and ask angelina if she and hadiyyah would accompany her on her next adventure in camden high street since she hadnt a great deal of money to waste on making the wrong sartorial decisions but she heard the flat door open and the sounds of taymullah azhar arriving home the last place she wanted to be found was in the bedroom he shared with the mother of his child so she hastily untied the scarf removed the blouse shoved them back into the bag and donned the pullover shed worn to work that day when she rejoined them azhar was admiring the new paint on the walls with hadiyyah clinging onto his hand and angelina linked to his arm he turned and his surprised face told barbara that neither hadiyyah nor her mother had mentioned her presence he said barbara hullo and what do you think of their handiwork im hiring them to do my digs next barbara said although im demanding purple and orange for my colours think thatll do me right hadiyyah no no no hadiyyah cried her parents laughed barbara smiled arent we all a happy family she thought time to exit stage right she said leave you to your dinner and to angelina specifically thanks for the help with the scarf i could see the difference if i can get you to dress me every morning ill be set for life anytime angelina said truly and the damn thing was she meant it barbara thought maddening woman if shed merely cooperate and be a sodding cow things would be so much easier she nodded a good night to them all and let herself out she was surprised when azhar followed her but she understood when he lit a cigarette something he would not do indoors now that nonsmoking angelina had returned he said congratulations barbara she stopped turned and said for what your teeth i see theyve been repaired and they look very good i expect people have been telling you that all day so let me count myself among them oh right ta the guv shes ordered the entire thing well not ordered exactly cause she cant do that in a personal matter like appearance so lets say she suggested it strenuously she wants the hair fixed next i dont know where we go from there but ive a feeling itll involve liposuction and serious cosmetic surgery when shes finished with me i expect ill be beating men off with a broom youre making light of it and you shouldnt azhar told her no doubt angelina and hadiyyah have already told you they havent actually barbara cut in but thank you for the compliment azhar so there was irony in a soap dish she thought a compliment from the very last man on earth who should have noticed her teeth and the very last man from whom she should have wanted notice in the first place well it didnt mean anything either way she told herself on that set of lies she walked on to her bungalow bidding taymullah azhar good night october belgravia london forewarned being forearmed lynley had spent the next two days following his meeting with hillier and bernard fairclough doing what research he was able to do on the man his family and his situation he didnt wish to walk into this covert investigation blind and as things turned out there was a fair amount of information available on fairclough who had not been born bernard fairclough at all but rather bernie dexter of barrowinfurness his initial appearance on earth took place at home in a twoup and twodown terrace house in blake street this turned out to be a short distance from the railway tracks upon the figurative wrong side of which the dexter domicile lay how hed morphed from bernie dexter into bernard fairclough first baron of ireleth was the kind of tale with by which sunday newspaper magazines justify their existences as bernie dexter at fifteen years of age hed finished with what schooling he was ever to have and had gone to work for fairclough industries in a lowly position defined by the mindless job of packing chrome bathroom fixtures into shipping containers for eight hours each day although it was a job guaranteed to bleed soul hope and ambition from an ordinary worker bernie dexter of blake street had been no ordinary worker cheeky from the first was how his wife described him in a postknighthood interview and she ought to have known for she had been born valerie fairclough the greatgranddaughter of the firms founder shed met the fifteenyearold when she herself was eighteen and he was performing in the companys christmas panto she was there for dutys sake he was there for funs sake they encountered each other in a receiving line the fairclough owners doing a yearly bit of noblesse oblige and their employees among whom was bernie moving along the line with an appropriate amount of forelock tugging downcast eyes and aye sir thank you sir in best dickensian manner as christmas bonuses were handed out this applied to all except bernie dexter who told valerie fairclough straightaway and with a wink that he intended to marry her a real beauty you are he said so i reckon ill set you up for life he declared this last with utter confidence as if valerie fairclough were somehow not set up for life already hed gone on to keep his word however for he had no qualms at all about approaching valeries father telling him i could make this firm into something better you know you give me half a chance and so he had done not all at once of course but over time and during that time he also managed to impress valerie with the persistence of his devotion to her he also managed to impregnate the young woman when she was twentyfive which resulted in an elopement in short order then he took her family name as his own improved the efficiency of fairclough industries modernised its products one of which was of all things an entire line of stateoftheart lavatories from which he amassed an impressive fortune his son nicholas had always been the fly in the ointment of bernies otherwise ideal life lynley found volumes of information on the bloke for when nicholas fairclough went periodically bad he did it in a very public manner public drunkenness brawls breakins football hooliganism drunk driving car theft arson indecent exposure while under the influence the man had a past that read like that of the prodigal son on steroids hed played out his dissolution before god and everyone and in particular before the eyes of the local press in cumbria and the stories generated from his behaviour caught the eyes of the national tabloids always on the prowl for sensation to feature on their cover pages especially when the sensation is generated by the scion of someone notable early death was the usual outcome of a life led in the manner nicholas fairclough had led his but in his case love supervened in the person of a young argentine woman with the impressive name of alatea vasquez y del torres fresh out of yet another rehab programme this one in america in the state of utah nicholas had taken himself to a former mining town called park city for what he apparently believed was a welldeserved spate of r amp r financed as usual by his desperate father the old mining town served this purpose well for it was nestled in the wasatch mountains and into its embrace every year from late november till april came avid skiers from round the world along with scores of young men and women hired to service their needs alatea vasquez y del torres had been among this latter group and she and nicholas fairclough according to the more breathless reports lynley was able to scavenge locked eyes over the till in one of the ski resorts many eateries the rest as is generally said was history what ensued was a whirlwind courtship a courthouse marriage effected in salt lake city a final descent into a drugfuelled pyre of dissolution on nicholass part odd way to celebrate matrimony but there you have it lynley thought from which the phoenix that was apparently the mans amazing physical constitution arose the arising of this phoenix however had little to do with faircloughs determination to get the better of the beast on his back and everything to do with alatea vasquez y del torress decision to walk out on him barely two months into their marriage id do anything for her fairclough had later declared id die for her to take the cure for her was childs play shed returned to him hed stuck with sobriety and everyone was happy so it seemed from all the accounts that lynley was able to glean in his twentyfour hours of research into the family thus if nicholas fairclough had been involved some way in his cousins death at this point in his life it seemed wildly out of character for it was hardly reasonable to assume that his wife would remain loyally at the side of a murderer lynley went on to read about the rest of the family from whatever sources he could find but information on them was vague considering how dull they were in comparison to the son of lord fairclough one sister divorced one sister a spinster one cousin this would be the dead man the master of the fairclough money that cousins wife a homemaker and their two children respectable the fairclough family were a disparate group but on the surface they all seemed clean at the end of his second day of exploration lynley stood at the window of his library in eaton terrace and looked out at the street the gas fire burning brightly behind him in the late afternoon he didnt much like the situation he was in but he wasnt sure what he could do about it in his line of work the objective was to gather evidence in proof of someones guilt not to gather evidence in proof of their innocence if the coroner had declared the death accidental there seemed little point delving further into the matter for coroners knew what they were about and they had evidence and testimony to bolster their findings that the coroner had deemed the death of ian cresswell an accident unfortunate and untimely as all accidents were but still an accident seemed a conclusion that ought to have satisfied everyone no matter the grief attendant on the sudden loss of a man from the bosom of his family it was interesting though that bernard fairclough wasnt satisfied lynley thought despite the inquest and its results faircloughs doubts in the matter suggested that he might well know more than hed mentioned at their meeting at twins and this suggested there was more to the death of ian cresswell than met the superficial eye lynley wondered if someone had dropped a word to fairclough about the local investigation into the drowning he also wondered if fairclough had himself had a word with someone inside of it lynley turned from the window and gazed at his desk spread out on it were notes printouts from his computer the laptop itself there was he reckoned more than one avenue to unearth additional information regarding ian cresswells death if indeed there was additional information and he was on his way to the phone to make a call in the service of gathering more details when it rang he thought about allowing the answer machine to take it that reaction to the phone had become habitual over recent months but he decided to pick up and when he did it was to hear isabelle say what on earth are you doing tommy why havent you been at work hed thought hillier would handle this detail obviously hed been wrong he said its a small matter hillier asked me to deal with i thought hed tell you hillier what sort of matter isabelle sounded surprised as well she might he and hillier didnt rub congenial elbows very often and if push came to shove lynley was surely the last person at the met to whom hillier would turn its confidential he told her im not at liberty whats going on he didnt reply at once he was trying to think of a way to tell her what he was doing without actually telling her what he was doing but she apparently took his silence for avoidance because she said tartly ah i see is this to do with what happened with what what happened please dont you know what im saying with bob that night the fact that weve not been together since lord no its nothing to do with that he cut in although the truth of the matter if he had to admit it was that he wasnt exactly sure then whyve you been avoiding me im not aware that i have been avoiding you there was a silence that greeted this he found himself wondering where she was the time of day suggested she might still be at the yard perhaps in her office and he could see her there at her desk with her head lowered to speak into the phone and her smooth hair rather the colour of amber tucked behind one ear to show a conservative but fashionable earring one shoe off perhaps and there she was leaning down to rub her calf as she thought what she would say to him next what she said surprised him tommy i told bob yesterday not who exactly because as i explained i do know very well hed use it against me at some time when he believes im out of order but that i told him that that what that im involved with someone that youd come to the door when he and sandra were there that id sent you off because i thought the boys werent ready to meet after all theyd come into london for the first time to see me and they needed to adjust to my being in london and to the flat itself and everything that goes along with it to have a man there as well i told him i felt it was too soon and id asked you to leave but i wanted him to know that you do exist ah isabelle lynley knew what it had cost her telling her former husband about him when the man held such power over her life and now telling him that shed done so when she was a proud woman and god how he knew that about her im missing you tommy i dont want us to be at odds were not at odds are we not we are not another pause perhaps she was at home after all he thought sitting on the edge of the bed in that claustrophobic bedroom of hers with its single window virtually sealed against anyones attempt to open it fully and its bed too small to accommodate both of them comfortably for an entire night which could or could not have been the point of it he realised and what would that mean to him if she admitted to that things are complicated he said they always are arent they after a certain age yes theres so much bloody baggage and then after an indrawn breath i want you tonight tommy will you come to me and most remarkably have you the time he wanted to say that it wasnt at all a matter of time it was a matter of how he felt and who he wanted to be but this too was complicated so he said i cant say exactly because of the hillier thing i was hoping youd notice i hadnt insisted on knowing whats going on and i wont youve my promise on it even afterwards i wont and you know what that means because i do know how you are afterwards sometimes i think i could get anything out of you afterwards you know and why dont you well it doesnt seem quite fair does it besides i like to think im not that sort of woman i dont scheme well not much at least are you scheming now only to have you and it cant be a scheme if im admitting to it can it he smiled at that he felt a softening towards her and he recognised this as the desire he continued to feel for her despite the fact that the timing of their relationship was wretched and they were ill matched anyway and always would be he wanted her still it might be late when i arrive he said that hardly matters will you come to me tommy i will he told her chelsea london he had arrangements to make first however while he could have made them over the phone he decided that making them in person would allow him to gauge whether what he was asking was an inconvenience to the people he needed for they would never tell him so the fact that this was not to be a formal police investigation hobbled him considerably it also called for a creative approach to appease the demands for secrecy he could have insisted that hillier allow him the services of another officer but the only officers he cared to work with were unlikely candidates for a surreptitious crawl round cumbria at six feet four inches tall and with skin the colour of very strong tea ds winston nkata would hardly fade into the autumn scenery of the lake district and as for ds barbara havers who under other circumstances would have been lynleys first choice despite her score of maddening personal habits the idea of barbara chainsmoking her belligerent way round cumbria under the pretext that she was perhaps a walker out for a bracing week on the fells it was too ludicrous to contemplate she was a brilliant cop but discretion was not her strong suit had helen been alive she would have been perfect for the job she would have loved it as well tommy darling well be incognito lord how delicious ive spent my life absolutely longing to do a tuppence but helen was not alive was not alive the very thought of her sent him on his way as rapidly as he could manage he drove to chelsea choosing the route that took him down the kings road it was the most direct way to get to cheyne row but not the quickest as the narrow road led him through the areas trendy shopping district with its fashion boutiques shoe shops antiques markets pubs and restaurants there were crowds on the pavements as always and seeing them especially seeing their youth made him melancholy and filled him with what felt like regret he couldnt have said what he regretted though he didnt much want to try to find out he parked in lawrence street near lordship place he walked back the way hed come but rather than going on to cheyne row he went in through the garden gate of the tall brick house that stood on the corner the garden was showing its autumn colours and readying itself for the winter the lawn was strewn with leaves needing gathering while the herbaceous borders offered plants whose flowers were long gone now and whose stalks leaned perilously as if weighted towards the ground by an unseen hand the wicker furniture wore canvas shrouds moss grew between the bricks lynley followed a path of these which led to the house there steps descended to the basement kitchen a light was on there against the coming evening he could see a shape moving behind the window itself steamed from the heat inside he knocked sharply twice and when the usual barking of the dog commenced he opened the door and said its me joseph ive come in the back way tommy it was a womans voice however not the voice lynley had been expecting but rather the mans daughter are you playing at victorian tradesman she came round the corner from the kitchen in the wake of the dog a longhaired dachshund with the unlikely name of peach peach barked jumped and did her usual by way of greeting him she was as undisciplined as always living proof of what deborah st james often declared that she required a dog she could pick up as she was utterly hopeless at training anything hullo you deborah said to lynley what a very nice surprise she scooted the dog to one side and hugged him she brushed a kiss against his cheek youre staying for dinner she announced for many reasons but most of all because im cooking it good lord wheres your father southampton anniversary he didnt want me to go this year i expect its because its the twentieth ah he knew deborah wouldnt say more not because it pained her to speak of her mothers death which after all had occurred when deborah was seven years old but because of him and the fact of what death might remind him of anyway she said hell be back tomorrow but meanwhile that leaves poor simon in my culinary clutches are you wanting him by the way hes only upstairs im wanting you both whatre you cooking then shepherds pie the mash is instant more than that i wasnt willing to attempt and besides potatoes are potatoes arent they im doing broccoli for the veg mediterranean style swimming in olive oil and garlic and a side salad as well also swimming in olive oil and garlic youll stay you must if its terrible you can lie and tell me everything tastes like ambrosia ill know youre lying of course i always know when you lie by the way but it wont matter because if you say everythings wonderful simonll be forced to do likewise oh yes and theres pudding as well thatll be the deciding factor ah you see i know youre lying but ill play along its actually a french tart leaping out of a cake or something she laughed very amusing lord asherton are you staying or not its apple and pear by the way how can i refuse lynley glanced towards the stairs that led up to the rest of the house is he in the study go up ill join you once i check to see how things look in the oven he left her upstairs he walked down the corridor he heard the sound of simon st jamess voice coming from his study at the front of the house this took the place of a normal sitting room and it was crammed floor to ceiling with books on three walls with a fourth dedicated to deborahs photographs when lynley entered the room his friend was seated at his desk and the fact that he was driving his hand into his hair with his head bent to the task as he spoke on the phone told lynley that difficulty was afoot in the other mans life st james was saying i thought so as well david i still think so as far as im concerned its the answer were looking for yes yes i completely understand ill speak to her again how much time exactly when would she want to see us yes i see he glanced up then saw lynley and nodded a hello he said all right then best to mother and your family before ringing off his final remark told lynley that hed been speaking to his eldest brother david st james rose awkwardly shoving away from his desk to get purchase on its edge so that he could rise more easily despite the disability of a leg that hadnt functioned without a brace for years he greeted lynley and moved to the drinks trolley beneath the window whiskys the answer he said to lynley taller than usual and straight what about you pour away lynley said to him trouble my brother davids come across a girl in southampton who wants to put up her baby for adoption a private arrangement made through a solicitor thats excellent news simon lynley said you must be delighted after all this time under normal circumstances its like a gift we werent expecting he uncapped a bottle of lagavulin and poured a good three fingers for each of them lynley raised an eyebrow as st james handed one over to him we deserve it st james said at least i do and i expect you do as well he gestured towards the leather armchairs in front of the fireplace they were worn and cracked suitable for sinking into and getting properly sloshed what are the circumstances then lynley asked st james glanced at the doorway suggesting the conversation was meant to take place without deborahs knowledge the mother wants an open adoption not only herself involved in the babys life but the father as well shes sixteen hes fifteen ah i see deborahs reaction was that she doesnt want to share her child not entirely unreasonable is it st james continued and decidedly she doesnt want to share her child with two teenagers she says it would be like adopting three children instead of one and besides that there are both extended families to consider and how theyd fit in as well he took a gulp of the whiskey actually lynley said i rather see her point as do i the situations far from ideal on the other hand it seems well shes had the rest of the tests tommy its definite its highly unlikely shed ever be able to carry a child to term lynley knew this hed known for over a year and it seemed that deborah had finally told her husband the truth shed carried alone aside from his own knowledge of it for the past twelve months lynley said nothing both of them meditated on their glasses of lagavulin from the corridor the clicking of dog nails against wood indicated that peach was coming to them and if peach was coming she was no doubt accompanied by her mistress lynley said quietly deborahs asked me to stay to dinner but i can make an excuse if its awkward for you tonight st james replied with god no id prefer it you know me anything to avoid a difficult conversation with the woman i love ive brought us some predinner goodies deborah said as she entered the room cheese straws peach has already had one so i can tell you theyre delicious at least to a dog dont get up simon ill fetch my own sherry she put a plate of the cheese straws on an ottoman between the two chairs shooed the dachshund away from them and went to the drinks trolley she said to her husband tommys told me he wants to see both of us i reckon its either business or an announcement or both and if it has to do with the healey elliott i vote that we buy it off him straightaway simon clear your mind of that proposition lynley said ill be buried in that car damn st james smiled i did try his wife told him she came to perch on the arm of his chair and said to lynley what then tommy he thought about how to approach the matter he settled on saying im wondering how you two might feel about an autumns jaunt up to the lakes chelsea london she always brushed the days tangles out of her hair before she came to bed sometimes he did it for her and sometimes he watched her hair was long and thick and curly and red ungovernable at most times which was why he loved it tonight he watched from the bed where he rested against the pillows she stood across from him at the chest of drawers there was a mirror above this and she could see him watching her in its reflection are you sure you can take the time away from work simon its only a few days question is can you and how do you feel about doing it dissembling not being my stock in trade you mean she put down her brush and crossed to the bed she wore a thin cotton nightgown but she shed this as usual before joining him he liked that she preferred to sleep naked he liked turning to find her warm and soft while he was dreaming its the sort of thing helen would have loved she noted i wonder tommys not thought of that perhaps he has hmm yes well im ready to help him for whatever good i can do ill want to track down that sidebar about nicholas fairclough that tommy mentioned i cn use that as my jumpingoff point i daresay having read about you and your project in that magazine article on your parents topiary garden et cetera et cetera and at least theres a reason that already exists for someone to want a documentary film made if there werent id be completely out of my depth what about you the inquest material wont present a problem nor will the forensic data as to the rest im not sure its an odd situation any way you look at it and speaking of odd situations he thought there was another that remained to be dealt with he said david phoned i was talking to him when tommy arrived he could actually feel the change in her her breathing altered one slow intake followed by one very long pause he said the girl would like to meet us deborah her parents and the boy would be there as well she prefers it that way and the solicitor indicated i cant deborah said ive thought about it simon ive looked at it every possible way truly i have you must believe me but no matter how i try to twist it i do think that the bad outweighs the good its irregular but other people manage it they may do but im not other people wed be asked to share a baby with its birth mother its birth father its natural grandparents and god knows who else and i know this is trendy and modern but i dont want it i cant make myself want it they might well lose interest in the child st james pointed out theyre very young deborah looked at him shed been sitting up in bed not at rest against the pillow and she swung round and said incredulously lose interest this is a child not a puppy theyre not going to lose interest would you no but im not a fifteenyearold boy and anyway there would be arrangements theyd be drawn up by the solicitor no she said please dont ask me again i just cant he let a moment pass shed turned away her hair tumbled down her back nearly to her waist and he touched a lock of it saw how it curled naturally round his fingers he said will you just think about it a bit longer before you decide as i said shed like to meet us we could do that much if nothing else you might well like her her family the boy you know the fact that she wants to keep contact with the child thats not a bad thing deborah how is it good she asked still turned from him it indicates a sense of responsibility she doesnt just want to walk away and get on with her life as if nothing ever happened to change it in a way she wants to provide for the child be there to answer questions should questions come up we could answer questions you know that very well and why on earth if she wants to be involved in the childs life would she choose a couple from london to be the parents anyway instead of a couple from southampton that doesnt make sense shes from southampton isnt she she is so you see he reckoned she couldnt bear another disappointment and he didnt blame her but if they didnt continue to push forward if they didnt follow whatever avenue opened up before them an opportunity could easily be missed and if they wanted a child if they truly wanted a child that was of course the real question asking it however constituted a mine field and hed been married to deborah long enough to know that some fields were too dangerous to venture into still he said have you another solution then another possibility she didnt reply at once he had the sense though that she did have something else in mind something she was reluctant to mention he repeated the question she quickly responded with surrogacy he said good god deborah that routes fraught with not a donor mother simon but a host mother our embryo our baby and someone willing to carry it it wouldnt be hers shed have no attachment or at least shed have no right to an attachment his spirits plummeted he wondered how something that for other people was so damnably natural could have for them turned into such a mire of appointments doctors specialists procedures solicitors questions answers and more questions and this now months and months would pass while a surrogate was sought and interviewed and checked out in every possible way while deborah took drugs that would do god only knew what to her system in order to harvest god what a word eggs while he disappeared into a lavatory stall with container in hand to make the required passionless and loveless deposit and all of this to result perhaps if they were lucky if nothing went wrong in a child that was biologically their own it seemed wildly complicated inhumanly mechanised and only partially guaranteed of success he blew out a breath he said deborah and he knew that she recognised in his tone a form of hesitation that she would not want to hear that it had to do with his desire to protect her would not occur to deborah and that was just as well he thought for she hated him to protect her from life even as she felt lifes blows more than he thought either necessary or good she said in a low voice i know what youre thinking and this puts us at an impasse doesnt it we just see things differently were coming at it from different directions one of us sees an opportunity where the other sees an insurmountable difficulty she thought about this she said slowly how odd it seems theres nothing to be done then she lay next to him then but her back was to him he switched out the light and put his hand on her hip she didnt respond wandsworth london it was nearly midnight when lynley arrived regardless of his promise to her he knew he should have gone home instead and slept however he was meant to sleep on this particular night which would be fitfully no doubt but instead he made his way to isabelles and he let himself in with his key she met him at the door hed expected she would have long gone to bed and it did seem shed been there at first but a light was on next to the sofa in the sitting area of her flat and he saw a magazine spread out there evidently discarded when shed heard his key in the lock shed left her dressing gown on the sofa as well and as she wore nothing beneath she came to him nude and when he closed the door behind him she stepped into his arms and lifted her mouth to his she tasted of lemons for a moment he allowed himself to wonder if the taste of her indicated that she was trying to hide the fact that shed been drinking again but then he didnt care as his hands travelled the distance from her hips to her waist to her breasts she began to undress him she murmured this is very bad you know he whispered what is that ive thought of little else all day his jacket fell to the floor and she worked the buttons of his shirt he bent to her neck her breasts that he said is very bad in your line of work in yours as well ah but ive more discipline have you indeed i have and if i touch you here like this she did so he smiled what happens to your discipline then the same thing i daresay that happens to yours if i kiss you here if i decide on more if i use my tongue rather like this she drew in a sharp breath she chuckled youre an evil man inspector but im fully able to match evil for evil rather as you say like this she lowered his trousers she made him as naked as she was herself she used her nakedness to force action from him she was he found as slick and as ready as he was he said the bedroom she said not tonight tommy here then oh yes right here november bryanbarrow cumbria because of the hour of the day zed benjamin had been able to score a good table at the willow and well and hed been sitting there for fifty minutes waiting for something to happen on the other side of a window whose lead mullions were in need of replacement the cold seeped past them like a visitation of the angel of death but the benefit of this discomfort was the fact that no one would question the knitted ski cap that zed was thus able to keep planted on his head the cap was his bow to making himself less memorable since it fully covered his flamecoloured hair there was nothing he could do about his extreme height save slouching whenever he remembered to do so he was managing just that at his table in the pub hed been going from hunching over his pint of lager to slumping in his chair with his legs stretched out till his arse was as numb as the heart of a pimp but in all the time hed maintained one posture or another nothing suggesting that illumination was in the offing had occurred in what he could see of the village of bryanbarrow just outside of the window this was his third day in cumbria his third day of searching for the sex that would keep his story on nicholas fairclough from being binned by rodney aronson but so far hed come up with nothing except fifteen lines of a new poem which god knew he wasnt about to mention to aronson when the odious editor of the source made his daily phone call to ask meaningfully how things were going and to remind zed that whatever costs he was incurring would be his own as if he didnt know that already zed thought as if he were not staying in the most modest room in the most modest bedandbreakfast he could find in the entire region an attic bedroom in one of the multitudinous victorian terraces that lined virtually every street in windermere this one on broad street within walking distance of the public library he had to duck to get through the door of the room and practically do the limbo if he wanted to walk to the single window the loo was on the floor below and the heat was by means of whatever came up from the rest of the house but all of this made the price extremely right so hed snapped it up upon a single glance once he learned how little it was going to cost him in recompense it seemed for the myriad inconveniences of the room the landlady provided sumptuous breakfasts involving everything from porridge to prunes so zed hadnt had to eat lunch since hed arrived which was just as well since he used the time he would have otherwise spent in a cafe trying to suss out who besides himself was prowling round the death of ian cresswell but if scotland yard was indeed here in cumbria in the person of a detective on the scent of the unfortunate drowning of nicholas faircloughs cousin zed had not been able to locate that person and until he saw him he wasnt going to be able to mould the ninth life into the nine lives and a death that rodney aronson apparently wanted naturally aronson knew who the scotland yard detective was zed would have put a weeks meagre wages on that he would have put a further weeks wages on aronsons having a master plan to give zed the sack upon his failure to unearth said detective which would equate to his failure to sex up his story that was what this was all about because rodney couldnt cope with the combination of zeds education and his aspirations not that he was getting far with his aspirations and not that he would get far with them oh one might survive artistically in this day and age by producing poetry but poetry did not put a roof over ones head that thought a roof over his head put zed in mind of the roof in london under which he lived it put him further in mind of the people beneath that roof lodged among those people were those peoples intentions his mothers foremost among them at least he didnt have to worry about those intentions just now zed thought for one morning soon after the first night of yaffa shaws presence in the family flat which had been effected with a rapidity astounding even for his mother the young woman waylaid zed outside of the bathroom they were going to be forced to share and sponge bag in hand shed murmured no worries zed all right his mind on his job he thought at first she was speaking of what lay in front of him yet another trip to cumbria but it came to him that yaffa was actually talking about her presence in the family flat and about his mothers determination to throw them together as much as she could until she wore down their resistance and they succumbed to an engagement marriage and babies zed said eh and fiddled with the belt of his dressing gown it was too short for him as were the trousers of his pyjamas and he never could find slippers to fit so he was wearing what he usually wore on his feet in the morning which was a pair of mismatched socks he felt all at once like what jack found at the top of the beanstalk especially in comparison to yaffa who was neat and trim and all of a piece with everything on her a coordinated affair in an appealing colour that seemed to enhance both her skin and her eyes yaffa looked over her shoulder in the general direction of the kitchen from where breakfast sounds were emanating she said quietly listen zed i have a boyfriend in tel aviv in medical school so youre not to worry shed pushed back a bit of her hair dark curly and hanging down below her shoulders quite prettily whereas earlier shed worn it pulled back from her face and she gave him a look that hed had to call impish she said i didnt tell her that you see this with an inclination of her head towards the door of the bedroom shed been given saves me heaps of money i can cut back my hours at work and take another course and if i can do that each term i can finish uni earlier and if i can do that im one step closer to getting back home to micah ah he said when she introduced us you and me i could see what your mum had in mind so i didnt say anything about him i needed the room i need the room and im willing to play along if you are how he realised he seemed only capable of oneword responses to this young woman and he wasnt at all sure what this meant she said we develop a pretence pretence were attracted you and i we play the role we fall in love she sketched inverted commas in the air and then conveniently i break your heart or you break mine it doesnt matter except considering your mum id better break yours wed probably have to go on one or two dates and maintain some kind of enraptured contact on our mobiles while youre gone you could make kissing noises occasionally and look soulfully at me over the breakfast table it would buy me time to save the money i need to take the extra course each term and it would buy you time to get your mother off your back for a bit about getting married wed have to play at a little affection now and then but youre off the hook having to sleep with me as we wouldnt want to show such disrespect to your mum i think it would work what about you he nodded i see he was pleased hed advanced to two words instead of one so she said are you willing yes and then in a graduation to four words when do we start at breakfast so when yaffa asked him over the breakfast table to tell her about the story he was working on in cumbria he played along to his surprise he found that she asked very good questions and her pretence of interest in his affairs caused his mother to beam at him meaningfully hed left london with his mothers ecstatic hug and her you see you see my boy burning in his brain along with a note from yaffa in his pocket wait thirtysix hours phone the flat ask your mum if you can speak to me ill give you my mobile number while shes listening good hunting in cumbria my friend hed phoned at the thirtysixhour mark exactly and hed ended up again surprised to find that he actually enjoyed the brief conversation he had with yaffa shaw this was due he reckoned to the fact that everything was out in the open between them no pressure he thought and he always operated best when there was minimal pressure he only wished that were the case with regard to this damn story he couldnt think of what to do to unearth the scotland yard detective aside from planting himself in bryanbarrow and waiting to see who turned up at ian cresswells farm on the scent of the mans untimely death the willow and well afforded him an unobstructed view of this place for bryan beck farm sat across the small triangular green that served as the centre of the village its ancient manor house visible behind a low stone wall and a tenant cottage making a crumbling statement at right angles to it as he watched into the second hour of nursing his pint and maintaining his vigil there was finally a sign of life at the farm it didnt emanate from the manor house though but rather from the tenant cottage from this emerged a man and a teenage boy they left the property side by side and walked onto the green where the man placed a step stool that he positioned in the centre of the lawn among the fallen leaves blown from the oak trees that bordered it he plopped himself on this stool and gestured to the boy who was carrying what looked like an old bedsheet along with a shoe box tucked under his arm the bedsheet he draped round the older mans shoulders and from the box he took scissors a comb and a hand mirror the older man removed the tweed cap he wore and jerked his head at the boy the sign to begin the boy set about cutting his hair this zed knew had to be george cowley and his teenage son daniel they could be no one else he knew that the dead man ian cresswell had a son but as cresswell was dead he didnt reckon the son was hanging about the farm and he reckoned even less that that son would be cutting the hair of the tenant farmer why they were doing this in the middle of the village green was an interesting question but cutting it there made cleaningup simple zed supposed although it wasnt likely to endear george cowley to the other residents of bryanbarrow some of whom lived in the terrace of cottages that comprised one side of the green zed downed the rest of his pint which at this point had long gone both warm and flat he lumbered out of the pub and he approached the haircutting on the green it was chilly outside with a breeze and the combined scent of wood smoke and cow dung hung on the air sheep were sounding off from beyond bryan beck farm and as if in response ducks were quacking with undue volume from bryan beck itself which gushed along the west side of the village out of zeds view afternoon zed nodded at the man and the boy youre mr cowley i understand he understood because hed spoken to the publican at some length during his first hours deployment within the willow and well as far as the publican knew zed was one of the myriad walkers who came to the lakes either to discover what wordsworth had spent his creative energies extolling or to see what the profits from peter rabbit had managed to save from mankinds tendency to build hideous structures upon it hed been more than willing to increase zeds knowledge of the real lakes with a good period of gossip about its denizens many of whom were genuine cumbrian characters one of whom was ultimately and conveniently george cowley a real piece o work is george the publican had said one of those blokes never lets go of a grievance love to feud they do that sort of bloke i feel dead sorry for that boy of his cause the only thing george has any fondness for is feuding and his bloody dog his bloody dog was a border collie whod come as far as the hedge when george cowley and his son crossed over to the green a word from george and the dog had dropped to its belly obediently there it remained a watchful eye on the proceedings throughout zeds conversation with its master cowley eyed zed with no small degree of suspicion his son held his scissors poised but hed stopped cutting his fathers hair george said over his shoulder to him get on with it dan and looked away from zed so much for friendly conversation zed thought lovely farm youve got zed said unusual to have it actually part of the village not mine george remarked sourly you run it though dont you doesnt that make it as good as yours george cast him a look indicative of scorn not hardly and whats it to you anyway zed glanced at the mans son daniels face flushed zed said nothing actually it merely looks an interesting place the big house and all that ive a curiosity about old buildings its an old manor house isnt it the bigger building cowley scowled could be dan are you cutting or not im not bout to sit here all day in the cold weve things to see to daniel said quietly to zed elizabethan it is we used to live there dan sorry he resumed his cutting it looked like something hed been doing for years as he used both the comb and the scissors efficiently cowley said to zed so who bloody wants to know and why eh the house the farm whyre you asking about em whats your interest youve some sort o business in the village oh zed thought of the approach that would glean him the most information with the least revelation on his part just interested in the history of the places i visit in the willow and well the barman was saying thats the oldest building in the village that manor house wrong he is cottages older by a hundert years is it really i expect a place like that could be haunted or something that why youre here you looking for ghosts or sharply for something else god the man was suspicious zed thought he wondered idly if the bloke had pieces of silver shoved up the chimney or something very like with zed there to case the joint as the saying went he said affably to cowley sorry no im only here visiting i dont mean to unnerve you not unnerved i cn take care of mself and dan i can right of course i expect you can zed went for a jolly tone i dont expect you get many people asking questions about the farm eh or actually many people here at all especially this time of year asking questions or doing anything else he winced inwardly he was going to have to do something about developing a subtlety of approach cowley said f you like history i cn give you history but he crossed his arms beneath the sheet that was keeping the hair from his clothing and his posture suggested nothing was forthcoming in spite of his words daniel said dad in a tone that took a position between advising and warning didnt say nothing did i cowley said its only that just cut the bloody hair and have done cowley looked away this time to the manor house behind the wall it was all of stone neatly whitewashed right to the top of its chimneys and its roof looked as if it had been recently replaced that he said was meant to be mine got bought out from under my nose it did with no one the wiser till the job was done and look what happened what needed to happen thats how it is n am i surprised not bloody likely you pay the wages in the end you do zed looked at the man in utter confusion he reckoned what happened was the death of ian cresswell who he knew had lived in the manor house but wages he asked while what he was thinking was what the hell is the man going on about of sin daniel said in a low voice the wages of sin thats right that is george cowley said he paid the wages of sin right and proper well there he is and here we are and when affairs get settled and the farm goes up for sale again well be there this time and make no mistake bryan beck farm is meant to be ours n weve not been scrimping from day one in our lives to have it go to someone else a second time from this it seemed to zed that ian cresswells sin had been purchasing bryan beck farm before george cowley had been able to do so which meant and this was useful wasnt it that cowley had a motive to murder cresswell and that meant it was only a matter of time before new scotland yard came calling which also meant that all he himself had to do was wait for their arrival confirm theyre here use their presence to sex up his story and get the hell back to london where he could resume his life yes things were looking up he said youre talking about mr cresswells purchase of the farm i take it cowley looked at him as if he were mad purchase of the farm you said the wages of sin i reckoned purchasing the farm was his sin bah that was bloody wrong that was that put us where it did me and dan but no one pays wages cause of property he loaded the final two words with derision and he seemed to feel zed was dim enough to require further elucidation indecent it was him and that arab lodger of his and whatre those kids of his still doing there thats the question i ask but no ones answering are they well thats indecent on top of indecent and i tell you this more wages are coming an theyre bound to be big you can count on that swarthmoor cumbria tim cresswell hated margaret fox school but he put up with it because it spared him from having to go to a comprehensive where he might be expected to make friends which was pretty much the last thing he wanted hed had friends once but hed learned that having them meant having to look at the smirks on their faces when they twigged what was going on in his life having friends meant having to overhear their murmurs of speculation as he passed them in one corridor or another on his way to lessons the fact was he didnt care if he ever had a friend again since those hed once possessed had ceased being friends just about the time his dad had walked out on the family to arsefuck a limpwristed iranian word had gone round about that soon enough for tims mum didnt possess the sense to keep her outrage to herself especially if she was certain about being the aggrieved party in a situation and she was definitely that wasnt she turned out his dad had been fucking other men for years exposing her to disease disaster disgust disrespect all the other disses there were because one thing niamh was especially good at was listing those disses to whoever wanted to hear them she made sure tim knew them from the word go and in response he broke a few things he burned a few things he hurt a few people he dismembered a kitten never mind that the poor thing was already dead and he ended up in margaret fox school just outside of ulverston here tim intended to stay but to manage that he had to do just enough to be cooperative and not enough to be given the boot back into the system where the normies were educated most kids boarded at margaret fox school because they were too disturbed to live with their families but there were day pupils as well and niamh cresswell had seen to it that tim was placed among them all the better to force his father or kaveh mehran to cart him from bryanbarrow all the way to ulverston and back each day a drive that took forever ate up their time together and punished them for putting a real bazooble of a crater in niamhs pride tim went along with it all because it got him far away from everyone who knew the story of what had happened to his parents marriage which was just about everyone in grangeoversands but one of the things he hated about margaret fox school was the rule about the stupid societies always spelled with a capital just like that in addition to regular lessons one was required to belong to three societies one each of academic creative and physical the philosophy was that the societies supposedly eased the whackedout pupils of margaret fox school into a semblance of normal behaviour sort of tricking them into acting as if they could function beyond the high walls that enclosed the grounds of the institution tim despised the societies because they forced him into contact with the other pupils but hed managed to find three that kept that contact to a bare minimum hed signed on for the ramblers the sketchers and the philatelists since each of these were activities he could do alone even if other people were present they didnt require communication of any kind other than listening to the staff member in charge of each society drone on about the subject of supposed interest which was exactly what was going on just now at the regular meeting of the ramblers quincy arnold was doing his usual blah blah blah at the end of their afternoon walk this had been a nothing stagger on the public footpath from mansriggs over to mansriggs hall and from there up to town bank road where the school van picked them up but the way qa was banging on about it youd think theyd just scaled the matterhorn the big deal had been the view of ben cragg wahoo to another bloody tooth of limestone tim thought but the ultimate goal was evidently what all this afternoon wandering was leading up to what qa called the big adventure on scout scar said adventure would not happen till spring and in the meantime all the rambling they were doing was to prepare them for the enchantment to come blah blah blah whatever qa could blather like no one else and he could be positively orgasmic about limestone escarpments and pound on my heart glacial erratics yew trees blasted by the winds dangerous screes where sure footing was crucial larks and buzzards and cuckoos on the wing daffodils tucked into hazel coppices it sounded about as interesting to tim as learning chinese writing from a blind man but he knew the value of looking at qa when the bloke was doing his blah blahs although he kept his expression hovering between indifference and loathing always on guard against being deemed cured he had to have a piss though he knew he should have done a sideoftheroad job before theyd embarked on the ride back to the school at the end of the walk but he hated pulling his prick out in public because one never knew how it would be taken among this lot with whom he had to walk so he squeezed back the urges and now he suffered through qas summary of their afternoons timeless adventure and when they were at last released onto the school grounds with the gates shut behind them he made a dash for the nearest loo and let it flow he made sure some of it went on the floor and some onto his trouser leg when he was finished he examined himself in the mirror and picked at a spot on his forehead he achieved a bit of blood always nice and left to fetch his mobile phone they werent allowed of course but the day pupils could have them as long as they got checked in every morning and ticked off on a list that was kept in the headmasters office to rescue them every afternoon one had to trek to the headmaster receive a permission slip and then trek back to the tuck shop where in a locked bank of pigeonholes behind the till the mobiles were deposited for safekeeping on this day tim was the last to retrieve his he checked for messages as soon as the mobile was in his hand there was nothing and he felt his fingers start to tingle he wanted to throw the mobile at someone but instead he walked to the tuck shop door and from there to the central path that would take him to the dropoff area where he would wait with the other day pupils to score their lifts for the trip home from school they could only ride with approved drivers of course tim had three but with his dad dead he was down to two which meant one really because there was no way in hell that niamh was going to drive to fetch him so that left kaveh and so far kaveh had done the job because he had no choice and hed not yet worked how to get out of it tim didnt care it was nothing to him who came to fetch him what was important now was the deal hed struck with toyyou and the fact that hed had no response to his latest message sent this morning on his way into school he got into contact once again where r u a moment and then here y didnt u anser when u no what i mean we agreed no way u promised me no can do y y y not on mobl u promised u said lets talk tim looked up from the screen he didnt want to talk he wanted action hed kept his part of the bargain and it was only fair that toyyou do exactly the same it always came down to this in the end he thought bitterly people played each other like a deck of cards and he was bloody sick and tired of it all but what choice did he have he could start all over but he didnt want that it had taken long enough to find toyyou he punched in his answer where u no day night ok he flipped the phone closed and shoved it into his pocket a fat girl whose name he didnt know was watching him from a bench his eyes met hers and she lifted her school skirt she spread her legs she had on no knickers he wanted to spew all over the path but instead he went for a distant bench and sat down to wait for his ride back to bryanbarrow he considered the ways he could torment kaveh on the long trip home and he congratulated himself for the piss on his trousers that would get up old kavehs nose in more ways than one he thought with an inward chuckle arnside cumbria alatea fairclough was mesmerised by morecambe bay shed never seen anything like it the ebb tide emptied its vast expanse leaving behind one hundred twenty square miles of varying kinds of sands but these were sands so dangerous that only the unwary the lifelong fishermen of the area or the queens guide went out on them if anyone else wandered into the empty bay and people did all the time they ran the risk of ending their days on earth by stumbling onto an area of quicksand that was to the casual observer indistinguishable from solid ground or far out in the bay they stood too long on rises of sand that seemed safe like islands only to find that the flood tide cut them off and then covered them in its return and when instead of a mere flood tide a tidal bore brought the water swirling back into the bay at the speed of a galloping horse things happened with a dizzying quickness as a vast surge of water covered everything in its path and that was the thing about the tidal bore that alatea found so hypnotic it seemed to come from nowhere and the speed of the torrent suggested a power driven by a force beyond any mans control the thought of this generally filled her with peace however that there was a force beyond mans control and that she could turn to that force for solace when she was most in need she loved the fact that this house a gift from her husbands father to celebrate the occasion of her marriage to his only son sat just above the kent channel which was itself part of greater morecambe bay from the edge of the property where a stone wall marked a public footpath along the channel and ultimately up to the wild open hilltop of arnside knot she could stand with a voluminous shawl wrapped round her and watch the renewing return of the salt water she could pretend she knew something about how to read the eddies that it created she was there now on this november afternoon the sunlight was dimming as it would do earlier and earlier until late december and the temperature was fast falling as well a cloud bank over the rise of humphrey head point across the channel to the west suggested a coming night of rain but she wasnt bothered by this unlike so many people in this adopted country of hers she always welcomed rain with its promise of both growth and renewal still she found herself uneasy her husband was the cause she hadnt heard from him shed phoned his mobile during the afternoon once shed learned from ringing fairclough industries that nicholas hadnt gone into work that day shed made that phone call round eleven when he still should have been there prior to leaving for the middlebarrow pele project where he now spent half of his workdays shed first assumed that hed gone to the project earlier than usual and shed then rung his mobile but all she heard was that disembodied voice telling her that she had to leave a message this she had done three times now the fact that nicholas had not replied filled her with concern his cousins sudden death loomed large alatea didnt want to think about it not only did death in general shake her but this death in particular and the circumstances of this death filled her with a dread that took every ounce of her skill at subterfuge to hide ians drowning had hit the family hard particularly had it devastated nicholass father so staggered had bernard been at first that alatea had wondered at the nature of his exact relationship with ian but it was only when bernard had begun to distance himself from nicholas that alatea had sensed an undercurrent beneath the older mans grief nicholas was not involved in ians drowning alatea knew this for a hundred and one reasons but most of all she knew it because she knew her husband he seemed weak to people because of his past but he was no such thing he was the rock and substance of her life and he would become the same to many others if he only had the chance this was what the middlebarrow pele project was giving to him but he hadnt been at the project today any more than he had been at fairclough industries had he been he would have had his mobile switched on he knew it was important to her to have contact with him periodically and he was always willing to allow her the access hed said at first do you not trust me allie i mean if im going to use again im going to use again you cant stop me with a phone call you know but that hadnt been the reason she wanted close contact with him and through partial truths shed ultimately been able to persuade him that her need had nothing to do with the need he himself had finally managed to conquer whenever he was gone from her she worried that something might happen to him entirely unrelated to his addictions a car crash a stone falling from the old pele tower a freak accident exactly like what had happened to ian except she wouldnt think about ian she told herself there were too many other things to consider she turned from the sight of the floodwaters swirling into the kent channel up the slope of the lawn in front of her arnside house spread out she allowed herself a momentary feeling of pleasure as she looked upon the building the house gave her a focus for her energies and she wondered if bernard had known that when he presented it to them upon their return to england it was used for convalescing soldiers after the war hed said as hed walked her through it and then it spent some thirty years as a girls school after that there were two sets of owners who did a few things to restore it to what it once was but then im afraid it stood vacant for a time still theres something about it thats very special my dear i think it deserves a family running about inside it and more it deserves someone like you to put your touch upon it hed kept his hand on the small of her back as hed walked her through the place he had a way of looking at her that was a little disturbing his gaze would go from nicholas to her and back to nicholas as if he couldnt understand what they had between them either where it had come from in the first place or how it was going to endure but that didnt matter to alatea what mattered was bernards acceptance of her and she had that she could tell he thought she possessed a form of magical power that was protecting nicholas a kind of sorcery perhaps she could also tell from bernards assessing looks taking her in from top to toes that he reckoned exactly what the sorcery was she went up the slope of lawn towards the house a set of stone steps led up to a terrace and she used these careful of the damp moss that grew upon them across the lawn she made for a doorway tucked into the side of the building there she let herself into the drawing room whose pale yellow walls suggested sunlight even on the most dismal of days this was the first room she and nicholas had restored it overlooked the terrace the lawn and the channel from its bay windows one could even see across the water to grangeoversands forming a fan of lights up the hillside at night in the evenings she and nicholas sat here a fire glowing in the fireplace as the shadows stretched across the floor it was early for the fire but she lit it anyway for comfort as well as for warmth then she checked the phone for a message from her husband and when there was no light blinking to tell her hed phoned she decided to ring him another time she pressed the numbers slowly the way one does when hoping a previously engaged line will now be unengaged before she finished though she finally heard him his footsteps approaching along the uncarpeted corridor she hadnt heard either his car or his entering the house but she knew it was nicholas just as she knew from the lightness of his step what mood he was in she slipped her mobile into her pocket nicholas called her name and she said in here darling and in a moment he was with her again he paused at the doorway he looked cherubic in the diffused light like an overlarge putto from a renaissance painting round of face with bright curls spilling over his forehead he said youre an impossibly gorgeous woman am i in the right house and he crossed the room to her she was wearing flatsoled shoes for once so they were of a height both of them nearly six feet tall this made it easier for him to kiss her and he did so enthusiastically his hands went down her back to cup her bum and he pulled her close to him he finally said with an engaging laugh im loaded allie like you wouldnt believe and for a terrible moment she thought hed got himself high but then he removed the pins and the slides that kept her hair in order and he loosened it to fall round her face and her shoulders after that he began to unbutton her blouse and talk about swimmers and therere millions of them and theyre perfect in form and let me tell you theyre ready to be perfect in function as well where are we in your cycle just now and his mouth went to her neck as his hands deftly unfastened her bra her body responded even as her mind assessed she sank to the carpet before the fire pulled nicholas down with her and undressed him he was not a man who coupled in silence rather it was christ the feel of you and my god allie and oh yes just like that and because of this she knew every level of his rising excitement it matched her own even if her thoughts began in another place as they always did in another time with one or another man they ended up centred on this man here of its own accord her body met his and they created for each other a release born of pleasure that made everything else fade into insignificance this was enough for her no it was more than enough enough was the love and protection nicholas afforded her that in addition she should have found a man whose body met hers in such a way as to drive off memory and fear this was something she had never expected that day behind the cafeteria till on a mountain in utah when she looked up accepted the money for his bowl of chili and heard him say in wonder jesus god is it difficult for you shed said what being so beautiful is it rather like a curse and then hed grinned scooped up his tray and said bloody hell never mind what a line eh sorry i didnt intend it to sound like that and off he went but he was back the next day and the day after that on the fourth time through her queue he asked her if shed have coffee with him that afternoon told her he didnt drink alcohol of any kind told her he was recovering from methamphetamine addiction told her he was english told her he meant to go home to england told her he meant to prove to his father and his mother that he was finally through with the devils that had ridden him for so many years told her there was a queue behind him but he didnt notice she did however and to get him to move along shed said i will meet you yes there is a place in the town across from the town lift its name and she couldnt remember the name she stared at him in some confusion he stared at her in much the same way hed said believe me ill find it and so he had now they lay on the carpet before the fire side by side he said you should tilt your hips allie theyre brilliant swimmers but itll be easier if theyre going downhill he rose on one elbow and observed her i went to lancaster he said frankly did you try to phone me i switched off the mobile because i knew i wouldnt be able to lie to you nicky she heard the disappointment in her voice she wished she could have hidden it but at least the sound of it was better than acknowledging the sudden fear that stabbed her no listen darling i needed to check just to make sure i did such a job on my body for so many years it was logical for me to want to know i mean wouldnt you want to in my position with nothing happening yet she turned as well her arm stretched out over her head and her head resting upon it she looked not at him but rather over his shoulder the rain had begun she could see its pattern on the bay windows she said i am not a machine for babies nicky how do you call it this thing that grows them incubator he said i know youre not and i dont think of you that way but its only natural i mean its been two years now weve both been anxious about it you know he reached out and touched her hair she didnt have the kind of hair a man could run his fingers through it was kinky and disordered the gift of one of her progenitors and god only knew which one because they represented a mixture of races and ethnicities too varied for logic to explain how they had all ended up reproducing with each other she said that is it nicky the anxious part you know my magazine says that anxiety alone can make this difficult for a woman i understand i do darling but it could be something else and its time we found out dont you think thats why i went and its also why you can no she shook his hand off her hair and sat up dont sit thatll she cast him a look in my country she said women are not made to feel this way that they exist for one purpose only i dont think that these things take time we know this where i come from and a baby is something to cherish a baby is not she hesitated she looked away from him she knew the truth of the matter far beyond what her body was and was not doing that truth needed to be spoken between them so she finally said a baby is not a way to win your fathers approval nicky another man would have responded in outrage or denial but this was not nicholass way part of her love for him derived from his absolute honesty so strange in a man whod given years of his life to the worship of drugs he said youre right of course i do want it for that reason i owe him that much for what i put him through hes desperate for a grandchild and i can do that for him since my sisters didnt we can do that for him so you see but thats not the only reason allie i want this with you because of you and because theres an us and if i have these tests if what comes out of it is that i am not able she dropped into silence and in that silence she could feel she would swear it his muscles become quite tense she didnt know what this meant and that fact pounded the blood down her arms and into her fingers so that she had to move she got to her feet he did as well he said is that what you actually think how can i think otherwise when this a gesture towards the carpet the fire where they had lain what they had done becomes only about a baby your little swimmers as you call them and how they are shaped and how they can move and how i should position myself afterwards to make certain they do what you want them to do how am i meant to feel faced with this and with your insistence that i visit some doctor and spread my legs and have instruments thrust into me and whatever else her voice had risen she bent picked up her discarded clothing began to dress all this day she said i miss you so much i worry when i phone you and you do not answer i long for you because its you while its the same for me you know that i know nothing she left him the kitchen was at the other end of the house down the long panelled corridor through the main hall and the dining room she went there and began their dinner it was far too early for this but she wanted something to do with her hands she was mindlessly chopping onions when nicholas joined her again he too was dressed but hed buttoned his shirt incorrectly and it hung drunkenly from his shoulders in a way that made her soften towards him he was she knew a lost boy without her just as she would be lost without him im sorry he said the last way on earth i want you to feel is like a baby machine or whatever i am trying she said the vitamins all the pills my temperature my diet whatever will make it easier possible she stopped because shed begun to weep she used her arm to brush the tears from her face allie he came to her turned her to him they stood together in each others arms one minute two at last he said just to hold you like this i feel a kind of awe dyou know how lucky a man i am i know it allie she nodded and he released her he cupped her face in his hands and studied it in that way of his that always made her feel that the thousand truths she had hidden from him were there openly displayed and he was reading them all but he made no mention of anything but forgive me of course and i will do as you ask just not quite yet please nicky let us wait a few more months he nodded then he grinned and said meantime well give those swimmers some exercise all right firm up their sense of direction she smiled in turn we can do that good now tell me why youre chopping a mountain of onions because my eyes are stinging like the devil whatre you making she observed the pile shed created i have no idea he chuckled mad woman he walked over to the days post which was in a neat pile near the kitchen phone he said did you speak with that bloke about restoring the stained glass she had she told him he thought he could match the glass in the other windows in the main hall but it would take some doing he could either take the original out for a while or he could bring glass to them but in either case it would be expensive did nicky want their conversation found its way back to normalcy compromise reached and tension gone they went on to other matters that concerned them till nicholas found the phone message that alatea had forgotten shed written so intent had she been on getting past babies doctors in lancaster and what nicholas wanted and expected of her whats this then he said holding up the paper shed torn from a notebook earlier in the day ah youve had a call a television film is being made and a woman phoned she would like to speak with you about it she is a i think she called it a scout of research something like that he frowned what kind of film alternative treatments for drug addiction this is a documentary she said interviews with addicts and doctors and social workers the involvement of a film crew and someone with them a celebrity a presenter i do not know to ask the questions i told her it is not likely you would be interested but why what whyd you tell her that she went for one of her cookbooks nicholas had created for her a recessed shelf for them above the cooker hob and she grabbed one at random wondering what she could possibly do with three onions chopped into tiny bits she said this sort of thing this is what feeds the ego nicky we have talked about that you and i it cannot be good because of where it leads because of all the things you must guard against right right but its not about me allie he looked again at the paper he held wheres she from wherere the filmmakers from i did not ask i did not think she looked at the cover of the cookbook she was holding she gathered her thoughts considered her approach she said nicky you must take care with this sort of thing you always said that your part is quiet behind the scenes this is best raising money to keep the project going is best he countered this could be what we need to make that happen and when it does not why dyou say that the other thing that newspaperman who was here so many times what came of that nothing and all the hours you spent with him the talking the walking round the working at the pele tower with him and what then more nothing he promises a story and what comes of his promise nothing i do not wish to see the disappointment in your face she told him because of where it might lead was what he would add in his own head but that could not be helped his expression changed but not to hardness rather he seemed to glow at her and the source of the glow was his love he said darling allie youre not to worry i do know whats at risk for me every day he picked up the phone but didnt punch in the number this isnt about ego this is about saving lives like mine was saved you always have claimed i saved your life no he replied you made it worth living id like to see what this is about he gestured with the phone but i wont do it without your agreement she saw no other way he was asking very little after all that he had given to her there seemed no course available but to say all right then nicky if you will have a care brilliant he replied he looked at the paper and punched in the number as he did so he said to alatea whats the surname allie i cant read your writing she came to look over his shoulder at what shed written st james she said great urswick cumbria when the gates of margaret fox school opened manette fairclough mcghie sighed in relief shed thought there was a very good chance that niamh cresswell wouldnt have phoned the school to inform them that her son would be fetched on this day by someone not on the previously approved list it would have been exactly like niamh to have done so niamh knew that manette had been close to ian which in niamhs eyes made manette a postdivorce enemy but it seemed that ians former wife had decided that the convenience of having an additional someone willing to fetch her son outweighed her need to avenge all putative sins committed against her shed said ill let gracie know shell be upset if tim doesnt show up at his regular time and this made manette feel that she ought to be taking gracie as well as tim but it was tim she wanted to see today tim whose face at his fathers funeral still haunted manettes nights this would be her tenth attempt to get through to her cousin ians son shed tried at the reception immediately following the funeral shed tried with phone calls shed tried by email and now she was going for the direct approach tim could hardly avoid her if she had him in the car shed left work early stopping by freddies office to tell him shed see him at home im fetching tim she said thought he might like to spend the evening with us dinner and a dvd you know perhaps stay the night freddies reply had somewhat surprised her instead of an absentminded oh right manette her erstwhile partner in life had turned the red of a very bad sunburn and said oh yes as to that and after a bit of uncharacteristic stumbling round had gone on with ive a date actually manette shed said oh and tried to hide her surprise hed hurried on with i rather thought it was time i probably should have told you before now but i didnt quite know how to put it manette didnt like the way she felt about this but she forced a smile and said oh lovely freddie anyone i know no no of course not just someone howd you meet he moved back from his desk on the monitor behind him she could see a graph and she wondered what he was working on profits and losses probably he was also due to analyse wages and benefits and there was the not small matter of formally going through the books following ians death when on earth had freddie even found the time to meet someone she wondered he said actually id rather not talk about it it feels a bit uncomfortable oh right manette nodded he was watching her earnestly to gauge her reaction so she was careful to give him a cheerful one prhaps you cn bring her by then ill want to see if i approve you dont want to make a second mistake you werent a mistake he told her ah thanks for saying that she fished in her bag and brought out her car keys she said brightly still my best friend then still and always he replied what he didnt say was what she knew that they couldnt go on forever as they were divorced but housemates everything the same in their lives save where they slept and with whom they made love what remained was the deep friendship that had always existed between them which was at the end the root of the problem shed often thought since the day theyd agreed to divorce that things might have been different had they been able to have children together that their relationship wouldnt have deteriorated to the point of their dinnertime conversation being all about the benefits of a selfcleaning and selfdeodorising lavatory and how to market it one couldnt go on like that indefinitely without waking up one morning and wondering where the magic had gone a friendly divorce seemed the best solution well shed known freddie would find someone else eventually she intended to do the same herself she just hadnt thought it would happen so quickly now she wondered if the truth was that she just hadnt thought it would happen at all she eased her car through the gates of margaret fox school shed not been here before but niamh had told her where tim would be waiting there was a supervised holding area near the administration building tims mother had said manettes name would be on a list matching to tims name she was to take her identification with her a passport was best if she had one there would be no quibbling over that she found tim easily enough since the lane into the school led directly to the administration building with the classrooms and dormitories forming a quadrangle behind it her cousins son was hunched on a bench with a rucksack at his feet he was doing what in manettes experience most teenagers did with their free time these days he was texting someone she pulled up to the kerb but he didnt look up so intent was he upon what he was doing this gave her the chance to observe him and she did so reflecting not for the first time upon the extremes to which tim went in order to hide his resemblance to his father like ian hed been late to puberty and he still hadnt gone through a growth spurt so he was small for his age and out of his school uniform he would look even smaller for then he donned clothes so baggy that they draped upon him and even the baseball caps he favoured were too large they covered his hair which hed not cut in ages and which he allowed to hang in his eyes he would want of course to hide those eyes most of all for like his fathers they were large and brown and limpid and they served perfectly well as those metaphorical windows to the soul manette could see he was scowling something wasnt right with whoever was texting in reply to tim as she watched he lifted his hand and tore at his fingers he bit down so hard that she winced at the sight she got out of the car quickly and called his name he looked up for a moment his face showed surprise manette wanted to call it delighted surprise but she didnt dare go that far but then his features settled into the scowl again he didnt move from the bench she said hey buster come on im your lift today i need help with something and youre my man he said sullenly i got somewhere to go and went back to texting or perhaps pretending to she replied well i dont know how else youre going to get there cause im the only one with wheels that youre going to see wheres bloody kaveh then whats kaveh got to do with it tim looked up from his mobile manette saw him huff it was a derisive exhalation of breath intended to convey his judgement of her it said stupid cow without saying stupid cow fourteenyearold boys were nothing if not transparent come on tim she said lets go the schools not about to let anyone else fetch you today now your mums rung them he would know the drill further recalcitrance was pointless he muttered shoved himself to his feet and slouched over to the car dragging his rucksack behind him he threw himself into the passenger seat with enough force to rock the car on its wheels she said steady on and then seat belt please and she waited for him to cooperate she felt for tim hed taken too many punches hed been the worst possible age for his father to have walked out on the family for any reason to have had his father walk out on the family for another man had thrown his entire world off its axis what was he meant to do and how was he meant to understand his own dawning sexuality in such a situation it was no wonder to manette that tims behaviour had altered on the edge of a knife propelling him from his comprehensive into the cloistered safety of a school for the disturbed he was disturbed in his position who wouldnt be she made a careful turn into the road outside the school gates and she said to tim cds in the glove box why dont you find us something wont have anything i like he turned a shoulder to her and stared out of the window bet i do have a look buster i got to meet someone he told her i said who someone your mum know about this that derisive huff of breath again he muttered something and when she asked him to repeat it he said nothing forget it and he watched the scenery there was little enough of it and certainly nothing to fascinate in this part of the county for outside of ulverston and heading south to great urswick the land was open and rolling farmland separated from the road by hedges and limestone walls pastures in which the ubiquitous sheep grazed and the occasional woodland of alders and paper birches it wasnt a long drive manettes home in great urswick was closer to margaret fox school than the homes of any of tims other relatives it was she thought not for the first time the most logical place for tim to reside during the school terms and shed mentioned this to both ian and niamh shortly after theyd enrolled the boy there but niamh wouldnt hear of it there was gracie to consider it would devastate her to be without her brother in the afterschool hours manette had reckoned that there was more to the matter than gracies devastation but she had not pressed it she would shed decided see the boy when she could great urswick wasnt much of a village one of those collections of cottages that had grown round the intersection of several country lanes a distance inland from bardsea and morecambe bay it possessed a pub a post office a restaurant two churches and a primary school but it had the added feature of sitting on the edge of a somewhat large pond the posh district as manette and freddie liked to call it consisted of the houses built along the banks of this pond they were situated near to the road but their large back gardens comprised lawns giving onto the pond itself reeds formed occasional barriers between the gardens and the water and where there were no reeds miniature jetties allowed residents access to rowingboats or places to sit and watch the ducks and the two resident swans who lived there throughout the year manette and freddies house was one of these manette pulled up to it leaving the garage for freddies use and she said to tim come and look heres where i need your help back here why isnt freddie helping you tim asked abruptly he didnt move to unhook his seat belt freddie she laughed impossible hed have to read instructions and theres no way hes about to do that the way i reckon it i read and you build and afterwards we cook burgers and chips build what i cant build nothing oh yes you can wait and see she said its round the back come on she set off towards the corner of the house without waiting to see if he would follow the project was a tent of course she could have put it up herself with or without help from anyone but this was not the point the point was doing something to engage tim and to get him talking or at least to get him relaxing enough that he might allow her a modest inroad into his suffering she unpacked the tent and laid it out on the lawn it was a large affair more suitable for a family of four than for what she had in mind but as it wasnt the season for tent buying shed had to make do with what was on offer she was sorting through various stakes and cords when she heard tim finally come round the side of the house she said good there you are need a snack before we begin he shook his head he looked from the sprawl of canvas to her to the water he said whatre you setting this up here for then oh this is just practice for you and me she told him when we know what were doing well take it up scout scar what for for camping out silly what else would we use it for your mum told me youre walking on the fells now and as im walking on the fells as well we cn do it together soons youre ready you dont walk on the fells a lot you know i take all kinds of exercise besides freddie doesnt like me running along the roads any longer he thinks ill be hit by a car come on then whatre you waiting for sure you dont want a snack custard cream jaffa cake banana marmite toast i said no he sounded fierce look i already told you i got to meet someone where its important i said id be there where windermere windermere who on earth are you meeting in windermere does your mum know youre meeting someone in windermere shed been crouched among the items intended for setting up the tent but now she stood she said see here tim whats going on are you up to something whats that sposed to mean you know very well drugs drink some sort of naughty nonsense that no look i got to be there i got to she could hear his desperation but she couldnt tell what it had to do with or why he was feeling it any idea she had in the matter was not a good one but there was something in his eyes when they flashed in her direction a form of suffering looking out at her and begging for her help she said i cant take you there without speaking to your mum and she headed in the direction of the house saying im going to phone her and make sure you cant why not tim whats going on she wont care she doesnt know it wont matter if you ring her oh fuck fuck fuck and he stalked across the tent and down to the little wooden jetty that stretched into the pond there was a rowingboat tied there but he didnt get into it instead he dropped heavily down onto the jetty and his head fell into his hands manette could tell he was crying her heart went out to him she crossed the lawn and went out to join him on the dock she sat down next to him but didnt touch him she said buster this is a bad time for you this is the worst but its going to pass i promise you it is going to pass because you dont know anything he swung round and shoved her she fell onto her side you dont know shit he kicked her and she felt the force of the blow in the region of her kidneys she tried to say his name but could not get it past her lips before he kicked her again november lake windermere cumbria lynley arrived at ireleth hall in the afternoon given the choice among flying driving or taking the train hed opted for driving despite the length of the trip he left london long before dawn stopped twice along the way and spent the time in the healey elliott deep in thought he hadnt been with isabelle on the previous night shed asked and hed wanted but he reckoned it would be better for them both if he stayed away despite her words to the contrary he knew she intended to get to the bottom of where he was going and why and he equally intended not to tell her the conflict between them that this would have doubtless caused was something he wanted to avoid isabelle had cut back radically on her drinking in the months theyd been together and he didnt want anything like an argument with him to set her on the path to the bottle again she needed to stay sober and he liked her sober and if avoiding a conflict encouraged her to maintain sobriety then he was happy to avoid anything resembling a conflict with her darling i had no idea youd become such a coward with women helen would have said about this but it wasnt cowardice as far as he was concerned it was the course of wisdom and he was determined to follow it still he thought about this and about isabelle and himself most of the way to cumbria compatibility was on his mind when he reached ireleth hall the great iron gates stood open as if in anticipation of his arrival he drove beneath the shelter of ancient oaks winding in the direction of lake windermere and finding himself ultimately pulling up to an impressive manygabled affair of stone dappled with grey lichen its central feature a boxy pele tower of enormous proportions that announced the age of at least part of the building thirteenth century lynley thought it predated his own home in cornwall by more than four hundred years from the pele tower various extensions had been put onto the building over the centuries wisely however they were all of a piece so the result was a harmonious blend of architectural periods with rolling lawns spreading out on either side of it these copiously dotted with some of the most impressive oaks lynley had ever seen among the oaks stood equally impressive plane trees and beneath them fallow deer grazed placidly he got out of the car and breathed deeply of air fresh from a recent rainfall from where he stood the lake wasnt visible but he reckoned that from inside the westfacing house the views of the water and the opposite shore would be impressive here you are then lynley turned at the sound of bernard faircloughs voice the man was heading his way from a walled garden to the north of the house he joined lynley by the healey elliott he admired the old car ran his hand along its sleek wing and asked the usual polite questions about the vehicle its age its performance and about lynleys drive from london the niceties dispensed with he ushered him into the house through a door that led directly into a great hall panelled in oak and hung with burnished breastplates of armour a fire burned in a fireplace here with two sofas facing each other in front of it other than the crackling from flames consuming wood and the ticking from a longcase clock the place seemed entirely silent fairclough spoke in the low tones of a man at a church service or one concerned about being overheard although as far as lynley could tell they were alone ive had to tell valerie why youre here he said we dont keep secrets in general more than forty years together and its impossible anyway so shes in the picture shell cooperate shes not entirely happy with me for pushing this matter but she understands as well as a mother can understand when there are concerns about her children fairclough pushed his thickframed spectacles up the bridge of his nose as he considered his words shes the only one though so for everyone else youre a fellow member of twins whos come for a visit some of them know about your wife as well its made well its made everything more believable youve no trouble with that i hope he sounded nervous lynley had to wonder what he was nervous about that lynley was here that he was a cop or that he might uncover something unsavoury as he stumbled round the property he supposed any of these were possible but the nerves did make him curious about fairclough helens death was in the newspapers he replied i can hardly protest if its common knowledge good good fairclough rubbed his hands together in a letsgetdowntowork gesture he shot lynley a smile ill show you your room and give you a tour i thought a quiet dinner this evening just the four of us and then tomorrow perhaps you can whatever it is you do you know the four of us our daughter mignon will be joining us she lives here on the property not in the house as shes of an age when a woman prefers to have her own home shes not far though and as shes unmarried and youre a widower it did seem possible fairclough lynley noted had the grace to look uncomfortable at this something of another excuse for you to be here i havent said anything to mignon directly but if you keep it in mind that shes unmarried ive a feeling she might be more forthright with you if you perhaps showed her a bit of interest you suspect she has something to hide lynley asked shes a cipher fairclough replied ive never been able to have a break through to her i hope youll manage it come its just this way the stairs formed part of the pele towers base and they rose among a collection of landscape watercolours into a corridor paneled in oak much like the great hall but without the great halls windows to lighten the gloom doors opened off this corridor and fairclough led lynley to one at the far north end where a leadpaned window offered a dim shaft of light in which dust motes floated upward as if released from captivity in the persian carpets the room they entered was a large one its best feature a set of bay windows with a deep embrasure where a seat had been fashioned fairclough walked lynley over to this spot windermere he said unnecessarily as lynley had assumed this west side of the house overlooked the lake three terraces made a way down to it two of lawn and a third of gravel upon which weathered tables chairs and chaise longues stood beyond this last one the lake spread out disappearing round a finger of land that pointed northeast and was called fairclough said rawlinson nab closer to hand the tiny island of grass holme seemed to float in the water surmounted by a copse of ash trees and grubbins point appeared like a knuckle protruding outward into the water lynley said to fairclough you must quite enjoy living here most of the year at least as i expect youre fairly overrun in the summer tourists he meant cumbria in general and the lakes in particular would be thronged from june to the end of september rain or shine and god knew most of the time it was rain theyd be walking climbing and camping everywhere there was space to do so frankly i wish i had more time to do just that to live here fairclough said between the factory in barrow the foundation my solicitors in london and the ministry of defence im actually fortunate to get here once a month ministry of defence fairclough grimaced my life is governed by a complete lack of romance ive a composting toilet theyre interested in weve been in discussion for months and the solicitors is there a problem i should know about something related to the family to ian cresswell no no fairclough said patent lawyers these are as well as solicitors for the foundation all of it keeps me on the run i rely on valerie to deal with this place its her family home so shes happy to do so sounds as if you dont see much of each other fairclough smiled secret of a long and happy marriage bit unusual but its worked all these years ah theres valerie now lynley moved his gaze from fairclough to the three terraces assuming the mans wife had come into view from elsewhere on the property but he indicated the lake and upon it a rowingboat a figure had just put oars into water and was bending to the task of rowing towards the shore it was impossible at this distance to tell if the oarsman was male or female but fairclough said shell be heading towards the boathouse let me take you to her youll be able to see where ian well you know outside lynley took note of the fact that the boathouse wasnt visible from the main house to gain it fairclough led him to the south wing of ireleth hall where through shrubbery formed by the autumn red foliage of a mass of spiraea over six feet tall an arbour gave way to a path this wound through a garden thick with the twin of holly mahonia which appeared to have grown in the spot for one hundred years the path curved downwards through a little plantation of poplars and ultimately opened onto a fanlike landing the boathouse was here a fanciful structure faced in the stacked slate of the district with a steeply pitched roof and a landside single door there were no windows the door stood open and fairclough entered first inside they stood on a narrow stone dock that ran round three sides of the building the lake water lapping against it a motorboat and a scull were tied to this dock as well as an ancient canoe according to fairclough the scull had belonged to ian cresswell valerie fairclough had not gained the boathouse yet but they could see her from its waterside door and it was obvious she would be with them within minutes ian capsized the scull when he fell fairclough said just over there you can see where the stones are missing there were two of them side by side and he apparently grasped one and lost his balance when it came loose he fell and the other stone went as well where are they now lynley went to the spot and squatted for a better look the light was bad inside the boathouse he would need to come back with a torch what the stones that came loose where are they ill want a look at them theyre still in the water as far as i know lynley looked up no one brought them up for examination that was unusual an unexpected death raised all sorts of questions and one of them was the one that asked how a stone on a dock no matter the docks age had loosened wear and tear might have done it of course so might a chisel however the coroner ruled it an accident as ive told you it looked straightforward to the policeman who came to the scene he phoned an inspector who came had a look and reached the same conclusion were you here when this happened in london was your wife alone when she found the body she was and with a glance towards the lake here she is now lynley rose the rowingboat was approaching quickly the oarsman applying muscular strokes when she was close enough for the boat to glide the rest of the way into the boathouse on its own power valerie fairclough removed the oars from the oarlocks rested them in the bottom of the boat and floated inside she was wearing rainclothes yellow slicker and waxed trousers gloves and boots she had nothing on her head however and her grey hair was managing to look perfectly kempt despite the fact shed been out on the water any luck fairclough asked she looked over her shoulder but did not appear startled she said there you are then rotten luck entirely im afraid i was out for three hours and all i managed were two miserable little things who looked at me so pathetically i was forced to toss them back into the water you must be thomas lynley this to lynley welcome to cumbria its tommy he extended his hand to her she threw him the dock line instead of grasping it cleat hitch she said or do i speak greek not to me good man she handed her fishing gear to her husband a tackle box a rod and a pail of squirming bait that lynley recognised as maggots clearly she wasnt a squeamish woman she clambered out of the rowingboat as lynley tied it up she was extremely agile impressive for her age since lynley knew she was sixtyseven years old when she was on the dock she shook his hand welcome again she said has bernie given you the tour she tugged off her rain slicker and removed the trousers she hung these from pegs on the boathouse wall as her husband stowed her fishing kit beneath a wooden workbench when he turned to her she offered her cheek for a kiss she said darling as ostensible greeting and added how longve you been back to which he said noon to which she said you should have sent up a flare she added mignon and he said not yet shes well to which she replied slow process but better it was lynley knew that shorthand of all couples whove been together so many years valerie said to him with a nod at the scull you were having a look at where our ian drowned werent you bernie and i arent of the same mind on this subject but i expect hes told you that hes mentioned that you found the body it must have been a shock i hadnt even known hed gone out rowing i hadnt known he was on the property at all as he hadnt parked his car near the house hed been in the water nearly twentyfour hours when i got to him so you can imagine what he looked like at that point still im glad i found him and not mignon or kaveh i can only imagine what would have happened then kaveh lynley asked ians partner hes doing some work for me here on the property im putting in a childrens area and hes done the design hes overseeing the work as well hes here every day perhaps three times a week he doesnt check in with me and i dont keep track she regarded lynley as if evaluating what was going on in his mind she said as the americans say on their television programmes do you like him for the murder lynley smiled briefly it may well turn out that the coroner was right i have every confidence that it will she looked from lynley to her husband fairclough lynley saw was gazing intently through the waterside opening in the boathouse out onto the lake she said it was a terrible thing to have happened we were very fond of ian bernie and i we should have kept a closer eye on the dock its quite old more than a hundred years and its never been out of use stones become loose see here theres another she used her toe against a stone next to the spot from which the other two had fallen it was as she said unsteady as well but of course lynley thought that might have been owing to the fact that someone had deliberately loosened it when accidents happen we want to blame someone valerie said and this was a wretched thing to have happened because it leaves those poor children with one mad parent and no tempering influence whatsoever if theres fault here however its mine im afraid valerie her husband said im in charge of ireleth hall and the property bernie i fell down on the job your nephew died as a result i dont blame you her husband replied perhaps you should consider doing so they exchanged a look from which bernard broke away first that look said more than their words had done there were lynley reckoned deep waters here they went far beyond those found in the lake november milnthorpe and arnside cumbria when theyd laid their plans for taking a few days to help tommy in cumbria deborah st james had entertained visions of herself and simon being domiciled in a hotel draped in a stunning display of virginia creeper in its autumnal glory overlooking one of the lakes she would even have settled for a situation viewing a mere waterfall as the county appeared to have a plethora of them but where she ended up was an old inn called the crow and eagle exactly at the point one would expect an inn to be sitting at an intersection of two roads down which lorries seemed to rumble at all hours of the night this intersection was in the middle of the market town of milnthorpe so far south of the lakes as not to be considered part of the lakes at all and the only water it boasted was the river bela nowhere in view which appeared to be one of the countless tributaries that debouched into morecambe bay simon had seen her expression at the first glimpse of the place hed said ah and well were not here on holiday are we my love but well take a day or two when weve finished a grand hotel with a view of windermere roaring fires scones tea and whatever else hed leered at her playfully shed eyed him and said im planning to hold you to that simon id have it no other way on the evening of their arrival shed received on her mobile the call that shed been awaiting she answered as shed been answering every call for the last twentyfour hours just for the practice shed said deborah st james photography and shed nodded to simon when the caller identified himself as nicholas fairclough it hadnt taken long to make the arrangements he was willing to meet with her and discuss the project that she had phoned about hed said but this documentary its not about me is it at least not about my private life shed assured him that it was only about the project he had developed for recovering addicts it would be a preliminary interview she told him she would give a report to a filmmaker from query productions who would ultimately make the decision regarding the projects inclusion in his documentary this is purely on spec she told him she liked this jargon anything to make her seem like the genuine article to this man ive no idea if youd actually be in the film at the end of the day you understand this seemed to relieve him he sounded quite buoyant when he said right then when shall we meet she was readying herself for that meeting now simon was on his mobile with the coroner spinning his own tale about a lecture he would be giving to a class at university college london he was she was finding far more glib than she this surprised her for while he had always been the most confident of men and his credentials were impressive enough to make him confident his confidence had always seemed to be connected to his relationship with the truth that he could dissemble so well gave her pause one didnt like to know ones husband was quite so adept at lying when he had to her own mobile rang as she was gathering her things she looked at the number and recognised it no need to be deborah st james photography at the moment the caller was simons brother david she knew at once why david was ringing her she was more or less ready for the call just thought id answer any questions you might have was how david brought up the subject his voice had that encouraging ring to it jollying her along the girls quite keen to meet you deborah shes had a look at your website the photos and all that simon said you were worrying a bit about the london placement since she lives here in southampton i daresay she wouldnt have considered it but she knows simons my brother and her fathers worked at the company here for a good twenty years part of the accounting department he added hastily that was synonymous with shes from a good family as if he felt that the girls having a dockworker as a father would constitute the possession of tainted blood they wanted her to decide deborah understood this david and simon both saw the situation as the perfect solution to a problem having gone on for years they were both the sort of man who takes each difficulty in life as it comes up and deals with it as soon as possible and just as efficiently neither of them was like her projecting into the future and seeing how complicated and potentially heartbreaking was the scenario they were proposing she said david i just dont know i dont think it would work i cant see how are you saying no that was another one of the problems saying no meant no asking for more time meant not taking a position why on earth deborah wondered could she not take a definite position on this matter last chance and only chance seemed like the reasons but she was still frozen in place unwilling to speak she said shed ring him back at the moment she had to set off for arnside a heavy sigh at his end told her he wasnt happy with this but he rang off simon said nothing although hed obviously heard her side of the call as hed finished with his own they parted at the sides of their respective hire cars wishing each other luck deborahs drive was the lesser one nicholas fairclough lived just on the far outskirts of the village of arnside and arnside was southwest of milnthorpe a short distance along the side of a muddy flat of sand that gave onto the kent channel there were fishermen here positioned along the road and down the bank although deborah couldnt tell exactly where they were fishing from the car it didnt look as if there was any water in the mud flat at all she could see however where the shifting tide from morecambe bay had scoured out depressions in the sand creating banks and drops that suggested danger arnside house was the name of nicholas faircloughs property it sat at the end of the promenade an impressive display of victorian mansions that had no doubt at one time served as the summer homes of industrialists from manchester liverpool and lancaster most of these were statelylooking conversions now flats possessing unimpeded views of the channel of the railway viaduct that stretched across the water towards grangeoversands and of grangeoversands itself just visible today through a mild autumn mist unlike the mansions that preceded it arnside house was an unadorned structure utterly plain and whitewashed over a roughcast exterior that was itself a finishing surface over what was undoubtedly stone or brick its windows featured unpainted sandstone surrounds and its many gables displayed rounded chimneys whitewashed like the rest of the building only the rainwater heads were other than plain and these were highly stylised in a design deborah recognised as arts and crafts shades of charles rennie mackintosh she thought once inside the structure however she discovered a whimsical blend of everything from the medieval to the modern nicholas fairclough answered the door he admitted her into an oakpanelled entrance hall whose marble floor was detailed in a pattern of diamonds circles and squares he took her coat from her and led her down an uncarpeted corridor and past a large room having the look of a medieval banqueting hall complete with minstrels gallery above a fireplace inglenook this hall was something of a wreck as far as deborah could tell and as if in explanation of this nicholas fairclough said were restoring the old pile bit by bit thats going to be last im afraid as we need to find someone who can cope with the most astounding wallpaper peacocks and petunias i call it peacocks is accurate but i cant swear to the other here we can talk in the drawing room this was sunshine yellow with a white plaster frieze of hawthorn berries birds leaves roses and acorns in any other room this elaborate decoration would have been the main feature but the drawing rooms fireplace served as a remarkable focal point of bright turquoise tiles and a hearth that duplicated the diamonds circles and squares of the entrance a fire was burning here and although the fireplace like the one in the great hall formed part of an inglenook with bench seats bookshelves and stained glass windows nicholas motioned deborah to one of two lowslung chairs in one of the bay windows from which they had a view of the water a table stood between the chairs a coffee service and three cups on it along with a fan of magazines i wanted to speak to you for a moment before i fetch my wife nicholas said i must tell you that im completely on board with talking to you and with having the project featured in this film if it comes to it but allies going to take some convincing i thought id give you a headsup i see can you give me some idea shes rather private he said shes from argentina and shes selfconscious about her english frankly i think she speaks it perfectly well but there you have it plus he tipped his fingers beneath his chin and looked thoughtful for a moment before saying shes protective of me as well theres that deborah smiled this film isnt an expose or anything mr fairclough although to be honest it could turn into that if youre enslaving recovering addicts for your own purposes i suppose i should ask if you need protecting for some reason shed meant it lightheartedly but she couldnt help noting how seriously he took the question he appeared to be tossing round a few possibilities and she found this detail rather telling he finally said heres what i think it is she worries that ill be disappointed in some way and she worries where disappointment will lead me she wouldnt say that but one has a way of knowing these things about ones wife after a bit of time together if you know what i mean how long have you been married two years last march youre quite close then we are indeed im pleased to say let me fetch her to meet you you dont look all that frightening do you he sprang up from his chair and left her in the drawing room deborah looked around whoever had decorated it had an artistic flair that she could well appreciate the furniture reflected the period from which the house had come but it managed to remain secondary to the features of the room aside from the fireplace the most notable of these were columns slender poles surmounted with capitals that were bowls carved with birds and fruits and leaves they stood at the sides of the bay windows they formed the ends of the inglenooks benches they held up a shelf that ran round the room just beneath the frieze the restoration of this room alone must have cost a fortune deborah reckoned she wondered where a reformed drug addict had managed to come up with such a sum her gaze went to the bay window from there it fell upon the table and the coffee service that sat upon it waiting for someones use the fan of magazines next to this caught her attention and she idly fingered through them architecture interior design gardening and then she came to one that caused her hand to stop abruptly conception this one was called deborah had seen it often enough during the endless appointments shed had with specialists before receiving the disheartening diagnosis that had sunk her dreams but shed never looked through it it had seemed too much like tempting fate she picked it up now however there might well be she thought a form of sisterhood between nicholas faircloughs wife and herself and this could be useful quickly she flipped through it it consisted of the types of articles one might expect in a magazine of such a name appropriate diets during pregnancy antenatal vitamins and supplements postpartum depression and related problems midwives breastfeeding all of it was here but in the back was something curious a number of pages had been torn out footsteps came along the corridor and deborah replaced the magazine on the table she got to her feet and turned as she heard nicholas fairclough say alatea vasquez y del torres fairclough and added with an appealing boyish laugh forgive me i rather love saying that name allie this is deborah st james the woman was deborah thought quite exotic olive skinned and dark eyed with cheekbones defining an angular face she had an abundance of coffeecoloured hair so wiry that it sprang from her head in a billowing mass and enormous gold earrings shone through it when she moved she was an odd match for nicholas fairclough former drug addict and family black sheep alatea crossed the room to her a hand extended she had large hands but they were long fingered and slim like the rest of her nicky tells me you seem harmless enough she said with a smile her english was heavily accented he has told you i have a concern about this about my being harmless deborah asked or about the project lets sit and have a chat nicholas was the one to speak as if worried that his wife wouldnt understand deborahs mild joke ive made coffee allie alatea poured she wore gold bangles on her wrists first cousins to her earrings and they slid down her arm as she reached for the coffeepot her gaze seemed to fall on the magazines as she did this and for a moment she hesitated she cast a glance at deborah deborah smiled in what she hoped was an encouraging fashion alatea said i was surprised about this film of yours ms st james its deborah please as you wish of course it is small up here what nicholas is doing i did wonder how you learned about him deborah was ready for this tommy had done his homework on the faircloughs hed found a logical point of entry for her it wasnt me actually she said i just go where im pointed and do the preliminary research for the filmmakers at query productions im not sure exactly how they decided upon you with a nod at nicholas but i think it had to do with an article about your parents house nicholas said to his wife it was that sidebar again darling and to deborah there was a piece written about ireleth hall my parents place its an historic old pile on lake windermere with a topiary garden round two hundred years old that my mothers brought back she mentioned this place our home to the reporter and as its a bit of an architectural conversation piece he trotted over to have a look not sure why perhaps it was a historicalrestorationsareinthebloodofthefaircloughs kind of thing this place was given to us by my father and i reckoned taking it on was better than looking a gift horse i think allie and i would have preferred something new with all the mod cons in working order though isnt that the case darling its a beautiful home alatea said in reply i feel fortunate to live here thats because you always insist upon seeing the glass halffull nicholas told her which makes me a very lucky man i suppose one of the film producers deborah said to alatea brought up the middlebarrow pele project at an early meeting we had in london when we were looking at all the possibilities frankly no one knew what a pele tower was but there were several people who knew about your husband who he is i mean as well as other things she didnt elaborate upon those things it was obvious to them all what they were so this film alatea said i do not have to be involved it is you see a matter of my english which sounded deborah thought not only excellent but charming and the fact that nicky has done all of this on his own i wouldnt have done it without you in my life nicholas put in but that is another matter entirely she turned as she spoke and her hair lifted that billowing effect caused by its wiry nature the pele project this is about you and what you have done and what you are achieving on your own i am only your support nicky as if thats not important he said rolling his eyes at deborah as if to add you see what i have to put up with nonetheless i have no real part and i want no part youve no worries on that score deborah assured her anything to get their agreement she thought and really i do want to stress that nothing may come of this anyway i dont make the decisions i only do the research i create a report take pictures to accompany it and everything goes to london the people at the production company decide what will be in the film see nicholas said to his wife no worries alatea nodded but she didnt look convinced still she gave her blessing with the words perhaps you should then take deborah to see the project nicky that seems like a good place to begin arnside cumbria when her husband had left with the redhaired woman alatea sat for a moment looking at the fan of magazines on the table in the bay windows alcove they had been gone through while this shouldnt have been odd considering the woman had been waiting for nicholas to fetch his wife for an introduction and it was natural for one to flip idly through magazines while waiting there was nonetheless very little that did not set alateas nerves on edge these days she told herself that it meant absolutely nothing that conception was now on the top of the stack while it was a little embarrassing that a stranger might conclude that alatea was obsessed with the subject of the magazine it hardly meant anything would come of her conclusion this woman from london was not here to talk to her or to wander through the labyrinth of her personal history she was here because of what nicholas was doing and it was likely that she wouldnt have been here at all had nicholas been just some ordinary individual trying to develop yet another way to help addicts turn their lives around the fact that he wasnt just some ordinary bloke the fact that the misdeeds of his misspent youth had garnered him so much publicity because of his father that was what made the story a good one the son of lord fairclough selfredeemed from a life of dissolution alatea hadnt known about the baron fairclough of ireleth part of nicholass past when shed first met him or she would have run from his presence instead shed known only that his father was a manufacturer of everything imaginable that one might find in a bathroom a fact that nicholas had made light of what he hadnt mentioned was his fathers title his fathers service to the cause of pancreatic cancer and his fathers subsequent position of prominence so shed been prepared to meet a man prematurely aged by his sons having thrown away twenty years of his life shed not been prepared to meet the vital presence that was bernard fairclough nor had she been altogether prepared for that way nicholass father looked at her through his heavyframed spectacles call me bernard hed said and his eyes had gone from her own to her bosom and back again welcome to the family my dear she was used to mens eyes on her bosom that had not been the problem it was natural men were men but men didnt usually then gaze upon her with speculation on their faces what is someone like you doing with my son was the unspoken question bernard fairclough had asked her she had seen that look each time nicholas had introduced her to a member of his family to them all she and her husband were unsuited and although she wanted to make her physical appearance the reason for her unsuitability as the wife of nicholas fairclough she reckoned it was more than that they thought of her as a gold digger she was not from their country they knew nothing about her her courtship had been disturbingly brief to them this meant she was after something undoubtedly the family fortune especially did nicholass cousin ian think this because he was the man in charge of bernard faircloughs money what nicholass family didnt think was that she could possibly be in love with him shed so far expended a great deal of effort to assure them of her devotion shed given them not a single reason to doubt her love for nicholas and ultimately shed come to believe shed soothed the concerns of them all there was no reason their concerns should not be soothed for she did love her husband she was devoted to him god in heaven she was hardly the first woman on earth who had fallen in love with a man less attractive than herself it happened all the time so for every person to gaze upon her so speculatively this had to stop but she wasnt sure how to halt it alatea knew that she had to resolve her anxieties about this and other matters in some way she had to stop starting at shadows it was not a sin to enjoy the life she had she hadnt sought it it had come to her that had to mean it was the path that she was intended to follow still there was the magazine mixed among the others on the table and now on the top of them still there was the way the woman from london had looked at her how did they really know who this woman was why she was here and what she intended they didnt they had to wait to find out or so it seemed alatea picked up the coffee service on its tray she carried it into the kitchen she saw next to the telephone the scrap of paper upon which shed first written the message from deborah st james she hadnt taken note of the name of the company deborah st james represented when shed taken the message but the woman herself had mentioned it thank god so alatea had a place to start she went to the second floor of the house along a corridor where servants once had slept she had designated a tiny bedroom as their design centre while she and nicholas worked upon the house but she also used the room as her lair and it was here that she kept her laptop it took forever to access the internet from this location but she managed to do so she stared at the screen for a moment before she began to type bryanbarrow cumbria it had been easy to bunk off school since no one with any brains would actually want to cart him all the way to ulverston and beyond and since kaveh did have brains it had been a simple matter lie in bed clutch the stomach say cousin manette had served him something that must have been bad on the previous evening claim he had already been sick twice during the night and act appreciative when gracie reacted as hed known shed react shed flown to kavehs bedroom and hed heard her crying out timmys been sick timmys not well and he did feel a very small twinge of guilt because he knew from gracies voice that she was afraid poor dumb kid it didnt take a genius to know she was worried that someone else from her family might suddenly kick the bucket she needed to get a grip did gracie people died all the time one couldnt prevent that by hovering round them and doing their breathing eating sleeping and shitting for them besides as far as tim was concerned gracie had bigger worries now than the potential death of someone else in her life she had the worry of what the hell was going to become of her now their dad was dead and their mother wasnt making the slightest move to claim them well at least they werent the only ones with that worry he thought for it was only a matter of time before kaveh got both the word and the boot and then it would be out on the street for him find a new place to live and a new dick to fuck you go back to whatever hole youd been living in when dad first found you kaveh my man tim could hardly wait for that moment and he wasnt the only one as things turned out that morning old george cowley had waylaid kaveh on his way to the car with gracie in tow cowley looked like shit from what tim could see from his bedroom window but cowley always looked like shit so it didnt mean much to see him with his braces forgotten and his fly so undone that part of his shirt was hanging out of it like a tattersall flag he mustve seen kaveh and gracie from the window of his hovel and come running to have it out with the bloke tim couldnt hear what they were saying but he reckoned he knew the topic well enough for cowley hitched up his sagging trousers and adopted a posture that suggested a confrontation was in the offing if that was the case there was only one reason for confronting kaveh about anything cowley wanted to know when kaveh was planning to vacate the premises he wanted to know when bryan beck farm was going on to the block outside gracie had her rucksack at her feet and was waiting for kaveh to unlock the car door for her she was pingponging her gaze between kaveh and cowley and tim could see from her expression that she was scared gracie scared created a twinge in tim suggesting he ought to go outside and see if there was something he could do to come between cowley and kaveh or at least to get gracie away from them but doing that would bring himself to the closer attention of kaveh who might then tell him to get himself ready to be carted down to margaret fox school and that was the last thing he wanted since he had things to do today tim turned from the window and crossed the room to his bed he threw himself down on it he was waiting for the sound of kavehs car which would indicate that tim was finally alone for the day when he heard its muted roar kaveh was always too heavy on the accelerator as if he thought the engine needed to be thoroughly flooded before putting the car into gear tim reached for his mobile he began to punch in the number so yesterday had been a waste hed flipped out with cousin manette and that was bad what was good in the bad was that hed not gone so far as to hurt her seriously hed come to his senses right at the moment he was about to fall upon her and choke the bloody life out of her and enjoy doing it just to get her to stop being so fucking concerned about him his vision had gone black and he couldnt even see the stupid cow on the ground in front of him hed dropped to his knees then and had beaten his fists on the wooden jetty instead of on her and damn it all if she hadnt rolled over and pulled him to her and tried to soothe him tim didnt know where his fathers cousin had developed her skill in the turntheothercheek department her ability to forgive and forget was a strong indication that she had more than one screw loose in a place where screws didnt belong at all at any rate getting into windermere had been out of the question tim had done his part and sobbed awhile then he finally calmed down there they remained on the jetty dock for a good thirty minutes with cousin manette holding him and murmuring about things being fine and all right and you and me will go camping up scout scar just you wait and see and then who knows what will happen maybe your dad will come back to life like anyone really wanted him to and maybe your mum will develop a different personality which was just as unlikely whatever tim thought who bloody cared anyway the important thing was not to have to spend the night in great urswick and hed managed that where r u he thumbed into the mobile day ok he added there was no reply couldnt was his second message no ride w there was no need to add the information about manette her tent and all the rest the fact was hed not had a way to get to windermere once manette had carted him to great urswick and it would have taken him hours to thumb it there was still no reply tim waited his gut started to feel like there was actually bad food inside of it as hed claimed and he swallowed a lump of desperation no he told himself immediately he wasnt desperate he wasnt anything he rolled off the bed tossing the mobile on the bedside table he went to his laptop and accessed his email no message it was he decided time to push matters along no way in hell was anyone walking away from a bargain tim had struck hed kept his half of it and it was time the other half was kept as well lake windermere cumbria lynley had rooted a small pocket torch from the glove box of the healey elliott and he was walking down to the boathouse for a closer look at the dock when his mobile rang it was isabelle he saw her first words to him were tommy i need you in london logically he thought something had come up which was what he asked her she said im not talking about professional need there are certain actions i dont want another member of the team to engage in for me he smiled at that well thats good to hear i didnt much fancy sharing you with di stewart dont push your luck when will you be back he looked out at the lake hed come through the plantation of poplars and he stood on the path with the morning sun falling on his shoulders it was looking like a very fine day for a moment he gave casual thought to what it would be like to be sharing the day with isabelle he said i dont know actually ive only just got started what about a brief encounter im missing you and i dont like to miss you when i miss you you start preying on my mind i cant have that and do my job properly a brief encounter would solve that for you it would i have no defence to offer i enjoy you in bed at least youre forthright and i always will be so have you the time i can come to you this afternoon she paused and he pictured her checking her diary for a time when she went on he knew hed been right round half past three she added can you free yourself then im not near london im afraid really where are you isabelle he wondered if shed been trying to trick him dangling the prospect of sex to divert him first and then sweeping in for an inadvertent admission on his part regarding his location you know i cant say i know youve been instructed by hillier to keep your mouth shut i wouldnt expect that to apply to me would it have applied she stopped herself she said never mind and that told him what shed been on the edge of asking would it have applied to your wife but she wouldnt say that they never mentioned helen because to mention helen ran the risk of taking their relationship in a direction that led from the purely sexual to an area shed indicated from the first she had no intention of going at any rate this is ridiculous she said what does hillier think im going to do with the information i dont expect its personal he said i mean the fact that he doesnt want you to know he doesnt want anyone to know to be honest i never thought to ask him why that doesnt seem like you did you want to leave london for some reason and then quickly never mind this is the sort of conversation that can get us in trouble ill speak to you later tommy she rang off he was left with the mobile in his hand he put it back in his pocket and continued to the boathouse best to keep his mind in the here and now he thought isabelle was right about conversations that could muddy the waters of what was going on between them the boathouse he found was kept unlocked the time of day made its interior darker than it had been on lynleys previous visit so he was glad hed brought the torch and he switched it on it was quite cool within the result of the water the stones and the time of year the air bore the tang of damp wood and algae he worked his way round to the spot where ian cresswells scull was tied there he knelt he used the torchs light against the edges of the stones that formed three sides of the gap remaining when the other two had gone into the water there was little enough to see mortar was a rough surface anyway and years of wear and usage had caused cracks gouges and splintered edges in more spots than just this one place but what he was looking for was an indication of some tool used to ease the process of disintegration along a chisel perhaps a screwdriver a wedge anything would have done the job anything would also have left a mark he could see nothing he realised that a closer examination under full light was going to be necessary rather hard to pull off if the pretence he was merely a visitor was to be maintained he also realised that his previous conclusion about the missing stones was now confirmed they had to get them up and out of the water the prospect wasnt a pleasant one the water wasnt deep but it would be frigid he switched off the torch and left the boathouse he paused and looked out at the lake no one was on it and its surface was a perfect plane that reflected the glowing autumnal trees on its shoreline and above them the cloudless sky he turned from this view and looked in the direction of the house it was not visible from where he stood although anyone on the path through the plantation of poplars could easily see it there was however another spot from which the boathouse could probably be seen the top floor and roof of a square tower rose above a rise of land just south of the poplars this was the folly where mignon fairclough lived shed not turned up to dinner on the previous night perhaps she wouldnt mind a morning call upon her now the folly was a duplication of the defensive pele towers in the district it was the sort of structure people had once added to their properties to give them a bit of faux history although in the case of ireleth hall faux history had hardly been necessary nonetheless at some point in time the folly had been constructed and now it stood four floors tall with a crenellated roof that suggested access was available at that level as well and from the roof the view would be all encompassing lynley reckoned one would be able to see ireleth hall the drive up to it its grounds and the lake as well as the boathouse when he knocked on the door he heard a woman call out from inside what what in some exasperation he reckoned he was disturbing mignon in the midst of whatever it was that she did he hadnt yet learned her occupation and he called out miss fairclough sorry am i disturbing you her answer sounded surprised oh i thought it was mother again and in a few moments the door swung open to reveal one of bernard faircloughs twin daughters she was supporting herself on a zimmer frame a woman whod taken her diminutive height from her father and not her mother she was swathed in various robes and gowns that gave her a bit of an artistic flair at the same time as effectively shrouding her body she was also lynley noted fully made up as if planning to go out sometime during the day shed done her hair as well but shed chosen a rather childlike style it was held off her face like alice in wonderland with a band of blue ribbon although unlike alices its colour was dull brown and not blond she said youre the londoner i take it whatre you doing prowling round this morning i saw you down at the boathouse again did you lynley wondered how shed managed that three flights of stairs with a zimmer frame he also wondered why shed managed it i was getting some air he said i saw the tower from the boathouse and came to introduce myself i expected to meet you at dinner last night not up to it im afraid she said still recovering from a bit of surgery she looked him over and made no effort to hide her inspection he thought she was about to say youll do or ask him to open his mouth for a look at his teeth but instead she said you may as well come in am i disturbing you i was online but it can wait she stepped back from the door once inside he could see the entire ground floor at a glance it comprised a sitting room a kitchen and an area for mignons computer it also seemed to be acting as a storage facility for boxes upon boxes stacked in virtually every open area upon the floor they were sealed and at first he thought she might be in the process of moving house till a glance told him they were all packages addressed to her with packing slips encased in plastic upon them the computer he saw was on the screen of its monitor was lit and the format told him shed been in the midst of reading and responding to emails she saw the direction of his glance and said virtual living i find it vastly preferable to the real thing a modernday version of pen pals lord no im having quite a torrid affair with a gentleman in the seychelles at least thats where he says hes from he also says hes married and a teacher in a deadend job poor bloke went there for a sense of adventure and ended up finding the only adventure available was on the internet she smiled briefly and insincerely of course he could be lying about everything since as far as he knows im a fashion designer terribly busy with getting ready for my next catwalk show last time i was a missionary physician doing noble work in rwanda and before that let me see oh yes i was an abused housewife seeking someone to understand my plight as i said its virtual living anything is possible its open season on the truth cant that sort of thing backfire thats half the fun but im careful and once they start talking about getting together in one port or another i end it with a bang she moved towards the kitchen going on to say i should offer you coffee or something ive only the instant kind im afraid would you like a cup or tea ive only bags i could do you a cup of either coffee is fine but i hate to trouble you do you indeed how wellbred of you to say so she was out of his line of vision in the kitchen banging about so he took the opportunity to look round the place aside from the plethora of boxes there was unwashed crockery on most available surfaces the plates and bowls looked to have been there for some time because when he lifted one it left a perfect ring beneath it that was untroubled by the dust that formed a fine down elsewhere he moved closer to the computer she hadnt been lying he saw at a glance god how i know what you mean she had written there are times when life gets in the way of whats really important in my case we used to do it every night and now im lucky for once a month but you should talk to her about it really of course i say that and dont myself talk to james how i wish but never mind what i wish cant happen if only though weve advanced to the point of revealing our miserable marriages mignon said behind him really its incredible the process is always exactly the same you think someone along the line would have a bit of imagination when theyre setting about seduction but they never do ive got the kettle on coffeell be just a minute ill need you to carry your own cup lynley joined her in the kitchen it was tiny but kitted out with everything one would need he saw she would have to do some washing up soon however there were very few plates left and she was using the last available mug for his coffee she was having nothing herself he said wouldnt you prefer a real relationship she eyed him like my parents perhaps he lifted an eyebrow they seem quite devoted oh yes they are perfectly devoted entirely compatible and everything else that goes along with it just look at them billing and cooing did they do that bit for you im not sure id recognise a bill or a coo well if they didnt engage in a few rounds of it yesterday theyll show you today im sure watch for an exchange of looks suggesting deep waters theyre good at that all form and no substance i didnt say that devoted was what i said theyre devoted and compatible with all the trimmings i think its to do with the fact that my fathers rarely here its quite perfect for them both well for him at least as for mother she doesnt complain and why should she as long as she can fish go to lunch with friends manage my life and spend vast amounts of her money on the gardens i expect her existence is fine and it is her money not dads by the way but hes never minded that as long as he has free use of it not what i would want in a marriage but as i dont want a marriage at all who am i to judge theirs the water came to a boil and the kettle clicked off mignon set about the exercise of making him a cup of coffee although she didnt bother to do it deftly she spooned in a heap of the instant powder leaving a trail of it between jar and mug and when she stirred it the liquid slopped over the edge of the mug and onto the worktop she used the same spoon to dig into a sugar bowl did a bit more slopping added milk and slopped some more she handed over the mug without wiping off the excess coffee and said in what lynley judged the understatement of the year sorry im not at all domestic nor am i he responded thank you she hobbled back to the sitting room tossing over her shoulder what sort of car is that by the way car that amazing thing youre driving i saw it when you arrived yesterday quite stylish but it must absolutely swill petrol like a camel at the oasis healey elliott he told her never heard of it she found a chair unburdened by magazines and boxes she deposited herself into it with a thud and said to him find a spot move anything it hardly matters and as he was searching for a place to sit so what were you doing at the boathouse i saw you there yesterday with my father whats the attraction he made a note about being more careful in his movements it was appearing that aside from occupying herself with the internet mignon spent her time in observation of what was going on round the property he said id thought about taking that scull out on the lake but my natural bent towards sloth got the better of me just as well she jerked her head in the general direction of the boathouse last person who used it drowned i reckoned you were tiptoeing down there to have a look at the scene of the crime she chuckled grimly crime he took a sip of the coffee it was ghastly my cousin ian surely youve been informed no she told him much of what he already knew as blithely as shed told him everything else he wondered about her general frankness of conversation in his experience such commitment to ostensible veracity hid in reality a wealth of information ian cresswell had definitely been murdered as far as mignon was concerned her reasoning was that as far as she knew people rarely died just because someone else wished them to to his raised eyebrow upon hearing this she went on her brother nicholas had had to stumble along in cousin ians sainted footsteps for most of his life from the moment dear ian had arrived from kenya to take up residence with the fairclough family upon the death of his mother it had been ian this and ian that and why cant you be more like ian firstclass pupil at st bees he was firstclass athlete firstclass nephew to his uncle bernard shining star blueeyed boy never put so much as a toenail wrong i reckoned when he dumped his family and took up with kaveh that would open dads eyes to our darling ian im sure nicky felt the same but even deserting his family didnt do it and now kavehs working for my mother and who orchestrated that if not ian hmm no nothing poor nickys done in his life has been enough to shine a light on him that was brighter than the light shone on ian and nothing ian did dimmed his own light in my fathers eyes it does make one wonder about all sorts of delicious things her face wore an illsaynomore expression saintly and pleased simultaneously so nicholas killed him lynley enquired i assume he stood to gain somehow as to the killing part personally i wouldnt be the least surprised as to the gaining lord knows she also seemed to be saying she wouldnt much blame nicholas for anything that might have happened to ian cresswell and this along with her remarks about the man himself was something that bore looking into as did lynley thought the terms of cresswells will he said it does seem a risky way to go about killing him though wouldnt you say why i understand your mother uses the boathouse nearly every day mignon straightened in her chair receiving this news she said and youre implying that your mother might have been a target for murder assuming in the first place that someone was targeted for murder at all no one would be the least interested in seeing my mother die mignon declared she felt the need apparently to tick off on her fingers every person devoted to her mother and topping the list was her father again and all those claims of his devotion to valerie lynley thought of hamlet and ladies protesting too much he also thought of rich people and what they did with their money and how money bought everything from unwilling silence to reluctant cooperation but all of this begged the question of what bernard fairclough had then intended by coming to london and requesting someone to look into the death of his nephew too clever by half came to mind lynley just wasnt certain where the expression ought to be applied grangeoversands cumbria manette fairclough mcghie had long believed there was no one on earth more manipulative than her own sister but now she had other ideas mignon had used a simple accident at launchy gill to control their parents for more than thirty years slip on the boulders too near the waterfall knock your head sustain a skull fracture and my god youd think the world had ended but really mignon was nothing at all in comparison to niamh cresswell mignon used peoples guilt fear and anxiety to get what she wanted but niamh used her own children and this manette decided was going to stop so she took the day off from work she had a good reason being bruised and sore from tims attack on her on the previous afternoon but even had he not kicked her kidneys and her spine so savagely she would have come up with something fourteenyearold boys did not behave as tim was behaving without good reason shed known of course that something more serious than confusion over his fathers life choices was behind tims attack on her as well as his placement in margaret fox school she just hadnt known the reason was his own miserable excuse for a mother niamhs home was just outside of grangeoversands some distance from great urswick it was part of a neat and newish housing estate that curled down a hillside overlooking an estuary in morecambe bay the houses here reflected someones taste for things mediterranean they were uniformly a blinding white uniformly trimmed in dark blue with uniformly simple front gardens heavily given to gravel and shrubbery they were of various sizes and true to form niamh possessed the largest of them with the best view of the estuary and the wintering birds who domiciled there this was the home to which niamh had decamped upon ians desertion of his family manette knew from talking to ian after the divorce that niamh had been adamant about moving house well who could blame her really manette had thought at the time the memories within the former home would have been painful and the woman had two children to care for in the aftermath of the nuclear explosion that had occurred in the centre of her family shed have wanted something nice at least to help cushion the blow of such a transition in tim and gracies lives that conclusion of manettes however existed before she had learned that tim and gracie werent living with their mother at all but rather with their father and his lover shed adjusted her thinking to what the hell is going on ultimately letting the question go when ian had told her it was what he wanted as well having his children with him upon ians death manette had thought that niamh would naturally have taken the children home with her that she had evidently not done so brought up what the hell is going on once again this time she intended to have the question answered niamhs estate car was in front of the house and she came at once to the door when manette knocked her expression was expectant but this expression altered when she saw that her caller was manette had niamh not been wearing enough scent to knock over a pony as well as a hotpink cocktail dress showing a copious amount of cleavage that altered expression alone would have told manette someone else was due to arrive quite soon niamh said manette as a means of greeting she did not step back from the doorway in unspoken welcome no matter manette thought she stepped forward giving niamh no choice but to go chesttochest with her or to move out of the way niamh chose the latter option although she did not close the door behind them as she followed manette into the body of the house manette made for the sitting room with its broad windows overlooking the estuary she gave a passing glance to the mass of arnside knot far across the bay and passing thought to the fact that with a powerful enough telescope one would have been able to see not only where the trees of the knot opened up to the crown of bare land and a few windscarred conifers at its summit but also lower down the hill and into her brother nicolass sitting room she turned and faced niamh the other woman was watching her but oddly her glance shifted several times from manette to the doorway leading into the kitchen it was as if someone was hiding in there which hardly made sense considering niamhs previous look of expectation so manette said i could do with a coffee mind if i and strode in that direction niamh said manette what do you want i would have appreciated a phone call to tell me but manette was in the kitchen at that point putting on the kettle as if she lived here on the worktop she saw the reason for niamhs shifty eyes a bright red tin bucket stood upon it filled with a variety of items a black sticker with white letters formed a flag on the bucket and bucket of love was printed across this that this intriguing object had just arrived by post was indicated by an open box on the worktop as well it took no advanced degree in human sexuality to understand that the buckets contents constituted a variety of suggestive toys meant to be used by a couple looking for spice to add to their sex life very interesting manette thought niamh pushed past her snatched up the bucket of love and replaced it in the box she said fine now what do you want and ill make the coffee if its quite all right with you she fetched a cafetiere which she slammed onto the worktop she did the same with a small bag of coffee and a mug with ive been to blackpool fading round its middle ive come about the children manette said there was no point in preliminaries that she could see why arent they back with you yet niamh i dont see that its any of your business did timothy tell you something yesterday tim attacked me yesterday i think you and i can agree thats hardly normal behaviour for a fourteenyearold boy ah so thats what this is about well you wanted to fetch him from school it didnt work out how awful for you niamh said this last in a tone that indicated tims attack upon manette had been nothing of the sort she spooned coffee into the cafetiere and fetched milk from the fridge she said but you cant be that surprised manette hes in margaret fox school for a reason and we both know what that reason is manette replied what the hell is going on whats going on as you put it is the fact that timothys behaviour hasnt been normal as you also put it for quite some time i expect you can work out why god manette thought it was going to be the same song and dance as it always was with niamh tims birthday and the surprise guest showing up wonderful moment to learn ones father has a lover of the same sex or of any sex manette wanted to strangle niamh how much more mileage was the bloody woman intending to get from what ian and kaveh had done manette said it wasnt tims fault niamh to which she added and do not attempt to derail this conversation in your usual fashion all right that may have worked with ian but i assure you its not going to work with me frankly i dont wish to talk about ian youve no worry on that score what a laugh manette thought this would be an exciting change in her cousins wife since ian and his outrage against her had been the sole subject of niamhs conversation for the last year well she was going to take niamh at her word she was here to talk about tim anyway she said excellent ive no wish to talk about ian either really niamh examined her fingernails which were perfectly groomed like the rest of her now thats a change i thought ian was one of your favourite topics what are you talking about please you may have been trying to hide it all these years but it was never a secret to me that you wanted him ian if he left me you assumed it would be for you really manette by all accounts you should be as enraged as i am that he chose kaveh as his next lifes partner god god god manette thought niamh had actually managed to slither away from the subject of tim as smoothly as if shed been oiled she said oh stop it i can see what youre doing its not going to work im not leaving till we talk about tim now you can have that conversation with me or we can play cat and mouse for the rest of the day but something with a meaningful glance at the box containing the bucket of love tells me youd like me to make myself scarce and thats not going to happen simply because you manage to raise my ire niamh said nothing to this she was saved by the bell of coffee making the electric kettle clicked off and she busied herself with filling the cafetiere and stirring the grounds manette said tims a day pupil at margaret fox school hes not a boarder hes meant to come home at night to his parents but hes still going home to kaveh mehran not to you whats that supposed to be doing for his mental state whats what doing to his mental state manette niamh turned from the coffee the fact that hes going home to ians precious kaveh or going home at all instead of staying there in lockdown like a criminal home is here not in bryanbarrow you know that very well if you could have seen the state he was in yesterday god in heaven whats wrong with you this is your son why havent you moved him home why havent you moved gracie home are you punishing them for some reason is this some sort of game youre playing with their lives what do you know about their lives what have you ever known youve only been involved with them when youve been involved at all because of ian dear beloved sainted ian who can do no wrong to any bloody fairclough even your father took his side when he left me your father ian with a halo on his head walks out of that door handinhand or should i say handonarse with some some some arab barely out of nappies and your father does nothing none of you do and now hes working for your mother as if he did absolutely nothing at all to destroy my life and you accuse me of playing games you question what im doing when the lot of you did nothing at all to make ian come home where he belonged where his duty was where his children were where i i she grabbed a kitchen towel because the tears that had come to her eyes were threatening to spill over she caught them before they damaged her eyeliner or made a streak through her makeup this done she threw the kitchen towel in the rubbish and drove the palm of her hand down upon the cafetiere separating the coffee from its grounds and putting a full stop to her own remarks manette watched her for the first time things were becoming clear she said youre not bringing them home are you youre intending kaveh to keep them why drink your bloody coffee and leave niamh replied not till we get things perfectly clear not till i understand every nuance of what you have in mind ians dead so thats ticked off your list now its kaveh kavehs not too likely to die though unless you kill him manettes words halted of their own accord she and niamh were left staring at each other niamh turned away first leave she said just go leave what about tim what about gracie what happens to them nothing which means you leave them with kaveh until someone forces your hand legally or otherwise you leave them in bryanbarrow permanently so kaveh gets the full experience of what he destroyed those two children who are by the way perfectly innocent in this entire matter dont be so certain of that what are you claiming now that tim my god you get worse and worse there was manette knew no further point in their conversation coffee be damned she began to head towards the front door and she was nearly there when footsteps came up the two exterior steps and someone called out nee pet wheres my girl a man stood at the door a pot of chrysanthemums in his hands and on his face a look of such eagerness that manette knew she was looking at the sender of the bucket of love he was there to play with its contents she reckoned a slight sheen of anticipation glistened on his pudgy face he said oh and looked over his shoulder as if thinking hed come to the wrong house then over manettes shoulder niamh said come in charlie manette is just leaving charlie he looked vaguely familiar manette couldnt place him however till he nodded at her nervously and passed her in the doorway his proximity brought his scent quite close and the scent was cooking oils and something else at first manette thought of fish and chips but then she realised he was the owner of one of the three chinese takeaways in the market square in milnthorpe shed been in there more than once on her way home from arnside and nicholass house scoring a meal for freddie shed never seen this man out of his kitchen uniform spattered with grease and copious amounts of soy sauce but here he was eager to do a job that didnt at all involve slopping chop suey into takeaway cartons as he entered the house he said you look good enough to eat to niamh she giggled hope so have you brought your appetite both of them laughed the door closed on them allowing them to get down to business manette felt white heat wash over her something she decided would have to be done about her cousin ians wife she was wise enough to understand however that it might well be a leavehertogod situation completely beyond her powers to effect but what she could effect was a change in tim and gracies lives and that was something she could see to herself windermere cumbria getting possession of the forensic reports had not been a difficult matter and this ease of acquisition had been largely due to st jamess reputation as an expert witness there was of course no actual need for his expertise in this matter because the ruling had already been made by the coroner but a phone call and a spurious tale about a university presentation on basic forensics had been enough to put all the relevant documents into his hands these confirmed what lynley had told him about the death of ian cresswell with a few additional salient details the man had suffered a severe blow to the head in the near region of the left temple which had been enough to render him unconscious and fracture his skull the apparent source of the blow was the stone dock and although his body had been in the water for approximately nineteen hours when it had been found it had at least according to the forensic report still been possible to make a comparison between the wound on his head and the shape of the stone that he had ostensibly hit on the dock before tumbling into the water st james frowned he wondered how this was possible nineteen hours in the water would do much to alter the inflicted wound making information about it useless unless some sort of reconstruction had been managed he looked for this but he didnt see one he made a note and continued reading death had been by drowning as an examination of the lungs had confirmed bruising on the right leg suggested that cresswells foot may have become caught in the sculls stretcher as he lost his balance capsizing the craft and holding the victim beneath the water for a time until perhaps due to the gentle action of the lake over the hours his foot had ultimately become dislodged and his body had floated freely next to the dock toxicology showed nothing unusual blood alcohol indicated that hed been drinking but he was not drunk everything else in the report indicated that he was a fine specimen of a man in the range of forty to fortyfive years in perfect health and superb physical condition since it had been an unwitnessed drowning a coroners ruling had been required this had necessitated an inquest preceded by an investigation by the coroners officers they had testified at the inquest as had valerie fairclough the forensic pathologist the first policeman on the scene and the subsequent officer called in to confirm the first policemans conclusion that no soco were needed as no crime had occurred the end product of all this was the ruling of death by accidental drowning as far as st james could see there was nothing untoward in any of this however if mistakes had been made theyd been made at the initial stage of the process and that was with the first policeman on the scene a conversation with this police constable was in order this demanded a trip to windermere from where the officer had originally come the mans name was pc william schlicht and from the look of him when he came into reception at the windermere station to meet st james he was fresh out of the nearest training facility this would explain why hed called in another officer to confirm what hed concluded it had likely been the first death scene pc schlicht had encountered and he wouldnt have wanted to start his career off with a gross error aside from that the death had occurred on the estate of a wellknown and semipublic figure the newspapers in the area would have found this of interest and the pc would know that eyes were upon him schlicht was a slight man but he was also wiry and athletic in appearance and his uniform looked as if he starched and ironed it every morning as well as polished its buttons he seemed to be in his early twenties and his expression was one of a man extremely eager to please not the best attitude in a policeman st james thought it put one in the position of being easily manipulated by outside forces a course youre teaching pc schlicht said after their exchange of greetings hed taken st james beyond reception into the station itself and he led him to a coffee roomlunch room where a refrigerator bore a sign reading put your name on your lunch bag and an old coffeemaker circa was sending forth an odour reminiscent of coal mines in the nineteenth century schlicht had been in the midst of eating what looked like leftover chicken pie from a plastic container a smaller pot of raspberry fool sat next to this awaiting consumption as his dessert st james made the appropriate noises of agreement upon the mention of the putative course he lectured frequently at university college london should pc schlicht wish to do some checking up on him everything he was claiming about his visit to cumbria was verifiable st james told the pc to go on with his lunch please as he merely wished to confirm a few details i reckon someone like you would look for a fancier case to pre sent in a lecture if you know what i mean schlicht lifted a leg over the seat of his chair to sit he scooped up his cutlery and tucked back into his meal the cresswell situation was a straightforward business from the start you must have had one or two doubts though st james said since you called in another officer oh that schlicht waved his fork in acknowledgement he then confirmed what st james had suspected it had been his first death scene he didnt want a blot on his copy book and the family was quite wellknown in the area he added not to mention rich as the dickens if you know what i mean and he grinned as if the wealth of the faircloughs demanded that a certain conclusion was in order from the local police st james said nothing merely looking questioning schlicht said the rich have their ways you know not like you and me they are you take my wife she finds a body in our boathouse not that we have a boathouse in the first place mind you and let me tell you shed be screaming down the walls and running in circles and no phone call to nineninenine she made would even be understandable if you get my meaning that one by whom st james concluded he was referring to valerie fairclough is cool as cream there appears to be a dead man floating in my boathouse is how she puts it cording to the dispatch bloke who phoned up the station and she goes right on to give the address without being asked which is a bit odd cause youd think under the circumstances shed need to be asked or reminded or something and when i get there shes not waiting on the drive or pacing in the garden or tapping her toe on the front steps or anything youd expect in such a situation is she no shes inside the house and she comes out dressed like shes going to some posh afternoon tea or something and i wonder i do what she went down to the boathouse for in the first place dressed like that she tells me straightaway and without my asking that she was down there to go out on the lake and do a bit of fishing dressed like that mind you she says she does it all the time two three perhaps four times a week all hours it doesnt matter to her she likes to be out on the water she says she says she didnt expect to find a body floating there and she knows who it is her husbands nephew she takes me down there to have a look were walking on our way when the ambulance shows up and she waits for them to join us she knew then for a certainty that the man in the water was dead schlicht paused fork midflight to his lips she did that course he was floating facedown and hed been in the water a good long while those clothes of hers though they do say something dont they still schlicht said it was cutanddried as far as he could tell when they got to the boathouse despite any oddity in valerie faircloughs attire and behaviour the scull was capsized the body was floating next to it and the condition of the dock with its missing stones told the tale of what had happened nonetheless he put in a call for a di to have a look just to be on the safe side of things and the di in question a woman called dankanics came along had a look and agreed with how all evidence seemed to schlicht the rest had been more or less routine filling out paperwork making reports showing up at the inquest et cetera did di dankanics go over the scene with you right she had a look we all did all ambulance crew mrs fairclough the daughter daughter where was she this was odd the scene should have been secured that it had not been was highly irregular and st james wondered if this irregularity was the result of schlichts inexperience di dankanicss possible indifference or something else dont know exactly where she was when she saw the commotion schlicht replied but what brought her down to the boathouse was the noise the ambulance had its siren going all the way to the house those blokes like their siren like i like my dog let me tell you and she heard it and came along with her zimmer disabled is she looks that way so that was that the body got carted off for autopsy di dankanics and i took statements and he frowned yes sorry id forgotten the boyfriend boyfriend turns out the dead bloke was a poofter his partner was working on the property not at that exact moment mind you but he came driving in as the ambulance was driving out course he wanted to know what was going on who wouldnt human nature eh and mrs fairclough told him took him to one side and had a word and down he goes he fainted faceflat onto the gravel we didnt know who he was at first and the fainting bit seemed offkilter for some bloke just driving up to the house and hearing theres been a drowning so we asked who he was and she told us this is valerie that this bloke did landscapes and the like and the other bloke the dead one in the boathouse was his partner partner as in partner if you take my meaning anyway he came round soon enough and he starts blubbing he says its his fault the other bloke drowned which we take up with some interest this is me and dankanics but it turns out theyd had words on the previous evening about tying the knot the dead bloke had wanted a civil ceremony with everything front and centre and all aboveboard while the living bloke liked things as they were and christ if that bloke wasnt howling his head off makes you wonder if you know what i mean st james didnt exactly although like alice he was finding the information curiouser and curiouser he said as to the boathouse itself hmm was everything in order aside from the missing stones on the dock of course far as mrs fairclough could tell what about the boats themselves they were all inside as usual schlicht knotted his eyebrows hed finished with his chicken pie and was prising the lid from the raspberry fool not sure i receive your meaning were the boats always kept in the order they were in when you saw the body or was that order arbitrary schlichts lips rounded into a whistle but he made no sound he also gave no reply for a moment but st james could tell that in spite of his informal manner of address he was not a fool thats something he said that we didnt ask bloody hell mr st james i hope it doesnt mean what i think it means for an arbitrary order suggested a likely accident anything else suggested murder middlebarrow farm cumbria the middlebarrow pele project was situated to the east of the hill that comprised arnside wood which gave entrance to a protected area called arnside knot deborah st james and nicholas fairclough skirted this hill on the way to the project curving through the upper part of arnside village and then down again following signs that directed them towards a place called silverdale as they drove nicholas fairclough chatted in what seemed to deborah to be a habitually friendly manner he appeared open and forthright the least likely individual to have planned the murder of his own cousin had it actually been a murder he made no mention of ian cresswells death of course the drowning of the man as unfortunate as it was bore no relationship to the ostensible reasons for deborahs visit to this place she wasnt sure she was meant to keep it this way however it seemed to her that one way or another she had to bring cresswell into the picture this wasnt her forte chatting up people in general was difficult for her although shed improved over the years since shed learned the value of having her photographic subjects relax while she snapped their pictures but that kind of chatting up was at least honest in its own way this brand of chatting up when she was pretending to be someone she utterly was not left her in a quandary luckily nicholas didnt appear to notice he was too intent upon reassuring her of his wifes support of the work he was doing shell be standoffish till you get to know her he told deborah as they zipped along the narrow road its her nature youre not to take it personally allie doesnt trust people much as a rule its to do with her family he cast her a smile he had an oddly youthful face like a boys when he hasnt come into his manhood yet and deborah reckoned hed remain young looking right to the grave some people were lucky that way her dads the mayor of the town she was born in in argentina hes been mayor for years so she grew up in the spotlight there and she had to learn to monitor everything she did so she always thinks someones watching her to catch her out doing i dont know what anyway it makes her skittish at first everyone has to earn her trust shes quite attractive isnt she deborah said i expect that could be a problem for someone in the limelight even in a small town all eyes on her if you know what i mean where in argentina is she from santa maria di something i always forget its about ten words long its in the foothills of wherever sorry all the spanish names flummox me im completely hopeless with languages i can barely speak english anyway she doesnt like the place she says it felt like an outpost on the moon i expect its not that big eh she ran off from home when she was something like fifteen years old she made it up with her family after a bit but she never went back her family must miss her that he said i wouldnt know although i expect they would do wouldnt they youve not met them then they didnt attend your wedding actually there wasnt much of a wedding just allie and me and city hall in salt lake city someone to do the ceremony and two women we carted in off the street to be witnesses afterwards allie wrote to tell her parents wed done the deed but they didnt write back theyre cheesed off about it i expect but theyll come round people always do especially he grinned when theres a grandchild on the way that explained the magazine shed seen conception with its countless stories on antenatal this and postnatal that youre expecting congrat not yet but any day now he tapped his fingers a bit on the steering wheel im very lucky he said then he pointed out an autumnal woodland to the east of the road on which they were driving a rich panoply of umber and gold deciduous trees contrasting against the green of conifers middlebarrow wood he told her you can see the pele tower from here he pulled into a layby to give her a view the tower deborah saw was on a rise of land that looked rather like the prehistoric barrows one found all round the countryside in england behind this rise the woods began although the tower itself was out in the open this would have given it a superior position should any border reivers have come calling a regular occurrence during the centuries when the border between england and scotland continually shifted the intent of the reivers was always the same they were marauders who had taken advantage of the lawlessness of that period of time perfecting the art of stealing cattle and oxen invading homes and stripping their victims of everything they owned their objective was always plunder and getting back to their own homes without being killed in the process if they themselves had to kill to accomplish this they did so but that hadnt been their first priority the pele towers had been an answer to the question of protection from the reivers the best of them were indestructible with stone walls far too thick to be harmed and windows just wide enough for an archer to fire from and separate floors for animals their owners their household activities and their defence but the towers had fallen out of use as time went on after the border was finally firmly established along with laws and the advent of lawmen willing to make those laws more than someones passing fancy once the towers fell out of use their materials were employed for other buildings or the towers themselves were subsumed into larger structures becoming part of a great house a vicarage or a school middlebarrow tower was of the first type it stood tall with most of its windows intact a short distance from it and across a field a group of old farm buildings gave testimony to what some of the towers original stones had been used for between the tower and these farm buildings a camp had been set up it was equipped with small tents honey pots and several makeshift sheds with a larger tent to accommodate the twelvestep programme nicholas fairclough said this was also the dining tent meals and twelvestepping went hand in hand nicholas pulled back into the road which descended to a lane leading off towards the tower the tower he said was on the private land of middlebarrow farm hed got the farmer to consent to the project not to mention to consent to the presence of the recovering addicts who were currently living and working there once he saw the benefits of a restored tower that could be used as anything from a holiday rental to a tourist attraction hes settled on turning the place into a camping site nicholas told her itll bring him some extra money during the season and hes happy enough to put up with us if thats the end product that was allies idea by the way approaching the farmer with the possibilities for the tower if hed let us renovate it she was involved with the pele project in its initial stages but not now she likes to be in the background plus well i daresay when the addicts began to arrive she was a bit more comfortable being at home than hanging about here they pulled onto the site where work was in progress and nicholas added no need to be wary though these blokes are far too used up and far too ready for a change in their lives to be harmful to anyone but they were not deborah found far too used up to work a team leader had been assigned to the project and when nicholas introduced him as dave k its traditional not to use surnames he told her it was clear that work leading to hunger leading to meals leading to twelvestepping and then to sleep was the order of the day dave k had a roll of plans with him and he unscrolled them on the bonnet of nicholas faircloughs car with a nod at deborah meant she assumed to convey acknowledgement of the introduction he lit a cigarette and used it as a pointer as he spoke to nicholas about the project deborah wandered from the car the tower she saw was huge a bulky mass of a building that looked like the makings of a norman castle complete with crenellation upon a casual glance it didnt appear in need of a great deal of restoration but when deborah walked round the other side of the structure she saw what had become of it during the centuries it had lain available for anyone to maraud upon it the project was going to be enormous deborah couldnt think how they were going to manage the scope of work needing to be done there were no floors to the building one of the four external walls was missing and another wall was partially collapsed removing debris alone was going to take ages and then there was the not small matter of obtaining materials to replace those that had long ago been carted off to become part of other buildings in the district she gazed upon it with a photographers eye in the same fashion she examined the men who were working there most of whom seemed to be the age of pensioners she didnt have any of her cameras with her aside from a small digital one to keep her position as a filmmakers research scout on the upandup she took this from her bag and applied herself to recording what was round her its really the act of creation that heals the process not product i mean of course at first they focus on the product thats human nature but in the end theyll come to see that the real product is selfbelief selfesteem selfknowledge whatever you want to call it deborah turned nicholas fairclough had come up beside her she said to be honest your workers dont look strong enough to do much mr fairclough why are there no younger men to help them because these are the blokes who need saving the most here and now if someone doesnt reach out to them theyre going to die on the streets in the next couple of years my thinking is that no one deserves to die like that therere programmes all over the country all over the world for young people and believe me i know because i spent time in a lot of them but for blokes like this shelters for the night sandwiches hot soup bibles blankets whatever but not belief theyre not so far gone that they cant read pity at fifty yards feel that way towards them and theyll take your money use it to get high and spit on your charity scuse me for a moment okay have a look round if you like i need to talk to one of them deborah watched as he picked his way through the rubble he yelled hey joe what dwe hear from that stone mason deborah wandered in the direction of the large tent identified by a sign in front of it reading eat and meet inside a bearded man in a knitted cap and heavy coat too heavy for the weather but he seemed to have no body fat at all to insulate his bones was setting up for a meal he had positioned large pots over spirit warmers and a fragrance came from them redolent of red meat and potatoes he saw deborah and his eyes lit on the camera in her hands deborah said pleasantly hello not to worry im just having a look round th always are he muttered lots of visitors always someone comin hereabouts himself needs the funds oh i see well im not a potential donor im afraid nor was the last doesnt matter to me i get food and the meetings and f someone wants to ask me do i think thisll work i say it will deborah approached him but you dont believe in this process didnt say that and doesnt matter what i believe like i say i get food and the meetings and thats enough for me dont mind the meetings as much as i reckoned i would so thats not halfbad dry place to sleep as well during the meetings deborah asked him he looked up sharply he saw her smile and he chuckled anyway like i said theyre not halfbad bit much with the god bit bit more with the acceptance bit but i can cope maybe itll sink in willing to try it ten years sleeping rough its enough deborah joined him then at the serving table he had a large box on a chair next to it and from this he began taking out cutlery tin plates plastic drinking glasses cups and a mound of paper napkins he began to arrange these on the table and deborah helped him teacher he said quietly she said what thats what i was secondary comprehensive in lancaster chemistry i bet you didnt reckon that did you no i didnt her words were equally quiet he gestured towards the outdoors all shapes and sizes he said we got a surgeon a physicist two bankers and an estate agent out there and thosere just the ones willing to say what they left behind the others theyre not ready yet takes time to admit how far youve fallen you dont have to make those table napkins so neat were not the ritz oh sorry force of habit like himself he said cant hide your roots deborah didnt bother to tell him that her own roots came from the soil of what in another century would have been called being in service her father had long been employed by the st james family and hed spent the last seventeen years of his life caring for simon while pretending not to be caring for simon it was a very delicate balancing act that had him referring to his own soninlaw as mr st james deborah made a murmur of quasiagreement and said you sound fond of him himself decent bloke bit too trusting but good to the core you think hes being taken advantage of i mean with these gentlemen here not hardly most of them know theyve got something good going and less theyre too far gone with the drink or with drugs theyre going to hang on here as long as they can then who taking advantage he eyed her directly a very meaningful look deborah saw that he had a cataract forming in his left eye and she wondered how old he was with ten years of life on the street as part of his cv it would be nearly impossible to determine his age from his appearance people come round with promises and he believes em hes naive that way its to do with money donations sometimes other times they want something off him again that meaningful look deborah realised that he was placing her in the category of people wanting something from nicholas fairclough it wasnt an unreasonable conclusion considering who she was supposed to be still she said such as well hes got a good story to tell doesnt he he thinks if he tells it itll bring in money to help this place only it doesnt always work that way does it most of the time it comes to nothing we had a newspaper bloke here four times promising a story and himself saw bags of money coming in to help us out when the story got printed bloody nothing came of it and were back where we started scrabbling for funds thats what i mean a bit naive deborah said four times eh a reporter was here four times and no story came out of it thats unusual quite an investment of time with no payoff for anyone it must have been a true disappointment what sort of reporter invests all that time in preparing a story without writing it thats what i want to know said he was from the source in london but no one was checking his credentials so he couldve been anyone what i think is he was here to find dirt on himself hoping to make him look bad greasing his own career this bloke if you know what i mean but himself he doesnt see it that way the time wasnt right is how he puts it but you dont agree way i see it he needs to be careful he never is and thats going to be a problem for him not now then later a problem windermere cumbria yaffa shaw had been the one to suggest to zed that more might be in order than his merely hanging about the willow and well in bryanbarrow village waiting for a miraculous revelation to drop into his lap like the appearance of a scotland yard detective complete with magnifying glass in hand and meerschaum pipe clenched between his lips all the better to identify him theyd had their regular conversation after zed had written up his notes regarding everything the old farmer george cowley had alluded to on the green hed made note also of the fact that the mans teenage son had seemed more than uncomfortable with his fathers rant could be he decided that another chat was in order but this time with daniel cowley and not his father yaffa playing the part of his concerned potential life partner since his mum was in the room when wasnt she in the room when it came to his love life zed wondered wryly pointed out that ian cresswells death and george cowleys intentions might be in conflict with each other instead of what zed had concluded which was that they were directly related at first zed bristled at this he was after all the investigative reporter she on the other hand was merely a student at university attempting to accelerate her course so as to get back to micah the medical school boyfriend in tel aviv he said i wouldnt be so sure about that yaf without realising at first that the nickname had risen unbidden to his lips sorry yaffa he said correcting himself she said i like the other it makes me smile and then obviously to his mother in explanation to what had to have been susanna benjamins breathless question about why yaffa shaw was smiling while in conversation with her beloved zed oh zed called me yaf i thought it was rather sweet and then to zed your mum says sweet is your middle name she says that behind that giant exterior of yours youre a cream puff god zed groaned can you get her to leave the room or should i just ring off and we can consider the duty done for today zed stop it she laughed she had hed discovered a most pleasant laugh she said to his mother this man is making kissing noises does he always do that when hes speaking on the phone to a woman he doesnt hmmm i wonder what hell say next tell her im asking you to take off your knickers or something zed said zedekiah benjamin your mum is standing right here and then hes being very naughty and then a moment later to zed and in an altered tone shes gone really though zed shes very sweet your mum shes started bringing me hot milk and biscuits at night while im studying she knows what she wants shes been working at it for years so everything going all right then fine micah did phone and i brought him into the picture now hes pretending to be brother ari phoning from israel to see how his baby sister is doing with her studies right well good and really that should have been it since their only obligation to each other was a twicedaily phone call taking place somewhere in his mothers vicinity yaffa however took them back to what shed been saying earlier in their conversation what if things arent how they look like us you mean well im not talking about us but its a case in point isnt it what i mean is what if theres an inherent irony here that in and of itself could sex up your story about nicholas fairclough the scotland yard bloke beyond the scotland yard bloke because listen to what youve told me about it all one man is dead another man wants the farm that the dead man occupied still another man lives on the farm with the dead mans children now what does that suggest to you the truth was that it suggested nothing but zed was suddenly aware that yaffa was ahead of him on the curve of the story he hemmed and hawed and cleared his throat she said mercifully theres more here than meets the eye zed did the dead man leave a will a will what the hell had a will to do with anything where was the sex in that yes a will theres potential conflict there dyou see george cowley assumes the farm is going to be his for the taking now because now it will go on the block but what if thats not the case what if that farm is paid for free and clear and ian cresswell left it to someone or what if he put a name besides his own on the deed what irony hmm george cowley is thwarted once again its even more ironic if perhaps this man george cowley had something to do with ian cresswells death isnt it zed saw she was right he also saw she was clever and on his side as well so after they rang off he set about delving into the matter of ian cresswell and a will it didnt take long for him to find out that there was indeed a will because wisely cresswell had registered it online and the information was there for all to see a copy of this document was at his solicitors office in windermere another copy since the bloke was dead would be available through the probate registry but scoring a look at that would eat up valuable time not to mention a trip all the way to york so he knew he had to get either a peek or the information itself in another way it would have been nothing short of pure delight for the will to be viewable online but the lack of privacy in the uk which was becoming pandemic considering global terrorism permeable national borders and the easy access to explosives courtesy of the worlds arms manufacturers had not extended to the requirement that ones last will and testament had to be offered up for public consumption still zed knew that there was a way to get to it and he also knew which single person on the planet was likely to be able to put his fingers on the document that he needed a will rodney aronson said when he caught up with the editor in his london office youre telling me you want to look at the dead mans will im in the middle of a meeting here zed weve a paper to produce you do know that dont you zed reckoned that his editor was also in the middle of consuming a chocolate bar for over the phone he could hear the wrapper being crinkled even as rodney aronson spoke he said the situation is more complicated than it looks rod theres a bloke up here wanting to put his mitts on that farm owned by ian cresswell expecting it to go on the block he is it seems to me that hes got one hell of a motive to do the chop on our guy our guy as you say is nick fairclough the story youre writing is about him no thats the story were looking for the sex in and the sex is the cops but its only sex in the fairclough story if theyre investigating fairclough zed my man do i have to do your job for you or can you possibly jump on board the moving train i get it i know im fully on board but as no cops have shown a face yet thats what youre doing up there waiting for cops to show their faces jesus christ zed what sort of reporter are you let me spell it out all right if this bloke credwell cresswell ian cresswell and hes got a farm up here and his kids are living on it with some bloke far as i can tell so if the farm was left to this bloke or even to the kids and i dont bloody care who the farm was left to who it belongs to or whether it dances the tango when no ones looking and i dont bloody care if this cresswell was murdered what i care about is what the cops are doing up there if theyre not prowling round nicholas fairclough then your story is dead and youre on your way back to london dyou understand that or do i have to go at it another way i understand but good now get back onto fairclough and stop bothering me or come back to london have done with the whole thing and get a job writing greeting cards the kind that rhyme that last was a particularly low blow nonetheless zed said right but it wasnt right nor was it good journalism not that the source actually practised good journalism but given a story that was virtually dropping into their laps one might think it actually possible fine zed thought he would get back to nicholas fairclough and scotland yard but first he was determined to find out about that farm and about the terms of that bloody will because he had a gut feeling that that information was crucial to more than one person in cumbria milnthorpe cumbria lynley met with st james and deborah in the public bar of their hotel over glasses of a rather indifferent port they went over the information theyd gathered st james was of the same mind lynley discovered as he himself was they had to bring up the missing stones from the dock and st james had to look at them he wouldnt mind having a look at the boathouse itself as well he told lynley but he didnt know how an arrangement for this could be made without tipping their hand i daresay itll be tipped eventually lynley said im not sure how long i can carry off the pretence of idle curiosity for the benefit of anyone who happens to be watching faircloughs wife knows by the way he did tell her that makes things a bit easier relatively yes and i agree with you simon we need you inside that boathouse for more reasons than one meaning deborah asked the question she had her digital camera on the table next to her glass of port and shed brought a small notebook out of her shoulder bag as well she was lynley saw taking seriously her part in this little investigation of theirs he smiled at her grateful for the first time in months to be in the presence of longtime friends ian cresswell didnt take the scull out on a regular basis lynley told her but valerie fairclough takes her boat out several times a week while the scull was indeed tied at the spot where the stones were loose on the dock it wasnt a set position for it people on the estate seem to tie up the watercraft wherever theres an opening but someone seeing the scull in place could have loosened the stones while he was out on the lake that night yes deborah said that would make it someone on the estate at that moment her husband said was nicholas fairclough there that night if he was no one saw him lynley turned to deborah what sort of reading did you get off fairclough he seems perfectly lovely and his wifes quite beautiful tommy i cant exactly gauge the effect she has on men but id guess she could make a trappist monk give up his vows without much effort on her part something between her and cresswell then st james offered with nicholas taking issue over it hardly as the mans homosexual said lynley or bisexual tommy and theres something else deborah went on two things actually they might not be important at all but if you want me to look for things intriguing i do lynley said then theres this alatea fairclough has a copy of conception magazine its got pages torn out of the back and we might want to put our hands on a copy and have a look at what they are nicholas told me theyve been trying to conceive st james stirred his expression said that the magazine meant nothing and would have meant nothing to anyone else save deborah whose own concerns about conceiving would probably cloud her judgement lynley saw that deborah read her husband as well as he himself had done because she said this isnt about me simon tommys looking for anything unusual and what i was thinking what if his drug use has made nicholas sterile but alatea doesnt want him to know that a doctor may have told her but not him or she might have convinced a doctor to lie to him for his ego to keep him on the straight and narrow so what if knowing he cant give her children she asked ian to lend a hand in the matter if you know what i mean keeping it in the family lynley asked anythings possible and theres something else deborah said a reporter from the source jesus god has been there four times ostensibly doing a story on nicholas four times but nothings come of it tommy one of the blokes at the middlebarrow pele project told me if its the source theres dirt on someones shoe soles st james pointed out lynley thought about whose shoe soles those might be he said cresswells lover has evidently been on the estate on the grounds of ireleth hall for some time now working on a project for valerie hes called kaveh mehran pc schlicht mentioned him st james said has he got motive theres the will and insurance to be looked into anyone else with motive lynley told them about his meeting with mignon fairclough her insinuations about her parents marriage followed by her denial of those insinuations he also told them about the holes in the background of nicholas fairclough that shed been only too happy to fill in he ended with shes rather a piece of work and i have the impression shes got a hold over her parents for some reason so fairclough himself might bear looking into blackmail with cresswell somehow in the know emotional or otherwise i daresay she lives on the property but not in the house i suspect bernard fairclough built her digs for her and i wouldnt be surprised if one reason was to get her out of his hair theres another sister as well ive yet to meet her he went on to tell them that bernard fairclough had put a videotape into his hands hed suggested lynley watch it because if there was indeed someone behind ians death then he needed to see something rather telling this turned out to be a video of the funeral made for the purpose of sending to ians father in kenya too frail to make the trip to say farewell to his son fairclough had watched it at lynleys side and as things turned out it was what he didnt see that he wanted to point out niamh cresswell ians wife of seventeen years and the mother of his two children had not attended fairclough pointed out that at least to be of support to those grieving children she might have turned up he gave me a few details on the end of ian cresswells marriage lynley told them what he knew to which st james and deborah said simultaneously motive tommy hell hath no fury yes but its not likely that niamh cresswell could prowl round the grounds of ireleth hall without being seen and so far no ones mentioned her being there still and all st james said shes got to be looked into revenge is a powerful motive so is greed deborah said but then so are all the deadly sins arent they why else be deadly lynley nodded so well have to see if she benefits in any way other than vengeance he said were back to the will or an insurance policy st james said that informations not going to be easy to suss out while keeping your head down about why youre really here in cumbria tommy not for me going at it directly youre right about that lynley said but theres someone else who can do it lake windermere cumbria by the time theyd concluded their meeting it was too late for lynley to place the call he needed to make so instead he phoned isabelle truth was he was missing her truth was he was also glad to be away from her this wasnt due to any disinclination on his part for her company this was instead due to his need to know how he felt about her when they were apart seeing her every day at work seeing her several nights each week made it nearly impossible for him to sort through his feelings for the woman aside from those that were clearly sexual at least now he had a feeling to name longing thus he knew he missed her body what remained to be seen was whether he missed the rest of the package comprising isabelle ardery he waited till hed got back to ireleth hall to place the call from his mobile he stood just to the side of the healey elliott and he punched in the number and waited for it to go through he thought about how he was all at once wishing that she were with him there had been something in the easy conversation between himself and his friends and something more in the way simon and deborah communicated with each other that made him want that for himself once again that familiarity and assurance he understood that more specifically what he really wanted was a return to the way he and his wife had talked to each other in the morning over dinner at night in bed together even as one or the other of them bathed for the first time as well however he realised that helen herself didnt need to be that woman but that someone else somewhere else could this felt in part like a betrayal of a most beloved wife cut down through no fault of her own by a senseless act of violence yet he also understood that this feeling was part of getting on with life and he knew helen would have wanted that for him as much as shed wanted their life together the ringing stopped on the other end in london he heard damn faintly then the sound of isabelles mobile hitting something and then there was nothing at all he said isabelle are you there and he waited nothing again he said her name when there was no response he ended the call the connection apparently gone he punched in her number again the ringing began it continued perhaps she was in the car he thought unavailable or in the shower or engaged in something that made it impossible lo tommy joo jus call and then a sound he didnt want to hear something knocking against the side of her mobile a glass a bottle what did it matter is thinking of you an here you are hows tha for mental tepe tele telepathy isabelle lynley found he couldnt say more he ended the call put the mobile in his pocket and returned to his room in ireleth hall november chalk farm london barbara havers had spent the first part of her day off visiting her mother in the private care home where she was domiciled in greenford the call was long overdue she hadnt been there in seven weeks and shed been feeling the weight of guilt grow heavier with every day once shed reached the threeweek point shed admitted the worst to herself that she welcomed having work piled upon her so she wouldnt have to go and witness the further disintegration of her mothers mind but there had come a point when continuing to live with herself meant she had to make the journey to that pebbledash house with its neat front garden and spotless curtains hanging behind windows that fairly gleamed in sun or rain so she took the central line from tottenham court road not because it was faster but because it wasnt she wasnt liar enough to tell herself she was travelling in this manner to give herself time to think the last thing she really wanted to do was to think about anything and her mother was only one of the subjects she didnt want pressing in on her mind thomas lynley was another where he was what he was doing and why she hadnt been informed about either isabelle ardery was yet another whether she was actually going to be named to the position of detective superintendent permanently and what that would mean to barbaras own future with the met not to mention to her working relationship with thomas lynley angelina upman was still another whether she barbara could have a friendship with the lover of her neighbour and friend taymullah azhar whose daughter had become a needed bit of sparkle in barbaras life no the reason she took the train was avoidance pure and simple additionally the distractions afforded by the tube were vast and continually shifting and what barbara wanted was distractions because they gave her conversation openers that she could use with her mother when she finally saw her not that she and her mother had conversations any longer at least not the sort of conversations one might deem normal between a mother and daughter and this day had ultimately been no different to others in which barbara spoke hesitated watched and felt desperate to end the visit as soon as possible her mother had fallen in love with laurence olivier the younger version she was completely swept away by heathcliff and max de winter she wasnt sure who he was exactly the man she kept watching on the television screen tormenting merle oberon when he wasnt leaving poor joan fontaine completely tonguetied she only knew that they were meant to be together she and this handsome man that he was in reality long dead and gone was no matter to her she didnt recognise the older version of the actor olivier doing the job on poor dustin hoffmans teeth not to mention olivier rolling round the floor with gregory peck made no impact on her at all indeed whenever an olivier film other than wuthering heights or rebecca was brought to her attention she became quite ungovernable even olivier as mr darcy could not sway her from either of the other two films so they looped endlessly through a television in her mothers bedroom a feature that mrs florence magentry had installed in order to save the sanity of her other residents as well as her own there were only so many times one could watch devious larry destroy poor david nivens tenuous claim on happiness barbara had spent two hours with her mother they were heartsore hours and she felt the pain of them all the way home from greenford so when shed run into angelina upman and her daughter hadiyyah on the pavement just outside the big house in eton villas where they all lived shed accepted their invitation to look at what mummy bought barbara as a means of clearing her mind of the images of her mother cradling one breast tenderly as she watched the flickering screen display max de winter in torment over the death of his evil first wife she was with hadiyyah and her mother now having dutifully admired two ultramodern lithographs that angelina had managed to practically pinch barbara they were such a bargain werent they mummy from a vendor in the stables market barbara admired them not to her taste but she could indeed see how they were going to work in the sitting room of azhars flat barbara gave thought to the fact that angelina had apparently taken her daughter to one of the places absolutely verboten by the little girls father she wondered if hadiyyah had mentioned this to her mother or if perhaps angelina and azhar had agreed in advance that it was time hadiyyah began to experience more of the world she had her answer when hadiyyah clapped her hands over her mouth and said i forgot mummy angelina replied no matter darling barbara will keep our secret i hope you will barbara wont you hadiyyah asked dadll be so cross if he knows where we went dont nag hadiyyah angelina said and to barbara would you like a cup of tea im parched and you look a bit rough round the edges difficult day just a trip to greenford barbara said nothing more but hadiyyah added thats where barbaras mum lives mummy shes not well is she barbara barbara certainly didnt want to entertain the topic of her mother so she sought a different subject angelina being percent female in ways barbara could only dream of barbara pulled a topic out of the air that seemed the sort of subject a percent female might wish to pursue hair more to the point the fact that upon isabelle arderys strongly worded recommendation she was going to have to do something with hers angelina had mentioned barbara recalled that she knew of a beauty parlour salon hadiyyah crowed barbara its not a parlour its a salon hadiyyah her mother said sternly thats very rude and parlour is fine by the way salon is more modern but it hardly matters dont be so silly to barbara she said yes of course i do know barbara its where i get my own hair done dyou think they could barbara wasnt even sure what she was meant to ask for a haircut a styling a colour job what shed been cutting her own hair for years and while it generally looked exactly as one would expect a selfcut hairstyle to look which was not like a style at all but rather like an application of scissors to head during a thunderstorm it had long served the simple purpose of keeping it out of her face that however was no longer going to suit at least as far as barbaras superior officer at the met was concerned they could do whatever youd like them to do theyre very good i can give you their number and my stylists name hes called dusty and hes a bit of a flamboyant arse im afraid if youll excuse me hadiyyah dont tell your father i said arse in front of you but if you can get past the fact that hes completely full of his own excruciating wonderfulness hes actually quite good with hair in fact why dont i make you an appointment and come with you as well unless of course you think that too intrusive barbara wasnt sure what she thought about having azhars lover along for the ride of her selfimprovement hadiyyah had done this service before angelinas return to her daughters life but making the switch to her mother and what was implied by making the switch to her mother a movement towards friendship she wasnt sure angelina seemed to sense this hesitation because she said well let me fetch you that number and in the meantime think about it im completely happy to go with you where is it exactly this par salon knightsbridge knightsbridge god now that would cost a fortune its not the moon barbara hadiyyah said her mother lifted a warning finger hadiyyah khalidah sokay barbara said she knows me too well if you give me the number ill phone them right now you want to come as well kiddo she asked hadiyyah oh yes yes yes hadiyyah cried mummy i cn go with barbara cant i you as well barbara said to angelina i think ill need all the help i can get for this enterprise angelina smiled she had barbara noted a very pretty smile azhar had never told her how hed met angelina but she reckoned it was the womans smile that hed first noticed about her since he was male hed probably gone right onto her body next which was lithe and feminine and clothed in appealing and wellgroomed ways barbara could never have hoped to duplicate she took out her mobile phone in anticipation of making the call but it rang before she was able to do so she looked at the number and saw it was lynley she didnt like the delight that swept through her when she recognised his number time for a rain check on the hair she said to angelina i have to take this call chalk farm london what are you doing lynley asked her where are you can you talk my vocal cords havent been cut if thats what you mean barbara said if on the other hand you mean is it safe god thats what he kept saying to dustin hoffman isnt it i might be losing my bloody mind if im starting to quote barbara what are you talking about laurence olivier marathon man dont ask im at home more or less i mean im on the terrace outside azhars flat having been saved at the final moment from making an appointment to have my hair styled to please acting detective superintendent ardery i was thinking big hair circa or one of those complicated world war ii jellyroll affairs if you know what i mean masses of hair on either side of the forehead wound round something and looking like salami ive always wondered what it was they used to get that style toilet rolls prhaps should i anticipate all future conversations with you to take this bent lynley enquired frankly ive always thought your appeal lay in your complete indifference to personal grooming those days are past sir what cn i do for you i reckon this isnt a personal call made to see if im keeping my legs shaved i need you to do some digging for me but its got to be completely out of everyones sight and hearing it might involve legwork as well are you willing more can you manage that thiss to do with whatever youre up to i reckon everyones talking you know about where you are why you are who sent you and all the trimmings common thought is youre investigating a monumental cockup somewhere police corruption with you on tiptoe fading into the woodwork to catch someone taking a payoff or someone else putting electrodes to a suspects cobblers you know what i mean and you what do i think hilliers got you up to your eyeballs in something he himself doesnt want to touch with a tenfoot plastic one you put a step wrong you take the fall he still smells like dewdrops on roses am i close on the hillier part but its just a favour and thats all you can say for the moment are you willing what to lend a hand no one can know you have to fly beneath the radar everyones but particularly the superintendents it could get you into trouble with her not in the long run but in the short term why else do i breathe in our native land barbara said tell me what you need chalk farm london as soon as lynley said fairclough barbara knew this wasnt due to the fact that she had her fingers on the pulse of the life of everyone possessing a title in the uk far be that from the fact rather it was due to her being a devout albeit closet reader of the source she was addicted and had been so for years an absolute victim to fourinch headlines and deliciously compromising photographs whenever she passed an advertising placard set up on the pavement and screaming a frontpage story on sale inside this tobacconist or that corner shop her feet went into the place of their own accord she handed over her money and she had a good wallow generally over an afternoon cuppa and a toasted tea cake thus fairclough was a familiar name to her not only as it referenced the baron of ireleth and his business which had garnered many journalistic guffaws over the years but also as it attached itself to his looseliving scion nicholas she also knew at once where lynley was in cumbria where the faircloughs and fairclough industries were based what she didnt know was how hillier knew the faircloughs and what hed asked lynley to do regarding the family in other words she wasnt sure if it was a case of wereforem or wereagainstem but she reckoned that if there was a title involved hillier was cosying up to the forem side hillier had a thing about titles especially those that were above his own rank which was all of them so this probably had to do with lord fairclough and not his wastrel son long the subject of tabloid exposes along with other rich young things throwing their lives away but the list of lynleys interests suggested that he was casting a very wide net indeed since they involved a will an insurance policy the source bernard fairclough and the most recent edition of conception magazine they also involved someone called ian cresswell identified as faircloughs nephew and for good measure if she had time to pursue the matter someone called alatea vasquez y del torres hailing from somewhere in argentina called santa maria di whatever might bear looking into but only if she had the time lynley stressed because at the moment the real digging needed to be about fairclough fairclough the father not the son he emphasised lake windermere cumbria freddies next internet date had spent the night and while manette always tried to think of herself as a withit sort of woman this did seem a bit much to her her exhusband was no schoolboy to be sure and he certainly wasnt asking for her opinion on the matter but for the love of god it had been their first date and where was the world going to or more to the point where was freddie going to if men and women tried each other out in bed as a modernday form of singing getting to know you but thats exactly what had happened according to freddie and it had been her idea the womans according to freddie shed said really thered be no point in carrying on further if were not sexually compatible freddie dont you agree well freddie was a man after all presented with the opportunity what was he going to do ask for six months of chastity to give them time to suss each other out on matters from politics to prestidigitation plus it seemed reasonable enough to him times were changing after all so two glasses of wine at the local and home they came to take the plunge evidently theyd found all their parts in working order and the experience pleasurable so theyd done it two more times again this was according to freddie and shed spent the rest of the night there shed been having coffee with him in the kitchen when manette came downstairs in the morning shed been wearing freddies shirt and nothing else which left her showing a lot of leg and not a small part of where the leg came from and like a cat with canary feathers hanging from her mouth she said to manette hello you must be freddies ex im holly holly holly what sort of name was that her former husband was going for a shrub manette looked at freddie who at least had the grace to turn puce and then poured herself a hasty cup of coffee after which she retreated to her bathroom there freddie came to apologise for the uneasiness of the situation not manette noted for having had the woman stay the night and he said in best freddie fashion that in the future hed spend the night at their places instead of the reverse it all just happened between us rather quickly he told her id not intended it but manette homed in on their places and this was how she learned that times had changed and that instantaneous copulation had become the new form of shaking hands shed sputtered you mean you intend to try out every one of them well it does seem to be the way things are done these days shed tried to tell him that this was lunacy shed lectured him about stds unplanned pregnancies entrapment and everything else she could think of what she didnt say was that they had a very good situation she and freddie living as roommates because she didnt want to hear him say that it was time they both moved on at the end of it all though hed kissed her forehead told her not to worry about him revealed he had another date that night declared he might therefore not be home afterwards and said hed see her at work hed take his own car today he told her because this date lived in barrowinfurness and they were meeting at scorpio nightclub so if she wanted to hook up seriously freddie actually said hook up seriously theyd go to her place as it was apparently too far to drive to great urswick if their knickers were on fire manette wailed but freddie yet realised there was nothing else she could say she could hardly accuse him of being unfaithful or destroying what she and he had or acting hastily they werent married they had next to nothing and theyd been divorced long enough that freddies decision to get back into the world of dating as bizarre as that world now apparently was had not been made on the fly he wasnt that sort of man anyway and one only had to look at him to understand why women would be happy to try him out as a mate he was fresh and sweet and not halfbad looking no she had no rights here and manette knew it but she mourned something lost all the same nonetheless there were things to be seen to that went beyond her situation with freddie and she found that she was grateful for them although she wouldnt have thought so on the previous day after her confrontation with niamh cresswell something had to be done about niamh and while manette herself was powerless when it came to the woman she was not powerless when it came to tim and gracie if she had to move a mountain to help those children then that was what she intended to do she drove to ireleth hall she thought there was a good chance that kaveh mehran would be there since hed been long engaged in designing a childrens garden for the estate as well as overseeing the implementation of this design the garden was intended for nicholass future children and wasnt that like counting chickens manette thought and considering the size of the garden that had been staked out it looked as if valerie was expecting dozens of them she was in luck manette saw upon her arrival she traipsed round to the location of the future childrens garden which was north of the immense and fantastical topiary garden and she saw not only kaveh mehran but her father as well there was another man with them whom manette did not recognise but reckoned was the earl that her sister had phoned her about widower mignon had told her manette could hear the tapping of her keyboard in the background so she knew her sister was doing her usual multitasking emailing one of her online lovers while simultaneously dismissing what shed reckoned was a potential offline one its rather obvious why dads dragged him up here from london hope springs eternal et cetera and now ive had the surgery and lost all the weight he reckons im ready for a suitor a regular charlotte lucas just waiting for mr collins to show up god how embarrassing well dream on pater im quite happy where i am thank you very much manette wouldnt have put it past her father hed been trying to offload mignon for years but she had him very much where she wanted him and she had no intention of making any changes why bernard wouldnt show her the door or give her the boot or any other figurative cutting of ties with mignon was beyond manette although once hed built the folly for her sister some six years earlier manette had concluded her twin was holding back something damaging that would ruin their father if she let it be known what that was manette couldnt imagine but it had to be something big kaveh mehran appeared to be showing the other two men the progress so far made on the childrens garden he was pointing hither and yon at stacks of timber beneath tarps and piles of quarried stone and stakes driven into the ground with string strung between them manette called out a hello and strode in their direction mignon was out of her mind manette decided as the men turned towards her if she thought the widower had been brought up from london as a potential suitor for her a sort of gentleman caller in the best tradition of tennessee williamss psychodramas he was tall blond exceedingly attractive and dressed even in the lakes for gods sake with that kind of understated rumpled elegance that fairly screamed old family money if he was a widower out looking for wife number two or wife number two hundred and twentytwo he wasnt going to choose her sister to step into that position the human animals capacity for selfdelusion was absolutely amazing manette thought bernard smiled a hello at manette and made the introductions tommy lynley was the name of the earl and wherever he was earl of was not mentioned he had a firm handshake an interesting old scar on his upper lip a nice smile and very brown eyes at odds with his light hair he was good at small talk she found and equally good at putting people at ease beautiful day in a beautiful place he told her he himself was from cornwall originally south of penzance an area which was obviously lovely as well and hed spent very little time in cumbria but from what he was seeing round ireleth hall he knew he should make regular visits here very nicely said manette thought very polite had he said it to mignon she would doubtless have considered it rife with double meanings manette said come in winter and its likely youll think otherwise and then to kaveh mehran id like a word if youve time her father had succeeded wildly in industry because he was a man fully capable of reading nuances he said whats going on manette and when she gave a glance at lynley bernard continued with tommys a close friend he knows weve had a recent tragedy in the family has something more niamh manette said what about her manette glanced at lynley and then said to her father im not sure you want lynley started to excuse himself but bernard said no its fine stay and to manette as i said hes a friend it cant be anything fine manette thought whatever you like and she said abruptly niamhs not yet taken the children back theyre still with kaveh we need to do something about it bernard glanced at kaveh his brow furrowed and he murmured to lynley my late nephews wife its absolutely not right manette said she knows it and she doesnt much care i spoke to her yesterday all dressed to the ninetynines she was with a bucket of sex toys sitting out for all the world to see shes got some bloke coming round to do the business with her and tim and gracie are in the way bernard cast another look at kaveh the young man said absolutely not right manette he spoke politely enough but his tone told manette hed misunderstood her meaning she said oh for gods sake kaveh you know im not talking about what you are you can be as bent as a broken twig for all i care but when it comes to children im not interested in children well thats just the point isnt it manette snapped choosing to misinterpret his remark it helps to have an interest in children if one is actually caring for them dad tim and gracie belong with family and whatever he is kavehs not family manette her fathers voice was minatory evidently there were things in the recent tragedy in the family that he did indeed prefer tommy lynley not to know despite what hed said a moment earlier well that was unfortunate because hed welcomed her to speak openly in front of the london man so that was what she intended to do she said ian was happy to have the children with him in bryanbarrow i understood that and i was on board with it anything to keep them away from niamh whos about as motherly as a great white shark as you know very well but ian cant have intended kaveh to keep them if something happened to him you know that kaveh and back to her father so you have to talk to niamh you have to order her you have to do something tims in a very bad way hes worse than what he was like to get him into margaret fox school in the first place and god knows gracie needs a mother more than ever just now and shes going to be completely desperate for one in a year or two if niamh isnt willing to do the job then someone else is going to have to step onto the pitch i see the situation bernard said well carry on further another time we cant dad im sorry and to lynley dirty laundry and more to come if you havent the stomach for it to bernard lynley said perhaps theres a way i can be of help and something passed between them some sort of message or assurance or something that assuaged whatever manettes father had been concerned about in having lynley present at an escalating conversation manette said tim attacked me no no i didnt get hurt im sore but thats not the point he must be dealt with the whole bloody situation must be dealt with and since kavehs not going to be staying on that farm forever its in everyones best interests to deal with it now before the farm is sold once kaveh has to move house what happens to the children are they going with him and where this cant go on they cant keep being uprooted he left it to me kaveh said im not going anywhere manette swung back to him what the farm manette ian left it to me to you why kaveh said with a dignity manette had to admire because he loved me because we were partners and thats what partners usually do make arrangements to take care of each other in the event of death silence ensued into it the sound of jackdaws burst into the air from somewhere the smell of burning leaves came at them in a rush as if there were flames nearby which there were not men usually take care of their children as well manette said that farm should be tims not yours it should be gracies it should be theirs to sell to provide for their future kaveh looked away he worked his jaw as if this would allow him to master an emotion i think youll find there was an insurance policy for that how convenient whose idea was all this the farm left to you and insurance for them how much insurance by the way and exactly who does the money go to because if it goes to niamh in trust for the children manette her father cut in thats not on just now and to kaveh will you be keeping the farm or selling it kaveh keeping it as for tim and gracie theyre welcome to stay with me till niamhs ready to have them back and if shes never ready ian would have wanted no no no manette didnt particularly care to hear the rest the point was that the children belonged with family and kaveh partner to ian or not was not family she said hotly dad you must ian cant have wanted does niamh know all this what part kaveh asked and do you think she actually cares one way or the other does she know youve inherited and when did ian do this kaveh hesitated as if evaluating the potential responses that he could make manette had to say his name twice to get him to respond at all i dont know he told her a look passed between bernard and tommy lynley manette saw this and knew that they were thinking what she herself was thinking kaveh was lying about something the only question was which of her enquiries he was answering with i dont know you dont know what exactly she asked him i dont know a thing about niamh one way or the other she has the insurance money and theres quite a pile ian meant it to help her care for tim and gracie of course but thats because he believed that if anything happened to him niamh would come to her senses about them well she hasnt and its not looking likely shes going to if they must then theyll stay with me theyre established at the farm and theyre happy enough ludicrous thought that tim cresswell was happy he hadnt been happy in ages manette said and what exactly is supposed to happen when you meet someone new in a month or two kaveh when you move him to the farm and take up life with him what then what are the children supposed to do what are they supposed to think manette bernard murmured cautiously kaveh had gone quite pale with her words but he said nothing although his jaw worked furiously and at his side his right hand clenched into a fist manette said niamh will fight you in court for that farm shell contest the will for the children manette enough her father said on a sigh theres been plenty of grief to go round and everyone needs to recover yourself included why are you playing the peacemaker in this manette demanded of her father hes nothing to us she said with a jerk of her head at kaveh hes nothing to the children hes just someone ian ruined his life for and i said enough bernard snapped and to kaveh excuse her kaveh she doesnt mean oh she knows very well what she means kaveh said most people do manette sought a way out of the mire shed created for herself by saying lamely all right look if nothing else youre too young to be the father of a fourteenyearold boy kaveh he needs someone older someone experienced someone not homosexual kaveh finished for her i didnt say that and i dont mean that i was going to say someone within his own family youve made that point more than once im sorry kaveh its not about you its about tim and gracie they cant be asked to tolerate more devastation in their lives its destroying tim its going to do the same to gracie i have to stop their world from falling apart even further i hope you can understand that leave things as they are manette her father said there are larger concerns at the moment like what he said nothing but there were those glances between her father and his london friend and she wondered for the first time what was going on here clearly this bloke wasnt intended to press a case for love with her wily sister in the fashion of the eighteenth century out for her money perhaps in order to support a crumbling estate in cornwall and the fact that her father had actually wanted him to hear every word of her conversation with kaveh suggested that the quiet waters of tommy lynleys outward appearance were probably deep enough for nessie to swim in well that couldnt matter nothing could matter she intended to do something about her cousins children and if her father wouldnt join forces with her she knew someone else who was likely to do so she threw up her hands all right she said and to lynley sorry you had to listen to all this he nodded politely but there was an expression on his face that told he hadnt minded hearing the information at all bryanbarrow en route to windermere cumbria the previous day had been a washout two hours trying to thumb it to windermere and tim had finally given up but he was determined today would be different the rain started not long after he began the most difficult part of his journey the endless hike from bryanbarrow village down to the main road through the lyth valley he didnt expect to get a lift during this part of the route as the cars were few and far between and if a farm vehicle happened to come by a tractor for example it moved so slowly and went so little distance that he could actually make better time on foot he hadnt counted on the rain though this was stupid of him considering it was the sodden month of sodding november and as far as he knew it rained more in the lakes than anywhere else in the bloody country but because hed left bryan beck farm in a state in which clear thinking wasnt exactly going on in his head he had put a hoodie on over a flannel shirt which he wore over a teeshirt and none of this was waterproof he had trainers on his feet too and while these werent soaked through they were mud up to the ankles because the verges of the lane were swampy the way they always were at this time of year as for his jeans they were growing heavier and heavier as the rain got to them since they were several sizes too large anyway the struggle to keep them up round his hips was infuriating he was on the main road through the valley when he scored his first lift a spot of luck in a day that otherwise was sucking ostrich eggs this was supplied by a farmer he pulled over in a land rover that was up to its wings in crusted mud and he said get in son you look like something dragged out of the pond where to tim said newby bridge the opposite direction from windermere because he had a feeling about the bloke and the way the bloke looked at him close and curious he also didnt want to leave a trail once everything was over if things went the way he wanted them to go if his name and face showed up in the paper and this bloke recognised him then tim wanted the phone call he made to the cops to be one that said oh yeah i member that kid said he was going to newby bridge the farmer said newby bridge is it and pulled back onto the road he said he could take him as far as winster and after that he did the usual thing which was to ask why tim wasnt at school he said school day innit you doing a bunk tim was used to the maddening habit adults had of asking questions that were none of their business it always made him want to dig his thumbs into their eyeballs it wasnt as if theyd ask a question like that of another adult like why arent you at work today like the rest of the world but they seemed to think it was open season on firing just about any question at a kid hed been prepared for this though so he said check the time half day the farmer said not for my three its not where dyou go to school jesus tim thought where he went to school was the farmers business like it was his business asking tim when his last shit had occurred he said not round here margaret fox near ulverston reasonably sure that the man wouldnt have heard of the place and its reason for being he added independent school its boarding but i dont board whats happened to your hands then the farmer asked you dont want them to stay like that tim gritted his teeth he said cut myself got to be more careful cut those dont look like you cut look pull over tim said you cn let me out here thiss nowheres near winster boy true enough theyd gone barely a mile just let me out okay tims voice was controlled he didnt want it to go fierce with all that fierceness revealed but he knew that if he didnt get out of the land rover now he would do something and it wouldnt be pleasant the farmer shrugged he pulled over he looked long and hard at tim as he braked and tim knew that the man was memorising his face no doubt hed be listening to the radio news next time it came on waiting to hear about a local burglary or a spate of malicious mischief that he could pin on tim well that was the risk hed have to take better that than riding farther with the bloke you take care son the farmer said just before tim slammed the door hard whatever tim replied as the land rover moved on he tore at the back of his hand with his teeth his next ride was better a german couple took him as far as the road to crook where they turned off in search of some posh country house hotel they spoke good english but all they wanted to talk about to him was ach such rain you have in cumbria and when they spoke to each other which was most of the time anyway they spoke in german rapid sentences about someone called heidi tim managed to get a final lift from a lorry driver just north of the crook road this bloke was heading all the way to keswick so windermere would be no problem he said what was a problem was the drivers intention of using their limited time together to lecture tim on the dangers of hitchhiking and to quiz him about his parents and did they know he was out on the roads taking lifts from strangers you dont even know who i am he announced i could be sutcliffe i could be brady i could be some child molester you understand that tim bore all this without kicking the bloke in the face which was what he badly wanted to do he nodded said yeah said whatever and when they finally reached windermere said drop me off over there by the library this the lorry driver did although not without saying it was lucky for tim that he had no interest in twelveyearold boys because this was truly and absolutely too much tim said that he was fourteen not twelve the lorry driver hawked a laugh and said you arent ever and whatre you hiding under them baggy clothes i reckon truth is youre a girl you are in response to which tim slammed the door hed borne just about all that he could if hed done exactly what he preferred to do at that precise moment he would have gone into the library and ripped up a shelf of books but that he knew would not get him an inch closer to where he wanted to be so he bit down hard harder and then hardest of all on his knuckles till he tasted the blood and that helped a bit and made him able to set off towards the business centre even at this time of year there were tourists in windermere it was nothing like the summer when one couldnt move in the town without bashing straight into some fellwalking enthusiast with a bulging rucksack on his back and a hiking pole in his hand then no one local with any sense came into town since endless tailbacks transformed every street into nothing more than a car park now though moving about was easier and the tourists on the pavements were of the whogivesashit sort kitted out in green plastic bedsheets with their rucksacks underneath making them all look like hunchbacks tim passed them by and followed the route into the business centre where there was not a single tourist at all tourists having no reason to go there tim however had a very good reason and it was called shots this was a photographic developing service hed learned upon his only visit to the place and its general purpose was to create superenlargements for professional photographers who came to the lakes to memorialise its grand vistas at all times of year in the window samples of what shots was capable of producing stood on large easels against a black background curtain inside the shop itself photo portraits were hanging on the walls digital cameras were on offer and a display of antique cameras was arranged in a glassfronted bookcase as well there was a counter and as tim knew a back room from this room a man emerged he was wearing a white lab coat with shots embroidered on the left breast and a plastic name tag above it when his eyes met tims his hand went quickly to that name tag he removed it and shoved it into his pocket tim thought once again how normal toyyou looked he was not at all what one would expect with neat brown hair roses in his cheeks and wirerimmed specs he had a pleasant smile and he used it now but what he said to tim was this isnt a good time i texted you tim said you didnt answer i had no message from you toyyou replied are you sure you sent it to the right number he looked directly at tim which was how tim knew he was lying because that was what he himself had used to do until hed understood how dead a giveaway it was to meet someones eyes like that tim said why didnt you answer we had a deal we have a deal i did my part you didnt do yours the mans gaze shifted it went from tim to the doorway this meant he was hoping that someone would enter the shop so that the conversation could go no further because he knew as well as tim knew that neither of them wanted to be overheard but there was no one out there so he was going to have to talk or tim was going to do something inside the shop like make a move for those old cameras in that case or one of the digitals he doubted toyyou wanted any of them destroyed tim said i said for what youre proposing the risk is too great ive thought about it but thats how it is tim grew so hot that he felt a fire being lit at his feet it rose quickly and engulfed him and he breathed fast and hard because that seemed the best way to control it he said we fucking agreed you think im forgetting about that he clenched his fists unclenched them and looked around dyou even want to know what i can do to you if you dont keep your promise to me toyyou went to a drawer at the end of the counter tim tensed reckoning he meant to pull out a gun or something which was what would have happened in a film but instead he pulled out a packet of cigarettes he lit one he examined tim for a very long moment before he spoke he finally said okay all right but if you want it to happen i need more from you than youve given so far thats the only thing that makes it worthwhile for me a risk you take for a risk i take equality tim parted his lips to speak but he couldnt at first hed already done everything every single damn thing and now he was meant to do more he said the only thing he could think of you promised me toyyou made the sort of expression one might make upon the discovery of a seriously soiled nappy in the front seat of ones car he said whats this you promised me like some infant school pupils arrangement thats it you give me your chocolate bikkie and i let you ride my skateboard only i eat the bikkie and then run off and you dont get your ride tim said you agreed you said this is fucking unfair toyyou drew in long on the cigarette and watched tim over its glowing tip he said i changed my mind thats what people do ive assessed the risk and its all on my part and none on yours you want things done you do them yourself tim saw a curtain of red fall between himself and toyyou he knew what it meant action was called for and toyyou wasnt about to call the cops to prevent him from taking it but on the other hand that would finish things between them and despite what he was feeling at the moment tim knew he didnt want to start this process all over again searching for someone else he couldnt face that the days and weeks that it would take so he said i swear to god ill tell and when im done telling no before that ill kill you and then ill tell i swear ill say i had to ill say you made me toyyou lifted an eyebrow casually with the trail youve left on that computer of yours i dont think so mate he glanced at a wall clock behind the shop counter and said and now its time for you to leave im staying tims voice began to shake the rage filled him with both passion and need im telling everyone who walks in that door you throw me out i wait in the car park anyone comes near this place i tell them you call the cops to get me out of here i tell them as well you think i wont you think i even care at this point at this toyyou took a moment without replying it became so quiet within the shop that the movement of the second hand on the wall clock sounded like a gun being cocked over and over again finally the man said hell relax okay youve got my short n curlies in your fist but i have yours as well and youre not seeing that as ive already said youre taking no risk im taking it all so youre going to have to make things more worthwhile than youre making them at present thats all im saying tim said nothing what he wanted to do at present as toyyou put it was dive over the shop counter and beat the bastard to a pulp but he remained where he was toyyou said really kid whats it going to take you to do that much an hour two three you want this bad enough you go along you dont want it bad enough you phone the cops but if you do you have to give them something to prove what youre telling them and you and i both know where that proof leads youve got a mobile with messages youve got a computer with email therere cops out there whore going to take a look at all that and see whats what with you and thats going to be easy were both in a dodgy position here so why dont we help each other instead of trying to push each other in front of the train eh they engaged in a staredown from rage and need what tim felt altered to pure hopelessness he didnt want to face the truth of the matter that truth being that toyyou had a point that tim could not deny so he finally said numbly what toyyou smiled briefly not alone this time tim felt his bowels get loose he said when that smile again the kind of smile that acknowledges triumph soon my friend ill send you a text you just be ready completely ready this time got that yeah tim said because there was nothing else left and he knew that lake windermere cumbria after manette had left them lynley told bernard fairclough that they needed to have a talk fairclough apparently anticipated this because he nodded although he said despite the rain that had begun to fall let me take you through the topiary garden first lynley reckoned that fairclough made this offer in order to prepare himself for whatever talk was coming but he let the other man have the time they went in through an arched gate in a stone wall that was greyspeckled with lichen fairclough chatted about the site he sounded casual enough but doubtless hed gone this route a hundred times showing off what his wife had accomplished with her efforts to return the garden to its former glory lynley listened without comment he found the garden oddly beautiful he generally preferred his shrubbery natural but in this place box holly myrtle and yew had been fashioned into fantastic shapes some of them over thirty feet tall there were trapezoids pyramids and spirals there were double spirals mushrooms arches barrels and cones paths of bleached limestone led among them and where there were no shrubs there were parterres created from low box hedges in these parterres yellow dwarf nasturtiums still bloomed a contrast to the purple violas that surrounded them the garden was more than two hundred years old and restoring it had been valeries dream upon inheriting ireleth hall fairclough told him it had taken her years upon years with the assistance of four gardeners and photos from early in the twentieth century magnificent eh fairclough said with pride shes amazing my wife lynley admired the garden anyone he knew would have done the same but there was something not quite right in faircloughs tone and lynley said to him shall we talk here in the garden or somewhere else fairclough obviously knowing that the time had come replied come with me then valeries gone to check on mignon shell be a while we can talk in the library this turned out to be a misnomer as there were no books the room was a small and cosy chamber just off the great hall with darkly panelled walls that were hung with portraits of faircloughs long departed a desk sat in the centre of the room and two comfortable armchairs faced a fireplace this was an impressive grinling gibbons affair surmounted by a display of old willow pattern pottery and a coal fire was laid within fairclough lit this for the room bore a chill then he opened the heavy curtains that covered the leadpaned windows rain was streaking them fairclough offered drinks it was a little early for lynley so he demurred but fairclough poured sherry for himself he indicated the chairs and they sat he said youre seeing more dirty laundry than i expected im sorry about that every family has its share lynley noted my own included not like mine i wager lynley shrugged he said because at this point it had to be asked do you want me to proceed bernard why do you ask lynley steepled his fingers beneath his chin and looked at the coal fire lit by candle stubs beneath it it was building nicely the room would soon be quite warm he said aside from this business about cresswells farm which bears looking into you may already have the result you prefer if the coroner has declared it an accident you might well want to leave it that way and let someone get away with murder at the end of the day no one gets away with anything ive found what have you uncovered its not a matter of what ive uncovered so far thats little enough as my hands are somewhat tied by the pretence of my being a visitor here its rather a matter of what i might uncover which is a motive for murder i suppose what im saying is that while this easily could have been an accident you run the risk of discovering things about your son your daughters even your wife that youd rather not know no matter how your nephew died that sort of thing happens in an investigation fairclough seemed to give this some thought like lynley he directed his gaze to the fireplace and then to the willow pattern pottery above it one of the vases lynley saw was cracked and had been repaired at some time long ago he reckoned the repair was inexpert not like what could be done today to hide damage lynley said on the other hand this could indeed be a murder perpetrated by someone you love do you want to face that fairclough looked at him then he said nothing but lynley could see that the mans mind was ticking away at something lynley continued consider this as well you wanted to know if nicholas was somehow involved in what happened to his cousin that was why you came to london but what if someone else is involved other than nicholas some other member of your family or what if ian wasnt the intended victim do you want to know that as well fairclough didnt hesitate both of them knew who the other intended victim would have been he said no one has a reason to want valerie hurt shes the centre of this world both my world and theirs he indicated the outofdoors by which lynley took that he meant his children and one of them in particular lynley said bernard we cant avoid looking at mignon she has access to that boathouse every day absolutely not mignon fairclough said she wouldnt have lifted a finger against ian and certainly not against her own mother why not shes fragile tommy always has been she had a head injury as a child and ever since shes incapacitated her knees her surgery no matter she wouldnt have been able to manage it lynley pressed him if she somehow were able has she a motive is there something i should know about her relationship with her mother with her cousin were they close were they enemies in other words did she have a reason to want ian dead thats what im asking fairclough took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes ian advised me on financial matters as you know he was in charge of all finances that was his job he was good at that and i needed him i understand lynley said hed insisted for a while perhaps three years that i cut mignon off he never understood that the girl cant work shes never been able ians point was that giving her money was what had crippled her and she was otherwise perfectly fine it was a bone of contention between us not a big one and it only came up once or twice a year but i had no intention of i just couldnt when your childs been badly injured when you have children of your own youll understand tommy did mignon know about ians wanting to cut her off fairclough nodded reluctantly he spoke to her when i wouldnt agree to stopping her allowance he went to see her he talked to her about bleeding money from her father as he put it mignon told me she was hurt of course she told me i could cut her off at once she invited me to do it in fact i daresay she knew you wouldnt shes my child fairclough said and your other children had manette a reason to want ian out of the picture manette adored ian i think at one time she would have liked to marry him long before kaveh of course and his feelings for her fairclough finished off his sherry and went to pour another he motioned the decanter in lynleys direction again lynley demurred he was fond of manette fairclough said but that was the extent of it shes divorced isnt she yes her former husband works for me freddie mcghie so does she for that matter is there any reason freddie mcghie might have wanted ian out of the way you did tell me that you havent definitely fixed on a successor at fairclough industries how do things stand with ian gone fairclough said nothing at first it seemed to lynley that they were getting close to something fairclough preferred to ignore lynley raised an eyebrow fairclough said as ive said ive not decided either manette or freddie could take over they know the business theyve worked for me their entire careers freddie especially would be a good choice despite being manettes ex he knows every department and hes worked in them all id prefer a member of the family as would valerie but if no one has the experience and the proper outlook freddie would be the logical one to take up the reins would you consider nicholas that would be madness with his history but hes trying to prove himself to me what did ian think about that he reckoned nick would fail but as nick had promised me that he was a changed man once and for all i wanted to give him a chance to demonstrate it hes working his way up from the bottom at the business i rather admire him for that is that the deal you struck with him not at all it was his idea i expect its what alatea advised him to do so its possible he could take over the company anythings possible fairclough said as i said its not been decided but you must have given thought to it at one point or another else why have me come up here and look into nicholas fairclough was silent it was answer enough nicholas was after all the son and the son not the meek was generally the one to inherit the earth lynley went on anyone else with a motive to be rid of ian anyone you can think of with an ax to grind a secret to keep an issue to clear no one at all as far as i know fairclough sipped his sherry but his eyes stayed on lynleys over the rim of the glass lynley knew he was lying but he didnt know why he also felt they hadnt got to the bottom of why he himself was there in the first place at ireleth hall investigating something that had already been resolved in a way that should have relieved the man lynley said bernard no one is actually in the clear on this except those who had no access to the boathouse youve a decision to make if you want the truth whatever it is what sort of decision if you actually do want to get to the bottom of the matter youre going to have to agree to let me be who i am and that is a cop fleet street city of london barbara havers chose a pub near fleet street one of the watering holes that had long ago been a gathering place for journalists in the heyday of the newspaper business when nearly every tabloid and broadsheet had its headquarters in the immediate vicinity things had changed with property in the canary wharf area luring more than one news organisation to the east end of the city but not all had heeded that siren call of lower rents and one in particular had stubbornly remained determined to be close to the action that was the source and barbara was waiting for her source at the source to show up shed phoned and asked him for a meeting hed been reluctant till she let him set the time and offered lunch hed still been reluctant till she mentioned lynley that got his attention he asked how is he and barbara could tell the reporter was hoping for something suitable to whet the readers appetite in the recovery from personal tragedy department it wouldnt make the front page but he could hope for page plus photos if the details were good shed said im not prepared to say a word about a word over the phone cn you meet that had done the trick she hated to use lynley that way she hated to use him any way if it came down to it but as he himself was the one who was asking her for information she reckoned she was on the safe side of what was appropriate between friends isabelle ardery had been more difficult to deal with when barbara phoned to ask for the time off that she was owed ardery had been at once suspicious as her questions of why where are you going indicated barbara had known the acting detective superintendent was probably going to be the difficult nail to pound into the board so shed had her excuse ready haircut she said or perhaps i should say hairstyle ive found a place in knightsbridge so you just need the day ardery had clarified so far barbara replied whats that supposed to mean sergeant there was that suspicion again the super needed to do something about the sharpness in her voice if she wanted to hide her paranoia barbara thought she said have some mercy guv if i end up looking like last nights dinner ill have to find someone to repair the damage ill be in touch im owed the time anyway this was no lie and ardery knew that besides she herself had been the one to order in the guise of making a recommendation an improvement in barbaras personal appearance the superintendent had reluctantly agreed although shed added no more than two days to make certain barbara knew which one of them was in charge on her way to the pub barbara had taken care of another of lynleys requests shed searched out the latest edition of conception magazine finding it at kings cross station where a wh smith provided every journal imaginable in the railway terminal that had been convenient since barbaras underground route from chalk farm took her through kings cross station anyway so all it had involved was a brief stop there not to mention putting up with an evaluative glance from the young man behind the till when she paid for the journal she could see it in his eyes and in the eversoslightlyamused movement of his mouth conception you not bloody likely shed wanted to pull him over the counter by the neck of his white shirt but the dirty ring round its collar stopped her no need to expose herself so closely to someone whose personal hygiene didnt extend to washing his clothes regularly shed decided she was leafing through conception as she waited in the pub she was wondering where they found all the perfect babies to photograph along with all the mothers who looked dewy fresh and not at all like what they probably were which was haggard with lack of sleep shed ordered herself a jacket potato topped with chili con carne and she was dipping into this and reading about the care of ones nipples during breastfeeding who knew it was so painful she wondered when her inside guy at the source showed up mitchell corsico came into the pub in his usual getup he always wore a stetson jeans and cowboy boots but barbara saw hed added a fringed leather jacket god she thought chaps and sixguns were probably next he saw her jerked his head in a nod and approached the bar to place his order he looked at the menu for a moment tossed it down and told the publican what he wanted he paid for it as well and this barbara took for a positive sign till he walked to her table and said twelve pounds fifty she said bloody hell what did you order did i have a limit she muttered and pulled out her purse she dug for the cash and shoved it over as he reached for a chair and mounted it like a cowboy onto a horse she said wheres trigger say what never mind thats bad for your arteries he noted with a nod at her potato and you ordered all right never mind whats up backscratch situation she saw the wariness across his features who could blame him corsico was the one who was usually coming to the cops for information and not the reverse but hope passed crossed his features as well because he knew his stock was very low at the yard hed been embedded with the police during the hunt for a serial killer nearly a year earlier and he wasnt popular because of that still he was careful he said i dont know lets see what dyou need a name he remained noncommittal theres a reporter from the source been sent up to cumbria i need to know who he is and why hes there at this he began to reach into his jacket pocket so she said uh we havent started scratching yet mitch hold triggers rein if you know what i mean oh a horse yeah just like silver hi ho and all that id expect you to know this all things considered so whos gone up there and why he considered after a moment during which his meal arrived roast beef and yorkshire bloody pud and all the trimmings and barbara reckoned he didnt eat like that unless someone else was footing the bill he said i need to know whats in it for me thats going to depend on the value of your information it doesnt work that way he said not usually but things have changed new super looking over my shoulder i have to be careful an exclusive with di lynley would do ha not bloody likely he started to rise barbara knew it was show because there was no way in hell he was going to walk off and leave his roast beef and yorkshire pud languishing uneaten at the table but she played along and said all right ill do what i can so you do what you can whos been sent to cumbria he spilled the beans as she reckoned he would he gave her everything zedekiah benjamin a story on nicholas fairclough a rejection by the editor and a reporters determination to mould the story into something suitable for the source instead of what hed turned in at first which appeared to be a puff piece that belonged in hello hed been up to cumbria at least three times now maybe four trying to sex up the story enough for rodney aronson but he was apparently slow on the uptake hed not been getting anywhere till ian cresswell drowned this was an interesting bit barbara thought she asked for the dates of zedekiah benjamins sojourns in cumbria and she learned that two of those sojourns had occurred in advance of the cresswell drowning the second of these had ended just three days prior to the death at which point benjamin had apparently returned to london with his tail between his legs having failed to suss out the sex that his editor required she said what happens to this bloke if he doesnt find the sex corsico did the knifeacrossthethroat business and topped that by flipping his thumb over his shoulder in case barbara was too dim to work out what he meant she nodded and said know where hes staying up there corsico said he didnt but he added that benjamin wouldnt exactly be difficult to spot if he was lurking in the bushes near someones house why barbara asked because corsico said he was six feet eight inches tall with a head of hair so red it looked like his skull was on fire now he concluded taking out his notebook my backs itching ill have to scratch it later she replied arnside knot cumbria the rain had begun during alateas walk she was prepared for it though having seen the nasty bank of clouds approaching arnside across morecambe bay coming from the direction of humphrey head what she hadnt anticipated was the strength of it shed known from the wind it would be coming on quickly the fact that it altered from a quarter of an hours downpour to a tempest was the surprise she was halfway to her destination when the pelting began she could have turned for home but she did not it seemed to her a necessity that she complete the climb to the top of arnside knot she told herself grimly that she might be struck by lightning there and at the moment this sort of end to her life didnt actually seem like such a bad thing shed be done in an instant over out it would be a form of the ultimate knowing in a situation in which not knowing was slowly eating her up the rain had abated when she began the final ascent among the auburncoated scottish steers that grazed freely on the hillside her feet sought safe purchase in the areas of limestone scree and she grasped the trunks of the bent windscarred conifers to aid her as she reached the top once there she found she was breathing less heavily than she had done in earlier climbs soon she told herself shed probably be able to jog to the top of arnside knot and arrive there no worse for the exertion from the top of the knot she could see it all two hundred and eighty degrees of panorama that comprised everything from the speck that was piel island castle to the undulating mass of morecambe bay and the fishing villages strung along its shore this vista offered endless sky treacherous waters and landscape of every variety what it did not offer however was a glimpse into the future and alatea had come out into the uncertain weather in an attempt to run from what she knew she could not hope to escape indefinitely shed told nicholas part of what shed discovered in her research but she had not told him all of it shes a freelance photographer not a location scout at all shed informed him her nerves were on edge and shed had a bit of sherry to still them come look nicholas she has a website it had been a simple matter to find out what she needed to know about deborah st james the internet was a bottomless pit of information and one did not need to be a genius in order to use it find a search engine type in a name in the world as it was at present one could run but one could not hide deborah st james wasnt even trying to hide what do you want photographed was part of her website design which contained various links showing the nature of her work she was an art photographer if that was the word for it she took the kinds of photos sold in galleries landscapes portraits still lifes dramatic action shots spontaneous moments of life captured in the streets she worked largely in black and white shed had several gallery shows and shed been featured in photographic competitions she was obviously good at what she did but what she did not do was scout locations for anyone let alone for a company called query productions there was no such company alatea had discovered that as well but that was what she did not tell her husband because she knew intuitively where telling nicholas that part of the information was going to lead a logical question had to be asked and nicholas would ask it so what is she doing here then alatea didnt want him to ask that because theyd have to look at the answers what do you want photographed said it all the real matter before them or before alatea herself if the truth be told was what deborah st james intended to do with the pictures yet that was far too fragile a subject to entertain with her husband so alatea had said to nicholas im not comfortable having her round here nicky theres something about her that i dont like nicholas frowned theyd been in bed and hed turned on his side to face her propping his head on his hand he didnt have his glasses on which meant he couldnt see her properly but he still looked as if he was studying her face and what he apparently thought he saw there made him say with a smile because shes a photographer or because shes a woman because darling wife let me tell you this if its the woman part that youre concerned about youre never going to have a single worry on that score hed scooted over to her to prove this declaration and shed allowed this shed wanted it even for the sheer diversion from her thoughts that love with nicholas produced but afterwards the worry and the fear came sweeping back like the tidal bore in morecambe bay there was no escape and the fastrising tide threatened to drown her hed sensed this nicholas was good at that he could read her tension although he could not interpret it hed said whyre you so wound up about this shes a freelance photographer and freelancers get hired to take pictures and to hand them over to whoever hired them thats what shes here to do he moved away on the bed we need a break i think his face looked tender as he spoke weve been working too hard too long youve been up to your ears for months dealing with the house and ive been running between the tower project and barrow so bloody caught up in getting back into my fathers good graces that i havent been paying enough attention to you to how youre feeling to the fact that this is all foreign to you coming here living here to me its home but i havent seen that for you its a foreign country he smiled regretfully addicts are selfish wankers allie im a prime example from this she took up a single strand she said why do you need this a break you this here in bed his smile then and id hope you wouldnt have to ask that last question your father she said why must you get into his good graces when he answered his voice showed his surprise because i made his life hell for years my mothers as well you cannot rewrite the past nicky but i can make amends for it i took years off their lives and i want to give those years back to them if i can wouldnt you want the same in my position life she said is meant to be lived by the individual living it being true to himself what youre doing is living your life in order to be true to someone elses perception of you hed blinked and an expression of hurt touched his features and then dissipated as quickly as it had come upon him he said well have to agree to disagree on this and youll have to wait and see how things turn out how they change for me for you and for the family shed said your family and hed cut in with i dont mean my family i mean our family yours and mine the family we make things are going to continue to get better from this point on youll see in the morning shed tried again but this time it was with a diversion and not with a frontal attack shed said dont go to work today stay with me stay here dont go to the tower his reply of thats a very tempting proposition had given her hope for an instant but he went on to say i must go into work though allie ive taken a day off already nicky youre the son of the owner if you cant take a day off im a line operator in the shipping department someday i might be the son of the owner again but im not there yet they were thus back to where they started alatea knew that this was the point of departure for them he believed he had to prove himself in order to make amends for his past in this manner he would pave a way to the future through illustrating over and over again that he was not who he once had been while she understood this it was not how she lived indeed living in the way nicholas was choosing to live was impossible for her and now there was the matter of query productions and the fact that it did not exist this meant only one thing that the presence of the photographer here in cumbria had nothing at all to do with the work nicholas was doing nothing at all to do with what he was attempting to create with the middlebarrow pele project and nothing at all to do with any intention he had with regard to his parents and to transforming his life that left only one explanation as far as she could see for the photographers presence what do you want photographed said it all alateas descent from the top of arnside knot took more time than the ascent had done the patches of limestone scree were slick after the rain slipping upon the loose stones falling and tumbling down the slope were distinct possibilities so was sliding upon the fallen leaves from the lime and chestnut trees that formed a copse lower down the hill so safety was foremost in her mind as she made her way home in the fastfading daylight safety too took her to the telephone soon after she walked into arnside house she always kept the phone number with her this had been the case since the very first time shed made the call she didnt want to do what she had to do but she couldnt see any other choice available she took out the card managed a few deep breaths punched in the numbers and waited for the connection to go through when it did she asked the only question that mattered to her now i dont mean to pressure you but i do need to know have you considered my offer i have the quiet voice replied and lets meet to talk it over this means youre completely serious about the money yes yes of course im serious then i think i can do what youre asking milnthorpe cumbria lynley tracked them down having what deborah called a most indifferent curry tommy which theyd found in a restaurant called fresh taste of india on church street in milnthorpe st james added were not spoiled for choices it was this take away chinese or pizza i voted for pizza but was overruled theyd finished their meal and were each drinking a rather disturbingly large glass of limoncello which was odd in both its size and the fact that an indian restaurant was serving the italian liqueur at all simon likes me soused after nine in the evening was how deborah explained at least the size of the glass i become putty in his wily hands although i dont expect hes worked out how hes going to get me off the floor out of the restaurant and back to the hotel if i drink this entire thing a trolley st james said he indicated a nearby table with its unoccupied chairs lynley dragged one of them over and joined them anything st james said to him lynley knew he didnt mean food or drink there are motives im finding its becoming a case of turn over a stone and find a motive he ticked them off for his friends an insurance policy with niamh cresswell as the beneficiary the land and the farm going to kaveh mehran the potential loss of funds to mignon fairclough the potential gain of position at fairclough industries by manette or freddie mcghie or for that matter nicholas fairclough niamh cresswells need for revenge theres also something not quite right about cresswells son tim evidently hes a day pupil in a school called margaret fox which turns out to be an institution for troubled children a phone call got me that much but no ones saying anything else about him so troubled could mean anything st james noted it could lynley went on to tell them about the cresswell childrens being unceremoniously dumped first upon their father and his lover and now upon the lover alone the sister manette mcghie was in quite a state about the situation this afternoon who wouldnt be deborah noted thats ghastly tommy i agree the only people so far who dont seem to have motives are fairclough himself and his wife although lynley added thoughtfully i do have the impression that faircloughs holding something back so i have barbara looking at the london end of his life but why ask you to look into matters if hes got something to hide deborah asked thats the question isnt it lynley said it hardly makes sense for a killer whos got away with the murder to head for the cops asking for a closer look as to that hed been to see the forensic pathologist st james told lynley it seemed that all the is had been dotted and all the ts crossed hed had a look at the reports and the xrays and from the latter it was perfectly obvious that ian cresswells skull had been fractured as lynley well knew when a skull was fractured it didnt bear the imprint of that which had fractured it the skull either cracked like an egg with a spiderweb of breaks spreading out from the point of impact or it suffered a lateral break in the form of a semicircle on the surface but in either case one needed to examine the potential instruments that could have caused the fracture in order to decide how it had occurred and lynley asked and this had been done there was blood on one of the stones remaining upon the dock when the others had dislodged and had fallen into the water dna analysis of this blood indicated it had come from ian cresswell there were hairs skin and fibres as well and when they were tested they proved to be from ian cresswell too i tracked down the coroners officers who did the investigation prior to the inquest st james went on there were two of them a former detective from the constabulary offices in barrowinfurness and a paramedic who does this sort of work on the side they felt they were looking at an accident not a murder but they checked all alibis just in case like lynley st james ticked them off consulting a notepad that he withdrew from the breast pocket of his jacket kaveh mehran he said was at home and although the cresswell children could have confirmed this they were not interviewed in order to spare them further trauma valerie fairclough was at home on the estate having entered the house at five in the afternoon after fishing on the lake and not leaving until the next morning when she went out to speak to the gardeners working in her topiary garden mignon fairclough was at home as well although no one could confirm her alibi that she was sending emails since anyone with access to her computer and her password could have been sending emails in her name niamh cresswell was en route to taking the children back to bryan beck farm and afterwards she was en route back to grangeoversands although no one could confirm this leaving both herself and kaveh mehran without confirmable alibis for a period of time lynley noted indeed st james went on manette and freddie mcghie were both at home where they remained for the evening nicholas was at home with his spouse alatea lord fairclough was in london having dinner with a member of the board of his foundation this was a woman called vivienne tully and she confirmed st james concluded of course the essential difficulty resides in the way the man died it does lynley agreed if the stones on the dock were tampered with it could have been done at any time so were back to access which roughly means were back to nearly everyone were back to a closer examination of the dock as well as bringing up the missing stones either that or were back to calling it an accident and calling it a day i suggest a closer examination if fairclough wants to be certain he says he does so we need to get into the boathouse with bright lights and someone needs to get into the water for the stones unless i can convince fairclough to bring this all into the open we may well have to do it on the sly lynley said any idea why hes playing his cards so close lynley shook his head its to do with his son but i dont know why aside from what one would expect which is i cant imagine him wanting his only son to know his father harbours suspicions about him no matter how chequered a past he has hes supposed to have turned over a new leaf after all he was welcomed home with open arms evidently and as you said he has an alibi home with the wife theres that lynley agreed deborah had been listening to all this but at this final mention of nicholas fairclough she brought a sheaf of papers from her handbag she said barbaras faxed me the pages i wanted from conception magazine tommy shes overnighting the magazine itself but in the meantime deborah handed him the pages relevant lynley could see they comprised advertisements both personal and professional she said they fit in with what nicholas told me about wanting to start a family lynley exchanged a look with st james he knew the other man was thinking what he himself was thinking how objective could deborah be if it turned out shed stumbled onto a woman suffering the very same problems as she herself was suffering deborah saw the look she said really you two arent you supposed to remain expressionless in the presence of a suspect lynley smiled sorry force of habit please continue she hmmphed but did so look at what we have here and consider the fact that alatea or someone tore these pages from the magazine the someone part of it might be important st james pointed out i dont think its likely someone else removed them do you look we have advertisements for just about anything you can think of relating to the process of reproduction we have ads for solicitors whore specialists in private adoptions ads for sperm banks ads from lesbian couples looking for sperm donors ads for adoption agencies ads for solicitors specialising in surrogacy ads looking for university girls willing to have their eggs harvested ads looking for university boys willing to make regular deposits of semen for a price its become an industry courtesy of modern science lynley gauged the passion in deborahs voice and considered what it might mean especially as it applied to nicholas fairclough and his wife he said protecting ones wife is important to a man deb fairclough might well have seen the magazine and torn these pages out so alatea wouldnt come across them perhaps she said but that hardly means alatea never knew they were there all right but how does this relate to ian cresswells death i dont know yet but if youre exploring every possible avenue tommy then this has to be one of them lynley looked again at st james the other man said i daresay shes right deborahs expression registered her surprise the fact that her husband chronically and to deborah infuriatingly attempted to protect her from pain had long been an issue between them born of the fact that hed known her since she was seven years old born of the fact that he was eleven years her senior she said i think i need a second go with alatea tommy i can establish a bond with her it will be easy enough if shes having my sort of trouble only a woman can know what thats like believe me lynley was careful at this point not to look at st james he knew how deborah would take it if he appeared to be asking her husband for permission like someone stepping out of a victorian novel so he said i agree another go is in order see what else you can find out about her he didnt add that she should have a care he knew that st james would make sure of that november bryanbarrow cumbria yaffa shaw was turning out to be pure gold much to zed benjamins surprise and delight not only was she amusing to speak to on the phone each day her performance as a woman besotted should have earned her a bafta he decided but she was also a twentyfourcarat helpmate in his efforts he didnt know how shed managed it but shed sweettalked her way into looking at ian cresswells will instead of attending university on the previous day shed taken the train to york where a clerk in the probate office had apparently been so smitten by her charms that hed slipped her the cresswell document for a looksee and a looksee was all she needed the woman had a bloody photographic memory as things turned out she phoned and recited the bequests thus saving zed a trip south and a wait for however long it took for the documents to be copied and posted to him she was in short entirely wonderful so he said i adore you she said im blushing and to his mother who was of course hovering somewhere nearby your son is actually making me blush mrs b she made some kissing noises into the phone zed made some back forgetting himself in his enthusiasm over her discovery then he remembered himself he also remembered micah waiting for yaffas return to tel aviv wasnt life full of irony he thought after a suitable exchange of auditory hugs and vociferous kisses they ended their call and zed reflected on the information he had despite rodney aronsons direction as to what he was supposed to be doing in cumbria zed decided that an attack on the opposing armys flank was in order he wasnt going to speak to george cowley about what he might and might not know about that farm though he was going to speak to the mans son thus he got himself up to bryanbarrow village early the willow and well with its windows conveniently situated to give a view of bryan beck farm was not open yet so zed had to wait in his car which he parked to one side of the village green this was misery for him because of his size but it couldnt be helped leg cramps and the distinct possibility of deepvein thrombosis were a small price to pay for an interview that might gain him everything of course it was raining it was a wonder to zed that the entire lake district wasnt a swamp considering the weather the endless precipitation along with the days cold kept steaming up the windscreen of his car as he waited for daniel cowley to appear he kept wiping it off with the back of his hand which was doing nothing but getting his shirtsleeves wet as the condensation began to drip down his arm finally the boy appeared zed reckoned he went to school in windermere this was going to necessitate one of two things either his father was going to drive him there or he was going to catch a school bus it didnt matter which because in any case zed was going to talk to him hed waylay him on his way into the school or hed offer him a lift as he hoofed it to the bus stop which sure as hell wasnt going to be out here in the middle of nowhere the latter turned out to be the case daniel trudged across the green around the corner and out of the village his head lowered and his trousers and shoes already beginning to pick up mud zed gave him ten minutes reckoning that he was heading for the main road through the lyth valley it was quite a walk by the time he pulled up next to daniel the boy was thoroughly soaked since like most boys his age he wasnt about to be seen dead or alive carrying an umbrella social suicide that would be as someone who had endured social suicide on a daily basis during his own school years zed understood this completely he lowered the window you need a lift somewhere daniel looked over his eyebrows drew together he glanced left and right and evaluated the question as the rain continued to pelt him he finally said i remember you you a pervert or something because if you lay a hand on me relax zed told him this is your lucky day im into girls tomorrow would be risky come on get in daniel gave an eye roll at zeds weak joke then he complied he dropped into the passengers seat and began dripping all over it he said sorry in reference to this not to worry zed set off he was determined to milk the kid for whatever he could so he drove slowly he kept his eyes on the road as a way of excusing the lack of speed paranoid visitor worried about hitting either a sheep or sasquatch daniel said whatre you doing round here again anyway zed had already reckoned on his opening which daniel himself had inadvertently given him you seem worried about the local colour what the boy screwed up his face the pervert remark who wouldnt be daniel said with a shrug places crawling with them well the whole bloody districts thick with sheep eh zed remarked with a wink no ones safe i reckon the boy observed him with that adolescent expression that telegraphed youre a bloody idiot far more effectively than words would have done zed said just a joke too early in the morning where can i drop you lyth valley i catch the school bus there where to windermere i can drive you there if you like no problem im heading that way the boy backed away clearly this was pervert territory he said what dyou want anyway you didnt tell me why youre in the village again whats going on too clever by seveneighths zed thought bloody hell relax he said ill drop you off wherever you like want to get out now daniel looked at the rain he said just dont try anything ill punch you right in the adams apple and dont think i wont i know how to do it my dad showed me and believe me it works better than the bollocks a hell of a lot better wonderful skill zed agreed he had to manoeuvre the kid into the conversation he wanted before they reached the lyth valley and he started screaming bloody murder or worse so he said sounds like he worries about you your dad right well we got perverts living next door to us dont we pretend they just lodge together but we know the truth dad says you cant be too careful round blokes like that and now its worse why hallelujah zed thought cause one of thems dead and the others going to be on the look for someone new that sounded like a remark coming directly from the horses youknowwhat i see zed said could be the otherll just move on though wouldnt you say thats what dads waiting for daniel said hes buying the farm once it goes up for sale what that sheep farm you two live on that was the one daniel told him he brushed his sopping hair from his forehead and settled in for something of a natter he seemed more comfortable with a subject that didnt deal with perverts as he called them because he adjusted the heat in the car to a tropical level and dug in his rucksack for a banana which he proceeded to eat he informed zed that his dad wanted the farm mostly because he wanted something to pass on to daniel himself this daniel said was dead stupid because there was no way in hell that he intended to be a sheep farmer daniel wanted out of the lakes entirely he wanted to join the raf they buzzed the lake district did zed know that wicked jets flying about three hundred feet off the ground okay maybe five hundred feet and youd be walking along when all of a sudden one of them would come roaring down the valley or just above lake windermere and it was bloody wicked it was told my dad that about a thousand times daniel said he thinks he can keep me home though all he needs is that farm to do it he loved his dad daniel said but he didnt want the kind of life his dad had lived look at the fact that daniels own mother deserted them she hadnt wanted that kind of life either but still his dad didnt understand i keep telling him he should do what hes good at anyway everyone should amen to that zed thought but he said whats that then daniel hesitated zed glanced at him the boy looked distinctly uncomfortable this could be the moment zed realised the kid was about to confess that what george cowley was good at was offing blokes who lived on the farm he wanted to buy silver gold platinum and the rest zed was about to be handed the scoop of his life making dollhouse furniture daniel mumbled say again dollhouse furniture furniture that goes into dollhouses dont you know what that is shit damn hell zed thought daniel went on hes bloody good at it sounds daft i know but thats what he does sells it on the internet as fast as he can make it i tell him he should be making it fulltime instead of walking round in the muck with the bloody sheep he says its a hobby and i should be able to tell the difference between a hobby and someones life work daniel shook his head for him its that stupid farm or nothing is it indeed zed wondered and what was cowley going to do next when he learned the farm legally belonged to kaveh mehran via ian cresswells will daniel pointed to an enormous oak sitting just inside a drystone wall that was where zed could set him down he said and thanks for the ride by the way zed pulled over and daniel got out at the same moment zeds mobile rang he gave it a glance and saw it was london rodney aronson ringing it was a bit early for rodney even to be at work and this didnt bode well good news though was that zed could report progress at last after this conversation with daniel cowley watch your back was what rodney said to him however without preamble why whats happened scotland yard knows youre there keep your head down when it was six feet eight inches in the air zed wondered and keep your eyes on nick fairclough thats where youll find whoevers been sent up there to dig into ian cresswells death barrowinfurness cumbria manette didnt want to face the fact that her former husband hadnt come home on the previous night more she didnt want to face how she felt about that fact but it was difficult not to do so theyd talked the subject of their broken marriage right into the ground over the years theyd touched upon every aspect of what had happened to them and what might have happened and what would definitely happen if they didnt make some sort of change theyd decided ultimately that the lack of romance had done them in the gettingdowntobusiness aspect of every part of their lives and particularly the utter lack of surprise theyd become a couple who had to check their diaries and make appointments for an interlude of intercourse during which they both had been pretending for ages to feel something that they did not feel for each other at the end of what had seemed like hundreds of hours of dialogue theyd decided that friendship was more important than passion anyway so theyd live as friends and enjoy each others company because at the end of the day theyd always enjoyed being together and how many couples could actually say that more than twenty years along the line but now freddie hadnt come home and when he was home hed taken to whistling in the mornings as he got ready for work worse hed taken to singing while he was in the shower freddie singing for gods sake and he always chose the same damn song which was driving her bonkers anyway it was that bloody call to arms from les miserables and manette knew if she had to hear the blood of the martyrs will water the meadows of france one more time she might water the meadows of the bathroom with freddies blood only she wouldnt not freddie she would never hurt freddie she went to his office at work hed removed his jacket and was bent over his desk in his crisp white shirt and his red necktie with the ducklings on it and he was reviewing a massive set of computer printouts more investigation into the books preparatory to stepping into ians job should her father offer it to him if he had any sense he would she said from the doorway so how was scorpio freddie looked up his expression told her he had no idea what she was talking about but he reckoned it was zodiac signs she said the nightclub where you and the latest date were meeting he said oh scorpio he laid the printout on his neatasapin desk we didnt go in actually we met at the door good lord freddie was it directly to bed after that youre a sly one he blushed manette wondered at what point in their marriage shed stopped noticing how often he blushed and how the colour washed across his cheeks from his ears after making his ears go completely red at the tips she also wondered when it was shed stopped admiring how nicely his ears lay against his head like perfect shells he laughed no no he said but everyone going inside the place looked round nineteen years old and most of them were dressed like the cast of rocky horror picture show so we went for a meal at a wine bar rigatoni puttanesca it wasnt very good rather heavy on the putta and light on the nesca as things turned out he smiled at his own silly joke and added in his usual appealingly honest fashion i didnt come up with that sarah did thats her name sarah at least manette thought it wasnt another shrub shed rather been expecting ivy or juneshortforjuniper as his second foray into internet dating but of course ivy wasnt a shrub was it more like a vine so she shook herself mentally what was going on inside her head she said and although she didnt actually want to know are there grisly details i have no life as you well know so im taking the opportunity for vicarious excitement she sauntered into his office and sat in the chair next to his desk he blushed more deeply this time i dont like to kiss and tell he said but you did it didnt you did it what kind of term is did it she cocked her head and sent him a meaningful look freddie well yes i mean i explained all that to you how things are these days you know when people go out together so well yes we did more than once she hated herself for asking but suddenly she had to know and the reason she had to know was that in all the years theyd been together even when theyd been twenty years old and hot for each other during the six months that they had actually been hot for each other she and freddie had never locked themselves into a passionate embrace more than once in a twentyfourhour period freddies reaction was a look of gentlemanly shock he said manette good lord there are some things so you did more than once more than with holly freddie are you taking precautions i think weve talked enough about this he replied with dignity so what about tonight are you seeing someone else tonight who is it tonight actually im seeing sarah again manette crossed one leg over the other she wished for a cigarette shed smoked when she was in her twenties and although she hadnt thought about cigarettes in years she suddenly wanted the comfort of doing something with her hands as it was she reached for a container of paper clips and played with it she said im curious about this since youve done it already and thats been got out of the way what comes next family photos or do you get on to surnames and communicable diseases he looked at her strangely manette reckoned he was evaluating her remark weighing it and matching its weight to a response that equaled but did not exceed it before he could say what she knew he was about to say youre upset about this why weve been divorced for ages and weve decided on friendship but i never intended to be celibate for the rest of my life she went on with well will you be home tonight at all or should i expect you to be spending it with sarah again he shrugged but still his face maintained that expression which was something stuck between curious and confused he said i dont know actually of course how could you sorry anyway i hope you bring her home id like to meet her just give me fair warning so i dont show up at the breakfast table without my knickers on will do of course i mean the other night was rather a spontaneous thing i mean with holly i didnt quite know then how these things tend to develop now that i do well of course there are arrangements arent there and explanations and whatnot it was manettes turn to look curious it wasnt like freddie to stumble round with his words she said whats going on god freddie you didnt run off and do something something rather mad did you she didnt know what that madness would have been but madness of any kind was out of character for freddie he was an arrow straight and true he said no no its just that i didnt tell her about well about you what you didnt say youre divorced she knows that of course but i didnt tell her that you and i well that we live in the same house holly knew though that didnt seem to be a problem for her lots of blokes have female flatmates and such yes of course but sarah it felt different being with sarah it felt like a risk that i didnt want to take he picked up the printouts and he tapped them neatly together on the top of his desk he said ive been out of action for ages manette as you well know im going by feel with these women she said tartly im sure you are shed actually come to his office to talk to him about tim and gracie and about her conversation with her father as well but now that conversation didnt feel right to manette and as freddie himself had just pointed out in a new situation one was wise to go by feel she got to her feet she said i wont expect to see you then just take care all right i wouldnt like to see you i dont know hurt or anything before he could reply she got herself out of his office and set off in search of her brother she told herself that freddie had his own life and she had hers and it was time she did something about that latter fact just as freddie was doing she didnt know what that something was going to be though she couldnt imagine launching herself into the unknown world of internet dating into bed with total strangers to see if a proper fit existed she shuddered to her that seemed to be a recipe for being cooked in a serial killers oven but perhaps shed been watching too many detective programmes on the telly over the years she found nicholas in the shipping department a warehouse that served as a modest step up from where hed laboured the previous six months then hed been working on the tops of cisterns the bowls of toilets and kitchen sinks seeing to the application of porcelain to the moulded clay and sliding them into the enormous kiln in that part of the factory the heat was intolerable and the noise was just as bad but nicholas had been successful there in fact hed been successful in every job hed been placed in during the last two years manette knew he was working his way through all possible jobs in the factory shed developed a grudging admiration for this although the why of his doing it gave her a bit of concern surely he couldnt think that a few years of puttering round fairclough industries superseded the decades she and freddie had worked there surely he didnt expect to be named managing director once their father stepped aside the thought was ludicrous todays employment for nicholas involved bathroom basins manette saw at the loading dock with a clipboard in one hand and a pen in the other he was comparing sizes and styles on shipping boxes to sizes and styles on an order the basins had been delivered on a pallet by a forklift once nicholas had checked them off he would load them into a waiting lorry the driver of which had reversed it to the shipping gate and was waiting round smoking and generally being unhelpful because the huge shipping doors were open to the lorry it was cold in the warehouse it was noisy as well because there was music blasting from speakers in the building as if someones proclivity for carlos santana oldies might raise the ambient temperature a bit manette approached her brother he looked up and gave her a nod of hello above the music she shouted asking him if she could have a word his response of its not near my break time irritated her she said for gods sake nick i think you can take five minutes without being sacked we have a shipment going out hes waiting by he nicholas meant the lorry driver who didnt look exactly desperate to be on his way hed gone to the drivers side of the lorry and had opened its door true but he emerged with a thermos from which he poured himself something that steamed in the air he looked happy enough for the break in his routine she said i need to speak to you its important ask permission if you want to or shall i do that for you her brothers supervisor was approaching anyway he tilted his hard hat back on his head greeted her and called her mrs mcghie which rather stabbed at her heart although it was indeed her legal surname she said cn i have a word with nicholas mr perkins its rather important a family matter she said this last as a way of reminding the man as if he needed reminding who nicholas was mr perkins looked towards the lorry and clocked the lounging driver before saying five nick and moving off manette led the way to a quieter location which turned out to be round the side of the warehouse this was the gathering place for smokers she saw for although none were present at the moment the ground was littered with evidence of their presence she made a mental note to talk to freddie about this then she crossed out the note and made a second one telling herself to handle it on her own she said to her brother its tim and gracie and she gave him the story with all its ins and outs niamhs intentions kavehs responsibilities their fathers position in the matter tims distress gracies future needs she ended with we need to do something about all this nick and we need to do it soon if we wait theres no telling what tim might get up to hes that damaged by whats gone on her brother removed the gloves he was wearing from a pocket he took out a tube of thick lotion he began to apply this to his hands she gave idle thought to the reason for this keeping them soft for alatea no doubt alatea was a woman for whom a man would want to have soft hands indeed nicholas said isnt it niamhs job to handle how the children are coping and everything else along those lines well of course it is in the natural course of events mothers are the carers and their children receive the care but niamhs not going the natural course not that she ever has since ian left her as you very well know manette watched her brother massage the lotion into his hands for nearly two years hed been doing manual labour not only at the factory but also out on the pele project near arnside but one would never know it from looking at his fingers his nails and his palms they were like a womans only larger someone has to step up to the mark believe it or not niamh has every intention of leaving those children with kaveh mehran hes a good bloke kaveh i quite like him dont you its not about liking him for gods sake nick hes not even their family look im as liberal minded as anyone and while they were living with their father that was fine by me better with ian in a household where there was love enough to go round than with niamh breathing fire brimstone and revenge all over them but its not working out and tims it has to have time to work out doesnt it nick said it seems to me that ians not been gone long enough for anyone to decide whats best for his children that may be the case but in the meantime they should be with family if not with their mother then with one of us nick i know there was no love lost between you and ian he was hard on you he didnt trust you he discouraged dad from trusting you as well but one of us must provide those children with a sense of security of familiarity and why not mum and dad then god knows they have enough space at ireleth hall ive spoken to dad and got nowhere manette felt a growing need to bend her brothers will to her own this should have been a simple matter because talking nicholas into something had always been childs play which was one of the reasons his youth had been such a troubled one anyone could have talked him into anything she said look i know what youre trying to do and i admire you for it so does dad so do we all well except mignon but youre not to take that personally since she doesnt know anyone exists on the planet other than herself he glanced her way he gave her a smile he knew mignon as well as she did she said this would be another plank in the structure youre building for yourself nick if you do this if you take the children it makes your position stronger it shows commitment it shows how capable you are of taking on more responsibility plus youre closer to margaret fox school than kaveh and you can take tim there on your way to work speaking of that nicholas pointed out youre closer to margaret fox school than i am youre practically in the neighbourhood why not you then nick manette knew she was going to have to tell him the truth so she made it brief freddie and dating and the new world of sex as soon as possible which ended up with previously unknown women at the breakfast table hardly a suitable situation into which one might bring children was it nicholas had kept his eyes fastened on her face as she told him this he said im sorry when she was finished and he went on lest she think he was saying he was sorry as a way of refusing her request to take on the children i know what freddie really means to you manette even if you dont were his words she looked away blinking hard she said be that as it may you see ive got to get back to work he put his arm round her and kissed the side of her head he said let me talk to allie about this okay somethings bothering her at the moment i dont know what she hasnt said yet but she will we dont have secrets between us so shell bring me into the picture in a bit until then youll have to give me some time okay im not saying no about tim and gracie arnside cumbria he knew nothing about fishing but that was hardly the point zed benjamin understood that the point was not to catch fish or even hope to catch fish but rather to look like he was fishing so hed borrowed a rod from the tottering owner of his b amp b who gave him chapter and verse on her late husband and the wasted hours hed spent with his fishing line in the waters of this lake that stream or whatever bay she handed over a tackle basket as well along with a slicker that fit zeds arm but nothing else and a pair of wellingtons that were altogether useless to him she pressed a folding stool upon him and wished him luck her husband she told him had had virtually none according to her the man had caught fifteen fish in twentyfive years he could see the record if he wanted to because shed kept it every time the bloody man left the house and returned emptyhanded could be hed been having an affair she said because when one really put ones head to the matter zed had thanked her hastily and had driven to arnside where he found with thanks to god that the tide was in hed established himself on the seawall path just beneath nicholas faircloughs house and there hed cast his line into the water the line was baitless the last thing he wanted was actually to catch a fish and have to do something with it like touch it now that scotland yard knew that he was in the vicinity he had to take care once they clocked him whoever they were his job was going to be even more difficult he needed to know exactly who they were assuming it was a they because didnt they work in teams like on the telly because if he could suss them out before they sussed him out his position to strike a deal was going to be a hell of a lot stronger for if they were here on the sly then the last thing they would want was to have their mugs printed on the front page of the source alerting nicholas fairclough to their presence not to mention to their intentions zed had reckoned theyd turn up at arnside house eventually he was there to take note when that occurred the stool had been an excellent idea after he took up his position along the seawall he alternated between standing and taking a load off as the hours passed but nothing of a suspicious nature or any nature at all happened across the lawn at arnside house and he was growing rather desperate to learn something anything useful to his story when alatea fairclough finally came outside she walked straight towards him and his thought was bloody bloody double bloody hell he was about to be discovered before hed learned a damn thing useful and wasnt that just how his luck was running these days but she stopped far short of the seawall and stood looking out at the endlessly undulating mass of the bay her expression was sombre zed reckoned she was thinking about all the people whod met an untimely end in this area like those poor chinese sods more than fifty of them caught in the darkness in the incoming tide and phoning home like et desperate for rescue that did not come or the bloke and his son caught by the tide and a sudden fog bank and disoriented round by foghorns that seemed to come from everywhere considering this zed reckoned the edge of morecambe bay was a perishing depressing place to live and alatea fairclough looked about as perishing depressed as one could get hell he thought was she considering the possibilities of offing herself out there in the treacherous waters he hoped not hed be meant to rescue her and theyd both likely die if it came to that he was too far to hear its ringing but alateas mobile phone seemed to go off because she took it from the jacket she was wearing and flipped it open she spoke to someone she began to pace ultimately she looked at her watch which glittered on her wrist even at this distance she glanced round as if worried she might be observed and zed ducked his head god she was a beautiful woman he thought he couldnt understand how she had ended up here in the back of beyond when a woman like her belonged on a catwalk or at least in a catalogue wearing skimpy knickers like those agent provocateur models with their sumptuous bosoms bursting out of brassieres and the brassieres always matching their knickers and the knickers themselves showing lots and lots of firm and delicious thigh so that one could so easily imagine all the delights of zed brought himself up short what the hell was going on with him he was being completely unfair to womankind thinking like this he was particularly being unfair to yaffa who was back in london working on his behalf and helping out with the insanity of his mother and but what was the point of thinking about yaffa since micah was on the back burner of her life studying medicine in tel aviv like the good son of a mother which zed himself was not he bashed his forehead with the heel of his palm he took a chance and cast a look back at alatea fairclough she was heading back towards the house now her phone call finished for a time that appeared to be the highlight of zeds day wonderful he thought another nought to add to the noughts of his accomplishments in cumbria he spent another two hours pretending to fish before he began to pack it in and consider what to do next things changed however as he was trudging back in the direction of the promenade and his car which hed left in arnside village hed just reached the end of the seawall that defined the boundary of arnside house when a car approached and made the turn into the driveway it was driven by a woman she looked as if she knew where she was going she pulled up to the front of the house and got out and zed crept as well as a man six feet eight inches tall can actually creep back the way hed come like him she was a redhead she was casually dressed in jeans boots and a thick wool sweater the colour of moss he expected her to walk directly to the front door some friend of alateas come to call he reckoned but she did not do so instead she began to prowl round the house like a thirdrate burglar moreover she took out a digital camera from her shoulder bag and started taking pictures ultimately she approached the front door and rang the bell she waited looking round her as if to see if anyone like zed himself might be lurking in the shrubbery while she waited she took out her mobile and seemed to check it for text messages or something then the front door opened and without an exchange of more than ten words alatea fairclough let her into the house but she sure as bloody hell did not look happy about having to do so zed realised he also realised with a surge of pure joy that his wait had paid off he had the scoop he needed he had the sex in the story he had the identity of the detective sent up from london from new scotland yard arnside cumbria when alatea answered the door deborah instantly read the alarm in her expression it was out of all proportion to the appearance on her doorstep of anyone other than a surprise visitor intent upon harming her so for a moment deborah was taken aback she scrambled for words and came up with i have a feeling mr fairclough isnt at home but its not mr fairclough i need anyway this promptly made things worse what do you want alatea said abruptly she looked beyond deborahs shoulder as if expecting someone else to come charging round the corner of the building nickys at work she glanced at her watch an enormous gold and rhinestone affair that suited her well but would have looked ridiculous on a woman less dramatic in appearance hell be on his way to the pele project by now not a problem deborah said cheerfully i was taking some shots of the exterior to give the producer an idea of setting and where he can conduct his interviews the lawnll work wonderfully especially if the tides in when theyre here but theres always a chance itll be pouring buckets isnt there so im hoping to get some shots of the interior of the house as well would that be all right i dont want to trouble you it shouldnt take long itll be very informal alateas throat worked with a swallow she didnt move from the doorway a quarter of an hour i expect deborah tried to sound jolly nothing to fear from me its the drawing room im interested in actually theres good ambient light and some background interest as well reluctant didnt do justice to the manner in which alatea admitted deborah into the house deborah could feel tension virtually oozing from the woman and she was forced to wonder if alatea had a man other than her husband inside somewhere playing at polonius behind a convenient arras they went towards the yellow drawing room passing the main hall whose sliding doors were closed these revealed more impressive panelling along with windows combining translucent glass and stained glass fashioned in the shape of red tulips and green leaves someone deborah decided could indeed have been lurking in that room but she couldnt imagine who it might be she made light chat the house was remarkable she told alatea had it been featured in any magazines the arts and crafts movement was so clean and sympathetic wasnt it was alatea interested at all in a documentary about the restoration of this building had she been approached by any of the myriad television programmes that featured period homes to all of this alateas answers were monosyllabic bonding with the woman was not going to be a simple matter deborah concluded in the drawing room she switched to another topic how did alatea like living in england it had to be very different from what she was used to in argentina deborah expected here alatea looked startled how do you know im from argentina your husband told me deborah wanted to add why is there a problem with your being from argentina but she did not instead she examined the room the object was to get alatea over to the bay window where the magazines were so deborah took a few shots of prospective areas in which interviews could occur easing over in that direction when she got there though the first thing she saw was that conception was gone from the fan of journals this was going to make things tricky but not impossible deborah took a photo of the two chairs and the low table in front of the bay window adjusting for the light outside so as to show both interior and exterior equally she said as she did so you and i have something in common mrs fairclough she looked up from her camera and offered a smile alatea was standing by the door as if ready to bolt she gave a polite smile and looked supremely doubtful if they had something in common it was clear she hadnt a clue what it was aside from being women who were at the moment standing in the same room of her house deborah said were both trying for a baby your husband told me he saw id seen the magazine conception she added a helpful lie ive been reading it for ages well for five years now thats how long simon and i thats my husband have been trying alatea said nothing to this but deborah saw her swallow as her eyes moved to the table where the magazine had lain deborah wondered if shed removed it herself or if nicholas had done so she wondered too if nicholas worried about his wifes state of mind and state of body as simon worried about her own she said as she took another photo we started out au naturel simon and i hoping that nature would take its course we went from there to monitoring everything from my monthly cycles to my daily temperature to the phases of the moon she forced a chuckle it wasnt pleasant to reveal this sort of thing to anyone but deborah saw the importance of doing so and even the potential for comfort that such a revelation could bring then there were the tests she said which simon less than adored i can tell you after that were the endless discussions about alternatives visits to specialists and talks about the other possibilities for parenthood she paused in her photographing to say to alatea with a shrug turns out ill never carry a baby to term somethings wrong with the way i was manufactured were onto adoption now or something else id like surrogacy but simons not on board the argentine woman had come into the room closer now but still at a distance her colour had altered deborah saw and she was clasping and unclasping her elegant hands her eyes were bright with unshed tears deborah knew what she was looking at shed felt the same for years she said quickly im terribly sorry as i said i saw the magazine when i was here earlier your husband said you and he were trying he said youd been married two years and mrs fairclough im very sorry i hadnt meant to upset you please here sit down alatea did sit although not where deborah would have wished it she chose the inglenook of the fireplace a padded seat just beneath a stained glass window that sent light streaming onto her crinkly hair deborah approached her but remained a safe distance saying its difficult i know i actually lost six before i found out the truth about my body they might be able to do something about it someday all things about science considered but by then ill probably be too old a tear streaked down alateas cheek she adjusted her position as if this would keep her from shedding more tears in front of a relative stranger deborah said i find it odd that something so simple for some women is a complete impossibility for others deborah kept expecting the other woman to respond in some way other than with tears to admit to a fellow feeling somehow but alatea did not and the only thing left was for deborah to admit the why behind her intense desire to have a child which had to do in part with the fact that her husband was disabled a cripple he called himself and in part with what that disabling had done to his sense of himself as a man but she had no intention of going to that place in conversation with alatea fairclough it was difficult enough admitting it to herself so she settled on another course altogether she said i think this room has better possibilities for a filmed interview than what i saw outside and actually where youre sitting is a wonderful location because of the light if you wouldnt mind id like to take a quick photo of you there to illustrate no alatea leaped to her feet deborah took a step backwards its for no no tell me who you are alatea cried tell me why youre really here tell me tell me november bryanbarrow cumbria tim hoped it was toyyou when his mobile chimed because he was sick with the waiting but it was bloody stupid manette she acted as if hed done nothing to her she said she was ringing to talk about their camping adventure that was what she called it an adventure as if they were going to africa or something and not where they would probably end up which was in someones bloody paddock where theyd be cheek by jowl with sodding tourists from manchester she said cheerfully lets get the date into our diaries shall we well want to go before it gets much later in the year we can cope with the rain but if it snows were done for what dyou say what he said was why dont you leave me alone she said tim in that patient voice adults tended to use when they thought he was barking which was most of the time he said look drop it all this bollocks about you care about me i do care about you we all care about you good grief tim youre dont give me that shit all you ever cared about was my father and dont you think i know that all anyone cared about was that filthy bastard and hes dead and im glad so leave me alone you dont mean any of that i bloody well do no you dont you loved your father he hurt you badly but it wasnt really about you dearest what he did she waited as if for a reply from him but he wouldnt give her the satisfaction of hearing anything in his voice she said tim im sorry it happened but he wouldnt have done it if he could have seen any other way to live with himself you dont understand that now but you will truly you will someday you dont know what the fuck youre talking about i know this is difficult for you tim how could it be otherwise but your father adored you we all love you your family all of us want you to be shut up he screamed leave me alone he ended the call with his insides raging it was her tone that bloody soothing motherly tone of hers it was what she said it was everything in his life he threw his mobile onto his bed his body felt strung as tight as part of a highwire act he needed air he went to the window of his bedroom and forced it open it was cold outside but who bloody cared outside across the farmyard george cowley and dan came out of their cottage they were talking heads bent as if what they were saying to each other was of deadly importance then they approached georges wreck of a car a land rover thoroughly crusted with mud not to mention sheep shit which was thick in its tyre treads george opened the drivers door and hauled himself inside but daniel didnt go round and get in as well instead he squatted next to the door and fixed his attention on the pedals and his fathers feet george spoke and gestured and worked the pedals up down in out whatever he climbed out of the wreck and dan got in in his place dan worked the pedals in a similar fashion while george nodded gestured and nodded some more dan started the ignition then as his father continued to talk to him george closed the door and dan rolled down the window the vehicle was parked in such a way that he didnt need to reverse it to set it going and george gestured round the triangular green dan set off first time with the clutch the accelerator and the brakes he went in fits starts and lurches george ran alongside the vehicle like a thirdrate carjacker shouting and waving his arms the land rover got ahead of him lurched and stalled george dashed over said a few words into the drivers window and reached inside watching this tim reckoned the farmer was going to give dan a smack on the head but what george did was ruffle his hair and laugh and dan laughed as well he started the land rover again they went through the process a second time this time with george remaining behind and shouting encouragement dan did a better job and george punched the air tim turned from the window stupid gits he thought two lame bastards like father like son dand end up just like his dad walking in sheep shit somewhere loser he was double loser triple he was such a loser that he needed to be wiped from the face of the earth and tim wanted to do it now at once without a pause storming from the house with a gun or a knife or a club only he had none of these and he needed them so badly the worst how he wanted tim strode from his room he heard gracies voice and kavehs answer and he went in that direction he found them in the picture room at the top of the stairs an alcove that kaveh used for his office the bugger was sitting at a drafting table working on something and gracie dumb old stupid gracie was at his feet with that bloody stupid doll in her arms and wasnt she even rocking it and crooning to it and didnt she need to be brought to her senses and wasnt it time she just grew up anyway and what better way to do it gracie screamed like hed stuck her in the arse with a pole when he grabbed the doll he said fucking bloody idiot for gods sake and he slammed the doll against the edge of the drafting table before he pulled off her arms and her legs and threw her down he snarled grow up and get a life you freak and he spun and made for the stairs he stormed down them and out of the door and behind him he heard gracies cries which should have felt good to him but didnt and then there was kavehs voice calling his name and the sound of kaveh coming after him kaveh of all people kaveh whod created this whole pile of shit that was his life he thudded past george cowley and daniel who were standing by the land rover and while he didnt need even to go near them he did anyway just so he could shove that limpwrist daniel out of the way george yelled just you bloody fuck you tim cut in he needed he wanted he had to find something because everything was cresting inside of him his very blood was cresting and he knew if he didnt find something his head would explode and the blood and the brains would surge out of him and while that didnt matter a whit he didnt want it to be this way and there was kaveh calling his name telling him to stop telling him to wait only that was the last thing hed ever do wait for kaveh mehran around the side of the pub and through a garden and there was bryan beck on the stream the village ducks floated and on the opposite bank wild mallards rooted through the heavytopped grass for slugs or worms or whatever the hell it was that they ate and oh god how he wanted to feel one of them all of them crushed beneath his fist or his feet it didnt matter just to have something die die die tim was in the water without knowing he was in the water the ducks scattered he flailed at them shouting was coming from every direction and some of it he realised was coming from him and then he was grabbed strong arms came round him and a voice in his ear said no you mustnt you dont mean to its all right and goddamn it was the bumboy himself the limp wrist the queer he had his arms and his hands on tim and he was holding him god he was actually holding him touching him the filth the filth the filth get away tim shrieked he fought kaveh held on harder tim stop kaveh cried you dont mean to do this come away quickly they wrestled in the water like two greased monkeys till tim squirmed away and kaveh fell back he landed on his bum and the frigid water was up to his waist and he was struggling to get back to his feet and tim felt such triumph because what he wanted was the stupid git struggling he wanted to show him he wanted to prove im not a butt fucker he screamed keep your fucking hands off me you hear me find someone else kaveh watched him he was breathing hard and so was tim but something came over his face and what it was not was what tim wanted it to be which was hurt devastation destruction kaveh said of course youre not tim did you think you might be shut up tim yelled in reply he turned and ran he left kaveh sitting in bryan beck water to his waist watching him run great urswick cumbria manette had managed to get the tent raised by herself it hadnt been easy and although she had always been excessively competent when it came to anything that required her to follow instructions she hadnt done her usual perfect job with erecting the poles and the canvas not to mention plunging the stakes into the ground so she reckoned the whole thing would collapse on her but she crawled inside anyway and sat buddhalike in the opening facing the pond at the bottom of the garden freddie had knocked on her bathroom door and said he needed to speak with her shed said of course and could he give her a few minutes she was just whatever he hurriedly said absolutely as if the last thing he wanted to know was what she was doing in the bathroom and who could blame him really there were some forms of intimacy that were far too intimate she hadnt been doing anything shed been killing time shed sensed something was going on with freddie when theyd met at the coffeemaker midmorning shed come down from her room hed come in from outside and since hed entered wearing what hed been wearing the previous day she knew hed spent the night with sarah wily one that sarah manette reckoned she knew a gem when she saw it so when freddie asked to speak with her she reckoned the boom was going to fall hed seen in sarah a potential to be the one or perhaps manette thought wryly the two since she herself had been the one at any rate he probably wanted to bring her home this very night or move her into the house soon and she wondered how she was going to cope with that obviously theyd have to sell the house and go their separate ways she didnt want to do that because she loved this place not so much the house which admittedly was rather pokey but this particular little spot that had been her haven for years it was indeed all about the place itself and having to leave it this disquiet she was feeling it was about the silence of great urswick about the canopy of stars that hung above the village at night it was about the pond and the resident swans that floated placidly on it and only occasionally went after an overly enthusiastic dog who stupidly tried to chase them and it was about the old paintflecked rowingboat tied to the dock and the fact that she could take it out onto the water and watch the sunrise or the sunset or sit in the rain if she wanted to she supposed it was really all about roots having them planted somewhere and not wanting them to be torn out because transplanting often killed the plant and she didnt know what it was going to feel like when she herself had to move on this wasnt about freddie she told herself this wasnt about sarah or any other woman freddie might finally choose how could it be when she herself had been the one to bring up the spark and how they had lost it she and freddie it was absolutely utterly and irrevocably gone and didnt he agree with her at heart manette couldnt recall the expression on freddies face when she had initiated this painful conversation had he disagreed she couldnt remember he was always so bloody affable about everything it should have come as no surprise to her that hed been equally affable about the idea that their marriage was as dead as roadkill and shed been relieved then now however she couldnt remember why on earth shed been so relieved what had she been expecting of marriage after all high drama sparks and falling all over each other like randy teenagers every night who could sustain that who would want to you and freddie mignon had said divorcing youd better have a long look at whats out there these days before you take that step but this wasnt about trading freddie in for a different model manette had no interest in that it was just about being realistic about looking squarely at the life she had and evaluating its potential for going the distance as theyd been best friends who occasionally made the time for a pleasant encounter between the sheets they hadnt stood a chance of lasting she knew it he knew it and theyd had to deal with it that was what theyd done and theyd both been relieved to have it out in the open hadnt they here you are what the devil are you doing out here old girl she roused herself freddie had come to find her and he bore in his hands two mugs he squatted by the tent opening and handed one over she began to crawl out but he said hang on ive not been inside a tent in years he crawled in to join her he said that poles going to go down manette with a nod in the general direction of the troublesome part of the structure she said i could tell one strong gust of wind and its over good place to think though and i wanted a trial run not at all necessary he said he sat next to her indian style and she noted he was flexible enough to do the same as she his knees went all the way to the ground not like some people who couldnt manage that because they were far too stiff she took a sip of what hed brought her chicken broth interesting choice as if she were ill she said not necessary decamping he said if youll pardon the pun deciding upon the outofdoors just in case she frowned freddie what are you talking about he cocked his head his brown eyes seemed to twinkle at her so she knew he was joking about something and she hated not to be in on the joke he said you know the other night holly that was a oneoff wont happen again she said you giving it up or something the dating good god no and then he blushed that freddie blush i mean im rather enjoying it id no idea women had become so so forthright in the years i was out of action not that id ever really been in action thank you very much she said sourly no no i didnt mean what i did mean is that you and i having started so young having been together from the word go more or less you were my first you know my only as a matter of fact so to see whats going on in the real world its an eye opener i can tell you well of course youll see for yourself soon enough she said not sure i want to oh he was silent he sipped his chicken broth she liked the fact that hed never made any noise when he sipped she loathed the sound of people slurping and freddie for one had never slurped well anyway she said anyway yourself and i have no right to ask you not to bring women home freddie never fear a headsup would be nice though a phone call when she goes to the ladies or something but even thats not compulsory i know that he said the thing about rights and the like but i also know how id feel if i came downstairs and found some bloke dipping into a bowl of cornflakes in the morning bit odd that so mostly ill be suggesting we meet off the beaten track not round here you know like sarah like sarah right manette tried to read something in his voice but she wasnt able to she wondered if shed ever actually succeeded in reading his voice at all it was odd to think of it but did one ever really know ones spouse she wondered and then she brought herself up short and moved away from the thought because what freddie wasnt and hadnt been for quite a while was her spouse after a moment of silence broken by the sound of ducks honking from the air above them freddie said whered this come from anyway in reference to the tent its new isnt it she told him about her plans for the tent camping with tim walking the fells ending up on scouts scar she ended with lets put it this way he didnt enthuse when i suggested it poor kid was freddies response what a life hes been having eh that was putting it featherlike she thought what in gods name was going to happen to tim to gracie to their world she knew that if the situation in her life were different she and freddie would take them shed have made the suggestion and freddie would have said of course without a second thought but she could hardly ask that of freddie now and even if she could she could hardly bring the children into a home where they might stumble into a strange woman walking the hallway at night in search of the loo because even if freddie said he wouldnt be bringing sarah or holly or whomever else home for a trial run there was always a chance that in the heat of the moment hed forget that promise she couldnt risk it out on the pond the two resident swans came into view majestic and tranquil they seemed to move without effort manette watched them and next to her she felt freddie doing the same he finally spoke again and his tone was thoughtful manette ive begun dealing with ians accounting programme i did notice she said yes well ive found something there several things actually and im not sure what to make of them to be frank im not sure whether theyre important at all but they need sorting out what kind of things freddie moved to face her he looked hesitant she said his name and he went on with did you know your father financed everything having to do with arnside house he bought it as a wedding gift for nicholas and alatea yes of course but hes also paid for the entire renovation and its been expensive extremely expensive as these things generally are i suppose have you any idea why hes done that she shook her head is it important dad has gobs of money true enough but i cant imagine ian didnt try to talk him out of tossing so much nicks way without some sort of scheme for repayment even if the repayment was to take a century and be made without interest and it wouldnt have been like ian not to have documented something like that theres also the notsosmall matter of nicks past handing so much money over to an addict i doubt dad handed him the money freddie more likely he just paid the bills and hes a former addict not a current addict nick himself wouldnt say former thats why he takes such care about going to his meetings but ian wouldnt have known that and he wouldnt have thought former not with nicks history i suppose but still nicholas stands to inherit something from dad perhaps their arrangement was for him to enjoy his inheritance now for dad to see him enjoying it freddie didnt look at all convinced dyou know hes also been paying mignon an allowance for years what else is he supposed to do shes had him by the short hairs ever since she fell at launchy gill honestly youd think dad pushed her he probably should have done the monthly payments have increased recently cost of living what sort of cost of living does she have and theyve increased a lot theyve doubled and theres no way ian would have approved of that he had to have protested he had to have argued not to do it at all manette considered this she knew freddie was right but there were matters concerning mignon that hed never understood she said shes had that surgery though it wouldnt have been on the nhs someone would have had to pay and who else besides dad those payments would have been made to the surgeon wouldnt they these werent perhaps they were made to mignon so that she could pay the surgeon herself then why keep making them why keep paying her manette shook her head the truth was she didnt know she was silent so was freddie then he sighed and she knew something more was coming she asked what it was he took a slow breath whatever happened to vivienne tully he said she looked at him but he wasnt looking back he was instead focused on those two swans on the pond she said ive absolutely no idea why because for the last eight years regular payments have gone to her as well whatever for i havent a clue but your fathers actually been bleeding money manette and as far as i can tell ian was the only one who knew chalk farm to marylebone london barbara havers was indulging in a snack when angelina upman and her daughter knocked on her door the snack was a blueberry poptart with a side helping of cottage cheese one needed to address at least three food groups with every meal and this seemed to wander in the general direction of more than one food group as far as she was concerned and barbara crammed the rest of the pastry into her mouth before she answered the door she could hear hadiyyahs excited voice outside and it was better to look virtuous with cottage cheese rather than despicable with a poptart she reckoned she was also smoking hadiyyah took note of this one look past barbara and she was tapping her foot at the sight of the fag smouldering in an ashtray on the table she shook her head but said nothing she looked up at her mother the virtuous nonsmoker as if to say you see what im dealing with here angelina said were messengers bearing both good news and bad news may we come in barbara god no barbara thought shed so far managed to keep angelina out of her hovel and shed intended to keep things that way shed not made the day bed shed not done the washing up and she had five pairs of knickers drying on a line that shed jerryrigged over her kitchen sink but really how could she step outside into the november cold to see why angelina and her daughter had appeared on her doorstep instead of doing what angelina herself would have done which was open the door wide offer coffee and tea and be gracious to the unexpected caller so she stepped back and said caught me just about to begin the housework such a blatant lie that she nearly choked on it hadiyyah looked doubtful but angelina didnt know barbara well enough to realise that for her housework was akin to pulling out ones eyelashes a single lash at a time barbara said coffee tea i cn wash a couple of the mugs of which there were ten in the sink along with various other bits of crockery and a pile of cutlery no no we cant stay angelina said hastily but i did want to tell you about dusty who the hell barbara wondered till she remembered that this was the name of the hairstylist in knightsbridge who was destined to alter her appearance forevermore oh yeah she said she went to the table and hastily crushed out her fag ive got you an appointment with him angelina said but its not for a month im afraid hes booked well hes always booked thats the nature of success for a hairstylist everyone wants in to see him yesterday hair crises yeah barbara said sagely as if she knew something about this topic damn too bad too bad hadiyyah echoed but barbara you must see him hes the best hell do such a lovely job oh ive got that point on a slice of toast kiddo barbara agreed but ive told my guv that im off work getting my hair seen to and i cant be off work for a month and i cant show up without my hair seen to so and to angelina know anyone else because she herself certainly did not angelina looked thoughtful one perfectly manicured hand went to her cheek and she tapped upon it she said you know i think something could be managed barbara it wouldnt be dusty but it would be the same salon hes got hangerson there stylists in training perhaps one of them if i can get you in and if i went with you im sure dusty could have a wander across the salon to inspect what the stylist is doing would that work considering shed spent the last ten years hacking her hair off in the shower anything moderately more professional would be just fine still barbara thought it wise to sound somewhat uneasy about this prospect she said hmm i dont know what dyou think i mean this is important because my guv she takes this stuff seriously i expect it would be fine angelina said the salons topnotch theyre not going to have just anyone in training shall i oh yes barbara hadiyyah said do say yes prhaps we can all go to tea afterwards we can dress up and wear hats and carry nice handbags and i dont think anyone wears hats to tea any longer angelina cut in clearly barbara thought shed read the expression of horror that had flitted across barbaras face she said what do you say barbara barbara really had no choice in the matter since she was going to have to turn up at the met with a hairstyle and unless someone with some training did it she was going to have to do it herself which was unthinkable at this point she said sounds good and angelina asked if she could use the phone shed make the call right from barbaras she said that way they wouldnt need to engage in more backing and forthing in the matter hadiyyah bounced over to where the phone was behind the telly on a dusty shelf and barbara noted then that the little girls own hair was not done in plaits as it usually was instead it hung down her back in a wellbrushed wavy mass and it was neatly fastened with an ornate hair slide as angelina was making her call to the salon barbara complimented hadiyyah on her own locks hadiyyah beamed as barbara had reckoned she would mummy had done it she said dad had only ever been able to manage plaits but this was how shed worn it always before mummys trip to canada barbara wondered if hadiyyah had been wearing her hair like this ever since angelinas return which had occurred four months earlier god if that was the case what did it say about her that shed only noticed it just now barbara avoided the answer to that question since she knew it was going to tell her that for that last four months shed had her attention focused on angelina herself and worse on angelina and taymullah azhar excellent excellent angelina was saying into the phone we shall be there and youre certain cedric cedric barbara thought will do a good job wonderful yes thank you well see you then then to barbara once shed rung off were set for three this afternoon dustyll come over and give his input as well just remember to ignore his appalling attitude and dont take it personally and afterwards well take up hadiyyahs idea of tea well take a cab and do things properly at the dorchester my treat by the way tea at the dorchester hadiyyah cried she clasped her hands to her chest oh yes yes yes do say yes barbara barbara wanted to go to tea at the dorchester as much as she wanted to give birth to octuplets but hadiyyah was looking so hopeful and after all angelina had been very helpful what else could she do tea at the dorchester it is she said although she wondered what in gods name she was going to wear and how in gods name shed survive the experience once those plans were set in stone barbara bade her friends farewell made herself relatively decent in appearance and took herself over to portland place and twins bernard faircloughs club she reckoned that chances were good lord fairclough parked himself at the club when he was in london if that was the case it was likely that someone who worked there would have beans to spill about the bloke if there were any beans involved barbara had never been into a private club so she wasnt sure what to expect she was reckoning on cigar smoke and blokes walking around in persian slippers and the sound of billiard balls clicking sonorously somewhere she figured there would be leather wingback chairs drawn up to a fireplace and dogeared copies of punch lying about what she didnt expect was the ancient woman who answered the door when she rang the bell the woman looked like someone whod worked there since the clubs inception her face wasnt lined it was creviced her skin was tissue and her eyes were cloudy and it seemed shed forgotten to put in her teeth or she didnt have any and didnt want false ones a possible way to diet barbara noted she might have been two thousand years old but she was shrewd she took one look at barbara head to toe and seemed deeply unimpressed she said no admittance to nonmembers without the company of a member dear in the voice of a woman fifty years younger indeed so disconcerting was it to hear her speak that barbara had to prevent herself from looking round for a lurking ventriloquist barbara said i was hoping to apply to get her foot in the door over the womans shoulder she could catch a glimpse of panelled walls and paintings but that was it this is a gentlemans club she was then informed women are admitted only in the company of a gentleman member im afraid dining room only dear and to use the facilities of course well that wasnt going to get her anywhere barbara reckoned so she nodded and said theres another matter then and fished out her scotland yard identification afraid i have a few questions about one of your members if i could come inside you said you were interested in membership the old lady pointed out which is it really membership or questions both more or less but looks like membership isnt going to happen so ill settle for questions id prefer not to ask them on the doorstep though she took a step forward this usually worked but it didnt work now the old lady held her position she said questions about what ill need to ask them of whoevers in charge barbara said if youll just track him down ill wait in the lobby or wherever you put the cops when they come calling no ones in charge theres a board and its made up of members and if you wish to speak to one of them youll have to return on their meeting day next month sorry that cant happen barbara told her its a matter of a police investigation and this is a matter of club rules the lady said shall i phone the clubs solicitor and have him come round because my dear thats the only way youre getting in this door aside from running straight through me damn barbara thought the woman gave new definition to tough old bird barbara said look im going to be straight with you i have serious questions to ask about one of your members and this could be a matter of murder i see the woman considered this her head cocked to one side her hair was thick and completely white barbara reckoned she was wearing a wig one didnt get this old with all the follicles still churning well my dear the woman said when could be a matter becomes is a matter well have something to discuss until then we dont that said she stepped back and closed the door barbara was left on the step realising shed lost the battle because shed used a bloody conditional verb she swore and fished a packet of players out of her bag she lit up and considered her next move there had to be someone else who worked in this place someone with information to impart a chef a cook a waiter a cleaner surely the old bag didnt run the place on her own she descended the steps and looked back at the building it was perfectly shut up and forbidding a fortress for its members secrets she glanced around perhaps she thought there was another way a shop with a curious shop assistant inside gaping out of the window at the wellheeled as they arrived and entered the club a florist who made regular deliveries through the front door a tobacconist selling members snuff or cigars but there seemed to be nothing at all aside from a taxi rank on portland place not far from bbc broadcasting house she decided a taxi rank was possible drivers of cabs probably had their favourite routes and their favourite ranks theyd know where the pickings were best and theyd haunt that area if that was the case it stood to reason that a cab driver could as easily cart a member of twins somewhere as he could cart someone ducking out of the bbc she walked over to have a chat the first three drivers in the line got her nowhere the fourth was her lucky charm the driver sounded like an extra from eastenders barbara reckoned he spent his sundays shouting pound a bowl in the vicinity of the brick lane market he knew lord fairclough he knew most them toffs he said he liked to chat to them cos it rankled em it did and he liked to see how long itd take em to tell im to plug his mug fairclough was always ready for a chat when he was alone when someone was wif him things was diffrent the someone was with him piqued barbaras interest anyone special with him she asked oh aye the cab driver told her alas the same bird it was his wife barbara asked the cab driver guffawed remember where you took him and the bird then she asked the driver smirked he tapped his head the repository of all knowledge including the knowledge he said that course he remembered cos it was alas the same place and he added with a wink the bird was a youngn better and better barbara thought bernard fairclough and a young woman always going by taxi to the same place after meeting at his club she asked the driver if he could take her to that place now he glanced at the rank of taxis ahead of him and she knew what that meant he couldnt move off with a passenger until it was his turn or there would be hell to pay she said shed wait till he was at the head of the line but could he take her to the exact place and show her where fairclough and his companion went she showed her id police business she told him he said you got the fare and when she nodded climb in then darlin im your man milnthorpe to lake windermere cumbria dont you see what all of this means simon whenever deborah said that to him st james knew to take care in their conversation she intended to attach something to the conclusion of her remarks and in this situation what she intended to attach could put her into a dangerous position so he said i dont actually my love what i see is that while you were talking to her alatea fairclough became upset for reasons that arent completely clear but those reasons dont seem to have anything to do with ian cresswells death the best course is for you to return the call from her husband and tell him somethings come up and youve got to go back to london without seeing what he wants deborahs tone was incredulous and her expression suspicious in the way of most husbands and wives deborah would know his weak spots she would also know his weakest spot was deborah herself why on earth should i do that you yourself said she knows youre not who you said you were you cant think she hasnt told nicholas that if he rang you and said hed like a word which he did yes hes going to want that word to be about the state his wife was in when you left her thats what you would want to talk about he might want to talk to me about a dozen things and im not going to know what they are unless i ring him back and agree to see him they were standing in the car park of the crow and eagle next to his hire car and he was due to meet lynley at ireleth hall he wasnt at this point late but if the conversation went on much longer he was going to be deborah had followed him down from their room because although hed considered their conversation finished she had not she was dressed to go out and this was not a good sign she hadnt brought her shoulder bag or camera however so this counted in his favour deborah had given him chapter and verse on her encounter with alatea fairclough and as far as he was concerned deborahs cover was blown and it was time for her to back away from the situation deborahs point was that the argentine womans reaction had been so extreme that she had to be hiding something her additional point was that if alatea was indeed hiding something chances were very good that her husband didnt know what it was so the only way she was going to discover what was truly going on was to speak with the man st james had pointed out that according to lynley a reporter from the source had been nosing round the area as well so that in combination with a photographer who wasnt who shed said she was certainly would be enough to unnerve alatea fairclough what did deborah think she was hiding anyway a nazi in her past she was after all from argentina fiddlesticks deborah said fiddlesticks st james thought what sort of word was fiddlesticks in this century and what did fiddlesticks have to do with anything he was wise enough not to say that however instead he waited for more and true to form his wife didnt disappoint him deborah said i think all of this has to do with the magazine simon alatea was perfectly fine well a little nervous but otherwise fine until i brought up conception i was attempting to get a little closer to her i told her just a bit about our difficulties with pregnancy and that was it she went a bit wild and weve been over this deborah he said patiently you can see where it leads cant you her husband arrives home she tells him you arent who you say you are he rings you and wants to have a chat and that chat is going to tell you that the cover youre using to slip into his life i told her i was a freelance photographer i told her what that means i told her i was hired by query productions which is a startup company with no films made yet i thought of that in the heat of the moment by the way because her next step is going to be to learn there is no startup company called query productions at all and you and i know it i can handle meeting with nicholas if i was able to handle that youre in a very bad position he concluded with his hand on the door handle of the car you need to leave this alone he didnt say he forbade her doing more he didnt say he wished her to do no more their years of marriage had taught him that in that way lay madness so he tried to ease her in the general direction of this conclusion at the end of the day it was losing her that terrified him but he couldnt say that since her next move would be to say that he wasnt going to lose her which would lead to his next move which would be about helens death and the crater in tommys life that helens death had caused and he didnt want to go anywhere near helens death it was too raw a place for him ever to speak of and he knew very well that it always would be she said i can take care of myself whats he going to do push me from a cliff knock me on the head somethings going on with alatea and im inches from knowing what it is if its something big and if ian cresswell found out about it dont you see the trouble was that he did see only too well but he couldnt say that because it would lead only to a conclusion that he didnt want to reach so what he did say was i shouldnt be long well talk more when i return all right her face wore that look god in heaven she was stubborn but she stepped away from the car and returned to the inn things were not close to being settled though he wished hed thought to pinch her car keys there was nothing for it but to set out for ireleth hall the arrangements were in place valerie fairclough would be in the tower folly keeping her daughter occupied and away from the windows lynley and lord fairclough would be waiting for his arrival with whatever lights theyd been able to come up with to illuminate the interior of the boathouse st james made good time and found ireleth hall with no difficulty the gates stood open and he coursed along the drive deer grazed placidly in the distance occasionally lifting heads as if to evaluate their environment and this was stunning a park defined by magnificent oaks planes beeches and copses of birch trees rising above expanses of rolling lawn lynley came out of the house as st james pulled up bernard fairclough accompanied him and lynley made the introductions fairclough pointed the way to the boathouse he said theyd managed to rig up some lights by using the current from an exterior bulb they had torches as well just in case they also were carrying a pile of towels the way led through shrubbery and poplars making a quick descent to lake windermere the lake was placid and the surroundings were soundless except for the birds and the distant noise of a motor somewhere on the water the boathouse was a squat stone affair with a roofline that dipped nearly to the ground its single door stood open and st james took note of the fact that it had no lock on it lynley would have seen this as well and he would have already drawn the conclusion about what the lack of a lock meant inside st james saw that a stone dock ran round three sides of the building several caged electricians lights had been set up to illuminate the area of the dock where ian cresswell had taken his fall and a long flex from these lights was looped over one of the buildings rafters running from there to the exterior the lights cast long shadows everywhere save on the immediate area of the stones in question so lynley and fairclough switched on their torches to do something to mitigate the gloomy spots st james saw that there was a workbench at one side most likely the spot where fish were cleaned if the heavy smell of them was any indication cleaning fish meant implements to do so so that would have to be looked into he reckoned the boathouse also accommodated four craft the scull belonging to ian cresswell a rowingboat a motorboat and a canoe the rowingboat was valerie faircloughs he was told the canoe and motorboat were used by everyone in the family but not on a regular basis st james stepped carefully onto the area from which the stones had been dislodged he asked for a torch he could see how easily a skull could be fractured if someone had fallen here the stones were roughly hewn in the manner of those used in so many structures in cumbria they were slate with the odd piece of granite thrown in theyd been mortared into place as any other kind of positioning would have been foolhardy but the mortar was worn and in some spots crumbly it would have been no difficult matter for the stones to have been loosened from it but such loosening could have come with age as well as with intent generations of people stepping from boats onto the dock would have over time caused the stones to become dangerous just as well as someone deliberately dislodging them he moved along the mortar looking for marks to indicate a tool had been wedged into it to serve as a lever he found however that the mortar was in such bad condition that it was going to be hard to say if this or that area of crumbling was the result of anything other than age a shiny spot would have indicated someone had used a tool to mess about with the mortar but there didnt seem to be one he finally stood having inched his way along the entire area of missing stones fairclough said what do you think it looks like nothing youre certain fairclough looked relieved theres no sign of anything we could bring in some more powerful lights as well as some higher magnification but i can see why it was deemed an accident so far at least fairclough glanced at lynley so far he said lynley said no marks on the mortar dont indicate there are no marks on the stones that are missing and with a wry look at his friend i was hoping to avoid this you know st james smiled i reckoned as much i find there are distinct benefits to being moderately disabled this happens to be one of them lynley handed his torch over and began stripping off his clothes he got down to his underwear grimaced and slid into the water he said christ when the frigid water rose to his waist he added at least its not deep not that its going to matter st james said dont avoid the best part tommy it should be easy enough therell be no algae on them i know he groused lynley went under it was simple as st james had said it would be the dislodged stones hadnt been in the water long enough to bear algae so lynley was able to find them quickly and heave them to the surface he didnt get out of the water however instead he said to fairclough theres something else can you swing some light this way and he went under again as fairclough swung the torchlight in his direction st james had a look at the stones he was concluding that they were fine since there was no shine of strike marks against them when lynley surfaced another time he was holding something that he slapped against the dock he lifted himself from the water shivering and grabbed the towels st james looked to see what hed brought to the surface fairclough still above them on the dock said whatve you found it was a filleting knife st james saw the sort of knife used when one is cleaning fish it had a thin blade some ten inches long most notable of all its state clearly indicated it had not been in the water long milnthorpe cumbria deborah had no idea what on earth simon thought was going to happen to her if she rang nicholas fairclough back shed perfectly weathered the confrontation with his wife she was determined to do the same with nicholas when she returned his phone call he asked to meet her he began by saying that he wondered if there was anything else she needed from him he said he understood that filmmakers liked to include all sorts of footage to run during voiceovers and there was plenty of scope for that so he wondered if he could take her to barrowinfurness to show her some of the areas where blokes lived rough this might be important in the overall picture of things deborah agreed it was yet another chance to delve and tommy had wanted her to delve where should they meet deborah asked nicholas hed fetch her from her lodgings he said she saw no danger in this she had her mobile to rely upon after all and both simon and tommy were a mere phone call away so she left her husband a note along with the number of nicholass mobile and she went on her way nicholas rumbled up in an old hillman some twenty minutes later deborah was waiting for him in front of the hotel and when he suggested that they have a coffee before setting off for barrowinfurness she didnt demur coffee was easy enough to come by considering milnthorpe was a market town with a goodsized square just off the main road a church comprised part of this square rising above the town on a modest slope of land but two of the other three sides comprised restaurants and shops next to milnthorpe chippy apparent purveyor of all things deepfried there was a small cafe nicholas led her to this but not before calling out niamh niamh in the direction of a woman who was just coming out of a chinese takeaway three doors down from the chippy she turned she was deborah saw petite and slender she was also formidably well put together especially considering the time of day which did not suggest stilettos and cocktail wear although that was what she had on her dress was short showing wellshaped legs it was also cut in a way to flatter breasts that were full perky and it had to be said patently artificial directly behind her was a man in the apron of an employee of the chinese takeaway there was apparently some relationship between them deborah saw for niamh turned to him and spoke while he offered her a long look that was clearly besotted nicholas said excuse me for a moment to deborah and went over to the woman she didnt look pleased to see him her expression was stony she said something to the man with her who looked from her to nicholas and decamped into the takeaway nicholas began to speak niamh listened deborah sidled closer to catch something of their conversation which wasnt easy as it was market day in the square so in addition to the vehicle noise from the main road through milnthorpe she had to contend with housewives chattily shopping for fruit and veg as well as individuals stocking up on everything from batteries to socks none of your concern niamh was saying and its certainly none of manettes business understood nicholas sounded perfectly affable but as theyre part of our family niamh you can understand her concern and mine as well part of your family niamh repeated oh thats a very good laugh theyre your family now but what were they when he walked out and the rest of you let it happen were they your family then when he destroyed ours nicholas looked nonplussed he glanced round as if searching not only for listeners but also for words im not sure what any of us could have done about what happened oh arent you well let me help you out your bloody father could have put a bloody end to his bloody job unless he saw reason and thats just for a start your bloody father could have said you do this and im finished with you and the lot of you could have done the same but you didnt do that did you because ian had you all under control thats not actually how things were nicholas cut in and not a single one of you was ever willing to stand up to him no one was look i dont want to argue about that we see things differently thats all i just want to say that tims in a bad state do you think i dont know that i who had to find him a school where he could feel that the other pupils werent pointing him out as the bloke whose father had been taking it up the chute from some arab on the sly i goddamn know hes in a bad state and im doing what i intend to do about it so you and your whole miserable family need to get out of our lives you were happy enough to do that while ian was living werent you she stormed in the direction of a line of cars parked on the north side of the square nicholas took a moment head down and obviously pondering before he came back in deborahs direction he said sorry family matter ah she replied shes a relative then my cousins wife he drowned recently shes having trouble well coping with the loss and therere children involved im sorry should we she gestured towards the cafe to which theyd been headed saying would another time be better for you oh no he said i want to talk to you anyway the bit about barrow to tell you the truth it was something of an excuse to see you deborah knew he certainly wasnt referring to a desire to be with her in order to experience her charms so she prepared herself mentally for what was to come since hed rung her and requested a meeting shed first assumed alatea hadnt told him the truth about their encounter that perhaps had not been the case she said of course and followed him to the cafe she ordered coffee and a toasted tea cake and attempted to seem completely at ease he didnt bring up alatea until theyd been served then what he said was i dont know how to put this exactly so ill have to say it directly you need to stay away from my wife if this documentary thing is going to work out the filmmakers will have to know that as well deborah did her best to look startled an innocent woman completely unprepared for this turn of events she said your wife and then with an attempt at dawning recognition and regret i upset her yesterday and she told you about it didnt she i was rather hoping she wouldnt frankly im so terribly sorry mr fairclough it was unintentional on my part rather emotionally clumsy to be frank it was the magazine that did it wasnt it to her surprise he said rather sharply what magazine odd reaction she thought conception she said what she wanted to add was is there another magazine i should be looking into but of course she did not she thought feverishly back to the other periodicals that had been on the table along with conception she couldnt remember what they were so interested had she been in that single one he said oh that conception no no thats not never mind which she could hardly do she opted for a direct approach and said mr fairclough is something wrong is there something youd like to tell me something youd like to ask me is there some kind of reassurance i can give you he fingered the handle of his coffee cup he sighed and said there are things alatea doesnt want to talk about and her past is one of them i know youre not here to delve into her background or anything but thats what shes afraid of that you might start delving i see deborah said well this isnt an investigative documentary other than as it relates to the pele project certain issues about you yourself might come up are you certain shes not just worried about how the film might affect you your reputation your standing in the community he laughed selfderisively i did enough damage to myself when i was using no film could damage me further no its to do with what alatea did to get by before she and i met its stupid frankly for her to be so upset about it its nothing i mean its not like she made porn films or something deborah nodded gravely she kept her face sympathetic but said nothing surely she thought he was on the verge the cusp the cliffs edge just the tiniest nudge might push him over she finally said thoughtfully you two met in utah didnt you i went to college for a while in america in santa barbara do you know the town its expensive there and i well funds were low and there are always easy ways to make money she let him fill in the blanks for himself with whatever his imagination might provide the truth was shed done nothing but go to photography school but there was no way on earth he would know that he pursed his lips perhaps considering an admission of some sort he took a sip of coffee set his cup back down and said well its underwear actually underwear alatea was an underwear model she did catalogue pictures advertisements in magazines as well deborah smiled and thats what she doesnt want me to know thats hardly disgraceful mr fairclough and lets be honest she has the body for it shes attractive as well one can easily see naughty underwear he said he let that sit there for a moment so that deborah could perhaps absorb the information and its implications catalogues for certain types of people you understand adverts in certain types of magazines it wasnt they werent i mean the underwear wasnt exactly highclass stuff shes dead embarrassed about it all now and shes worried that someone will uncover this about her and humiliate her in some way i see well you can reassure her on that score im not interested in her underwear past she glanced out of the window of the cafe which looked onto the market square it was busy out there and a queue had formed at a takeaway food stall operating from a dark green caravan with sues hot food bar scrolled in white across the front of it people sat at a few picnic tables in front of the caravan tucking into whatever the eponymous owner was shoveling steaming onto paper plates deborah said i did think it was that magazine conception but i suppose thats more to do with me than with her i shouldnt have brought the subject up do let her know i apologise it wasnt that nicholas said she wants to get pregnant certainly but truth is i want it more than she does just now and thats making her touchy but the real problem is this damn modeling part of her life and those pictures which she keeps expecting to pop up in some tabloid as he made these final remarks his gaze like deborahs went outofdoors but instead of the same casual glance deborah had given the food stall and its accompanying picnic tables his fixed on something and his expression altered his pleasant face hardened he said excuse me for a moment and before deborah could reply he strode outside there he walked up to one of the individuals enjoying a sues hot food bar meal it was a man who ducked his head as nicholas approached in an obvious effort to go unnoticed this didnt work and when nicholas clutched the mans shoulder he rose he was enormous deborah saw he looked nearly seven feet tall rising quickly as he did he knocked his cap against the furled umbrella in the centre of the table and the cap dislodged revealing fiery red hair she reached into her bag as the man stepped away from the table and listened to whatever nicholas was saying which appeared to be as hot as the food the man was eating the man shrugged further words were exchanged deborah took out her camera and began to photograph the man and his encounter with nicholas fairclough kensington london barbara havers considered herself one lucky bird when the cab drove only from portland place to rutland gate south of hyde park it just as easily could have been wapping or regions beyond and while she knew lynley would have been good for the cab fare ultimately shed not brought sufficient funds to cover a lengthy journey and she doubted the driver would have been willing to take a quarter of an hours snog in exchange for the ride she hadnt thought of this when she hopped blithely into the vehicle but she breathed a sigh of relief when the bloke headed west instead of east and finally turned left a short distance beyond the brick expanse of hyde park barracks he pointed out the building in question an imposing white structure with a panel of doorbells indicating that it was a conversion barbara got out paid for the ride and considered her options as the cab rumbled away but not before the driver told barbara with a wink that this was where the couple debarked they always went inside the place together and both of them had keys since one or the other of them would do the unlocking when they reached the door conversions meant flats barbara knew which in turn meant occupants which in turn meant winkling out the identity of the occupant in question she fished for a cigarette and paced while she smoked it the nicotine she reckoned would sharpen her wits the sharpening didnt take long she went to the door and saw the line of bells flats were marked but there were no names as was typical in london there was however one bell marked porter and this turned out to be a piece of good luck not every residential building in london had a porter it upped the value of the flats within but it also cost the residents a bundle a disembodied voice asked her business she said shed come to make an enquiry about one of the flats that shed learned would soon be coming on the market and could she possibly speak to him about the building the porter didnt embrace this idea with wild enthusiasm but he did decide to cooperate he buzzed her in and told her to come along the corridor to the back where shed find his office it was perfectly quiet inside aside from the wellmuted sound of traffic on kensington road just beyond rutland gate she passed along a marble floor treading silently on a faded turkey carpet the doors to two groundfloor flats faced each other here and a table upon which sat cubbies for the days post was positioned beneath a heavy gilt mirror she gave a quick glance to the cubbies but like the bells outside next to the door they offered flat numbers only and not names just beyond the stairway and a lift she found a door marked porter the porter in question opened it to her knock he looked like a pensioner and he wore a uniform too tight in the collar and too loose in the stomach he gave barbara the onceover and his expression said that if she was intending to make a purchase of a flat in the building she had better prepare herself for an acceptingoffersbeginningat situation that was going to knock her out of her hightop trainers he said dont know about any flat on offer do i without any introduction she said this is a bit of a preemptive strike if you know what i mean cn i she indicated his office and smiled pleasantly ill just take a minute of your time she added he stepped back and tilted his head towards a desk situated in a corner of the room he had a nice little setup here barbara thought with part of the place made into a snug sitting room complete with television currently tuned in to an ancient film in which sandra dee and troy donahue were locked in a timeless adolescent agonizing embrace as music swelled with a familiar theme she thought for a moment before she came up with the title a summer place that was it all about young tormented love nothing quite like it she thought shoot me first the porter saw the direction of her gaze and perhaps determining his choice of film was some sort of revelation about him went to the television and hastily switched it off that done he moved to his desk and sat behind it this left barbara standing but that apparently was his intention barbara expressed what she felt was a suitable amount of gratitude for the porters willingness to talk to her she asked some questions about the building the sorts of queries she expected a potential buyer might have before plunking down hardearned cash on a piece of outrageously priced kensington property age condition problems with heating and plumbing and ventilation difficulties encountered with other residents presence of undesirables the neighbourhood noise pubs restaurants markets corner shops and on and on when shed run the gamut of everything she could possibly think of jotting his answers in her small spiral notebook she said laying out her bait and hoping hed go for it brilliant cant thank you enough most of this matches up with what bernard told me about the place he bit bernard that your estate agent cause like i said i dont know of a place thats going up for sale no no bernard fairclough he told me an associate of his lives here and she apparently told him about a flat i cant remember her name oh thatd be vivienne tully that would he said dont think its her place going up for sale though situations too convenient for that oh right barbara said its not viviennes i thought it might be and got a bit excited about the possibility but bernie she especially liked the touch of bernie said shes quite established here thatd be the case he said nice woman as well remembers me at christmas she does which is more than i can say for some of em he shot a look at the television then and cleared his throat barbara saw that on a squat table next to a reclining chair a plate of beans on toast was waiting doubtless he wanted to get back to that as well as back to sandra troy and more of their passionate forbidden love well she couldnt exactly blame him passionate and forbidden love made life more interesting didnt it lake windermere cumbria lynley was having a preprandial sherry with valerie and bernard fairclough when mignon showed up they were in what valerie had referred to as the small drawing room where a fire was doing a fine job of cutting the chill none of them heard mignon enter the house the front door being some distance from the room in which they sat so she was able to make something of a surprise entrance the door swung open and she shoved her zimmer frame in ahead of her it had begun to rain again quite heavily and shed come from the folly without raingear this omission which lynley reckoned had to be deliberate had caused her to become wet enough to provoke a reaction from both of her parents her hair was flattened her aliceinwonderland hairband dripped water onto her forehead and into her eyes and her shoes and clothing were soaked it was not a far enough walk from the folly to the main house to have become so wet lynley concluded that shed stood for a while in the downpour for the drama a thorough soaking might provide seeing her her mother jumped to her feet and lynley who couldnt have stopped himself if hed tried politely rose to his mignon valerie cried whyve you come from the folly without an umbrella mignon said i can hardly hold an umbrella while using this can i in reference to the zimmer a mac and a hat might have solved that problem her father said guilelessly notably he hadnt risen and his expression indicated he was fully aware of her ploy i forgot it mignon said valerie said here sit by the fire darling ill fetch some towels for your hair dont bother mignon said ill be walking back in a moment youre dining soon arent you as i had no invitation to join you this evening i dont want to take up too much of your time you dont need an invitation valerie said youre always welcome but since youve preferred because of clearly she didnt want to say more in front of lynley just as clearly mignon did she said ive had a gastric band thomas big as an ox i was you wouldnt believe how big destroyed my knees heaving my fat round the planet for a good twenty years so theyll be replaced next the knees i mean then ill be as good as new and some blokell come along and take me off my parents hands or so they hope she made her way across the room and lowered herself into the chair her mother had vacated she said to her father i could do with a sherry myself and to lynley i thought at first thats why youd come stupid of me i know but youve got to consider who my father is always has a scheme my dad i knew you were part of one as soon as i saw you i just misjudged what the scheme actually was thinking youd come to have a look at me if you know what i mean mignon really her mother said i think ill take those towels after all mignon seemed to like the idea of ordering valerie about she looked quite gratified when her mother went off to do her bidding her father in the meantime hadnt moved so she said to him that sherry dad bernard lynley thought looked like a man who was about to say something hed regret in any other circumstances lynley would have waited to see what that something was but his natural inclination towards civility got the better of him he set his own glass of sherry on the table next to his chair he said let me and bernard cut him off with ill get it tommy make it a big one mignon told her father ive just had a successful romantic interlude with mr seychelles and while normally one has a fag for afters id prefer to get sloshed fairclough observed his daughter his expression was so obviously one of distaste that mignon chuckled have i offended you she asked so sorry her father poured sherry into a tumbler a great deal of sherry that lynley thought was certainly going to do the job if the woman tossed it back he had a feeling she fully intended to do so fairclough was handing the drink over to his daughter when valerie returned towels in hand she went to mignon and set about drying her hair gently lynley expected mignon to show a burst of irritation and to brush the ministration aside she didnt instead she allowed her hair to be seen to along with her neck and her face she said mother never comes for a friendly visit did you know that thomas what i mean is that she brings me food rather like giving alms to the poor like the lady of the manor she is but just to drop in for a chat that hasnt happened in years so when it did occur today i was all amazement what can the old dear want i thought valerie dropped her hands and the towel from her daughters hair she looked at her husband he said nothing they both seemed to gird themselves for some kind of onslaught and lynley found himself wondering how on earth theyd got themselves into this sort of position with their own daughter mignon took a healthy gulp of her sherry she held the glass with both hands like a priest with a chalice mother and i have nothing to talk about you see she has no interest in hearing about my life and believe me i have no interest in hers this rather limits ones conversation after the weather whats there to talk about i mean aside from her dreary topiary garden and her even drearier childrens playground or whatever it is her father finally said mignon are you joining us for dinner or have you another purpose for your call do not mignon said back me into a corner you do not want that darling her mother began please if theres a darling in the family we both know im not it thats not true god mignon rolled her eyes at lynley its been nicholas nicholas since the day he was born thomas a son at last and all the attendant hallelujahs but thats not what ive come here about i want to talk about that pathetic little cripple for a moment lynley had no idea whom she actually meant he was of course acutely aware that st james was disabled since he himself had been the cause of the accident that had injured him but to apply either pathetic or little to the man hed known since their school days was so inapposite a description that for a moment he thought mignon was speaking of someone else entirely she disabused him of that notion when she went on mother didnt last as long as she was evidently supposed to last in my company once she left i wondered why shed come at all and it wasnt difficult to suss that out there you all were dad coming up from the boathouse you thomas here and the cripple and thomas looked like hed had a wetting if the towels and his hair were anything to go by but not the cripple he was quite dry as you were dad another hefty gulp of sherry followed before she continued now the towels suggest our thomas went down to the boathouse prepared he didnt just slip and fall into the water and since his clothes werent wet i think weve got corroboration for that assumption which means he went into the water intentionally this not being the season for taking a dip in the lake he had to have had another reason im thinking that reason has to do with ian how am i doing lynley felt fairclough glance his way valerie looked nervously from her daughter to her husband lynley said nothing it was he reckoned up to fairclough to confirm or deny what was going on as far as he was concerned being open with his reasons for his visit to ireleth hall was wiser than attempting to maintain a pretence for his presence fairclough however said nothing to his daughter she took this for assent it seemed she said so that means you believe ians death was no accident dad at least thats what i reckoned when i saw the three of you coming up from the lake a few seconds on the net was actually all it took to learn who our visitor here really is by the way had you wanted to keep the information from me you needed to come up with a pseudonym no one was keeping anything from you mignon her father informed her tommys here at my invitation the fact that hes also a policeman has no bearing a detective mignon corrected a scotland yard detective dad and i assume you know that and since hes here at your invitation and hes prowling round the boathouse in the company of whoever that other bloke was i think i can connect the dots well enough she turned in her chair so that her focus was on lynley and not her father her mother had stepped away from her towels in her hands mignon said to lynley so youre conducting a little investigation on the sly engineered by well it cant be dad can it mignon her father said she went on because that suggests that dad himself is innocent which frankly isnt very likely mignon valerie cried thats a terrible thing to say do you think so but dads got a reason for offing our ian havent you dad fairclough made no reply to his daughter his look at mignon betrayed nothing either he was used to this sort of conversation with her or he knew she would go no further with what she was claiming a tense moment passed as they all waited for more outside a gust of wind sent something against the windows of the small drawing room valerie was the one to flinch mignon said but then so do i isnt that correct dad she leaned back in her chair enjoying herself looking at her father she nonetheless directed her next words to lynley dad doesnt know that i know ian wanted to cut me off thomas he was always pouring over the books our ian looking for ways to save dad money well im certainly one of them theres the folly itself which cost a bundle to build and then theres its maintenance as well as my own and as you no doubt used your detective skills to suss out when you paid your call upon me i do like to spend a bit of money here and there considering the piles dads made for the firm over the years what i need isnt a lot of course but to ian it was far more than i deserved to his credit dad never agreed with him but we both know dad and i that there was always a chance that hed change his mind and go along with ians suggestion to throw me out on my ear isnt that correct faircloughs face was stony her mothers face was watchful this offered more information than either of them might have given lynley otherwise valerie bernard finally said his gaze on his daughter i think its time for dinner dont you mignon will be leaving presently mignon smiled she gulped down the rest of her sherry she said pointedly i believe ill need some help to get back to the folly dad i expect youll do fine on your own he replied november chalk farm to victoria london barbara havers shrieked when she saw herself in the bathroom mirror having stumbled towards the loo upon rising in the early morning and having forgotten that her appearance was decidedly altered her heart leapt in her chest and she swung round ready to confront the woman she saw in an oblique angle of the mirror it was a matter of seconds only but she felt every which way the fool as she came to her senses and all of yesterday came sweeping back in the form of a hot wave of what was not quite shame but not quite anything else either shed rung angelina upman on her mobile after shed visited the building in which bernard faircloughs associate vivienne tully lived shed said she was in kensington and it looked like she was going to have to cancel the hair thing as she called it being so far from chalk farm at the moment but angelina enthused on the matter heavens kensington was just a hop from knightsbridge theyd meet there instead of going in each others company hadiyyah had weighed in hearing her mothers end of the conversation shed got onto the mobile and said you cant barbara and anyways youre under orders you know and its not going to hurt shed lowered her voice and gone on to say and its the dorchester barbara tea at the dorchester afterwards mummy says theyve got someone who plays the piano while you have your tea and she says someones always walking round with silver trays heaped with sandwiches and she says someone brings fresh scones thatre hot and then there are cakes lots of cakes barbara barbara reluctantly agreed she would meet them in knightsbridge anything to be served tea sandwiches from a silver platter the big event at the hair salon had been what barbara knew a pop psychologist would have called a growth experience dusty angelinas stylist had fully lived up to her description of him when barbara was ensconced in the chair of one of his underlings hed come over from his own station taken one look at her and said god and what century is it that youre representing he was thin handsome spiky haired and so tan for the month of november that only hours in a tanning bed could have possibly effected such a dubious glow of precancerous health he hadnt waited for barbara to come up with a witty reply to this instead hed turned to the underling and said bob it foil it with oneeightytwo and sixtyfour and im going to want to check your work he then said to barbara really youve gone this long you could have waited another six weeks and id have seen to you myself what on earth do you use for shampoo fairy liquid i use it for everything youre joking of course but its something from the shampoo aisle in the supermarket isnt it where else am i supposed to buy shampoo he rolled his eyes in horror god and then to angelina youre looking gorgeous as always after which he airkissed her and left barbara in the hands of the underling hadiyyah he ignored altogether at the end of what had seemed like a period in hades to barbara she had emerged from the ministrations of dustys underling with sleekly bobbed hair that was highlighted with streaks of shimmering blond and with subtle strands of auburn the underling who turned out not to be cedric after all but rather a young woman from essex nice despite her four lip rings and her chest tattooes gave her instructions about the care and maintenance of her locks which did not involve the use of fairy liquid or anything else save a supremely costly bottle of elixir that apparently was going to preserve the colour improve the body repair the follicles and one assumed alter ones social life barbara paid for it all with a shudder she wondered if women truly poured this much lolly into something that could as easily be seen to in the shower every now and again nonetheless when she showered that morning she protected the costly hairstyle from the water by wrapping it in cling film first she was shrouded in an overlarge pair of flannel drawstring trousers and a hoody and toasting herself a strawberry poptart when she heard the excited chatter of hadiyyah at her door followed by the little girls knock upon it are you there are you there hadiyyah cried ive brought dad to see your new hair barbara no no no barbara whispered she wasnt actually ready for anyone to see her yet least of all taymullah azhar whose voice she could hear but whose words she could not distinguish she waited in silence hoping that hadiyyah would assume she was already off for the day but really how could she it wasnt eight in the morning and hadiyyah knew barbaras habits and even if she hadnt known barbaras mini was in full view of azhars flat there was nothing for it but to open the door see hadiyyah cried grabbing her fathers hand see dad mummy and i took barbara to mummys own hairdresser yesterday doesnt barbara look nice everyone at the dorchester noticed her azhar said ah yes i do see which barbara felt was akin to being damned with very faint praise indeed she said bit different eh scared the dickens out of myself when i looked in the mirror this morning its not at all frightening azhar told her gravely right well i meant that i didnt recognise myself i think barbara looks lovely hadiyyah told her father so does mummy mummy said the hair makes barbara look like lights coming from her face and it makes her eyes show nicely mummy says barbaras got beautiful eyes and she must show them off dusty told barbara shes to let her fringe grow out so that theres no fringe any longer as well but instead shell have khushi azhar cut in not unkindly you and your mother have done very well and now as barbara is eating her breakfast you and i must be off he offered a long and sombre look at barbara it does suit you well he said before he gently put his hand on his daughters head and directed her to turn so that they could go barbara watched them walk back in the direction of their flat hadiyyah taking a skip and a hop and chattering all the while azhar had always been a sober sort of bloke in the time she had known him but she had the feeling there was something here that comprised more than his usual gravitas she wasnt sure what it was although since angelina wasnt currently employed his concerns might have had to do with the fact that he and not his partner was going to be footing the bill for their costly teatime excursion at the dorchester angelina had pulled out the stops on that one beginning with champagne with which she had toasted barbaras burgeoning beauty as shed called it barbara shut the door thoughtfully if shed put azhar into a difficult position she needed to do something about it and she wasnt quite sure what that was going to be other than from slipping him a few quid on the side which he was unlikely to take from her when she was ready for her day she began the mental preparation for what lay ahead although she was still officially taking her few days off work part of what comprised her agenda had to be a visit to new scotland yard this was going to put her on the receiving end of some goodnatured jibes from her colleagues once they got a look at her hair in another situation she might have been able to prolong the inevitable since she was still on holiday but lynley needed information that was going to be more easily gleaned at the yard than anywhere else so there was nothing for it but to head to victoria street and to try to avoid being noticed wherever she could she had a name vivienne tully but not much else shed tried to get more as shed left the building in rutland gate and a quick survey of the cubbies for the post had given her a bit vivienne tully resided in flat so her small stack of letters told barbara and a quick dash up the stairs allowed her to find this flat on the third floor of the building it was indeed the sole flat on the floor but when barbara knocked she learned only that vivienne tully had a house cleaner who also answered the door if someone showed up while she was hoovering and dusting one polite question about ms tullys whereabouts revealed that the house cleaner spoke limited en glish something baltic seemed to be her native tongue but the woman recognised vivienne tullys name well enough and through pantomime a magazine grabbed up from a cocktail table and much gesturing at a longcase clock barbara was able to ascertain that vivienne tully either danced for the royal ballet or shed gone to see the royal ballet with someone called bianca or she and her friend bianca had gone to a ballet dance class in any case it all amounted to the same thing vivienne tully wasnt at home and was not likely to be home for at least two hours barbaras appointment to be beautified precluded her hanging about to accost the woman so she had scarpered to knightsbridge with vivienne tully a blank page upon which something needed to be written her visit to the yard was supposed to take care of this at the same time as it allowed her to see what there was to see about ian cresswell bernard fairclough and the woman from argentina whom lynley had also mentioned alatea vasquez y del torres so she fired up her mini and set off towards westminster holding to her heart the hope that shed see as few of her colleagues as possible as she skulked round the corridors of new scotland yard she had fairly good luck in this department at least at the start the only people she saw were winston nkata and the departmental secretary dorothea harriman dorothea long the picture of sartorial perfection and possessing an unmatchable degree of excellence in the area of all things related to personal grooming took one look at barbara stopped dead in the tracks of her crippling fiveinch stilettos and said brilliant detective sergeant absolutely brilliant who did it she touched barbaras hair with her slender and speculative fingers without waiting for an answer she went on and just look at the sheen gorgeous gorgeous acting detective superintendent ardery is going to be delighted you wait and see waiting and seeing were the last things barbara wanted to do she said ta dee bit different eh different does not do justice dorothea said i want the name of the stylist will you share it with me course barbara said why wouldnt i share it oh some women wont you know battle of females on the prowl that sort of thing she took a step away and sighed her gaze fixed on barbaras hair im green with envy the idea that dorothea harriman might be envious of her hairstyle made barbara want to hoot with laughter as did the notion that she herself was intent upon capturing a man with this makeover shed been forced to endure but she restrained herself and gave the other woman dustys name as well as the name of the knightsbridge salon this would be right up dees alley barbara reckoned as she had little doubt that dorothea spent vast amounts of time and most of her wages in knightsbridge winston nkatas reaction was less extreme and barbara thanked her stars for this he said looks good barb guv see you yet and that was it barbara said i was hoping to avoid her if you see her im not here okay i mean im here but not here i just need access to the pnc and some other stuff di lynley mums the word nkata said hed cover for barbara as best he could but there was no telling when acting superintendent isabelle ardery was going to appear in their midst best be prepared with some sort of story he advised shes not happy bout the inspector going off without letting her know where hell be barbara gave nkata a closer look when he said this she wondered what he knew about lynley and isabelle ardery but nkatas expression betrayed nothing and while this was habitual for him barbara decided it was safe to conclude that he was merely remarking upon the obvious lynley was a member of arderys team the assistant commissioner had pulled him off to see to some matter unrelated to arderys concerns she was cheesed off about this barbara found an inconspicuous spot where she could access the yards computer with its myriad sources of information she started first with vivienne tully and she began with very little difficulty to amass the pertinent details about her they ranged from her birth in wellington new zealand to her education from primary school there to university in auckland to an impressive advanced degree at the london school of economics she was the managing director of a firm called precision gardening which manufactured gardening tools hardly a highglamour job barbara thought and she was also an executive director of the fairclough foundation a bit of delving turned up a further connection with bernard fairclough barbara found in her early twenties shed been the executive assistant to bernard fairclough at fairclough industries in barrowinfurness between her time at fairclough industries and precision gardening shed been an independent business consultant which barbara reckoned in the way of the modern world could indicate either an attempt at developing her own business or a period of unemployment that had lasted four years as of now she was thirtythree years old and a photo of her showed a woman with spiky hair quite a boyish dress sense and a rather frighteningly intelligent face her eyes communicated the fact that vivienne tully didnt suffer fools in conjunction with her background and her general appearance they also suggested ferocity of independence as far as lord fairclough was concerned barbara found nothing curious there was plenty curious about his wayward son though as nicholas fairclough hadnt exactly trod the straight and narrow in his teens and twenties and records showed car crashes arrests for drink driving bungled burglaries shoplifting and sale of stolen goods he seemed a straight enough arrow now though hed paid all of his debts to society and from the day of his marriage not a hair of his head had even been ruffled that brought barbara to alatea vasquez y del torres her of the mouthful name aside from that name barbara had in her crumpled notes the town from which shed sprung communicated to her as santa maria di somethingorother which wasnt exactly helpful as she quickly found out santa maria di et cetera turned out to be to the towns and villages in a latin american country what jones and smith were to surnames in her own this she reckoned was not going to be like pinching candy from a fiveyearold she was considering her approach when the acting superintendent found her dorothea harriman had alas waxed eloquent on the subject of barbaras hair failing to append to her waxing a convenient lie about having seen barbara at a location that was not new scotland yard isabelle ardery thus accosted her on the twelfth floor where barbara had hidden herself in the mets library a convenient location from which she could access the mets databases in peace and in secrecy here you are then the acting superintendent had come upon barbara with the stealth of a hunting cat and her satisfaction was feline as well she looked like a cat decapitated mouse in jaws barbara said guv with a nod she added still on holiday on the very slight chance that isabelle ardery was there to requisition her for work ardery didnt go in that direction nor did she acknowledge barbaras status as being off rota for the moment she said ill see the hair first sergeant barbara hardly wanted to know what second was going to be considering the superintendents tone she stood to give ardery a better look ardery nodded now that she said is actually a haircut we could go as far as to call it a style considering what shed paid for it barbara thought they ought to be calling it a night at the ritz she waited for more ardery walked round her she nodded she said hair and teeth very good im quite pleased to know you can take direction when your feet are to the fire sergeant i live to please barbara said as to the clothing barbara said to remind her on holiday guv which she believed adequately explained her ensemble of tracksuit trousers teeshirt emblazoned with finish your beer children in china are sober red hightop trainers and donkey jacket even on holiday ardery said barbara youre a representative of the met when you walk in the door abruptly she brushed aside whatever shed intended to say as her gaze came to rest on barbaras tattered notebook she said what are you doing here just needed to get some information needing to get it here suggests a police matter isabelle put herself in a position to see the screen of the computers monitor she said argentina holidays barbara said airily isabelle looked further she scrolled back to the previous screen and the one before that she said reading the list of santa maria di towns developing a fondness for the virgin mary holidays suggest resorts skiing seaside visits jungle excursions adventures ecojourneys which are you interested in oh just playing with ideas at the moment barbara told her isabelle turned to her im not a fool sergeant if you wanted to look for holiday possibilities you wouldnt be doing it here that being the case and since youve asked for time off i think its safe to conclude youre doing some work for inspector lynley am i correct barbara sighed you are i see isabelles eyes narrowed as she thought this one through it seemed to lead her to a single conclusion youve been in contact with him then well more or less right regularly not sure what you mean barbara said she also wondered where the hell this was going it was not as if she had a thing with di lynley if ardery thought that she was clearly off her nut where is he sergeant the superintendent asked directly you know dont you barbara considered her answer truth was she did know truth also was lynley hadnt told her his mentioning of bernard fairclough had done that so she said he hasnt told me guv but ardery took another meaning from the moments in which barbara had been considering her options she said i see in a way that told barbara she saw something other than the truth of the matter thank you sergeant the superintendent added thank you very much indeed ardery left her then barbara knew she could call her back before she got to the door of the library she knew she could clarify but she did not do so nor did she ask herself why she was allowing the superintendent to believe something that was patently untrue instead she turned back to her work with santa maria di whatever alatea vasquez y del torres she thought whoever she was and not isabelle ardery was the crux of the matter in hand milnthorpe cumbria the end product st james had to deal with was that his wife was simply afraid afraid she was projecting them into a future for which shed come up with half a dozen alternative scenarios none of which did anything to assuage her fears what was to st james a potential solution to their longthwarted desire for a family was no solution at all to her there were too many variables that they couldnt control shed argued and reluctantly he had to admit that there was a great deal of truth in what she said an open adoption could indeed invite into their lives not only an infant in need of a loving family but also a birth mother birth father birth grandparents on both sides and god only knew who else it wasnt a simple matter of scooping up an infant from the arms of a social worker and it had to be said hoping that the child and young adult growing out of that infant would not be one who felt the need to develop a second life with a birth family he or she scouted out when of an age to do so deborah was completely right in this but so was he there would be no guarantees in any route to parenthood hed told her his brother was pressing him for an answer this girl in southampton couldnt wait forever david had said there were other interested couples come along simon its either yes or no and its not like you not to make a decision so st james had spoken to deborah again again shed been adamant theyd gone back and forth for a quarter of an hour at the end of which hed set out for a walk they hadnt actually parted badly but they needed a little space for the heat of their discussion to dissipate hed left the crow and eagle and walked in the direction of arnside along the road that skirted the river bela and ultimately the mudflats of milnthorpe sands as he walked he tried not to think but rather merely to breathe in the rainwashed damp day he needed to clear his mind of this whole adoption business once and for all if he didnt and if deborah didnt it was going to poison their marriage the damn magazine hadnt helped matters deborah had it in hand at this point and shed read the bloody thing from cover to cover from a story in conception she had concluded decisively that she wanted to go the surrogacy route her egg his sperm a petri dish and a host mother shed read a story of a sixtime surrogate and the altruism she extended towards other women it would be our child was the point she kept making ours and no one elses well it would be and it wouldnt to his way of thinking there were dangers here as well as dangers in the other routes of adoption the day was a fine one although the night had seen buckets of rain pouring down on cumbria but now the air felt clean and crisp and the sky displayed an ashen wealth of cumulus clouds out on the mudflats the stragglers from various flocks of birds heading to africa and the mediterranean still hunted for ragworms lugworms and tellins he recognised the plovers and the dunlans among them but as to the rest he could not have said he watched them for a while and admired the simplicity of their life then he turned and walked back into milnthorpe in the car park of the inn he found lynley just arriving he walked over to join him as his friend got out of the healey elliott they had a moment of mutual admiration for the saloons sleek lines and handsome paint job before st james said but you didnt come by to prompt further vehicular envy on my part i expect any chance to lord it over you in the transportation area is a chance i must grab on to but in this case youre right i wanted to talk to you a mobile would have done this was a bit of a drive hmm yes but part of the gaff is blown i reckoned a few hours away from the faircloughs wouldnt go amiss lynley told him of his evening encounter with valerie bernard and mignon fairclough now that she knows scotland yards involved shell make short work of letting everyone else know as well that could be good its actually as id have preferred it but youre uneasy i am why because of who fairclough is because of who hillier is because of hilliers damnable propensity for using me to serve his own ends st james waited for more he knew the history of lynleys relationship with the assistant commissioner it included at least one attempted coverup of a longago crime he wouldnt have put it past hillier to use lynley another time in a similar capacity in which one of their own as hillier would no doubt think of fairclough lynley and himself had something serious he wished to bury and lynley was supposed to wield the shovel anything was possible and both of them knew it lynley said it may all be a smoke screen which part of it fairclough wanting me to look into ian cresswells death thats certainly what mignon fairclough indicated last evening it was a looknofurtherthantheblokewhoemployedyou kind of remark its something id already thought of myself and dismissed however why because i just cant make sense of it simon lynley leaned against the side of the healey elliott arms crossed at his chest i can see how hed ask for the mets involvement if a murder had occurred and hed been accused or suspected and wanted to clear his name or if one or more of his children had been accused or suspected and he wanted to clear their names but this was deemed an accident from the first so why find someone to look into it if he himself is guilty of something or if he suspects one of them is that rather suggests mignon herself is throwing up a smoke screen doesnt it it would explain her trying to divert attention onto her father last night evidently cresswell wanted bernard to cut her off lynley explained the financial arrangement mignon apparently had with her father she wouldnt have wanted that and since cresswell kept the books and knew every move bernard made financially theres the additional possibility that he wanted someone else cut off as well the son hes the likely choice isnt he with nicholass past cresswell would have argued not to trust him with a penny and who could blame him nicholas fairclough might be a recovering methamphetamine user but thats the key word recovering and not recovered addicts never recover they merely cope daytoday lynley would know about that st james acknowledged because of his own brother and has fairclough handed money to his son i want to look into that the other daughter and her husband are my means to the information st james looked away noise and odours were coming from an open door into the back of the hotel the crashing and banging of pots along with the smell of frying bacon and burnt toast he said to lynley what about valerie fairclough tommy as killer ian cresswell was no blood to her he was her husbands nephew and he had the potential to damage her children if he wanted to cut off mignon and he doubted nicholass longterm recovery hed steer fairclough away from helping them financially as fairclough tended to do and valerie faircloughs behaviour that day was decidedly strange according to constable schlicht dressed to the nines perfectly calm a phone call announcing a dead man floating in my boathouse theres that lynley admitted but she could have been the intended victim as well motive mignon declares her father is hardly ever there hes in london repeatedly havers is looking into that end of things but if somethings not right with the faircloughs marriage bernard could have hopes to rid himself of his wife why not divorce her because of fairclough industries hes run it forever and of course hed stand to walk away with a great deal of money if it was part of a settlement unless theres some sort of prenuptial agreement were not privy to but as of now its still her company and i daresay she can throw her weight into whatever decisions are made at the place if she wants to another reason for her to want ian dead tommy if hed been recommending decisions not to her liking possibly but wouldnt it make more sense for her to have ian fired why kill him when she had the power to cut him off as easily as he wanted to cut off two of her children so where do we stand st james pointed out to him that the fillet knife theyd brought up from the water looked perfectly innocent to the naked eye not a scratch upon it the stones theyd also brought up bore no recent scratches to indicate theyd been jemmied away from the dock they could get constable schlicht out to the boathouse and the local soco boys involved but they were going to need the coroner to reopen the case and they had virtually nothing to give him in order to encourage him to have another look at ian cresswells death the answer lies with the people lynley said they all bear a closer looking into which means i think that my usefulness to you has run its course st james said although theres a final route we might go with the fillet knife and another conversation that might be had with mignon lynley was about to reply to these suggestions when his mobile rang he looked at the caller and said its havers this could tell us where we need to head next he flipped the phone open and said tell me youve got something meaningful sergeant because all were running into here is one dead end after another arnside cumbria alatea had gone out early to plant bulbs because she wanted to avoid her husband shed slept poorly with her mind racing hour after hour and at the first sign of dawn shed slipped out of bed and faded out of the house nicholas had slept badly as well something was very wrong the first evidence of this had come over dinner on the previous evening he toyed with his food mostly cutting the meat and moving it round the plate mostly slicing the potatoes neatly and piling them up like poker chips to her question of what was bothering him hed smiled vaguely and said just a bit off my food tonight and ultimately hed pushed away from the table and wandered off into the drawing room where hed sat in the fireplace inglenook briefly and then paced the room as if it were a cage and he the imprisoned animal on display when theyd gone to bed things had been worse with a rising feeling of dread shed approached him a hand on his chest shed said nicky somethings wrong tell me although the truth was that she feared hearing his answer more than she feared her own restless mind and where it took her when she allowed it free rein hed said nothing really darling just tired or something just a bit on edge and when shed not been able to prevent a look of alarm washing over her features hed gone on to say youre not to worry allie and she knew he was reassuring her that whatever was going on inside him it bore no relationship to his past with drugs she hadnt thought it had however but she played along saying you might want to talk to someone nicky you know how it is and he nodded but he looked at her with so much love in his face that she realised whatever was on his mind most likely had to do with her they hadnt made love this too was unlike her husband because she had approached him and not the opposite and hed long loved to be approached by her because he was not a fool and he knew very well how disparate was everything about them at least everything visible to a world that judged peoples equality by external matters so the fact that she would want him at least as often as he wanted her had always thrilled nicholas who had always responded this too was a sign so when alatea left the house and made her way to the garden it was in part because she needed to do something to take her mind off the terrifying possibilities that had been assailing her throughout the night but it was also in part to avoid seeing nicholas because eventually what was bothering him was going to come out into the open and she didnt think shed be able to face it there were several thousand bulbs to be planted she planned the lawn to be filled with early glories of the snow so that a bank of blue upon green would fall from the house down to the seawall and this was going to take considerable work for which she was glad she would not of course be able to complete it in this one morning but she could make a very good start she set upon it with shovel and spade and the hours passed quickly when she was sure her husband would have left arnside house to make the drive to barrowinfurness for his half day at fairclough industries prior to his work at the pele project she finished up what she was doing and stretched and rubbed the sore spots on her back it was only when she headed to the house that she saw his car and understood that nicholas hadnt gone to work at all her gaze then went from the car to the house and the dread she felt crept up her spine he was in the kitchen he was sitting at the broad oak table and he appeared to be brooding there was a cup of coffee in front of him with a cafetiere and a bowl of sugar nearby but the cup of coffee appeared undrunk and a ring of sediment round the inside of the cafetiere suggested its contents had long gone cold he hadnt dressed for the day he wore the trousers of his pyjamas and the dressing gown shed given him for his birthday his feet were bare although he didnt seem to be bothered by the fact that the tiles on the floor would be cold against them there was much about his appearance that wasnt right but least right was the fact that nicholas never missed work alatea wasnt sure what to say she went with the lead he had given her during dinner the night before she said nicky i didnt think you were still at home are you ill just needed to think he looked at her then and she saw his eyes were bloodshot a tingling went up her arms and felt as if it would encircle her heart he said this seemed like the best place to do it she didnt want to ask the obvious but not to do so would have been more obvious still so she said think about what whats wrong he said nothing at first she watched him he moved his gaze from her and it seemed he was thinking about her question and all the different answers he might give at first he said manette came to see me in the shipping department are there problems there its tim and gracie she wanted us to take them take them what do you mean he explained she heard but didnt hear because all the time she was busy trying to evaluate his tone he spoke of his cousin ian of ians wife niamh and of ians two children alatea of course knew all of them but she had not known of niamhs intentions towards her own flesh and blood it was inconceivable to her that niamh would use her children in this way as chess pieces in a game that by all rights should have been over she wanted to weep for tim and gracie and she felt the imperative of doing something for them as much as nicholas obviously felt it but for this to have disturbed his sleep to have made him ill he wasnt telling her everything manette and freddie are the best ones to take them he concluded im no match for tims problems but manette and freddie are shed get through to tim shed be good at that she doesnt give up on anyone so it seems theres a solution yes alatea said hopefully except that manette and freddie have split up so that throws a spanner nicholas said their situations odd its also unstable he was silent again for a moment and he used the moment to top up his cold coffee with more cold coffee into which he stirred a heaped teaspoonful of sugar and thats too bad he went on because they belong together those two i cant think why they split up in the first place except they never had kids and i think perhaps that wrecked them after a time oh god this was the crux alatea thought this was where it all headed in the end she had known it would if not with nicholas then with someone else she said perhaps they didnt want children some people dont some people but not manette he glanced at her his face was drawn from this alatea knew he wasnt telling her the truth tim and gracie might indeed be in need of a stable place to live but that was not what was bothering her husband she said theres more though she drew out a chair from the table and sat i think nicky that you had better tell me it had long been a strong part of their relationship that from the first nicholas had told her everything hed insisted upon it because of how hed lived in his past which had been in a world of lies experiencing a life defined by hiding his drug use in any way he could if he didnt tell her everything now despite what that everything might comprise his withholding of information would be more damaging to their marriage than whatever the information itself was both of them knew it he finally said i believe my father thinks i killed ian this was so far from what alatea had been expecting that she was rendered speechless there were words somewhere inside her but she couldnt find them at least not in english nicholas said scotland yards up here looking into ians death considering it was ruled an accident theres only one reason that scotland yards turned up dad can pull strings when he wants to i reckon thats what he did thats impossible alateas mouth felt dry she wanted to reach for nicholass coffee and drink it down but she stopped herself from even moving so unsure was she of her ability to keep the sudden trembling of her body under her control how do you know this nicky that journalist what are you talking about that man that same man the one who came here the story that never was a story at all nicholas nodded hes back he told me scotland yards here the rest is clear enough im the person theyre interested in he said that the journalist said that not in so many words but from everything thats gone on its obvious there was something more here that he wasnt telling her alatea could read it in his face she said i dont believe it you why on earth would you have hurt ian and why would your father think you could he shrugged she saw that he was struggling with a conflict that he couldnt bear to reveal and she herself struggled to understand what it was and what it could mean to both of them he was deeply depressed or deeply grieved or deeply very deeply something else she said i think you should speak to your father you must do this straightaway this reporter nicky he doesnt mean you well and now this woman who says shes from the film company that doesnt exist you must talk to your father at once you must hear the truth of the matter its the only answer nicky he raised his head his eyes were liquid her heart constricted with her love for this man troubled soul to her own troubled soul he said well ive definitely decided against being part of that documentary film that she was here about ive told her that by the way so theres one less thing for either of us to deal with his lips curved but it was a poor effort at a smile it was meant to encourage her to tell her all would be well soon enough both of them knew this was a lie however but like everything else neither one of them would be willing to admit that milnthorpe cumbria i wouldnt want to have to write it on an envelope but they probably have some spanish abbreviation if youre sending a letter there havers said she was referring to the town in argentina that shed managed to come up with as being the likeliest origin of alatea vasquez y del torres santa maria de la cruz de los angeles y de los santos she had just announced to lynley over his mobile phone were talking about a burg thats touching all the spiritual bases it must be in an earthquake zone and hoping for divine intervention in case of the worst lynley could hear her smoking on the other end no surprise havers was always smoking she wouldnt be at the met then or if she was she was phoning from a stairwell where he knew she occasionally skulked for an illegal hit of the weed he said to her why this town barbara and to st james who had joined him to lean against the healey elliott shes onto alatea fairclough whore you talking to havers enquired irritably i bloody well hate threeway conversations st james is here ill switch it to the speaker if i can work out how to do that oh thatll happen on a snowy day in hell she said give it to simon sir he can do it for you havers im not entirely sir it was her patientasasaint voice there was nothing for it he handed the mobile over to st james one or two buttons and both of them were listening to havers in the car park of the crow and eagle its the mayor havers said i know this is spitting in the dark sir but the mayors a bloke called esteban vega y de vasquez and his wifes called dominga padilla y del torres de vasquez i reckoned it could be a putitalltogetherandwhatveyougot situation some of the surnames are the same as alateas thats a stretch barbara this came from the internet st james asked bloody hours on it and since everythings in sodding spanish im only guessing hes the mayor he could be the dog catcher but there was a picture of him and i cant think why the dog catcherd be handing over the keys to the city to anyone in some picture well except maybe to barbara woodhouse shes dead lynley said whatever so theres a picture of him and hes in his mayor kit and theres his wife and theyre posing with someone and i cant of course read the caption since its in spanish in which language i can actually say una cerveza por favor but believe me nothing else but the names are in the caption esteban and dominga and all the rest so far thats our best bet i reckon because i havent been able to find anything else even close well need someone to translate lynley noted what about you simon spanish among your many talents only french st james said well theres latin as well but im not sure how much use that would be well we got to find someone and we need someone else to tell us how these people come up with their surnames because i bloody dont know and cant work it out it has to do with forebears lynley said got that much i think but what is it do they just keep lining them up back through history wouldnt want to have to write that on my passport application if you know what i mean lynley was thinking about the language and who would serve their purposes as a translator there would of course be someone in the met but he wasnt sure how many more people he could afford to bring in on this before isabelle traced the lot of them back to him he said what about alatea fairclough herself whatve you come up with on that score when you work her into this town of santa maria et cetera youre assuming shes the mayors daughter i take it havers said cant go that way at all sir they seem to have five sons she inhaled on the other end of the line and blew smoke noisily into the mobile phone lynley heard the rustling of paper and knew she was leafing through her notebook as well she went on to say carlos miguel angel santiago and diego at least i reckon there are five sons considering the way these people string together their names it could be one bloke i spose so where does alatea fit in way i see it she could be the wife of one of them a wife on the run sounds very good to me what about a relative st james asked a niece a cousin i reckon thats possible as well are you working that angle lynley asked her havent been can do but no way can i delve because like i said this stuffs in spanish she reminded him course the yardll have a program to translate you know something buried on the computers somewhere away from the prying eyes of the likes of us who might actually need to use it sometime i cn talk to winston hell know how to do it should i ask him lynley thought about this he was back to what hed considered earlier the impact on isabelle ardery if she discovered hed bled another member of her team away for his own purposes the results of that manoeuvre wouldnt be pretty there had to be another way to get round the problem of the spanish language where he didnt want to go in his own thoughts at the moment was why it mattered to him how isabelle would react it wouldnt have mattered to him how a superior officer might have reacted before this the fact that he was worried now put him on the edge of a dangerous escarpment that he didnt want to be on at this juncture in his life he said there has to be another way barbara i cant get winston into this as well im not authorised havers didnt point out to him that he hadnt been authorised to get her help either she just said let me well i could ask azhar your neighbor he speaks spanish he does practically everything else she said ironically but i reckon if he doesnt speak spanish he can get me someone from the university who does a professor probably a graduate student worse comes to worse i cn walk over to camden lock market and listen to the tourists if there are any at this time of year and put my fingers on someone speaking spanish and drag em to the nearest internet cafe for a look at the information on the net i mean there are ways sir i spose we dont need winston ask azhar lynley said and he added if that doesnt put you in a difficult position why would that put me in a difficult position sir barbaras tone was suspicious and with good reason lynley didnt reply there were things between them that they didnt discuss her relationship with taymullah azhar was one of them anything else he asked her bernard fairclough hes got a set of keys to the flat of a woman called vivienne tully ive been there but so far no luck in seeing her picture of her that i tracked down makes her youngish trendy clothes good skin good figure edgy hairstyle another womans basic nightmare essentially all i know about her is that she once worked for him she now works in london and she likes ballet because thats where she was yesterday either at a dance class or watching a performance her housekeeper didnt speak english so we did it with sign language lots of moving body parts if you know what i mean bloody hell sir have you noticed how few people actually do speak english in london these days have you noticed simon i feel like im living in the bloody lobby of the bloody united nations fairclough has a key to her flat sounds cosy eh ive another trip to kensington on the agenda i reckon she bears a little arm twisting i havent got onto the cresswell will yet no matter lynley told her she could verify details but they had that information in hand theyd learned there was insurance that the exwife had come into and according to the partner the farm had been left to him in cresswells will what she could do though was confirm these details the date of the will might be helpful too could she see to that could and would she told him what about the kids apparently cresswell assumed the insurance money would also benefit them that doesnt appear to be the case however havers whistled always good to follow the money isnt it just which reminds me she said that bloke from the source have you run into him yet not yet lynley said why because theres more to him than meets the eye as well turns out he was up there for three days directly before ian cresswell drowned with him needing to beef up his story for the paper seems like murders a good way to do it well take that on board lynley told her but hed have had to get onto the fairclough property get down to the boathouse fiddle with the dock and get off the property all unseen you mentioned he was a big bloke didnt you nearly seven feet tall a nonstarter then its doubtful but at this point anythings possible lynley thought about the likelihood of a sevenfoottall redheaded reporter managing to escape the notice of mignon fairclough only in the dead of a very dark night could this have happened he reckoned he said weve our work cut out one way or the other it signaled an end to their conversation and he knew the sergeant would take it that way but before she could do so he had to know even if he didnt want to understand why he had to know he said are you carrying this off without the superintendents knowledge she still thinks youre on holiday youve not run into her at the met have you there was a silence in it he knew what the answer was he avoided st jamess glance as he said damn thats going to make things difficult for you i mean im sorry barbara she said airily truth to tell the guvs a bit tense inspector but you know me im used to tense milnthorpe cumbria deborah hated being at odds with her husband this was due in part to the disparity in their ages and due in part to his disability and all the baggage attendant upon that but most of all it was due to the differences in their characters which defined how each of them looked at life simon went at things logically and with remarkable disinterest making it nearly impossible to argue with him because she looked at things through a cloud of emotion in a battle where the warring armies marched onto the field from either the heart or the head those battalions from the head won each skirmish she was often left with that most useless of declarations to put a full stop to any heated conversation between herself and her husband you dont understand when simon left her in their room at the inn she did what she knew had to be done she phoned his brother david and gave him what she called their decision i so much appreciate how youve thought of us david she told him and she meant every word but i cant get my mind round sharing a baby with its birth parents so were saying no she could tell that david was disappointed and she had little doubt that the rest of simons family would be disappointed as well but simons family were not being asked to open their lives and their hearts to the virtual unknown david said you know its all a lottery deb any way you go at parenthood to which shed said i do know that but the answers the same the complications involved i wouldnt be able to cope so it was over in a day or two the pregnant girl in question would move on her way towards another couple eager for a child deborah was glad shed made the decision but she felt disconsolate all the same simon wouldnt be pleased but she couldnt see any answer other than the one shed given they simply had to move on she could tell her husband was more than illatease with going down the surrogacy route shed actually thought it would appeal to him since he was a scientist but for him the miracles of modern medicine were turning out to be dehumanising deborah locking himself up in a doctors loo and seeing to the appropriate deposit made into the equally appropriate sterile container and then there was the matter of harvesting her eggs and what that involved and the additional matter of the surrogate and monitoring the surrogate throughout the pregnancy and even finding the surrogate in the first place who is this person he reasonably asked and how do you make sure of all the things you need to make sure of this person is just a womb were hiring was how deborah explained it to him if thats what you think the extent of her involvement would be simon replied then youve got your head in the clouds were not hiring a vacant room in her house to store furniture deborah this is a life thats growing inside her body you seem to think shell ignore that therell be a contract for heavens sake look here in the magazine theres a story about that magazine he said needs to go into the rubbish deborah however didnt toss it away when he left the room instead she phoned david and when shed done so shed sat and looked at the copy of conception that barbara havers had overnighted to her she gazed at the photos of the sixtime surrogate posing with the happy families shed helped she reread the article finally she turned to the back where the advertisements were everything related to reproduction had some sort of listing she saw but despite the hopeful article in the magazine itself nothing referred to surrogacy phoning a legal service listed on the page told her why this was the case advertising oneself as a surrogate mother was illegal she learned the hopeful mother had to find her own surrogate a relative is best she was told have you a sister madam a cousin even mothers have carried their own grandchildren for their daughters how old is your own mother god nothing was easy deborah thought she had no sister her mother was dead she was an only child of only children simons sister was a possibility but she couldnt imagine the madcap sidney currently in the throes of love with a mercenary soldier for heavens sake allowing her millionpound models body to be the launching pad for her brothers child there were definite limits to sororial love and deborah reckoned she knew what they were the law was not her friend in this matter advertising everything else related to reproduction appeared to be entirely legal from clinics offering money to women willing to have their eggs harvested to lesbian couples looking for sperm there were even adverts for groups who wanted to talk donors out of donating in the first place along with counseling services for donors recipients and everyone in between there were help lines listed and assistance offered from nurses doctors clinics and midwives there were so many options heading in so many different directions that deborah wondered someone didnt simply advertise in conception with the single word help this thought finally took her to the matter of the magazine itself and how it had come to her attention through alatea fairclough who had torn out these very same pages that were now eating at deborahs peace of mind with herself in turmoil over the matter deborah began to see more clearly how alatea could be viewing her own situation what if alatea knew she couldnt carry a baby to term deborah asked herself what if she hadnt yet shared that information with her husband what if she just as deborah herself was proposing to do was searching for a surrogate mother here she was in england away from her native land away from friends and relatives who might have volunteered for the job was there someone she could turn to in their stead was there someone she could ask to carry her petri dish child made with nicholas fairclough deborah thought about this she compared alatea to herself she had sidney st james unlikely candidate though she was whom did alatea have there was a possibility she realised one that fitted in with what had happened in the boathouse at ireleth hall she needed to tell simon about it she needed to talk to tommy as well she left the room simon had been a good while gone on his walk and she punched in his mobile number as she descended the stairs speaking with tommy in the car park he told her they were just about to she told him to wait she was coming to meet them both nicholas fairclough was what stopped her however he was the last person she expected to see in the tiny lobby of the crow and eagle but there he was and he was waiting for her he rose when he saw her and he said i reckoned this is where youd be he spoke as if shed been making an effort to hide herself from him and she pointed this out his reply of no i get that much the best place to hide anything is always in plain sight she frowned he was completely altered he was very drawn and his cherubic face had gone unshaven he didnt seem to have had much sleep for there were circles under his eyes there was also nothing friendly or affable about him he made no preamble to his remarks he said look i know who you really are and heres what you need to know i didnt touch ian i wouldnt have touched ian the fact that my father thinks i might have done something tells you the state our family is in but it sure as hell doesnt tell you anything else you and here he jabbed a finger at her although he didnt touch her need to get the hell back to london theres sodall to learn from hanging about your bloody investigation is over and leave my wife alone all right are you stay away he backed off and when he was far enough he turned on his heel and left her deborah remained she felt her heart pounding hard in her chest and the blood started singing in her ears there was she knew only one explanation when every single statement hed made was considered for whatever inconceivable reason nicholas fairclough actually believed that she was the scotland yard detective come to cumbria to look into his cousins death there was only one way he could have reached that conclusion and her digital camera had captured that way milnthorpe cumbria zed benjamin had faded out of the picture on the previous day after his brief encounter with nicholas fairclough in the milnthorpe market square luckily there were enough stalls in the square that hed been able to get out of view of the cafe in which fairclough had been meeting with the scotland yard woman so after fairclough had a few final words with her all it took was a few more minutes of waiting before she emerged from the cafe as well and then it was nothing to see where she was going since where she was going turned out to be the crow and eagle at the junction of the main road through milnthorpe and the route to arnside so on this day zed had parked himself there in the early am in the vicinity of a natwest and hed been skulking round the cash point for hours eyes on the inn waiting for the woman to emerge this garnered him many a look of suspicion from people going in and out of the bank and a few pointed words from other people using the cash point he was even prodded once in the chest by an old bag telling him to move away laddie or ill have the coppers on you i know your kind i do so he began to hope that something would happen soon on the scotland yard end of things or he was going to get hauled into the nick for loitering with intent hed had his morning phone call with yaffa and this was on his mind she hadnt returned his kissy noises the reason turning out to be that his mother wasnt in the room and a show of affection hadnt been necessary to keep susanna benjamin happy plus it also turned out that there were problems developing with micah out in tel aviv apparently getting a bit weary with playing yaffas brother ari in conversation with micah she had said attractive in reference to zed it was no big thing for goodness sake shed told micah but he hadnt been pleased and while zed had been dwelling on the fact that yaffa had used the word attractive to refer to him shed gone on to say that there was sadly enough a very good chance that she was going to have to move on soon to other lodgings quite beside himself was how she put it in reference to micah she was afraid his worry over her commitment to him was going to put him off his studies for a man in medical school this was out of the question but you know how it is when a man becomes uneasy about his woman zed actually zed had no idea how it was when a man became uneasy about his woman since hed so far spent his adult years avoiding women altogether yaffa said that she thought she could appease her fiance for a while longer but only for a while then she would either have to move on or she would have to return to tel aviv zed hadnt known what to say he was hardly in a position to beg her to stay he wasnt even sure why begging her to stay crossed his mind in the first place yet that entreaty was what was on the tip of his tongue at the end of their conversation what was not on the tip of his tongue was have a nice trip home then which was something of a surprise to him shed rung off before he could say anything at all he wanted to ring her back and tell her that hed miss her terribly he hadnt intended her to think from his silence that he wouldnt hed enjoyed their every conversation in fact she was just the sort of woman but he couldnt go that far alas and alack he thought theyd have to be keats and fanny writing tortured letters to each other and there was an end to the matter zed was so consumed with his thoughts about yaffa and micah and the great irony of stumbling across a woman who was lets face it perfect for him only to find her engaged to another man that when nick fairclough turned up at the crow and eagle and went inside the importance of this didnt register at first he merely thought ah theres old nick fairclough and hed pulled his cap more firmly down on his head and slouched to reduce his size so as to make himself less noticeable it was only after faircloughs visit to the inn was so brief and only after he strode out with a stony expression on his face that zed realised what one and one amounted to which was fairclough plus the detective equals something worthy of note happening then the detective herself came out she was on her mobile a detective on her mobile meant that developments were about to develop fairclough had left and the detective was following zed needed to be following as well his car wasnt far away hed parked on the pavement just a short distance down the arnside road so he dashed for this as the redhaired woman went round the corner of the inn where no doubt her own car was parked he fired his car up and waited for her to emerge no way was she going anywhere at this point without him on her tail he counted the seconds they turned into minutes what was it he wondered car trouble flat tyre where the hell was she finally a car did emerge from the car park round back of the crow and eagle but this was no hire car and she wasnt driving it it was instead a sleek coppercoloured antique thing of the sort costing god only knew what and it was driven by a bloke who looked perfectly at ease in it not to mention wellheeled because how else could he have afforded the thing another guest at the inn zed concluded the bloke took off towards the north about three minutes later another car emerged and zed put his vehicle in gear but this one was driven by a bloke as well a seriouslooking gent with too much dark hair and he was looking grim and rubbing his head as if he needed to get rid of a migraine then at last he saw the woman but she was on foot she wasnt on her mobile this time but her face was serious and determined zed reckoned at first she was on her way to some location nearby and the logical place was the market square where the cafes made good meeting spots as did the restaurants and the chinese takeaways if it came down to it but instead of heading there she went back into the crow and eagle zed made his decision in an instant he switched off the cars engine and dashed after her he could he reckoned follow her forever or he could take the bull by the horns and do some fancy dancing with it he pushed through the door of the inn milnthorpe cumbria deborah was so angry with simon that she was far beyond seeing red she was seeing whatever the next colour in the outrage spectrum was supposed to be camera in hand shed found her husband with tommy in the car park it was she believed excellent luck that tommy was with him for tommy was going to be on her side and she knew she was going to need an ally shed given them the information in brief nicholas fairclough waylaying her in the inn nicholas fairclough knowing scotland yard was looking into the death of ian cresswell nicholas fairclough believing that she of all people was the scotland yard detective prowling round his life she said theres only one way hedve reached that conclusion at which point she showed them the photo shed snapped on the previous day this was of the redheaded man speaking to fairclough in the market square she said right afterwards nicholas wanted nothing more to do with me we were meant to go to barrow but that didnt happen and then this morning he was in such a state you see what this means dont you tommy looked at the picture simon did not tommy said its the reporter from the source simon barbara described him to me huge redhaired there cant be two blokes wandering round cumbria fitting that description and interested in fairclough better and better deborah had thought shed said tommy we can use him somethings obviously going on with this entire lot of people and hes onto it or he wouldnt be up here let me make contact with him hell think hes got an in with the police we can deborah simon had said it was that tone that maddening tone of shemustbeappeased tommy had added to this i dont know deb and he looked away for a moment she couldnt tell if he was thinking about what she said or thinking about getting out of the car park before she and simon had the argument he would be anticipating for tommy knew simon better than anyone he knew what deborah meant when simon said it that way there were reasons for simons concern in some situations all right she could admit that but there was no reason for his concern just now shed said this is being handed to us on a platter tommy to which tommy had said barbara told me he was up here three days in advance of cresswells death deb his intent has been to add some interest to a story on nicholas fairclough so deborah its obvious enough simon put in theres a chance that this bloke oh you cant be thinking his idea of adding interest to a story was to arrange the suspicious death of a member of his subjects own family thats completely absurd and as both of the men started to speak at once she said no wait listen to me ive had a think about this and therere things you dont know they have to do with nicholass wife it was to her advantage that neither of the men had met alatea neither had met nicholas fairclough either so that was an additional advantage tommy said barbaras looking into alatea fairclough deb but deborah said she may be doing but she doesnt know everything and she proceeded to tell them about those things that alatea fairclough had to hide therere photographs somewhere according to nicholas she was a model but the kind of work she did is the kind shed prefer to keep hidden she told nicholas about it but no one in his family knows he called it naughty underwear and i think we all know what you can read for that what exactly simon was watching her with that look of his grave and understanding and worried stuff and bloody bother deborah thought she said we can read for that everything from catalogue pictures of leather goodies for the sadomasochistic crowd to pornography simon i think we can agree on that cant we youre right of course tommy said but barbaras on this deb shell sort it out but thats not all tommy thats not everything deborah knew simon would not be pleased with her next direction but she intended to take it anyway because it had to be explored because it was surely connected to ian cresswell theres surrogacy to consider simon actually went pale at this deborah realised he thought she intended to bring up this most personal of matters with tommy standing there as an arbitrator of their disagreement and their pain she said to her husband not that i just think its likely alatea cant carry a baby to term or shes having difficulty with pregnancy i think shes looking for a surrogate and i think that that surrogate might well be ian cresswells wife niamh simon and tommy exchanged a look but they hadnt seen niamh cresswell so they didnt know she went over it with them nicholas faircloughs desire for a baby alateas possession of a magazine with all of the advertisements in the back removed niamh cresswells appearance and the very clear indication that shed been doing something surgically to improve it one doesnt have breast enhancement on the national health was how deborah put it and the simple logic of a woman whos lost her man and believes she has to have a replacement and wants to do something to increase her chances of finding that replacement niamh has to finance all this carrying a baby for alatea is the answer its illegal to profit from surrogacy but this is a family matter and whos going to know if money is exchanged nicholas and alatea certainly arent going to tell a soul so niamh has their baby she hands it over they hand her the money and its done simon and tommy greeted this with silence tommy looked down at his shoes this was the moment when they were going to tell her she was off her nut oh how well she knew these two men in her life so she went on or perhaps even better nicholas fairclough doesnt even know about the arrangement alateas going to fake the entire pregnancy shes quite tall and theres a very good chance shed never show a pregnancy till very late in term niamh takes herself out of the picture for a few months and when shes ready to deliver alatea joins her they come up with a pretence they god deborah simon rubbed his forehead while tommy shifted his feet on the ground inanely deborah thought how tommy always wore lobbs shoes they must have cost a fortune she reckoned but of course they would last forever and the pair he had on hed probably had since he was twentyfive years old they werent scuffed of course tommys man charlie denton valet butler man friday equerry whatever in tommys life would never have allowed scuff marks on tommys shoes but they were worn and comfortable rather like friends and simon was speaking and she realised shed deliberately plugged her ears to his words he would think that all this had to do with her with them with this stupid open adoption business which of course he had no idea shed put a stop to so she decided to tell him then and there i phoned david she said i told him no definitely not i cant cope with it simon simons jaw moved that was all hurriedly deborah said to tommy so lets say ian cresswell found out about all of this he protests he says that their children his and niamhs are already putting up with just about enough in their lives and they cant be asked to cope with their mother carrying a baby for his cousins wife theres too much confusion he puts his foot down theyre divorced tommy pointed out gently since when did divorce mean people stop trying to control each other if they can get away with it lets say he goes to nicholas he appeals to him nicholas knows whats going on or he doesnt know but in either case the appeal goes nowhere so ian says hes going to have to talk to nicholass father about it the last thing anyone wants is to have bernard fairclough drawn into this hes already spent most of nicholass life believing hes a wastrel and now this this terrible division in the family enough simon said really i do mean it enough the paternal tone behind his words was an electric shock thirty thousand volts running through her body deborah said what did you say to me simon said it doesnt take a freudian to know where this is coming from deborah the electric shock turned in an instant to fury deborah began to speak simon cut her off this is a flight of fancy its time for both of us to get back to london ive done what i can here this to tommy and unless we want another go at the boathouse i daresay what appears to be the case about ian cresswells death is indeed the case that he would actually dismiss her like this deborah had never wanted to strike her husband but she wanted it badly in that moment temper deb temper her father would have said but never had her father been taken so lightly by this man who stood implacably before her god he was insufferable she thought he was pompous he was so bloody selfrighteous he was always so sure so certain so percent full of his sodding scientific knowledge but some things had nothing to do with science some things had to do with the heart some things werent about forensics microscopes bloodstains computer analyses graphs charts amazing machinery that would take a single thread and connect it to a manufacturer a skein of wool the sheep it had come from and the farm on the hebrides where that sheep had been born she wanted to scream she wanted to scratch out his eyes she wanted she does have a point simon tommy said simon looked at him and his expression asked his old friend if hed entirely lost his mind tommy said i dont doubt there was bad blood between nicholas and his cousin somethings not right with bernard as well granted simon said but a scenario in which ians former wife he waved off the entire idea tommy then said but its too dangerous deb if what youre saying is true but youve done good work up here but simons right about going back to london ill take it from here i cant let you put yourself in harms way you know that he meant more than one thing all of them knew it she shared a history with tommy and even if she hadnt done he would never allow her to come close to a danger that could take her from simon as tommys own wife had been taken from him she said numbly theres no danger here you know that tommy if murders involved theres always danger hed said all he would say on the topic he left them then and left her with simon there in the car park simon had said to her im sorry deborah i know that you want to help shed said bitterly oh you know that do you lets not pretend this isnt about punishing me for what he sounded so bloody surprised for saying no to david for not solving our problem with one little word yes thats what you wanted an instant solution without once considering how it would feel to me with an entire second family hovering out there watching my every move evaluating what sort of mummy id be she was close to tears this infuriated her simon said this has nothing to do with your phoning david if youve made up your mind i accept it what else can i do i might have other wishes but and thats what counts thats what always counts your wishes not mine because should my wishes be granted in any matter the power shifts doesnt it and you dont want that he reached towards her but she backed away she said just go about your business weve said enough at this point he waited for a moment he was watching her but she couldnt look at him she couldnt look at his eyes and see the pain and know how far back into his past it reached he finally said well talk later and he went to his car another moment and hed driven away out of the car park and about his business whatever it was it didnt matter to deborah she left the car park herself she went towards the front door of the inn shed got just inside when she heard someone say hang on you and i need to talk and she turned to see that of all people the redheaded giant was coming in the entrance before she had a chance to say anything he continued your covers been blown it can be on the front page of the source tomorrow or you and i can strike a deal what sort of deal deborah asked him the kind that gets us both what we want great urswick cumbria lynley knew that simon was right about deborah she needed to stay clear of things from this point forward they didnt know exactly what they were dealing with and anything that might put her into danger was unacceptable on so many levels that most of them didnt bear talking about hed been wrong to bring them into this it had seemed a simple enough job that he could sort through with their help in a day or so that wasnt turning out to be the case and he needed to finish things before deborah did something that he she and simon would regret when he left them in milnthorpe he headed north then east then he took the road that coursed down the spatulate landmass at whose tip sat barrowinfurness barrow wasnt his destination however he wanted to speak to manette fairclough privately and that meant a trip to great urswick the route he followed took him through the hilly victorian sea town of grangeoversands along the estuary where wintering birds formed a living landscape across the mudflats establishing hierarchies in the search for food it was abundant here replenished daily by the tides from morecambe bay after grangeoversands the road opened to grey water deceptive in its calm along one side of the car and pastures on the other side broken by the occasional line of cottages where seaside holiday makers came in better weather this was far south in cumbria not the land of the lakes so treasured by john ruskin and william wordsworth and his daffodils here most people got down to the serious handtomouth of daily living which comprised generations of fishermen out on the shifting sands of the bay first with horses and carts and now with tractors and always within inches of losing their lives to the quicksand if they made a wrong decision and then there was no saving them if the tide came in there was only waiting for their bodies to turn up sometimes they did sometimes they did not at bardsea he turned inland great urswick was landlocked one of those villages that seemed to exist merely because it was at a crossroads and contained a pub to get to it one traveled through a countryside completely unlike the dramatic fells slatestudded screes and sudden eruptions of limestone of the upper lakes this part of cumbria looked more like the broads one climbed briefly through a village and then out onto a landscape flat and windswept suitable for grazing buildings in great urswick didnt look like part of cumbria either they were prettily painted but they were not done up in the vernacular of the lakes no neatly stacked slate fronted them for a consistency of appearance here they were roughcast some even were clad in wood a strange building material for this part of the world lynley found manettes home alongside a large pond which appeared to be the centrepiece of the village swans floated on it and it was thick with reeds here and there to protect them their nests and their young there were two cars parked in front of the house so he reckoned he could kill two birds by speaking to both manette and her former husband with whom bernard fairclough had revealed his daughter still lived he went to the door a man answered this lynley reckoned would be freddie mcghie he was a decentlooking bloke neat as a pin dark hair dark eyes helen would have declared how squeaky clean he is darling but she would have meant it in the best possible sense because everything about him was perfectly groomed he wasnt dressed for work but he still managed to look like someone whod stepped out of an advertisement for country life lynley introduced himself mcghie said ah yes bernards guest from london manette said shed met you he sounded affable but there was a sense of questioning in his tone there was after all no reason that bernard faircloughs guest from london would come awandering into great urswick and knock on freddie mcghies front door lynley said he was hoping to speak to manette if she was at home mcghie glanced towards the street as if for answer to a question he didnt ask then he said as if remembering his manners oh yes well of course its just that she didnt mention what lynley wondered he waited politely for elucidation no matter mcghie said do come in ill fetch her he ushered lynley into a sitting room that overlooked the back garden and the pond beyond it the dominant indoor feature was a treadmill it was state of the art with a screen that featured readouts buttons and assorted geegaws to accommodate it and a rubber mat for preliminary stretching much of the other furniture in the room had been stacked and lined against a far wall mcghie said oh sorry not thinking the kitchens better its just this way and he walked on he left lynley there in the kitchen for a moment and went off calling manettes name as his footsteps sounded against rising stairs however the kitchens exterior door opened and manette herself came inside lynley reflected as he hadnt done before that she looked nothing like her sister she had her mothers height and her mothers rangy build but unfortunately shed inherited her fathers hair this was sparse enough to see to her skull although she kept the cut of it short and curly as if to hide its scarcity she was dressed for running obviously the person who used the treadmill in the districts often inclement weather she saw lynley at once and said goodness well hello and her glance went to the door through which hed come because she obviously heard her former husband calling her name she said excuse me and went in the same direction as mcghie lynley heard her call out down here freddie i was out for a run and then his reply of oh i say manette which was all lynley heard because at that point their voices became hushed he caught mcghies should i and his happy to you know without knowing the what or the why of each still when manette returned she had freddie mcghie in tow her choice of words was apparently deliberate when she said to lynley a nice surprise for us this did dad want you to pop in to see us for some reason i did want to speak to you both lynley said they exchanged a look he realised it was more than time to drop the pretence which hadnt worked with mignon and which certainly wasnt going to work with anyone else he took out his police identification and handed it to manette her eyes narrowed she pushed it to mcghie and while he was examining it she asked the obvious question whats this about i cant think it likely scotland yards on the trail of replacing their lavatories and theyve sent you up here to evaluate our line of loos whats your guess freddie mcghie was blushing faintly and lynley didnt think his growing colour had anything to do with lavatories he said to her id thought he shrugged one of those you know movements in which a couples history allows them to communicate in a truncated fashion manette barked a laugh i appreciate the vote of confidence she said but i have a feeling the inspector here likes them a little less long in the tooth dont be stupid youre only fortytwo freddie said to her female years are like dog years freddie when it comes to men im closer to eighty what can i do for you inspector he said your fathers asked me to look into ian cresswells death manettes response was to mcghie i rest my case there was a kitchen table at which she then sat a bowl of fruit was in the centre of it and she took a banana and began to peel it she said well this must put a real pin in poor mignons balloon she used her foot to push one of the other chairs out sit she told lynley she said the same to mcghie lynley thought at first that the gesture indicated her full cooperation but she disabused him of that notion straightaway she said if dad thinks im about to finger anyone for anything id appreciate your telling him that kite wont fly as a matter of fact no kites launching from this house at all honest to god i cant believe hed do this to his own family its more a matter that he wants to be sure of the local police lynley told her that happens actually more often than people think whats that exactly manette enquired someone pops down to london and asks for a second investigation into a matter already settled by the coroner so scotland yard takes up the case just like that please inspector you cant think im that stupid mcghie said to lynley whats prompted this it was a straightforward matter according to the coroner dads throwing his weight manette said to him god only knows how but i reckon he knows someone who knows someone whos willing to pull a few strings or make a donation to the widows and orphans thats how these things happen my guess is he wants to see if nicks involved no matter what the coroner said god knows how nick would have managed things but with his history i daresay anythings possible she looked at lynley im right am i not youre here to see if i can assist in putting the screws on my brother not at all lynley said its only a matter of getting a clear understanding of where everyone fits what the hell is that supposed to mean it means that sometimes a death is placed too conveniently in time a coroner wouldnt be looking at that thered be no reason to if the circumstances are straightforward enough so thats why youre here youre determining the convenience as you say of my cousins drowning and whom did ians death convenience because i must tell you it didnt convenience me what about you freddie were you convenienced mcghie said manette if scotland yards here oh bother she cut in if scotland yards here my father probably handed over some cash a new wing on their offices who the hell knows what else youve been looking at the books freddie youll find it if you look hard enough therell be a payout that you cant understand beyond the others you cant understand lynley said to mcghie are there irregularities with the books then in your fatherinlaws business i was joking manette said and then to mcghie wasnt i freddie in a tone whose meaning was dont say a word what freddie did say was former what former fatherinlaw yes of course current former it doesnt matter manette said what matters is that ian drowned it was an accident and if it wasnt an accident you need to be looking at who was convenienced by his death which wasnt me that being the case it seems to me if im remembering this right the big convenience is the one that fell into kaveh mehrans lap mcghie said to her whats going on there she said to him i havent told you kavehs now sole owner of the farm youre joking hardly ian left it to him or so he claims i expect hes telling the truth as it wouldnt take a big effort to check out the paperwork everythings being looked into mrs mcghie lynley said but you dont think kaveh killed ian do you freddie mcghie asked no one killed him at all manette said his death might have been opportune for someone but it was an accident freddie that entire boathouse ought to be pulled down before it collapses of its own accord im surprised mother wasnt the one to fall smash her head and drown shes in there more often than ian anyway mcghie said nothing but his face altered a subtle change in which his jaw lowered but his lips didnt part something had struck him with his former wifes words something he was perhaps inclined to speak of if the prod was gentle enough lynley said mr mcghie mcghies hand was on the table and his fingers curled till they made a light fist he was watching manette but he was also deciding what it would mean lynley reckoned if he told what he knew there was always tremendous value in silence it acted upon people in much the same way that time alone in a police interview room acted tension was the great equaliser among men most couldnt handle it especially when they themselves could so easily defuse the ticking bomb it comprised lynley waited manettes gaze met her former husbands eyes she read there apparently what she didnt want to know because she said we dont know what anything means freddie to which he replied true enough old girl but we can easily guess cant we and then without ceremony he began to speak she protested but he made his position clear if someone had set up the boathouse to hurt ian cresswell or indeed to hurt manettes own mother then everything currently in the shadows had to come out the way freddie mcghie saw it bernard fairclough had been running through money for a number of years payments to various clinics to turn nicholas around the wealth put into the ireleth hall gardens the purchase of arnside house at a high point in the property market the renovation of that building to make it suitably habitable for nicholas fairclough and his bride the folly built to house mignon her subsequent operations to allow her finally to shed the weight shed been piling on since childhood the followup surgery for the excess skin she then carted round ian might have been writing the cheques but he also wouldve been telling bernard to stop stop stop was how mcghie put it because some of this nonsense had been going on for years there was no sense to it as far as i can see it was as if he couldnt stop himself or he felt he had to for some reason had to lay out money i mean for years lynley clarified well nicks been a problem for a very long time and then there was freddie thats enough manettes voice was sharp freddie said hes got to know it all im sorry darling but if viviennes somehow at the bottom of this shes got to be mentioned vivienne tully lynley said you know about her im learning dyou know where she is manette asked does dad know well he has to hasnt he mcghie said to her reasonably unless ian was paying her every month without your fathers knowledge but why in gods name would he do that the obvious reason because she knew about him what he was hiding from niamh and from everyone else she held his feet to the fire blackmail freddie come on old girl you dont believe that theres only one good reason for payouts to vivienne tully and we both know what it probably is theyd almost forgotten he was in the room lynley realised so intent were they upon believing whatever it was each of them wished to believe about ian cresswell about vivienne tully about the money cresswell had paid out left right and centre either on behalf of bernard fairclough or without his knowledge aside from everyone else taking handouts from bernard faircloughs funds freddie mcghie told lynley that vivienne tully a longago employee as lynley already knew had been receiving monthly sums for years despite not having been employed by fairclough industries during that time period this money wouldnt have anything to do with profit sharing or a pension scheme freddie added so the payout could mean any number of things he concluded a sexual harassment lawsuit bernard was trying to avoid an unlawful dismissal he glanced at his former wife as if for confirmation of this or dad didnt know was what she said youve said yourself ian might have been cooking the books all along to lynley all of the information indicated a death that was no accident what it still did not clarify however was who the intended victim had actually been he thanked manette and her former husband he left them to what he reckoned was going to be a full discussion of the family situation he could tell from manettes reaction to the information mcghie had been giving that she was not going to let these dogs lie he was getting into the healey elliott when his mobile rang havers he thought clarity on its way but he saw by the incoming number that it was isabelle ringing he said to her hullo you this is a pleasant diversion she said im afraid we need to talk thomas even if she hadnt said thomas isabelles tone would have told him this wasnt the woman whose soft curves and warm body his hands knew and enjoyed this was his guv and she wasnt pleased on the other hand she was stonecold sober and he could tell that as well he said of course where are you where you should be im at work as am i isabelle after a fashion but thats not my point he waited for more it was quick in coming why is it barbara havers can be entrusted with information and i cant what dyou expect id have done with the knowledge what could i have done marched into hilliers office crowing i know i know i bloody well know barbaras doing some digging for me isabelle thats all it is you lied to me didnt you about what the entire need for secrecy it can hardly be a hushhush matter if sergeant havers is sledgehammering her way through it barbara knows no more than some names there were matters i couldnt deal with at my end but i knew she could shes doing research oh please im hardly stupid tommy i know how tight you are with barbara shed gladly step into the iron maiden if you asked her you say mums the word on this one barb and shed cut out her tongue this has to do with bob hasnt it lynley was flummoxed bob for a moment he had no idea what she was talking about then she added bob his wife the twins youre punishing me because unlike you i have entanglements and sometimes they get in our way are you talking about that night he asked when i turned up when they were all there isabelle good god that happened and its done with i carry no grudge no you wouldnt would you youre far too well bred for that really isabelle darling youre upset about nothing its everything that i said it was hillier wants this unknown at the met and ive kept it that way its about trust you know and im not just talking about this situation im talking about the other as well you could ruin me tommy one word and im finished gone its done if you dont trust me how can i trust you god in heaven whatve i done to myself what youve done is work yourself into a state over nothing what do you expect id do to you i step out of line i dont cooperate im not quite the woman you think i should be and what i march into hilliers office and say ive been my guvs lover on the sly for the past four months six months two years whatever is that what you think you could destroy me i dont have that equal power over you you dont need the job you dont even bloody want the job were not equals in so many ways and this is the biggest one add to that the fact that theres no trust now and what have we got what do you mean that theres no trust now thats ridiculous its completely absurd and then the question because he suddenly knew was sure of it that hed been wrong at first about her condition have you been drinking silence it was the worst thing to ask he wished he could unsay it but he couldnt and her reply was soft thank you tommy she said she cut off the call she left him looking out at great urswicks pond and a family of swans peacefully afloat upon the placid water lake windermere cumbria after the detective left manette drove directly to ireleth hall she parked on the drive and strode to the folly shed left with freddie telling her that hed had no choice but to speak that if indeed ians death was no accident they had to get to the bottom of the matter anyway hed said it was becoming clear that there were other matters they needed to get to the bottom of also well and good had been manettes reply getting to the bottom of things was exactly what she intended to do mignon was at home when was mignon not at home but she was not alone as she usually was so manette was forced to sit through the last part of her sisters thriceweekly headandfoot massage this was administered by a grave chinese man who drove out from windermere for this purpose which was an hour on the head and an hour on the feet which of course their father would pay for mignon was in a reclining chair eyes closed as her feet were seen to pressure massage whatever the hell else it all was manette didnt know and she hardly cared but she understood her twin well enough to throw herself into a seat and wait because this was the only way she was going to be able to garner her sisters cooperation interrupt her pleasure and there would be hell to pay it all took a tedious half hour occasionally mignon murmured so lovely or yes or a bit more pressure to the left darling the solemn chinese man obliged as instructed manette wondered what hed do if her sister asked him to suck on her toes at the end the masseur gently wrapped mignons feet in a warm towel she moaned and said so soon it seemed like five minutes slowly she opened her eyes and cast a radiant smile upon the man you are a miracle incarnate mr zhao she murmured you know where to send the bill of course of course manette thought mr zhao nodded and packed up his things oils and unguents and whatevers then he was gone as silent as an embarrassing thought mignon stretched in her chair arms raised high over her head toes pointed all of it like a luxuriating cat then she unwrapped her feet got up and strolled to the window where she stretched a bit more she bent to touch her toes and she worked her body to loosen her waist and her hips manette half expected her to start doing jumping jacks anything to rub in the obvious joke that mignon was continuing to play on their parents i dont know how the hell you live with yourself manette said its one eternal circle of excruciating pain mignon told her casting a sly look in her direction if one could project gleeful misery manette decided that would come close to describing her sisters expression you cannot possibly know what i suffer she strolled from the sitting room into the area set up to house her computer careful to take her zimmer along should either of their parents make an unexpected call upon her she tapped a few keys and spent a few moments reading something that was likely an email message she said oh dear this ones becoming something of a bore weve got to the greatimpossibilityofourlovedarling stage and when they get there all the anguish and teeth gnashing put such a bloody damper on things she sighed i did have such hopes for him he seemed good for a years go at least especially once he started with the genitalia photos but what can i say when they fall they do fall so hard she punched a few keys and murmured byebye darling alas alack and all the rest love springs eternal whatever i want to talk to you manette said to her twin i did conclude that manette mere casual calls upon your siblings not being exactly your style at least casual calls upon this sibling that troubles me you know we used to be so close you and i odd manette said i dont recall that part of our history well you wouldnt would you once freddie came into the picture it was all about him and how you intended to snare the poor man he was secondbest of course but he didnt know that unless of course you moaned the wrong name at an inopportune moment did you by the way is that how it ended between you and freddie manette refused to bite she said dads haemorrhaging money i know about the increased payments to you we must talk about that ah the economy mignon said piously always such a fragile thing isnt it lets not play games whats happening to the business and to dad has nothing to do with a sudden and surprising decline in the need for lavatories basins and tubs since the beauty of that business is simple enough theres always a need but you might want to know that freddies been dealing with the books since ians death these payouts to you must stop must they why worried ill run through all the money till theres nothing left for you i think ive made myself clear i know dads increased his payments to you mignon its right there in the books its ridiculous you dont need the money youre entirely taken care of youve got to cut him loose and are you having this same conversation with nick beloved apple of our fathers eye for his entire wasteland of a life oh stop it you werent the son dad wanted and neither was i is that always going to be at the centre of your thoughts your entire existence on earth defined straight into eternity by daddydidntlovemeenough youve been jealous of nick since the day he was born while you havent a jealous bone in your body mignon returned to the sitting room making her way past the boxes and the crates and the endless array of items shed seen and fancied and bought online at least i know what to do with my jealousy as you call it referring to what manette saw the trap too late mignon smiled the successful black widow awaiting her mate to ian of course you always wanted ian everyone knew it everyone tuttutted behind your back for years you took freddie as secondbest and everyone knew that as well poor freddie included that mans a saint or something rubbish which part the saint the something the wanting ian or the freddie knowing it cant be the wantingian part of things manette lord it must have slain you in your trainers when niamh came along i expect you think even now that niamh being the piece of work she is drove ian to try it on with men instead if you think back carefully manette said calmly although she was burning youll come up with a small problem in your scenario which is that i was married to freddie when ian chose niamh now that doesnt quite make things fit does it details mignon said utterly insignificant you didnt want to marry ian anyway you just wanted to well you know some poking and thrusting on the sly dont be absurd whatever you say she yawned are we finished here id like to have a liedown massages take it out of one dont they so if theres nothing else stop this nonsense with dad i swear to you mignon if you dont please dont be ridiculous im taking what im owed everyones doing that i cant think why you arent everyone like vivienne tully for example mignons face became shuttered but only for the instant it took her to come up with a nonchalant reply youll have to ask dad about vivver what do you know about her what i know isnt important its what ian knew darling and its like i said people take what theyre owed at the end of the day ian knew this better than anyone he probably took some of the dosh himself i wouldnt be surprised it would have been childs play he held the purse strings after all how difficult would it have been for him to do some skimming only to have dad find out about it get into that kind of chicanery and youre not going to be able to do it forever someones going to get wise someones going to stop you that sounds like a cautionary tale you ought to heed yourself manette told her sister mignon smiled oh im the exception to every rule there is was her airy reply lake windermere cumbria there was at least some truth in what mignon had said manette had loved ian once romantically but it had been a young adolescents love insubstantial and unsustainable albeit as obvious as the longing looks shed cast in his direction over family dinners and the desperate letters shed written and pressed into his hand at the end of holidays when he left for school ian alas had not shared her passion hed been fond enough of manette but there had finally come that one dreadful and never forgotten moment when hed taken her aside during a halfterm holiday had handed her a shoe box of every one of her letters unopened and had said to her listen burn these manette i know what they are but its just not on hed spoken not unkindly because unkindness had never been his way but firmness had and hed been firm well we all survive these things manette had thought eventually but now she wondered if some women werent constituted in a way to do so she went in search of her father she found him on the west side of ireleth hall far down on the lawn and quite near the lake he was speaking to someone on his mobile phone his head down as if with concentration she considered coming upon him stealthily but before she could do so he concluded his call he turned from the water to move towards the house but when he saw her heading in his direction he remained where he was and waited for her manette tried to assess the look on his face it was strange that hed come out of the hall to make a phone call he could of course have been having a walk and received a call in the midst of it but somehow she doubted this there was a furtiveness to the manner in which he slid the mobile into his pocket whyve you let all this go on she asked her father as she came to his side she was taller than he just as her mother was fairclough said which part of all this are you referring to freddies got ians books hes printed the spreadsheets hes got the programmes you must have known hed be putting things in order after ian hes demonstrating his competency is freddie hed like control of the firm thats not his style dad hed take control of the firm if thats what you asked of him but thats the extent of it freddie doesnt scheme are you certain i know freddie we always think we know our spouses but we never quite know them well enough i hope youre not accusing freddie of anything thats not on bernard smiled thinly as it happens im not hes a very good man as it happens he is your divorce it always puzzled me nick and mignon fairclough fluttered his fingers in the general direction of the folly they had their demons but you didnt seem to i was pleased when you and freddie married shes chosen well i thought to see it end to have it dissolve as it has youve made very few mistakes in your life manette but letting freddie go was one of them these things happen manette said shortly if we allow them was her fathers reply now those were truly infuriating words manette thought all things considered like you allowed vivienne tully to happen she asked bernards gaze didnt leave her face manette knew what was going on in his head it was that rapid assessment of all the potential sources from which had sprung his daughters question it was also a wondering of what exactly manette did know he said vivienne tully is in the past shes been gone a very long time he was casting his line most delicately two could fish in these waters though so manette cast hers the past is never as gone as we would like it to be it has a way of coming back to us rather like viviennes coming back to you im not sure what you mean i mean ians been paying her off for years monthly it seems years and years of monthly youll know that of course he frowned actually i know nothing of the sort manette tried to read him his skin wore a glittering of sweat and she wanted that to mean something significant about who he was and what he might have done she said at last i dont believe you there was always something about you and vivienne tully he said vivienne was part of a past that i allowed to happen whats that supposed to mean that i failed myself in a human moment i see manette said not everything her father countered i wanted vivienne and she agreed to my wanting but neither of us ever intended oh people never do do they manette heard the edge of bitterness in her words its presence surprised her what after all was her father saying that in her heart shed not suspected for years a longago affair with a very young woman what was this to her his daughter it was nothing at all yet everything at once and the hell in the moment was that manette did not know why people dont intend fairclough said they get caught up they start to think rather stupidly that life owes them something beyond what they have and when they go in that direction in their heads the result is you and vivienne tully i have to be honest i dont mean to hurt you but i cant see why vivienne would have wanted to sleep with you she didnt sleep with you oh please no thats not what i mean fairclough looked towards the hall and then away there was a path along lake windermere rising towards a woodland that marked the far north edge of the property he said walk with me ill try to explain i dont want an explanation no but youre troubled im part of what troubles you walk with me manette he took her arm and manette felt the pressure of his fingers through the wool sweater she was wearing she wanted to loosen his grip and walk away from him and make that departure a permanent one but she was as trapped as was her sister by the fact that bernard had wanted a son so badly unlike mignon whod spent her life punishing him for this desire manette had tried to be that for him adopting his ways his postures his habits his manner of speaking and standing and gazing intently at someone with whom he was conversing and even working in his business from the time she was able all to show him she was a worthy son which of course she could never be then the son hed had was unworthy from the start no matter how hed redeemed himself recently and even that had not been enough to turn her fathers eyes upon her so he could see her merit thus she didnt want to walk with the bastard and she didnt want to hear his lies about vivienne tully whatever they were going to be he said children dont like to hear about their parents sexuality its unseemly if this is going to be about mother some rejection of you god no your mother never once no matter its about me i wanted vivienne for no reason other than i wanted vivienne her youth her freshness i dont want you brought her up my dear you must hear it through there was no seduction involved had you thought there was he glanced at her manette saw his look but she kept her eyes fixed ahead on the path the way it followed the shore the way it climbed a rise to the woods that seemed to keep receding no matter how she and her father pressed onward he went on im not a base seducer manette i approached her shed worked for me perhaps two months at that point i was frank as frank as id been with your mother the night i met her marriage between us wasnt possible it wasnt even a thought so i told vivienne i wanted her for my lover a discreet arrangement that no one would know of something that would never stand in the way of her career which i knew was important to her she had a brilliant mind and an excellent future i didnt expect her to waste that mind for a lifetime in barrowinfurness or to give up that future because i wanted to be in her bed for however long she remained in cumbria i dont want to know this manette told her father her throat aching so badly that she found speaking difficult but you brought her up so now youll hear she asked to have time to think about it to consider all the ramifications of what i was proposing for two weeks she thought then she came to me with her own proposal she would try me as a lover she said shed never thought of herself as anyones mistress and shed certainly never thought of herself as a woman attached in some way to a man older than her own father this she said frankly was rather distasteful because she was not the sort of woman who found a mans money an aphrodisiac she liked young men men her own age and she didnt know if she could manage even once putting up with me in her bed she couldnt see me exciting her she said but if i pleased her as a lover which she frankly did not expect shed agree to the arrangement if i didnt please her there would be as she put it no bad feeling between us god she could have taken you to court it could have cost you hundreds of thousands sexual i knew that but its the madness of wanting that i was speaking of earlier it cant be explained if you havent felt it it makes everything seem so reasonable even propositioning ones employee and accepting her proposition in return they walked on their pace slow and the wind beginning to come off the lake manette shivered and her father put his arm round her waist pulling her closer saying theres likely to be rain soon and then he said so for a time we played two different roles vivienne and i at work we were the employer and his executive assistant with never the slightest indication that there was something more between us at other times we were a man and his mistress with those daylight hours of fierce propriety providing the stimulus for what happened at night then at last shed had enough her career called out to her and i wasnt so much a fool as to stop her i had to let her go and as id promised to do so from the first there was nothing for it but to wish her well where is she now ive no idea the job she was offered was in london but that was some time ago id think she would have gone on from there what about mother how could you your mother never knew manette but mignon knows doesnt she fairclough looked away a moment passed during which a v of ducks flew overhead swooped down towards the lake rose above them again he finally said she does i dont know how she found out but how does mignon find out anything so thats why shes been able to yes but what about ian these payments he was making to vivienne fairclough shook his head then looked back at her he said as god is my witness i dont know manette if ian was paying vivienne it can only be that he was doing it to protect me from something she had to have contacted him threatened something i just dont know perhaps she threatened to tell mother like mignon and thats what shes doing isnt it mignons threatening to tell mother if you dont continue to give her what she wants what would mother do if she knew fairclough turned to her then and it came to manette that for the first time her father looked old indeed he looked fragile capable of breaking within someones hands your mother would be completely devastated my dear he said after all these years id like to spare her that bryanbarrow cumbria tim could see gracie from the window she was on her trampoline shed been out there for a good hour now jumping and jumping with her face a picture of concentration sometimes she fell on her bum and rolled round on the matting but she always got back up and resumed her jumping earlier tim had seen her out in the garden at the back of the house she was digging and he noted next to her on the ground a small cardboard box tied up with a red ribbon when the hole she was digging got deep enough and wide enough she put the box inside and buried it she used a pail for the excess earth which she spread around neatly throughout the garden although at this time of year the garden was such a wreck that this nicety was entirely unnecessary before she did that spreading though she knelt and crossed her arms over her chest right fist to left shoulder left fist to right shoulder her head tilted to one side it came to tim that she looked a bit like one of those angels one saw in old victorian cemeteries which clued him in to what she was doing she was burying bella giving the doll a proper funeral bella could have been repaired tim had done a fairly good job of destroying her but her arms and legs might have been reattached and where shed been scratched up from his attack upon her the scratches might have been smoothed away but gracie would have none of that just as she would have none of tim once hed returned from the soaking hed given himself in bryan beck when hed changed his clothes he went to gracie and hed offered to brush her hair and frenchbraid it but she didnt want him near her dont touch me and dont touch bella timmy was how she put it she didnt sound sad merely resigned after the dolls funeral she went to the trampoline there shed been ever since tim wanted to stop her but he didnt know how he thought about ringing their mother but he dismissed that notion as soon as it came into his head he knew what shed say shell stop jumping when she gets tired im not going to drive all the way to bryanbarrow to pull your sister off that trampoline if youre so bothered by it ask kaveh to get her off he should enjoy the opportunity to be paternal shed say that last bit with a snarl in her voice then off shed go to that wanker wilcox to get herself seen to by a proper man and that was how shed think of it charlie wilcox wanted to do her so he was the real goods while anyone not wanting to do her like tims father for example was shite on oatmeal well that was the truth anyway wasnt it tim asked himself his dad was shite and so was kaveh and tim was learning that everyone else was shite as well hed come back to the house after going after the ducks in the beck kaveh had followed and tried to talk to him but tim wasnt having anything off that bloke bad enough that the wanker had put his greasy mitts on tim to have to talk to him on top of that it just wasnt on tim thought though that kaveh might be able to get gracie off the trampoline he might also get gracie to let tim dig up the doll and take her off to windermere to be repaired gracie liked kaveh because that was gracie she liked everyone so shed listen to him wouldnt she besides kaveh hadnt done anything to hurt her aside from wrecking her entire family of course tim himself would have to talk to kaveh though hed have to go downstairs and find him and tell him that gracie was outside jumping but if he did that kaveh would probably just point out that there was nothing wrong with jumping on a trampoline thats what trampolines were for werent they and wasnt that why theyd got one for gracie in the first place because she liked to jump then tim would have to explain that when she jumped for an hour as shed done so far it was because she was hurting inside then kaveh would say the obvious thing well we both know why shes hurting tim dont we tim hadnt intended that was the problem he hadnt intended to make gracie cry gracie was the only person who actually mattered to him and the truth was shed just been there in his way he hadnt thought of what came after the moment when he snatched bella up and pulled her arms and legs off hed only wanted to do something to make the boiling inside of him go away but how could gracie understand that when she had no boiling inside of her she could only see the meanness within him that had snatched up bella and dismembered her gracie stopped for a moment outside tim saw that she was breathing hard he also noticed something new about gracie which brought him up short she was growing breasts and he could see the buds of them poking at the jersey that she was wearing this brought a searing sadness upon him it clouded his vision and when the cloud passed gracie had gone back to jumping again and this time he watched her little breasts as she jumped something he knew had to be done about her how useless would it be to pick up the phone and ring their mother he asked himself a second time gracie growing breasts meant gracie needing her mum to do something like take her to town and purchase her a baby brassiere or whatever it was that little girls wore when they started growing breasts this went beyond just getting gracie off the bloody trampoline didnt it yes it did but wasnt the truth that niamh would see this the same way she saw everything tell kaveh about it she would say kaveh can handle this little problem that was everything tied up with a bow whatever gracie was going to face in her growingup years she was going to have to face without a mum to help her because the one thing in life that was an absolute certainty was that niamh cresswell had plans for herself that didnt include the children shed had with her louse of a husband thus tim knew it was down to him or it was down to kaveh to help gracie as she grew up or it was down to them both tim left his room kaveh was somewhere in the house and tim supposed now was as good a time as any to tell him that they needed to take gracie into windermere to get whatever she needed if they didnt do it the boys in her school would start to tease her ultimately the girls would tease her as well teasing her would turn into bullying her soon enough and tim wasnt about to have his sister bullied he heard kavehs voice as he descended the stairs it seemed to be coming from the fire house the door to the room was partially closed but a shaft of light fell on the floor from inside and he heard the sound of a poker stirring coals in the grate not actually in my plans kaveh was saying politely to someone but you cant be thinking of staying on now cresswells dead tim recognised george cowleys voice he also recognised the subject staying on meant they were talking about bryan beck farm george cowley would be seeing the death of tims father as his chance to sweep in and buy the place obviously kaveh wasnt having that i am kaveh said thinking of raising sheep are you cowley sounded amused by the entire idea he probably pictured kaveh mincing round the farmyard in pink wellies and a lavender waxed jacket or something like id actually hoped youd continue renting the land as youve been doing kaveh said its worked out so far i dont see why it cant continue to do so besides the lands quite valuable if it ever came to a sale of it and you reckon id never have the funds to make it mine cowley concluded well dyou have the funds to buy it up yourself laddie i reckon not this whole placell go on the block in a few months time and ill be there with the money im afraid it wont be going on the block at all kaveh said whys that then youre not claiming he left it to you as it happens he did george cowley was silent digesting this unexpected bit of news he finally said youre taking the piss as it happens im not no so where dyou plan to come up with the death duties eh thatll take a real pile of dosh death duties arent actually going to be a problem mr cowley kaveh said there was another silence tim wondered what george cowley was making of all this for the first time he also wondered how kaveh mehran fit into the picture of his fathers death it had been an accident plain and simple hadnt it everyone had said so including the coroner but now it didnt seem so simple at all and the next thing that came out of kavehs mouth made the matter complicated beyond tims imagining my family will be joining me here as well you see our combined resources will see to it that death duties family cowley scoffed whats the meaning of family in the light of day to your sort eh kaveh didnt reply for a moment when he spoke then his tone was deathly formal family means my parents for one theyll be coming up from manchester to live with me along with my wife the walls seemed to shimmer around tim the earth itself seemed to tilt everything hed thought hed known was suddenly thrown into a vortex where words meant something far beyond what theyd meant for all of his fourteen years and what he thought hed actually understood was obliterated by the uttering of one declaration your wife cowley said it flatly my wife yes the sound of movement kaveh crossing to the window perhaps or to the desk at one side of the room or even standing at the hearth of the fireplace one arm on the mantel looking like someone who knew he was holding all the good cards in the deck ill be marrying next month oh too right cowley snorted she know about your little situation here this nextmonth wife of yours situation what on earth do you mean you little pixie you know xactly what i mean you two arse bandits you an cresswell whas this eh think the whole village didnt know the truth if you mean that the village knew ian cresswell and i shared this house of course they knew beyond that what else is there why you little bum fucker you trying to say im trying to say that ill be marrying my wife will live here along with my parents and then our children if theres something not clear to you in that i dont know what else to tell you what about them kids you think onef them wont tell this nextmonth wife of yours whats up with you are you talking about tim and gracie mr cowley you goddamn bloody well know i am aside from the fact that my fiancee doesnt speak english and wouldnt understand a word they said to her theres nothing for them to tell anyone and tim and gracie are going back to their mother thats already in the works thats that then im afraid it is youre a real deep one then arent you lad had this planned from the first i expect what kaveh said in answer tim did not catch hed heard all that he needed to hear he stumbled from the passageway into the kitchen and from there out of the house lake windermere cumbria st james had decided there was a final possibility in this matter of ian cresswells drowning it was a tenuous one at best but as it existed he knew he had to set out to see about it he required a single sporting implement to do so there was no angling shop in either milnthorpe or arnside so he drove the distance to grangeoversands and made his purchase in a concern called lancasters lancasters sold everything from baby clothes to gardening tools and it was strung along the sloping high street as a series of shops that had obviously been snapped up by the eponymous and enterprising lancaster family over the last hundred years in a remarkable and successful project of expansion one shop now tumbling into the next the governing philosophy behind them all seemed to be that what wasnt sold within the place didnt need to be bought this being a part of the world given to fishing what they did have was a fillet knife exactly like the one that lynley had brought up from the water inside the ireleth hall boathouse st james made his purchase of this rang lynley on his mobile and told him he was heading to ireleth hall he also phoned deborah but she wasnt answering he wasnt surprised as she would have seen he was the caller and she wasnt happy with him at the moment nor particularly was he happy with her he loved his wife deeply but there were moments when the fact that they couldnt see eyetoeye on something made him despair of their entire marriage this despair was always a fleeting thing a feeling that he generally reflected upon later and chuckled over when both his temper and deborahs had cooled why were we so caught up in that he would wonder matters so crucial one day were mere bagatelles the next this one didnt seem so insignificant however he took the most direct route to lake windermere although at another time he would have quite enjoyed taking a diversion and cruising up through the lyth valley instead he sped along the northeastern route and ended up at the very tip of lake windermere where the mass of end moraines at newby bridge spoke of glaciers an ice age and a time long ago when the village had stood at the southernmost point of the lake itself which now lay some distance away then he sped north within moments lake windermere came into view a broad unwrinkled sheet of greyblue reflecting the autumnhued trees that formed woodlands along its shores ireleth hall was not far from this point a few miles beyond the area where the victorian beauties of fell foot park offered walks and vistas that at this time of year were growing cold and forbidding but in spring would be a palette of nodding daffodils and colourful rhododendrons that grew to the height of buildings he passed by this place and entered one of dozens of arboreal tunnels along the road auburn and ochre where still there were leaves on the trees skeletal branches where there were now none the gates were closed at ireleth hall but there was a bell buried within the ivy that climbed the stone plinth forming part of its boundary wall st james clambered out of his hired car and rang it as he did so lynley pulled up behind him in the healey elliott this made entry easy a moment of disembodied conversation with someone who answered the bell lynley saying over st jamess shoulder its thomas lynley and that was that they were inside the gates creaking open like something from an old horror film then creaking closed behind them they went directly to the boathouse this was st james told his friend the only other possibility in what went for his part of the investigation while no one would ever be able to proclaim that all the circumstances surrounding ian cresswells death had been completely straightforward if there was anything to persuade the coroner to reopen the matter this was how they would find it and even this guaranteed nothing he said for his part lynley declared hed be more than happy to close matters up here and return to london as soon as possible st james shot him a querying look at this remark lynley said the guvs not happy with me hillier hoping for something different from what youre coming up with no isabelle shes not happy hilliers roped me into this situation ah not good decidedly not good they said nothing more on the matter but st james wondered about lynleys relationship with isabelle ardery together theyd come to see him on matters concerning an earlier case theyd worked on and st james was not so oblivious of the world around him that he could not see the spark that existed between them but involvement with a superior officer was a dangerous proposition indeed lynleys involvement with anyone at the met was a dangerous proposition as they walked to the boathouse lynley told st james of his meeting with bernard faircloughs daughter manette and her husband explaining what they had revealed about the money that ian cresswell had been paying out either bernard fairclough had been a party to all of this or he had not lynley said but whatever the case cresswell seemed to have known things that could have spelled danger for him had fairclough not known about these payouts or at least some of these payouts then in fairclough lay the danger once hed discovered them had ian tried to put a stop to some of the payments he was making then in the recipients of those payments lay the danger it all seems to come down to money in the end lynley said thats the case more often than not isnt it st james noted inside the boathouse there was no need for additional light what st james intended did not require it and the ambient light reflecting off the lake from the bright day outside was sufficient st james was there to examine the condition of the rest of the stones comprising the dock if more of them were loose than just the two that had become dislodged then he was of the opinion that what had happened to ian had been mere chance the scull was there but the rowingboat was not valerie it seemed was out on the water st james went to the area where her boat had been tied sensible he thought to check here first he used his hands and his feet working his way along he knelt awkwardly saying i can manage to lynley when the other man made a move to help him things seemed quite solid until he got to the fifth large stone along his way which felt as loose as a sevenyearolds baby incisor the sixth and seventh wobbled as well then the next four were fine while the twelfth was barely hanging on it was on this twelfth one that st james applied the fillet knife hed bought in grangeoversands using this on what remained of the grout in order to get the stone into a position from which it would easily tumble into the water upon the slightest touch was simple the blade slid in st james did a bit of jemmying with it and the job was done one foot placed on it here lynley did the honours and into the water it went it was not difficult to see how someone getting out of a scull and placing all his weight upon a stone similarly jemmied would have produced what had happened to ian cresswell the real question was whether the other loose stones weighted by lynley but unassisted by st jamess fillet knife would fall into the water as well one of them did three of them didnt lynley sighed shook his head and said at this point im quite open to suggestions i wont argue if going home to london is one of them we need direct light for what at this point nothing in here come with me they left the boathouse st james brought the fillet knife up between them they both had a look at it and the conclusion required no microscopic examination in a forensic lab from its use on the grout it was deeply scratched and scored but the one that lynley had earlier brought up from the water had been completely unmarked lynley said ah i do see this clarifies matters i think tommy its time deborah and i went back to london im not saying at this point that those stones couldnt have been loosened in another way but the fact that the knife you brought up from the water was unmarked suggests the drowning was indeed an accident or something else was used to dislodge one of those stones and unless you intend to cart everything from the property off to forensics for some kind of matchup with the stones that went into the water ill need another route lynley finished for him or i can close this up and head back myself unless barbara havers gives you something i daresay thats the case its not a bad result though is it its just a result it is they stood silently looking out at the lake a rowingboat was approaching them with a woman skillfully at the oars valerie fairclough was dressed for fishing but shed evidently had no luck when she neared them she showed her empty bucket and called out cheerfully its good were not starving round here ive become rather hopeless in the last few days there are more loose stones on the dock inside lynley called back weve made several a bit worse have a care well help you they went back inside she glided in silently and docked the rowingboat in the exact spot where the stones were loose lynley said youve managed to choose the very worst spot was this where you set out it was valerie said i hadnt noticed are they bad over time theyll give way like the others like the others her face relaxed she didnt smile but her relief was palpable st james took note of this and he knew lynley did likewise as valerie fairclough handed her fishing gear over to him lynley set this to one side then extended his hand and helped valerie fairclough from the boat he made the introductions between the woman and st james st james said you found ian cresswells body as i understand i did yes valerie removed the hat shed been wearing a baseball cap that covered her fine grey hair this was youthfully styled and she ran her fingers through it you phoned for the police as well st james said thats correct im rather wondering about that st james said are you heading to the house may we walk with you valerie glanced at lynley she didnt look wary she had far too much control for that but shed be wondering why lynleys friend the expert witness from london wanted to have a chat and shed know quite well the topic wasnt going to be her momentary lack of success as an angler she said graciously of course you may but that quick movement at the corners of her blue eyes told a different story about how she actually felt they set off up the path st james said to her had you been fishing that day when i found him no what took you out to the boathouse i was having a walk i do that in the afternoons generally once the weather gets bad with the winter im rather more confined than i like to be as we all are so i try to get out as much as i can while the days are still fine around the property into the woods on the fells ive lived here all my life mr st james i walk wherever my fancy takes me on that day valerie fairclough glanced at lynley she said to him would you like to clarify which was naturally a wellbred way of asking why she was being grilled by his friend st james said this is my interest rather than tommys ive spoken to constable schlicht about the day ian cresswell was found he told me two curious things about the phone call to nineninenine and ive been trying to understand them ever since well actually only one of the things he told me was about the phone call the other was about you now the wariness was plain to see valerie fairclough stopped on the path she ran her hands down the sides of her trousers a movement that st james could tell was meant to settle her nerves he knew lynley was aware of this from the look lynley cast him which was one that told him to go on in order to get what he could from her and what did the constable tell you valerie said hed had a conversation with the bloke at dispatch this would be the person who took the nineninenine call about ian cresswells drowning he learned that whoever made that call was remarkably calm considering the circumstances i see valerie spoke pleasantly enough but the fact that shed stopped moving along the path suggested there were elements of ian cresswells death that she didnt want st james and lynley to uncover one of them st james knew was now out of their sight line the folly built for their daughter mignon was no longer in view there appears to be a dead man floating in my boathouse is roughly what was said st james told valerie she glanced away a ripple on the surface of her face was not unlike a ripple on the surface of the lake behind them something swimming beneath the water or a gust of wind across it but in either case the moment comprised an instant in which her placidity failed her she raised a hand to her forehead and brushed an errant hair away shed not put her baseball cap back on her head the sunlight struck her face showing the fine lines of an ageing that she seemed intent upon keeping at bay she said no one knows exactly how theyll react in that kind of situation i entirely agree but the second odd thing about that day was how you were dressed when you met the police and the ambulance on the drive you werent dressed for walking certainly not for an autumn walk and certainly not for anything other than a walk through the rooms of your house i expect realising the direction st james had been heading lynley said so you see there are several possibilities that want exploring he gave her a moment to think about this before going on with you werent at the boathouse at all were you you werent the one to find the body and you werent the one to call nineninenine i believe i gave my name when i phoned valerie spoke stiffly but she wasnt stupid she would know that at least this part of the game was over anyone can give any name st james said perhaps its time you told the truth lynley added its about your daughter isnt it i daresay mignon found the body and mignon placed the call from the folly she can see the boathouse if she goes upstairs to the top floor of the tower i should guess she can see everything from the door of the building to the boats leaving it to go out on the lake the real question then is whether she had a reason to arrange ian cresswells death as well because she would have known he was out there on the lake that evening wouldnt she valerie raised her eyes to the sky st james was reminded unaccountably of a suffering madonna and what motherhood brought and did not bring to a woman brave enough to engage in everything that it comprised it never ended with the childs entry into adulthood it went on till death either the mothers or the childs valerie said none of them she faltered she looked at both of them st james and lynley before she spoke again my children are innocent in all matters st james said we found a filleting knife in the water he showed her the knife hed used on the stones not this one of course but one very similar that would be the one i lost a few weeks ago she said an accident actually i was cleaning a goodsize trout but i dropped the knife and it slid into the water indeed lynley said indeed she replied clumsy of me but there you have it lynley and st james glanced at each other what they had actually was a lie since the workbench for cleaning fish was on the other side of the boathouse from the spot where the filleting knife had fallen into the water unless st james was very much mistaken about the nature of the tool the knife would have had to swim in order to end up lying beneath ian cresswells scull kensington london in person vivienne tully looked exactly like the photographs barbara had seen of her on the internet they were of an age she and vivienne but they couldnt have been more dissimilar vivienne barbara reckoned was exactly what acting detective superintendent ardery would have her become svelte of body sveltely clothed with all the suitable accessories and ultrasveltely put together when it came to hair and makeup indeed if there were degrees of svelte and barbara reckoned there were then vivienne tully had somehow managed to claw her way to the top level on principle alone barbara hated her on sight shed made the decision to turn up at rutland gate as who she was and not as who she had earlier pretended to be someone in search of a piece of pricey kensington property she rang the bell for flat and without asking whod come calling upon her vivienne tully or whoever was inside her flat had released the doors lock at that barbara reckoned she was expecting someone very few people were foolish enough to allow callers into their buildings without giving them a proper grilling people ended up burgled that way people also ended up dead it turned out that the expected visitor was an estate agent barbara learned this within three seconds of vivienne tullys giving her a onceover head to toe and a look of thiscantpossiblybe and vivienne was saying youre from foxtons barbara might have taken offence at this but she wasnt there for a beauty contest she also wasnt there to seize the moment and run with it since there was no way on earth that vivienne tully was going to believe an estate agent hot to sell her property would show up at her door wearing hightop red trainers orange corduroys and a navy donkey jacket so she said ds havers new scotland yard i need a word vivienne didnt exactly fall back in shock which barbara found worthy of note she said come in i dont have a great deal of time im afraid ive an appointment with foxtons got it selling up are you barbara looked round as vivienne closed the door behind them it was a gorgeous flat by anyones standards high ceilings elaborate crown mouldings hardwood floors covered by persian carpets a few tasteful antiques a marble fireplace surround it would have cost buckets in the first place and it would take barrels to purchase it now the odd thing was however that there was nothing of a personal nature anywhere one could call a few pieces of carefully chosen german porcelain personal barbara supposed but the collection of antique books on a bookshelf didnt exactly look like something one browsed through on rainy days im moving to new zealand vivienne said time to go home born there barbara asked although she already knew the answer the other woman had no evident accent shed be able to lie if she wished she didnt in wellington she said my parents are there theyre getting older and theyd like me back in the area been in the uk a while then may i ask what this call is about sergeant havers how may i help you by telling me about your relationship with bernard fairclough thatd be a start viviennes expression remained preternaturally pleasant i dont think thats any of your business exactly what is this about the death of ian cresswell its being investigated i expect you knew him since you worked for fairclough industries for a time and so did he then wouldnt the logical question be what my relationship with ian cresswell was i reckoned wed get to that next right now its the fairclough angle of things that interests me barbara looked round the room with an appreciative nod she said very nice digs mind if i park myself somewhere she didnt wait for an answer instead she went to an armchair dumped her shoulder bag next to it and sank down into its comfortable depths she ran a hand along the fine upholstery bloody hell is this silk she wondered obviously vivienne tully didnt do her shopping at ikea vivienne said i think i told you im expecting someone from foxtons got it im good that way memory like the proverbial elephant if you know what i mean or is it the metaphorical elephant i never know which well never mind youd probably like things better if i scarpered before foxtons shows up eh vivienne wasnt a fool she knew it was going to be information in exchange for barbaras departure she went to a small sofa and sat she said i worked for a time for fairclough industries as youve noted i was bernard faircloughs executive assistant it was my first job straight after the london school of economics after several years i went on to other employment your type generally move round in the employment game barbara acknowledged i get that but in your case it was fairclough industries a spate of private consulting and then this current gig you have with the gardening concern and there youve stayed what of it i wanted more job security than private consultancy offers and once i went to precision gardening i had it i climbed the ladder there the right person in the right place during a period of time when it was important to demonstrate equity in employment between men and women i hardly started as managing director sergeant but you didnt cut your ties with fairclough i dont burn bridges i find it wise to maintain contacts bernard asked me to serve on the board of the fairclough foundation i was happy to do so howd that come about what do you mean are you looking for something sinister he asked me and i said yes i believe in the cause and he asked you because i assume he thought my work for him in barrow was competent and reflective of a willingness to be useful in other ways as well when i left fairclough industries why why did i leave seems to me you couldve climbed the career ladder there as well as anywhere else have you spent much time in barrow sergeant havers no well it didnt appeal i had the opportunity to come to london and i took it thats what people do i had the kind of offer of employment that might have taken years to get in barrow even if id wanted to stay there which believe me i did not and here you are then in lord faircloughs flat vivienne altered her position slightly her posture which had seemed perfect in the first place managing to become even more so whatever youre thinking youre misinformed fairclough doesnt own this flat whys he got his own key then i reckoned he was showing up to check you werent rubbishing the place doing the landlord bit if you know what i mean what does any of this have to do with ian cresswell the ostensible reason for your call not sure yet barbara said cheerfully want to explain the situation with the keys especially since fairclough doesnt as id thought own this place whichs quite nice by the way mustve cost you a pile of dosh youd want to keep it all safe and secure id think so im wondering if you hand out keys willynilly or if you only give them to special sorts of people im afraid thats none of your business wheres our bernard stay when he comes to london miss tully or i spose i should say ms eh i checked at twins but they dont have overnighters there it seems also they dont allow women past the threshold aside from the old bag on door duty believe me i found that out straightaway unless theyre in the company of a member turns out youre in and out all the time on faircloughs arm the way i heard it lunch dinner drinks whatever and off the two of you go by taxi and the taxi always brings you here sometimes you unlock the front door sometimes he does with his own key then up you come to this well let me say its a bloody gorgeous place and after that where does fairclough stow his ageing body when hes in london thats the real question vivienne rose she would need to barbara reckoned it was close to the point where the other woman would do the ceremonious tossing of her rotund body out of the front door meantime barbara meant to push things as far as she could she saw that viviennes entire composure was heading in a southerly direction and this gratified her enormously there was after all a certain selfish thrill in discommoding someone so ostensibly perfect no it isnt the real question vivienne tully said the real question is how long it will take you to walk to the door where i shall open it for you and then close it upon your timely departure our discussion is over thing is barbara said i do have to walk there dont i to the door that is or you can be dragged of course kicking screaming and howling for the neighbours to hear raising a ruckus the likes of which gets you noticed rather more than youd probably like to be noticed i want you out of here sergeant theres not a single thing illegal in any part of my life i dont see what my having lunch dinner drinks or anything else with bernard fairclough has to do with ian cresswell unless bernard handed the receipts to ian and ian didnt want to pay the bills but hed hardly lose his life over that would he would thatve been like ian tight with the barons money was he i dont know i had no contact with ian once i left the firm which was years ago is that all you want to know because as i told you i have an appointment theres still the matter of the keys to be cleared up vivienne smiled mirthlessly let me wish you luck in that matter she walked to the front door of the flat then and she opened it she said if you dont mind and really there was nothing for it but for barbara to cooperate shed got what she could from vivienne and the fact that vivienne had been unsurprised to have scotland yard come calling in the first place not to mention the fact that shed managed the nearly impossible feat of not putting a foot wrong during their entire conversation told barbara that this was a case in which forewarned had led effortlessly to forearmed there was nothing for it but to try another route nothing after all was impossible she took the stairs down rather than the lift they deposited her opposite the table on which the postal cubbies stood the porter was there hed gathered up the post from where it had been dropped into the mail slot at the front of the building and he was in the process of distributing it he heard her and turned back again are you he said in greeting still hoping for a flat barbara joined him at the table the better to have a look at what he was putting into the cubbies a signed declaration of shes guilty of something would have gone down a treat shoved into vivienne tullys cubby or better yet handed over to barbara to be sent along to lynley but everything seemed to be straightforward enough from what she could see from the return addresses of bt thames water television licensing and the like she said got an in at foxtons as things turn out in the world of property sales flat six will be going on offer soon i thought id have a quick look miss tullys flat the porter said i heard naught about that odd as people genrally tell me since therell be some coming and going once it hits the market could be its a sudden thing barbara said spose never thought shed sell though not with the situation shes got tisnt easy to find nice digs where a good schools just round the corner eh barbara felt a frisson of excitement shoot through her school she said carefully exactly what school are we talking about november windermere cumbria zed benjamin found that he was quite looking forward to his morning chat with yaffa shaw and he wondered if this was what true partnership was like between a man and a woman if so he also wondered why for years hed been avoiding it like a romany beggar on the steps of a church when he rang her she gave the verbal sign that his mother was within listening distance she said zed my little puppy let me tell you all the ways ive been missing you and she constructed a quick paean to his intelligence his wit his affability and added the warmth of his hugs for good measure zed reckoned his mother would be over the moon at that hmm im missing you as well he said in reply without thinking about the ramifications of such a disclosure he didnt after all have to respond other than with amused thanks for yaffas continuing to bamboozle his mother during their daily conversations if i were there id show you warmth the likes of which youve never seen from far more than hugs i hope yaffa said that zed told her you may rely on she laughed youre a very naughty boy and then to his mother mama benjamin our zeds being rather naughty again mama benjamin she insisted yaffa said and before he could comment she went on so tell me what youve uncovered my dear youve moved your story forward a leap havent you i can hear it in your voice the reality zed admitted to himself was that this was the real reason for his call he wanted to crow to the woman who was pretending to be the love of his life as any man putatively caught within the snares of adoration would wish he said ive found the cop have you indeed thats marvellous zed i knew that you would and will you phone your editor with this news will you she made her voice appropriately anxious will you come home cant yet i dont want to phone rod either i want to have this story signed and sealed so i can hand it over and tell him its ready to be run word for word with every detail chased down ive spoken to the detective and ive struck a deal were going at it as a team my god yaffa produced breathless admiration thats brilliant zed shes going to be helping without knowing shes helping well track down one story as far as shes concerned but ill end up with two and one of them is her the detectives a woman then detective sergeant cotter shes called first name deb got her nailed down shes part of the story but shes not all of it turns out shes looking into the wife alatea fairclough shes not onto nick fairclough at all well she was at first but turns out theres something particularly iffy about the wife have to say i reckoned that from the first it never made sense that someone like nick fairclough could have ended up with an alatea oh yaffa sounded interested why is this zed hes an okay sort of bloke but she his wifes dropdead gorgeous yaf ive never in my life seen anyone like her there was silence from yaffas end then a little goodness comprised her entire response and zed wanted to slap himself sharply what a bloody gaffe he thought he said shes not my type at all of course cool and distant the sort of woman keeps a man running to do her bidding if you know what i mean sort of a black widow and youre in the web you know what black widows do eh yaffa they attract males to mate with as i recall she said well right of course but point is theyre deadly its the old mateanddie or rather its the old mateandbemurdered gives me the absolute willies yaffa shes beautiful but theres something strange going on with her one can tell yaffa seemed to take comfort from this although zed wondered what it meant that she needed comfort what with the loathed micah in tel aviv studying to be a physician a nuclear physicist a neurosurgeon and a financial wizard all rolled into one she said you must be careful then zed this could be dangerous not a worry there he told her plus ive got the scotland yard detective with me for added protection another woman did yaffa sound sad a redhead like me but i like my women dark like this alatea no he said not one bit like this alatea anyway darling this detectives got information by the bucketful shes giving it to me in exchange for my sitting on the story for a few more days but what will you tell your editor zed how long can you hold off giving him something no problem there ill have rodney where i want him once i tell him about the deal ive struck with the met hell love that its right up his alley you be careful then will do always yaffa rang off then zed was left literally holding the phone he shrugged and shoved the mobile into his pocket it was only when he was on his way down to breakfast that he realised yaf hadnt made her usual kissy noises at him it was only when hed tucked into his plate of watery scrambled eggs that he also realised he wished shed done so milnthorpe cumbria theyd passed a wretched night together deborah knew that simon wasnt happy with her theyd had a desultory dinner in the crow and eagles restaurant an establishment that wasnt exactly within breathing distance of being awarded a michelin rosette hed said very little at the meal about the matter of open adoption which deborah knew was the source of his displeasure just a quiet id have preferred it had you not phoned david quite so soon and that was it what he meant of course was that hed have preferred it had she waited until he could talk her into something that she did not want in the first place deborah had not replied to this at first instead shed made conversation with him on other matters and waited until theyd returned to their room there shed said im sorry youre unhappy about this adoption situation simon but you did tell me the girl wanted to know at which hed observed her with his greyblue eyes so assessing in that way he had hed said thats not really the point though is it it was the sort of remark that could make her miserable or fire her anger depending upon which part of her history with simon she went to in order to receive it she could hear it as the wife of a beloved husband whom shed inadvertently hurt or she could hear it as the child whod grown to adulthood in his house and under his gaze recognising the disappointedfather tone in his voice she knew the former but at the moment she felt the latter and sometimes it was such a pleasure just to let ones feelings fly so shed said you know i really hate it when you talk to me like that hed looked surprised which added fuel hed said talk to you like what you know like what you are not my father believe me im aware of that deborah and that had set her off that he wouldnt allow himself to be roused to anger that anger simply wasnt part of who he was it maddened her and it had always done so she couldnt imagine a time when it would not things had developed from there in the way of all arguments from the manner in which shed put an end to this matter with david and the girl in southampton theyd found themselves examining the myriad ways in which she had apparently long required his benevolent intervention in her life that took them ultimately into the manner in which hed dismissed her in the car park during their conversation with tommy this was a primary example of why he was required to watch over her hed pointed out since she could not see when she was pigheadedly putting herself into harms way of course simon hadnt used the word pigheadedly that was not his style instead hed said there are times when you dont see things clearly and you wont see things clearly you have to admit that in reference to her insistence in the car park that the route to investigate had everything to do with alatea faircloughs possession of a magazine called conception youve reached a conclusion based on your own inclinations he said youre letting your judgement become clouded because of what you want instead of relying upon what you know you cant do that and be effective in an investigation and none of that has any importance anyway because you shouldnt be involved in this matter at all tommy asked me if this is going to come down to tommy he also pointed out that youve served your purpose and theres danger likely if you go any further danger from whom danger from what there is no danger oh this is absurd i agree completely he replied so were finished here deborah we need to return to london ill see to it this positively made her erupt as hed known it would hed left the room to do whatever he felt needed to be done regarding their departure and when hed returned her anger was so icy that she saw no point in speaking to him at all in the morning then hed packed up his things she pointedly did not pack up hers instead shed informed him that unless he wished to carry her over his shoulder all the way to her hire car she was remaining in cumbria she said this isnt finished simon and when he said isnt it she knew he was referring to more than matters associated with the drowning of ian cresswell she said i want to see this through cant you at least try to see this is something i need to do i know therere things connected to this woman it was definitely the wrong route to take any mention of alatea fairclough would only make simon think more determinedly that deborah was blinded by her own desires he said quietly ill see you in london then whenever you return he gave her a half smile that felt like an arrow to her heart he added good hunting and that was that all along deborah knew that she could have told him about her plans with the reporter from the source but had she done that the fact that she and zed benjamin were going to join forces in the investigation would have come out into the open then simon would have done something to stop this from happening and telling tommy would have accomplished it in keeping the truth from simon she was actually protecting tommy from exposure as the scotland yard detective she was effectively giving him more time to get to the bottom of things if simon couldnt see that she now had a vital place in this investigation there was simply nothing she could do about that even as she and her husband had their final words at the milnthorpe inn zed benjamin was down the road in arnside maintaining a position from which he could see the comings and goings at arnside house he would text her should alatea fairclough leave the property move meant she was on the move heading somewhere in her car your way meant she was heading towards milnthorpe this was the beauty of arnside deborah and zed benjamin had concluded on the previous day although there were narrow lanes leading out of the village that one could take to reach the other side of arnside knot and the hamlets beyond arnside knot if one wanted a quick route out of the place there was but a single good road upon which to travel that road was the road to milnthorpe that road passed by the crow and eagle when the text message came simon had been gone thirty minutes deborah examined her mobile with a surge of excitement move and your way comprised the message shed already gathered her necessary belongings in less than one minute deborah was down the stairs and waiting just inside the entrance to the inn with a view to the street through the glass half of the door she saw alatea fairclough drive by and make a right turn into the a three cars behind her came zed benjamin deborah was ready for him when he pulled to the kerb south she said im on it he replied nick took off as well looking down in the mouth heading for the family business i dare say doing his part to keep the country wellsupplied with loos what do you think should one of us have been following him he shook his head no i think youre right this little lady is at the crux of it all lancaster lancashire the man was huge deborah thought he filled more than his side of the car he wasnt fat merely enormous his seat was pushed back as far as it would go but still he had difficulty keeping his knees out of the way of the steering wheel despite his size he wasnt an intimidating presence however there was an odd kind of gentleness to him which she reckoned had to make him a fish out of water when it came to his chosen employment she was about to comment on this when he made a remark about what he supposed to be her line of work instead with his eyes on alateas car far ahead of them he said to deborah wouldnt have taken you for a cop i wouldnt have known who you were at all if you hadnt been nosing round arnside house what did i do to give the game away if you dont mind my asking i just have a sixth sense about this kind of thing he tapped the side of his nose can sniff em out pretty easily if you know what i mean goes with the territory has to doesnt it what territory are we talking about journalism thing is he said expansively you have to be able to see more than whats just on the surface in my line of work investigative reporting is about more than sitting at ones desk and waiting for some blokes lifelong enemies to ring up with details of a story thatll bring down the government you have to be adept at digging you have to get into the hunt deborah found this nonsense impossible to resist investigative reporting she said contemplatively is that what you call working for the source then they dont seem to publish investigative stories about the government very often do they if at all just using that as an example he said ah hey its a living he declared doubtless picking up on her ironic tone anyway im a poet otherwise and no one supports himself on poetry these days no indeed deborah said look i know its a rag sergeant cotter but i like to eat and have a roof over my head and this is how i do it your line of work isnt much better i reckon looking under stones to dig out societys scum eh mixed metaphor deborah thought odd for a poet but there you had it i suppose thats one way of looking at it she said theres more than one way to look at everything up ahead of them alatea drove onward it became apparent soon enough that she was heading for lancaster once in the environs of the city they had to take care not to be seen by her so they dropped back with five cars between them they wound through the streets there was no question that alatea knew exactly where she was going she ended up in the city centre in the small car park of a stout brick structure which deborah and zed benjamin passed by thirty yards from this place zed pulled to the kerb deborah swivelled in her seat to look back at the building in some fortyfive seconds alatea came round the corner of it from the direction of the car park and went inside we need to find out what that place is deborah said considering zeds size he wasnt the one to accomplish this task unseen deborah got out said wait here and dashed to the other side of the street where she could keep herself somewhat hidden by using the cars parked there she went as far as she needed to go to be able to read the lettering above the buildings entrance kenthowath foundation for disabled veterans it said a home for soldiers wounded in war deborah considered alateas place of birth which she knew was argentina this took her ineluctably to the falklands war she wondered about the likelihood of an argentine soldier ending up here for some reason someone whom alatea was visiting she was thinking about other possible wars the gulf wars being the most recent ones when alatea emerged she wasnt alone but she wasnt with anyone who looked remotely like a disabled veteran she was instead with another woman tall like alatea but stocky her appearance and ease of movement suggested she was someone who regularly favoured the type of clothing she was wearing at the moment a colourful long skirt loose pullover and boots her long hair was unstyled dark in colour but peppered with grey and she wore it pulled back from her face and held with a hair slide they walked in the direction of the foundations car park talking earnestly considering what this meant deborah dashed back to where zed had parked she got into the car saying shes going to be on the move shes got someone with her in response he fired up the engine and readied himself to follow once more he said what was that place disabled soldiers home that whos with her no shes got a woman with her i spose she could be a soldier but shes not disabled as far as i could tell here they come quickly deborah lunged at zed she threw her arms round him and drew him into what she hoped appeared to a passerby as a lovers passionate embrace when over zeds shoulder she saw the car pass she released him and saw that his face was flaming sorry she said it seemed best he stammered yes right course and he pulled out of the parking space and got back onto alatea faircloughs tail they headed out of the city centre traffic was heavy but they managed to keep alateas vehicle within view zed benjamin was the one who twigged first where alatea was headed clear of the centre of lancaster it wasnt long before a hillside topped with a variety of modernera buildings came into view shes going to the university he said this could take us nowhere in our information deborah didnt think so if alatea was heading towards lancaster university with a companion there was going to be a reason why she had a feeling of what that reason would be and she reckoned it had nothing to do with a desire to pursue higher education parking in this area while remaining out of sight of their quarry was something of an iffy situation vehicles heading to the university were made to use a peripheral road and once they found themselves upon it deborah and her companion discovered that parking was restricted as well there were culdesacs for it but very little scope for hiding within them obviously deborah thought the university had not been designed with the thought of individuals skulking along on the tail of someone else when alatea turned into one of the culdesacs deborah told zed to let her out of the car when he started to protest they were after all supposed to be doing this tailing of alatea fairclough together and he wasnt exactly sure of scotland yards cooperation he pointed out she said look we cant go in there after them zed drop me off and drive on park somewhere else ring me on my mobile and ill tell you where i am its the only thing thats going to work he didnt look happy he didnt look trustful that couldnt be helped she wasnt there to earn his personal faith in her character she was there to get to the bottom of alatea fairclough hed braked the car and that was good enough for deborah she hopped out saying ring my mobile and she dashed into the culdesac before he could protest he wasnt stupid he knew he couldnt be seen by alatea fairclough or the gaff would be blown in a very large way deborah couldnt be seen either but it was going to be far easier for her to hide herself from the argentine woman and her companion than for zed to do so following them proved simpler than she had thought it would be providence helped it began to rain the downpour was sudden and it was heavy requiring umbrellas what better way to conceal ones identity deborah fished hers out of her shoulder bag and thus was able to obscure her face and more important cover her coppery hair she kept a good distance between herself and the other women they made for the university buildings there were plenty of students on the purposebuilt campus at this time of day which was a blessing it was also a blessing that the university unlike the older institutions in the country existed largely in a single location on the top of that hill outside of the city proper the two women continued to talk as they walked heads bent together sharing an umbrella alatea had her arm through the other womans she slipped once and her companion steadied her they seemed to be friends they didnt stop in their progress through the campus they consulted no map they didnt ask directions deborah felt a flicker of excitement at this her mobile rang she said into it hurriedly were on a central path a sort of walkway it goes straight across the campus deb tommys voice deborah winced and called herself a fool for not having looked at the incoming callers identity she said oh tommy i thought it was someone else obviously where are you why dyou want to know because i know you i saw that expression on your face in the car park yesterday and i know exactly what it means youre doing something weve asked you not to do i take it simons not my father tommy is he with you hes asked to meet for a coffee in newby bridge deb whatre you doing where are you whose call are you waiting for deborah considered not only whether to lie to him but also whether she could carry off a lie she sighed and said lancaster university lancaster university whats going on im following alatea fairclough shes come here in the company of a woman from a disabled soldiers home i want to see where theyre going she didnt give him time to consider what this might mean instead continuing with this entire situation has got to do with alatea fairclough somethings not right tommy i know you can sense it im not sure i sense anything other than the distinct possibility that youre walking into trouble alatea fairclough or not there can hardly be trouble in my following them they dont know im behind them and even if they work that out she hesitated to tell him more would risk his telling simon he was shrewd as a fox he said you didnt answer my other question deb whose call are you waiting for the journalist that bloke from the source deb this is a mad sort of business to be engaging in anything can happen i see nothing worse happening than my photo appearing on the front page of the source with a caption misidentifying me as detective sergeant cotter and i see that as hilarious tommy its hardly dangerous he was silent for a moment ahead deborah saw that the women had come to their destination which was a modern upended box of a building constructed of brick and concrete in the unattractive fashion of the s deborah gave them a minute to enter and to get themselves out of the lobby and into a lift in the meantime tommy said deb have you any idea what it would do to simon if something happened to you because believe me i have she paused at the buildings front door she said gently dearest tommy he made no reply she knew what the question had cost him she said youre not to worry im quite safe she heard him sigh take care he said of course she replied and please not a word to simon if he asks me he wont and she rang off immediately her mobile chimed again zed benjamin demanded who the hell were you talking to i was trying to ring you where the hell are you deborah told him the truth she was talking to a di from the met she was standing in front of well the building was called george childress centre and she was about to go inside and see what was housed here he could join her but she wouldnt recommend it since as before he was rather more difficult to camouflage than she was he seemed to see the sense in this he said ring me when you know anything then and this better not be a double cross of some kind or youre in the paper tomorrow morning and the gaff is blown absolutely understood she flipped the phone closed and went inside the building there were four lifts in the lobby as well as a security guard she knew she couldnt bluff her way past the guard for love or money so she looked round and saw that to one side of the lobby and between two languishing bamboo plants a glassedin notice board was hung on the wall she went to this and studied its information it identified offices surgeries and what appeared to be laboratories and above all of these was something that made deborah whisper yes for the building itself fell under the aegis of the faculty of science and technology when she saw this deborah searched the list feverishly and found what she knew at heart would be there one of the laboratories was dedicated to the study of reproductive science her intuition had been correct all along she was on the right path simon had been wrong newby bridge cumbria when lynley rang off he looked at his friend st james had watched him the entire time hed been speaking to deborah and there were few people lynley knew who were more adept at reading between the lines than st james although there actually wasnt much reading between the lines that st james would have had to do lynley had framed the conversation with deborah in such a way that her husband would understand where she was and with whom without lynley overtly betraying her st james said she can be the most maddening woman lynley raised and lowered his fingers in a gesture that indicated his acceptance of this idea isnt that the nature of women in general st james sighed i should have put my foot down in some fashion good lord simon shes an adult you can hardly drag her kicking and howling back to london her point exactly st james rubbed his forehead he looked as if he hadnt slept during the previous night he continued its unfortunate we needed two hire cars id have been able to give her a clear choice otherwise come with me to manchester airport or find your own way home i doubt that would have gone down very well and you know what her reply would have been oh yes thats the hell of it i do know my wife thank you for coming up here simon for lending a hand i would have liked to give you a more definitive answer but it all stacks up the same way no matter how i look at the facts an unfortunate accident despite the plethora of motives everyone seems to have one mignon freddie mcghie nick fairclough kaveh mehran god knows who else despite st james said and not the perfect crime st james glanced out of the window at a copper beech hedge aflame with autumn as he considered this they had met in a rather crumbling victorian hotel not far from newby bridge where in its lounge they were able to order morning coffee it was the sort of place about which helen would have happily declared lord how deliciously atmospheric it is tommy in order to excuse the hideous carpets the layer of dust on the wallmounted deer heads and the tattered condition of the sofas and armchairs for a moment lynley missed his wife with a crushing force he breathed through it as hed learned to do everything passes he thought this also would st james stirred in his armchair and said there were perfect crimes at one time of course but today its so difficult that virtually no one can carry one off forensic science is too advanced tommy there are ways to pick up trace evidence now that were unheard of even five years ago today a perfect crime would have to be one in which no one thinks there was a crime at all but isnt that the case here not with a coroners investigation having been completed not with bernard fairclough coming to london and getting you involved a perfect crime now is one in which theres no suspicion that there could have been a crime an investigation is neither ordered nor needed the coroner signs off on the death on the spot the victim is conveniently cremated within fortyeight hours and there you have it but with the situation youve got here all the bases were covered and there was ultimately nothing to suggest ian cresswells death was anything other than what the coroner decided an accident and if valerie and not ian was the intended victim exactly the same problem as you know st james took up his coffee if this was intentional tommy and if valerie and not ian had been the intended victim youve got to agree there are far better ways to be rid of her everyone knew ian used the boathouse as well as valerie why risk killing him if she was supposed to die and whats the motive anyway and even if there is a motive for her death trying to go at this problem through forensic data isnt going to get you anywhere because there is no forensic data none that suggests this wasnt what it appears to be an accident something other than that filleting knife could have been used to dislodge the stones simon of course but the stones themselves would have borne the marks of a tool being used on them and they had no marks you saw that beyond that look how many others were loose that boathouse has doubtless been an accident waiting to happen for years no case to present then thats my conclusion st james smiled regretfully so id have to say to you what ive said quite unsuccessfully to deborah its time to go back to london what about a crime of intent meaning meaning one wishes another dead one hopes for it one even plans it but before the plan can be put into action an accident supervenes the intended victim dies anyway could we have that here we could of course but even if we do the point is in this case no guilt can be established and no ones behaviour is suggesting guilt lynley nodded thoughtfully still and all what i have the nagging feeling lynleys mobile rang he glanced at the number then said to st james havers could be something new then i can only hope lynley answered the call with tell me something sergeant at this point anything will do chalk farm london barbara had placed the call to lynley from her home shed been into the met long before the crack of dawn to engage in some further investigating using the vast resources there afterwards not wishing to be anywhere near the place when acting detective superintendent ardery showed her face shed scarpered home twelve cups of coffee had seen her through the early morning and at this point she was so lit up by caffeine that she doubted shed be able to sleep for days she was also smoking like a steam engine going full throttle her head felt as if her brain were about to begin sending out torpedoes the first thing she told lynley was theres a kid inspector this may be important this may be nothing but turns out vivienne tullys got an eightyearold daughter called bianca i think she also knew i was going to show my mug on her doorstep her flat was swept clean of everything personal and she didnt exactly swoon with shock when i told her i was from the met i only found out about the kid because im bonding with the buildings porter in a very big way expect an announcement soon in that quarter you got inside then my talents sir know not a single bound i live to impress you barbara went on to tell lynley what shed learned from vivienne she gave him everything from the womans education to her employment to her intention to return to new zealand land of her birth didnt deny a thing about fairclough knowing him acting as a board member of his foundation seeing him regularly for meals and such at twins but she threw up a roadblock when it came to why he has a key to her digs this child bianca could she be faircloughs possibly but she could also be his sons ian cresswells the prime ministers or the prince of waless for that matter she could be a wild night on the town a little whoops if you know what i mean anyway this vivienne hasnt worked for fairclough for years she hasnt worked for him since before she even had the kid itd be hard to believe shes maintained a longdistance romance with him wouldnt you say a longdistance romance enduring enough to have had his kid perhaps its not a romance thats been maintained for years barbara perhaps biancas the result of a chance encounter that brought vivienne back into faircloughs life at some point what like they find themselves in a lift somewhere lock eyes on each other and the rest is bianca i spose thats possible he established a foundation lynley pointed out he needed board members and shes one of them cant be that foundations been around long before bianca was a gleam in anyones eye anyway accepting a position on the foundation boards one thing getting involved with fairclough and staying involved with him is another why would she want to do that hes decades older ive seen his picture as well and believe me theyre not close to being a physical match wouldnt she have preferred a bloke nearer to her own age and also available getting enmeshed with a married bloke is generally boarding a train to nowhere and she seems far too clever for that in a sensible world she would have understood your point and made a different sort of decision but if she didnt youll have to agree that therere always things making people far less than sensible sergeant barbara heard the murmur of someones voice in the background lynley identified the voice with simons saying that vast amounts of money make people less than sensible all the time okay right but if the kids faircloughs and if hes been doing the horizontal rumba with vivienne tully for god only knows how long then why bring in a scotland yard investigation into his nephews death which has already been called an accident hed have to have known that everyone would be looked into including himself what the hell sort of risk is he taking if its unrelated to cresswells death he may be reckoning on my keeping a lid on this particular aspect of his private life if its unrelated barbara said but if it is related that bloody well explains why hillier picked you for this particular job doesnt it the earl covering up for the baron hed like that touch hillier would i cant disagree hes done it before anything else lynley enquired yeah ive been busy kaveh mehrans not lying about ownership of that farm cresswell left it to him interesting bit is when he did it prepare for a drum roll he signed the will one week before he drowned thats telling lynley agreed although one would have to wonder at a murderer so dimwitted as to kill someone one week after a will was signed in his favour there is that havers admitted anything more oh im the early bird all right getting up at ungodly hours of the morning also allows one to make international phone calls whose recipients are easy to reach because theyre still in bed argentina lynley guessed in a pie tin i managed to get through to the home of the mayor of santa maria di all the et ceteras i tried his office first but that turned out to be a case of someone at one end saying quien and que and me on this end shouting let me talk to the bloody mayor for gods sake before i finally worked out the time difference and twigged i was talking to the cleaner i had to give up that idea but i did get to the house and let me tell you that was not an easy task im all admiration barbara what did you uncover the fact that no one speaks english in argentina or that everyone pretends not to speak english have it either way i did manage to corner someone i think was dominga padilla y del torres de vasquez though i kept repeating the name and she kept saying si when she wasnt saying quien i went with alateas name then and this dominga started babbling there was a lot of dios mios and dondes and graciases so i wager this bird knows who alatea is what i need just now is someone who can talk to her are you onto that then like i said before azhars got to know someone at the university therell be someone at the yard as well barbara with some fishing but i go that route and the guv will be all over me like groupies on a rock star shes already asked me ive spoken to her she knows i have you doing some work for me barbara ive got to ask this did you tell her barbara felt deeply affronted they had years of history she and the inspector that he would think shed betray those years made her back go up i bloody well did not for that was the gods truth of the matter the fact that shed allowed isabelle ardery to work it out for herself without sidetracking her with some sort of red herring was not barbaras problem lynley was silent barbara had a sudden anguished feeling that they were heading towards a herorme moment this was the very last thing she wanted since if it came down to the superintendent or herself she knew how unlikely it was that lynley would make the choice that would put him at odds with his own lover he was after all and she had to face it a bloke so she went back to where theyd gone off track saying anyway id planned to speak to azhar if he can come up with someone adept at spanish weve solved that problem and weve got the key to alatea fairclough as to that theres something else lynley told her a tale about alatea faircloughs modeling career in her prenicholas fairclough days he ended with he told deborah it was naughty underwear and said shes embarrassed and afraid shell be found out naughty underwear hardly being a crushing issue to anyone but a nun or someone marrying into the royal family were thinking it might be pornography instead ill see what i can do with that as well barbara told him they exchanged a few more words during which barbara tried to read him through his tone did he believe what shed said about isabelle ardery and his presence in cumbria did he not and was it important in any case what he believed when he ended the call she had no answers but she had no love for her questions either chalk farm london barbara heard the sound of raised voices as she approached the groundfloor flat at the front of the property she was already crossing the patch of lawn to the terrace in front of the flats front doors when the unmistakable voice of taymullah azhar shouted furiously i will take steps angelina i promise you that barbara froze at once angelina upman cried are you actually threatening me and azhar returned at top volume you can ask me that this matter is settled barbara spun on her heel to beat a quick retreat but she was too late out of the door azhar strode his face as black as shed ever seen it he clocked her for there was no place for either of them to hide he turned away and hurried off the property setting off down eton villas in the direction of steeles road it was a damnandblast moment that got worse immediately for angelina upman came dashing out of the flat as well as if going after her partner and she clasped a fist at her mouth when she saw barbara they locked eyes angelina spun and retreated that painted things badly for barbara she was caught angelina had shown her friendship barbara could hardly slink off without asking if she could be of help this was actually the last option she wanted to choose from the list of alternatives that she rapidly considered she chose it anyway however angelina answered immediately when barbara knocked on the french windows barbara said to her sorry i was coming to ask azhar she ran a hand through her hair and was all at once aware of how different it felt since the previous choppiness of it was gone this fact seemed to define what she had to do next she said bloody hell im dead sorry i overheard the row but i didnt hear much just the last bit i was coming to ask azhar for a favour angelinas shoulders slumped a bit im terribly sorry barbara we should have kept our voices down but were too hot tempered i brought something up better left unsaid there are topics hari wont discuss triggers for a row just that yes she blew out a regretful breath anyway thisll blow over it always does cn i do anything if you dont mind a mess you might come inside and have a cup of tea with me angelina then grinned and added or a glass of gin which i could bloody do with let me tell you ill go for the tea barbara said save the gin for next time inside the flat barbara saw what angelina had meant by a mess it looked as if azhar and his partner had resorted to hurling a few objects at each other in the midst of their row this seemed so utterly unlike azhar that barbara looked from the sitting room to angelina and wondered if shed done all the hurling herself there were scattered magazines a broken figurine an upended lamp a shattered vase and flowers lying on the floor in a pool of water barbara said i cn help you put this in order as well tea first angelina said the kitchen was untouched angelina made the tea and took it to a small table that sat beneath a high window through which a patch of sunlight gleamed she said thank god hadiyyahs in school she would have been frightened i doubt shes ever seen hari like that barbara took the inference angelina herself had seen hari like that she said to her like i said i was on my way to ask his help haris how barbara explained angelina lifted her teacup as she listened she had lovely hands like the rest of her and their tapered fingers bore shapely nails of a uniform length she said hell know someone hell want to help you he likes you enormously barbara you mustnt think that this she tilted her head in the direction of the sitting room is an indication of anything but two similar temperaments crashing into each other well both get over it we usually do thats good to know angelina took a sip of tea its stupid how arguments between partners grow from nothing one makes a suggestion that the other doesnt care for and before you know it tempers flare things get said its ridiculous to this barbara didnt know what to say she didnt have a partner had never had one and had no possibility of some chance encounter leading her to having one so arguing with one hurling objects at one there was small likelihood that shed find herself having that experience any time soon still she made a mumbling s hell that eh and hoped that would suffice you know about haris wife dont you angelina asked i expect hes told you how he left her but theres never been a divorce barbara felt a bit prickly with this direction of conversation well right yeah i mean more or less he left her for me i was a student not his of course ive no brain for science but we met at lunch one day it was crowded and he asked to share my table i liked his well i quite liked his gravity his thoughtfulness i liked his confidence the way he didnt feel he had to answer quickly or amusingly in a conversation he was very real that appealed to me i cn see how it would for it appealed to barbara as well and long had done taymullah azhar had appeared from the first to be exactly who he seemed to be i didnt want him to leave her i loved him i love him but to break up a mans home i never saw myself as such a woman but then there was hadiyyah when hari knew i was pregnant hed hear of nothing else but our being together i could have ended the pregnancy of course but this was ours you see and i couldnt face not having her she leaned forward and briefly touched barbaras hand can you imagine a world without hadiyyah in it it was a simple question with an equally simple answer cant barbara said anyway ive wanted her to meet her siblings haris other children but he wont hear of it that was the row weve gone through it before its the only thing we ever argue about the answers always the same that will not happen as if he determines the course everyones life is supposed to take when he says that sort of thing i dont react well nor do i react well when he declares that he and i will not be giving her a sibling either i have three children he says i will have no more he might change his mind he hasnt in years and i cant think of a single reason why he would behind his back then without him knowing take hadiyyah to meet her siblings you mean angelina shook her head ive no idea where they are ive no idea what their names are or who their mother is she might have returned to pakistan for all hes told me about her theres always an accidental pregnancy i suppose but its a bit low that eh hed never forgive it and ive already asked him to forgive a great deal barbara thought angelina might go on at that point revealing her reasons for having left azhar and hadiyyah for her trip to canada as it had long been called but she didnt do so instead she said i love hari so much you know but sometimes i hate him in just the same way she smiled at the irony of her own statement then she seemed to shrug it off she said wait an hour then ring him on his mobile hari will do whatever he can to grant your favour lake windermere cumbria manette had reckoned on the previous day that her father hadnt been telling the truth about vivienne tully she had also reckoned that emotional cowardice was what was preventing her from pushing the subject further it was stupid really but the fact of the matter was that she hadnt wanted to show any sign of weakness in her fathers presence she was still infuriatingly that little girl who believed she could morph herself into the son bernard fairclough so wanted if she tried hard enough big boys didnt cry so neither would she thus anything that threatened a wellspring of emotion from her while her father stood there observing evaluating and dismissing her was something that had to be avoided but the subject wasnt closed how could it be if ian had been making monthly payments to vivienne tully for years there was more than one reason that manette had to get to the story behind that there was also her mother to consider her mother after all owned fairclough industries it had been her inheritance her father might have run it for decades with great success but it was a private company with a small but powerful board of directors her mother and not her father was its chairman for valeries own father had been no fool just because bernie dexter had become bernard fairclough this did not mean he had fairclough blood running through his veins so there was no way on earth that valeries father would have risked fairclough industries falling into the hands of someone who was not a fairclough born shed talked everything over with freddie thankfully hed not had a date with sarah on the previous night although hed had a lengthy conversation with the woman his hushed voice sounding amused and affectionate manette had gritted her teeth through this and when her jaw had begun to ache and the conversation did not end shed gone into the sitting room and used the treadmill till the sweat ran down her chest and soaked her jersey finally freddie had wandered in his face slightly flushed and the tips of his ears quite pink she would have concluded theyd had telephone sex but manette didnt see that as freddies style she ran for another five minutes to make her workout look legitimate freddie mouthed wow in ostensible admiration for her endurance and took himself into the kitchen there she found him bent over a book of crossword puzzles looking thoughtful and tapping the nonbusiness end of a biro against his lip she said to him not going out tonight he said giving it a bit of a rest the old prong tired is he freddie blushed oh no hes very up for the job freddie mcghie freddies eyes got wide and then he caught the innuendo lord didnt mean it that way he laughed we decided you and the lady or you and the prong sarah and i decided to slow things just a bit seems that a relationship should have more to it than tearing off ones clothes within ten minutes of hello im glad to hear that manette said without thinking are you why oh well i she thought for a moment and came up with i dont want you to make a mistake to be hurt you know he gazed at her she felt the heat climb her chest and ease its way up her neck a change of subject was needed and manettes conversation with bernard was just the ticket freddie had listened in that freddie way giving her his complete attention when she was finished he said i think we both must talk to him at this point manette manette was surprised by the strength of her gratitude still she knew that they had only one option when it came to getting information from her father it was likely that mignon had managed to learn whatever it was shed learned via either her impressive skills with the internet or her dexterous turning of the screws of their fathers guilt mignon had never been wrong about their fathers preference for nicholas shed merely dealt with that preference in a fashion that served her own ends from the first becoming more expert at this the older she grew but neither manette nor freddie possessed that sort of manipulative expertise the way manette saw it only valeries presence and valeries learning about the money drain would move bernard now there was simply too much on the line the ruin of an entire firm just for starters to let matters lie if manettes father wasnt willing to look into the money situation to sort it out and to stop it she knew her mother certainly would be they set off for ireleth hall in midmorning soon enough the rain began to fall late autumn and it poured buckets in cumbria in another month it would begin to snow theyd get a bit where they lived in great urswick farther north the steep narrow passes over the fells would close until next spring when freddie parked the car near the vast front door of ireleth hall manette turned to him thanks for this freddie she said he said eh and looked genuinely perplexed for coming along with me i do appreciate it tosh were in this together old girl and before she could reply freddie was out of the car and coming round to open her own door lets beard the lion before we lose our nerve if things get bad we can always ring your sister and request an interesting diversion manette chuckled freddie did know her family didnt he well of course he did hed been a member of it for nearly half his life she said without thinking of the implications why on earth did we ever divorce freddie continual failure on someones part to recap the toothpaste as i recall he replied lightly they didnt knock upon the door merely entering the long rectangular hall where the autumn chill suggested a fire needed to be lit in the enormous fireplace manette shouted out a hello that seemed to echo off the walls freddie did likewise calling out bernards and valeries names valerie was the one who replied they heard her walking along the corridor upstairs in a moment she came down she smiled and said what a nice surprise to see you together as well she said the last as if expecting from them a happy announcement of the reconciliation type not very likely manette thought her mother didnt know about freddie and his wildly successful foray into the world of internet dating manette saw that valeries assumption could be extremely useful in this moment though she reached for her former husbands hand and said coyly we were hoping to have a word with you and dad is he around valerie looked even more pleased she said goodness he must be let me see if i can find him freddie dear will you light that fire shall we meet in here or would you prefer heres just fine manette said she held on to freddies hand and looked at him isnt it freddie freddie was as always blushing which manette considered a perfect touch as her mother left the room he said i say old girl to which manette replied thanks for playing along before she lifted his hand and gave it a swift and affectionate kiss youre a brick lets see to the fire mind the flues open by the time valerie returned with bernard the fire was roaring and manette and freddie were standing in front of it toasting their backsides to manette it was fairly clear from the expression on her parents faces that theyd had a brief conversation about the nature of what freddie and she had come to talk about her father wore a look of anticipation that equaled her mothers no surprise there really theyd both adored freddie from the day manette had brought him home for an introduction her father offered coffee her mother offered toasted tea cakes chocolate gateau biscotti from a bakery in windermere both manette and freddie demurred politely manette said lets sit though and led freddie to one of the sofas perpendicular to the fireplace her parents took the other both of them interestingly sat on the edge as if ready to spring up and run at the least provocation it was either that or being ready to dash off for a bottle of the bubbly hope did always spring eternal manette thought when it came to what people believed was possible she said freddie as an indication to him to take the bull by the horns he said looking from her father to her mother bernard valerie its about ian and the books alarm swept across bernards features he looked at his wife as if drawing the conclusion that hed been bushwhacked by her in a scheme with their daughter while valerie looked mystified although she said nothing merely waiting for more information manette didnt know if freddie noticed this it didnt matter much because he went on directly saying i know this isnt going to go down well in some quarters but we have to sort out a way to deal with mignons monthly payments or preferably to stop them altogether and we have to get to the bottom of this matter of vivienne tully what with the money thats gone into arnside house and the money to mignon and the money to vivienne id love you to think fairclough industries is awash with cash but the truth is that along with the expense of the childrens garden here at the hall were going to have to cut back somewhere and sooner rather than later it was all so vintage freddie manette thought he was earnest and truthful guileless to a fault there was no possible way her father could argue that this outlay of money was not freddies concern freddie was not accusing him of anything in addition no one was more appropriate than freddie to be looking through the books to see where the business stood after ians death anyway she waited for her fathers response so did freddie so did valerie the fire crackled and popped and a log rolled off the grate bernard took this opportunity to temporise he took up the tongs and the hearth brush and dealt with the problem while the three of them watched him valerie said when he turned back to them tell me about the money going out to vivienne tully freddie although when she said it her eyes were fixed on her husband freddie said affably well its a bit peculiar its evidently been going on for years increasing incrementally ive more documentation from ians computer accounts to sort through but from what ive gathered so far it seems like a large pile of money went out to her via a bank transfer some years ago then a gap of a few years with nothing going out to her and then a monthly allowance of some sort appears to have begun when would this have been valerie asked steadily round eight and a half years ago now i know she sits on the board of the foundation bernard i beg your pardon valerie turned to her husband and said his name as freddie continued with but that position as with all charitable boards would be unpaid save for expenses of course only what shes being paid far exceeds any expenses unless and here he chuckled and manette wanted to kiss him for the sheer innocence of that chuckle shes dining out every night with potential donors and sending their children to public schools to boot that not being the case im getting the picture valerie said arent you bernard or is the truth of the matter that theres no picture for you to get bernard was looking at manette of course he would want to know what she had told freddie and what sort of game they were playing with him now he would feel betrayed as well what hed told her on the previous day hed told her in confidence well had he told her everything manette thought she might have kept the truth to herself but he hadnt done had he hed told her just enough to appease her in that moment or so he had believed bernard tried to present his earlier excuse saying ive no idea why there were payments to vivienne its possible that ian felt he had to he stumbled here looking for a reason perhaps this was a means of protecting me from what exactly valerie asked as i recall vivienne accepted employment in a more senior position with a firm in london she wasnt dismissed or was she is there something i dont know and then to freddie exactly how much money are we talking about freddie named the sum freddie named the bank valeries lips parted manette could see the whites of her teeth gritted together her gaze fixed on bernard he looked away valerie said to him how would you prefer me to interpret this bernard bernard said nothing she said shall i believe shes been blackmailing ian for some reason perhaps he was cooking the books and she knew it so he cooked them some more benefitting her or perhaps she promised to take herself out of the picture and say nothing to niamh of his sexual proclivities as long as he paid her although that wouldnt explain why he continued to pay her once he left niamh for kaveh would it darling so lets go with the first idea freddie is there any indication ian was cooking the books well only in that the payments to mignon have increased as well but as to any money going his own way theres nothing mignon right her allowance has taken a rather large jump freddie said problem with that the way i see it is that the jump doesnt actually match necessary expenses if you know what i mean of course there was the surgery but that would have been one payment wouldnt it and considering she lives right here on the property what has she got in the way of actual expenses i know she does tend to spend a bit on her internet shopping but really how much can that cost well of course i suppose it could cost a fortune couldnt it if one became addicted to shopping on the internet or something but freddie babbled on a bit manette knew he could feel the tension between her parents and she knew his babbling was a reaction to this he had to have known that theyd be walking into a minefield talking to her parents together about the money going out to vivienne and to mignon but in his freddie innocence he hadnt considered exactly how many mines lay within that field waiting to explode there was silence at the end of freddies remarks valerie had her gaze concreted on bernard bernard ran his hand back over his head he opted for an attempt at redirection saying to manette i wouldnt have thought this was possible for you what manette said you know very well i thought our relationship was rather different to what it apparently is my error i see to which freddie said quickly i say bernard this has nothing to do with manette and with such firmness that manette looked at her former husband freddie put his hand on hers and squeezed it going on to say her concerns are completely legitimate in the circumstances and she only knows about the payments because i told her this is a family business and youre not family bernard snapped you were once but you took yourself out of that position and if you think do not manette cut in talk to freddie that way youre lucky to have him were all lucky to have him he appears to be the only honest person working in a position of responsibility at the company does that include you then her father asked im not sure that matters manette told him because it certainly includes you perhaps she thought she would have said nothing at the end of the day not wishing to be the one to devastate her own mother but her fathers remarks to freddie took things too far in manettes eyes although she didnt pause to consider why this was the case since the only thing her father had actually said was the absolute truth freddie wasnt a member of the family any longer shed seen to that she said to her mother i think dad has something hed like to say something hed like to explain about himself and vivienne tully im taking that point very well manette valerie said and to freddie stop the payments to vivienne at once contact her through the bank to which the payments have gone tell them to inform her its my decision bernard said thats not i dont care what it is and it isnt valerie said nor should you or have you a reason to be paying her that youd care to explain bernards expression was agonised had things been different manette thought she might actually have felt sorry for him she gave passing consideration to what shits men were and she waited for her father to attempt to lie his way out of this situation as he was surely going to do in the hope that she would say nothing about their conversation and what hed admitted to her about his affair with vivienne tully but bernard fairclough had always been the luckiest bastard on the planet and that proved to be the case in that moment for the door burst open as they sat there waiting for bernard to answer and the wind swept in as manette turned thinking she and freddie had left it off the latch her brother nicholas strode into the room lancaster lancashire deborah knew the only course open to her was to speak to the woman with alatea fairclough if indeed she was correct in her surmise that what was going on with alatea had to do with conceiving a child then she seriously doubted that alatea was going to be willing to talk about it especially to someone whod already been found out as misrepresenting her true purpose in cumbria nor was she likely to unburden herself to a tabloid journalist thus the other woman seemed like the only possibility to get to the bottom of alateas odd behaviour and to learn whether it had anything to do with the death of ian cresswell she rang zed on his mobile he barked you took your bloody sweet time where the hell are you whats going on we had a deal and if youre reneging she said theyve gone into a science building well thats got us nowhere in a basket could be shes just taking a course mature student right the other could be doing the same thing i must talk to her zed i thought you already went that route with no result i dont mean alatea obviously shes not going to talk to me any more than shes going to talk to you i mean the other the woman she fetched from the disabled soldiers home shes the one i need to talk to why and here was where things got tricky they seem to have a relationship of some sort they were talking quite companionably all the way from the car park to the science building they seemed like friends and friendships mean confidences shared they also mean keeping those confidences to oneself of course but i find that outside of london the met have a certain cachet with people say scotland yard cid and show your identification and suddenly what was sworn to secrecy gets offered for police consumption same thing with a reporters work zed noted was he joking deborah wondered probably not she said i take your point of course then i think i might be a less threatening presence how so it seems obvious first it would be two against one two complete strangers confronting a woman about her friendship with another woman second well theres your size zed which you have to admit could be rather threatening im a lamb shell see that perhaps she would but then theres the entire matter of who we are shell want to see our identification picture the result i show her mine you show her yours and whats she going to think let alone do when she sees the met in bed with the source it wouldnt work the only route we have is for me to talk to this woman privately see where that takes us and share the information with you and howm i sposed to know youll do that i see this as a bloody good route to a double cross with your ability to break the story of scotland yards presence up here on the front page of the source at any moment believe me zed im hardly going to play games with you he was silent deborah had retreated a safe distance from the george childress centre she had it in sight but she didnt want to risk being seen by alatea fairclough should she and the other woman emerge the way she reckoned the safest route to take at this point was to return to the disabled soldiers home and to wait there for alatea and her companion to turn up it could take hours obviously but there didnt seem to be any other choice but a long wait in zeds car which was what she told him she also said that if he had any other ideas she would be happy to entertain them luckily he hadnt he wasnt stupid he did see that a direct confrontation of the two women together right on the campus of the university of lancaster bore the distinct possibility of getting them nowhere superficially at least the women were engaged in nothing that even looked suspicious aha whatre you two doing together was a very likely route to none of your business zed saw that although he made it clear to deborah that he also didnt like it it wasnt his style he told her to sit and wait journalists didnt do that journalists dug and confronted and got the story that was at the very core of what a journalist was that was part of the rich tradition of the profession deborah wanted to scoff at that one but she made various murmurs of assent too right yes indeed i understand but at the moment they didnt even know the name of the woman with whom alatea had come to the university and without this at the very least neither one of them could dig for anything she brought zed round to her way of thinking albeit reluctantly he finally said he would meet her at the same spot where shed hopped out of the car earlier theyd head back to the disabled soldiers home and there they would wait for the return of alatea fairclough and her companion theyd lay their plans during their wait he said and there would be a plan sergeant cotter no way was he going to miss out on this story because of some double dealing at her end therell be no double dealing deborah said i recognise that youve got me in a tricky spot if i dont work with you zed he chuckled thats what good reporters do yes im definitely learning that she told him they rang off deborah waited a few more minutes to see if alatea and her companion might emerge they did not from deborahs recollection of the notice board inside the buildings lobby there were no lecture halls within it was given over to offices and laboratories this meant that alatea and the other woman were probably not there as mature students as zed had suggested and since reproductive science was one of the disciplines studied there deborah was certain she was on the track of what alatea fairclough had to hide victoria london barbara havers had to return to the yard she needed winston nkatas expertise and other than a return to victoria street the only way she reckoned she could get it was to convince him to disappear for a few hours and to meet her somewhere with access to the web she didnt have that at her bungalow she didnt even own a laptop having long considered them a drain on the time of the individuals who possessed them the whole world of the information superhighway was too bloody much for her shed liked things better when everything had been controlled simply by on and off switches and when the pushbutton telephone and telly remotes were as far as technology had gone make a few calls and put the burden of information searching on someone else that was the ticket now however things were different it was the investigators mental shoe leather that got worn down not the real thing but while she was finally albeit reluctantly developing her capabilities in the area of digging through the ether of the world wide web she was nowhere close to winstons level how did one locate naughty underwear ads featuring a specific model that was the question he would have the answer she reckoned she could phone him but that wouldnt be the same she needed to see what was on the screen as a result of his relentless googling clicking and doubleclicking so she took herself back to new scotland yard she rang him from the lobby meet me in the library she told him they had a cloakanddagger state of affairs going on the guv needed to be kept in the dark barb he replied barbara knew exactly what it meant when winston used that tone but she also knew how to quell his concerns the inspector needs some information she said winnie she knew would do anything for lynley you cn break away cant you it wont take long whatre you doing looking up dirty pictures on a met computer you gone dead mad hilliers orders she said really winnie dyou think i actually want to do this the inspectors following up on something itll probably turn out to be a fat old cow modelling bras and knickers he said hed meet her in the library but he also said and this was winston through and through that if he ran into the guv and she wanted to know where he was heading he would tell her the truth but you will try to avoid her wont you barbara clarified the inspectors already in trouble with her for bringing me into this i bring you into it as well and shes going to go for his jugular that did it as she hoped it would he would avoid isabelle ardery as best he could he was apparently successful in this when barbara reached the mets library on the twelfth floor nkata was waiting he confessed that hed run into dorothea harriman however and this wasnt good news the departmental secretary had methods of discovery so advanced that shed probably read winstons intentions about the library by looking at his shoelaces well it couldnt be helped they set to work winstons capable fingers flew across the keys once he had the spelling of alatea faircloughs lengthy birth name he was unstoppable screen after screen flashed by barbara didnt attempt to keep up winston didnt explain what he was doing or where they were heading on the web he just glanced at things made a decision of some sort hit a few more keys and off they went he would have done fine in forensic computer work barbara reckoned she was about to tell him this when a furious sergeants havers and nkata told her that dorothea harriman had let something drop and isabelle ardery had managed to unearth them nkata swung round from the computer if a black man could have been said to go pale that was what happened barbara herself went empty what was it with the bloody superintendent she wondered was this about lynley and where he was and why he wasnt performing nightly between her legs or was it about holding the rest of them beneath her thumbnail like insects about to be pinned to a board winston stood slowly he looked at barbara she said i borrowed winston for a few minutes guv something i needed to look up and hes clever with this stuff i can do it but it takes me forever and im generally hopeless when it comes to figuring where to go next isabelle looked her over her gaze rested most meaningfully on barbaras teeshirt which was perfectly readable since shed flung her donkey jacket on a nearby chair christ died for our sins lets not disappoint him clearly did not amuse ardery said holidays over sergeant havers i want you back at work and wearing something appropriate within an hour barbara said due respect guv dont push this barbara isabelle told her you may have six days six weeks or six months of holiday time due but it seems rather obvious that youre not on holiday that being the case get back to work i was only going to say sergeant havers isabelle barked this time do it now barbara said it in a rush guv i cant get home and change my clothes and be back in an hour its impossible plus i need to get over to university college if youll let me have a day this day this one day more i swear im out of here in thirty seconds and im back tomorrow dressed like she couldnt come up with a name like whoever she wanted to add picture me gorgeous but she reckoned the superintendent would respond with id rather picture you dead so she let that one go she did add i twisted winstons arm guv please dont take things out on him things the superintendent snapped what things would those be sergeant havers next to her barbara heard winston moan just a small sound that the superintendent didnt take note of thank god she said i dont know just whatever things stress of the job life referring to what isabelle was furious now barbara wondered how much further she could dig herself guv i dont know she said although being without lynley to bonk was fairly high on her list i didnt mean anything by that anyway just something to say yes well dont play round with just something to say all right finish what youre doing here then get out of this building ill see you here tomorrow morning and if i do not youll be a traffic warden in uzbekistan by tomorrow afternoon is that clear dont know how it could be clearer barbara said and you isabelle said to winston are coming with me no sign of knickers was what nkata said in response although he said it quickly and he said it to barbara adding check out raul montenegro before he left her barbara waited till the superintendent and nkata had left the met library she cursed her bad luck when it came to ardery she was going to have to start walking the perfectly straight and the excruciatingly narrow with the superintendent failing that she had little doubt that isabelle would be only too happy to dropkick her bum into another time zone she replaced winston at the computer terminal she gazed at the screen she read what was there damn if it wasnt in bloody spanish again but she found the name winston had mentioned before being carted off raul montenegro popped out from a jumble of other words okay barbara thought lets follow that lead lake windermere cumbria throughout the years manette had seen her younger brother in many different states from stonecold sober to barely conscious shed seen him regretful shed seen him earnest shed seen him manipulative mournful agitated anxious pleasantly high and unpleasantly paranoid but shed never seen him as angry as he was when he burst through the door to ireleth hall letting it crash back behind him as entrances went it was damn effective it left all of them gaping most conveniently it left bernard fairclough in the welcome state of not having to answer any further questions about vivienne tully and the payments made into her bank account nicky whats wrong valerie demanded are you all right bernard said wheres alatea has something happened to her nothings happened to alatea nicholass voice was brusque lets talk about scotland yard all right you wont mind that will you will you manette what about you freddie i spose i can assume the whole collection of you are in on this manette looked at her father she wasnt about to take this on she closed her fingers over freddies hand to indicate to him he wasnt to say anything either she felt him look at her but he said nothing instead his hand turned and he wove his fingers with hers bernard said what are you talking about nick sit down you look awful are you not sleeping dont start the bloody false concern with me he cried theres someone up here from london to investigate me and if youre about to suggest you know nothing about it thats just not on he strode to the fireplace he towered over his father what the hell did you think that i wouldnt notice that i wouldnt work it out that im so bloody addlebrained from drugs and done up with booze that i wouldnt wonder why christ in heaven i ought to kill you and have done with it itd be easy enough wouldnt it ive apparently got such talents in the area of homicide that one more dead body in the boathouse would hardly count nicholas valerie rose from the sofa stop this at once oh youre part of it are you he sneered at her i wouldve thought you not part of it all of it valerie said are you listening to me im all of it that brought him to silence manette felt the shock of her mothers words like a ball of ice forming within her stomach but confusion replaced shock soon enough it was easier to be confused by the declaration than it was to follow it to its logical conclusion valerie her husband said quietly this isnt necessary im afraid it is at this point she said to nicholas the police are here because of me your father fetched them at my request it was not his idea do you understand he went to london he did the legwork because he knows someone at new scotland yard but it was no more his idea than she gestured to manette and freddie still holding each others hand on the sofa than it was your sisters or mignons or anyone elses i wanted this nicholas no one else nicholas looked like a man whod taken a mortal blow he finally said my own bloody mother did you actually think you thought its not quite what youre concluding she said that i might that i could have then he hit his fist on the mantelpiece manette winced at the force he used id kill ian thats what you think that i was capable of murder whats the matter with you nick enough bernard had spoken if nothing else youve a history of i goddamn know my history i lived it you bloody well dont need to recite it for me but unless i spent a decade or two of my history in some sort of fugue i dont recall ever lifting a hand against anyone no one valerie said lifted a hand against ian either thats not how he died then what the hell valerie bernard said this will make things worse they cant get worse nicholas said unless theres another reason mother wanted scotland yard up here want me to think that do you are they investigating manette what about mignon what about fred or has he just continued running to do manettes bidding as usual manette said dont you dare take this out on freddie and yes the detective has been to see us and the first we knew there was a detective was when we had a scotland yard id shoved under our noses well at least you got that much he said and to his mother have you any idea any bloody idea at all im sorry she said ive hurt you and im sorry but there are things beyond your hurt like what he shouted and then the pieces seemed to fall into place is this about the family business who gets what who runs what who has the power and when and how nicholas please there are other things dyou think i care about any of that dyou think i want it dyou think thats why im here back at home i dont give a toss who runs the business give it to manette give it to freddie give it to someone off the street do you have any idea what this has done to alatea having someone actually come into our home someone prowling round pretending to be this this investigator of yours has lied to us from the first mother do you understand that shes come to the house shes told a stupid tale about why shes here shes frightened allie who now apparently thinks oh god i dont know what she thinks but shes in a state and if she thinks im using dont you see what youve done my own wife if she walks out on me she bernard spoke shes come to the house nick what are you talking about what the hell do you think im talking about your sodding scotland yard investigator its a man valerie said nicholas its a man not a woman its a man we know nothing about oh too right mum shes telling the truth manette told her brother he has someone with him bernard added but its another man nick a forensic specialist another man if a womans been to arnside house to talk to you and alatea its to do with something else entirely nicholas blanched then he was making connections rapidly manette could see that much as the thoughts passed quickly across his face unaccountably he said montenegro who bernard asked but as swiftly as nicholas had entered ireleth hall just as swiftly he left it lancaster lancashire deborahs two hours in a parked car with zed benjamin were broken only by a single call on her mobile she thought it might be simon and she glanced to see rapidly assessing whether she should answer or let it go to her voice mail rather than risk something less than an official conversation in the presence of the journalist it was tommy though she reckoned she could work with that she said to zed my guv and when she answered she said inspector lynley hullo thats a formal touch all due respect deborah told him cheerfully she felt zeds eyes on her she kept her own fixed on the disabled soldiers home if only i received that at work tommy said then ive met up with simon i thought you might have done hes unhappy with both of us with me for getting you into this with you for not getting out of it where are you now still in lancaster how did you get there what dyou mean deborah simons rung me from your hotel you said you saw him this was afterwards he went back to the hotel you were gone but your hire cars there hes obviously concerned not enough to ring me oh for gods sake deb have some pity on the man he knows youre in a temper he knows you wont answer the phone if you see hes the caller how did you get to lancaster she had no choice but she did need to be careful with her phrasing mr benjamin from the source is working with me at the moment sir she heard his mild curse so she quickly went on im waiting to speak to the woman who was with alatea they paid a call upon someone at the faculty of science and technology and we need to know why deb she could hear in his voice that he wasnt sure what approach to take with her just now what would work he was wondering an appeal to her wiser nature a veiled reference to their own past as lovers it was an interesting position for him to be in she reckoned he said you know simon wants you back in london hes worried i dont think londons wise at the moment im very close to something here thats exactly what hes worried about youve been too close to a murderer once before guernsey she thought like bogart and bergman when it came to paris she and simon would always have guernsey all right shed been hurt but she hadnt died she hadnt even been close to dying and this was different since she had no intention of ending up inside an earthen chamber with someone in possession of an antique hand grenade she said this is important somehow a loose end needing to be tied its hard to disagree with the science behind someones death deb simons conclusions are sound perhaps but theres more here than his conclusions she said i dont disagree youre obviously finding alatea fairclough one of them i have havers on her in london by the way so you see as i said i dont disagree its simon im concerned about frankly so you do think he could be wrong hes far too preoccupied with you that sometimes blinds someone to whats right in front of them still and all i cant allow you no ones allowing anything dreadful choice of words i can see were going to go round and round if nothing else i do know you all right have a care will you do that much i will what about you there are a few loose ends on my end as well ill be doing some tying you will ring me if theres any reason at all wont you definitely inspector she rang off at that she glanced at zed benjamin to see if shed carried off the conversation without raising his suspicions but he was in the process of sinking down into his seat as best as he could he nodded in the direction of the soldiers home alatea fairclough and her companion were just making the turn into the car park deborah and zed remained where they were and in less than a minute the other woman came round the side of the building and went inside shortly thereafter alatea drove out of the car park heading off in a direction that suggested she was going to retrace her route to arnside this was well and good deborah thought it was time to see what she could get from this other woman she said to zed im off he said quarter of an hour and im ringing you on your mobile she said you can do that of course but do consider youre my ride back to milnthorpe so im hardly likely to jeopardise that zed grumbled a bit he said at the least he was getting out of the bloody car and having a stretch because two hours of waiting in virtually a doubledup position had taken their toll deborah said this was fine with her it was a good idea shed be in contact with him should he wander far while she was inside the soldiers home oh dont zed said worry your head on that score ill be close by deborah had little doubt about that hed lurk in the bushes if he could do so one ear pressed to a convenient window but she knew this was as close as she was going to get to a compromise with the man so she said shed be as quick as she could and she crossed the street inside the kenthowath foundation for disabled veterans she decided on a direct approach having very little other choice in the matter as she didnt possess police identification she approached a reception desk and worked upon her most pleasant smile she said to the receptionist an antique soldier himself by the look of him that shed just seen a woman come into the building rather tall brown hair tied back long skirt boots she was certain this woman was a schoolmate of her own elder sister and she would very much like to have a moment to speak with her she knew this was a silly request after all the woman might turn out to be a total stranger on the other hand if she was who deborah thought she was you mean lucy i expect the elderly man said he was wearing a military uniform it hung upon him like a bride to her husband on her wedding night his neck rose from its collar corrugated with flesh shes our social lady games and exercises and groups and the like going to the pageant at christmas that sort of thing lucy yes that was her name indeed deborah said is there any chance she cast a hopeful look at him always a chance for a pretty gel he said whered you get all that lovely hair eh grandmother on my fathers side deborah told him lucky you always had an eye for the ginger me he reached for a phone and punched in a number he said gorgeous woman out here asking for you darling and then he listened for a moment and added no someone new this is howd you get so popular eh he chuckled at something she apparently said rang off and told deborah that shed be right out deborah said confidentially this is terrible of me but i cant exactly recall her surname keverne he said lucy keverne thatd be what she was then and what she is now as shes not married doesnt even have a boyfriend i keep trying but she says im too young for her she does deborah poohpoohed this idea as was expected of her and went to wait on a wooden bench across from the receptionists desk she gave scattered thoughts to what on earth she was going to say to lucy keverne but she had little time to consider her approach it wasnt a minute later that the woman shed seen with alatea fairclough came out into reception she looked understandably a little puzzled as she no doubt would be deborah reckoned that entertaining sudden visitors at her place of employment wasnt a regular feature of her job up close to her deborah could see that she was younger than shed previously thought when viewing her from a distance her hair had grey strands wound through it but these were premature for her face was of a woman in her twenties she wore fashionable glasses that complemented her pleasant features she cocked her head at deborah and said how may i help you as she extended her hand lucy keverne is there a place we can talk deborah asked its rather a private matter lucy keverne frowned a private matter if youre here to discuss the placement of a relative im not the person you should speak to no its not that this rather relates to lancaster university deborah said it was a stab in the semidarkness the george childress centre into which she and alatea had gone providing the only bit of light it turned out to be a good stab who are you lucy sounded a bit alarmed who sent you is there somewhere we can go deborah said have you an office lucy keverne glanced at the receptionist as she considered the various options she finally said to deborah come with me then and she took her towards the rear of the building where a sunroom looked out into a garden which was unexpectedly large they didnt take seats in the sunroom however it was already occupied several elderly gents were nodding over newspapers and two others were playing cribbage in a corner lucy took her through the glass doors and out into the garden she said who gave you my name is that important deborah asked her im looking for some help i thought you might be it youre going to need to be more specific of course deborah said reproduction would be what im talking about ive been trying to conceive a baby for years now it turns out i have a condition that prevents gestation im sorry that must be very difficult for you but why would you think i could help you because you went into the george childress centre with another woman and i was there i followed you here once you left the campus hoping to speak to you lucys eyes narrowed as she evaluated this she would have to consider the potential for danger they were speaking in a form of code all of which was perfectly legal at the moment a few steps in the wrong direction however and they could be walking on the other side of the law of the land there were two of us lucy said not unwisely why follow me why not follow her i took a chance and did i look more fertile to you more at ease far less desperate after a few years one gets to know the look theres a hunger it transmits from one woman to another like a form of biological code i dont know how else to explain it if you havent experienced it you wouldnt recognise it i have so i do all right i can see thats possible but i dont know what you want from me the truth was what she wanted but deborah wasnt quite sure how to get at it she opted again for a form of her own truth im looking for a surrogate she said i think you can help me find one what sort of surrogate are there different sorts lucy considered deborah theyd been walking on one of the garden paths heading towards a large urn that marked one end of the garden but now lucy faced deborah and crossed her arms beneath her breasts she said youve not done much homework in this area have you clearly not well i suggest you do so there are egg donors sperm donors surrogacy involving the gestational mothers egg and donor sperm surrogacy involving gestational mothers egg and the natural fathers sperm surrogacy with the biological mothers egg and donor sperm surrogacy with the biological mothers egg and the natural fathers sperm if youre going to go down this route in one form or another you have to begin with an understanding of how it all works and she added all of the legalities relating to it deborah nodded hoping she looked thoughtful are you do you i mean im not sure how to ask this but which route do you generally take im an egg donor she said usually im harvested deborah shuddered at the term so impersonal so clinical so so agricultural but usually suggested that lucy keverne was open to other possibilities as well she said to her and when it comes to surrogacy ive never been a surrogate before before so with this woman you accompanied to the university lucy didnt reply at once she looked at deborah as if trying to read her she said im not prepared to talk about her this is a confidential matter im sure you understand of course i see deborah thought a bit of hand wringing would do at this point plus an expression of desperation which wasnt at all difficult for her to manufacture she said ive spoken to clinics of course what theyve told me is that im on my own when it comes to surrogacy i mean when it comes to finding a surrogate yes lucy said thats how it is theyve said a friend a sister a cousin even ones own mother but how does someone like me approach all this what do i do begin every conversation from now on with hullo would you consider carrying my baby for me and then quite surprisingly deborah did feel the desperation of her position exactly what she wished to project to lucy keverne she blinked hard feeling tears rise to her eyes she said im sorry forgive me and this apparently moved lucy keverne for she put her hand on deborahs arm and drew her in the direction of a bench near a pond on which a skin of autumn leaves was floating she said its a stupid law its supposed to prevent women from carrying babies for profit its supposed to protect women altogether of course its a law made by men i always find that rather ironic to tell you the truth men making laws for women as if they know the first thing about protecting us from anything when most of the time theyre the source of our problems in the first place may i ask deborah fished in her bag for a tissue you said that youre an egg donor but if you knew someone someone close to you someone in need if someone asked you would you hesitant woman in pursuit of help she thought no one else would be likely to ask this question directly of a total stranger lucy keverne didnt look wary but she hesitated clearly deborah thought they were getting close to whatever relationship she had with alatea fairclough it seemed to deborah that lucy herself had already named the possibilities alatea either needed her for her eggs or she needed her to be a surrogate if there was another possibility deborah couldnt see it surely they hadnt been together to pay a social call upon someone in the george childress centre at lancaster university lucy said as i said im an egg donor anything else is more than id take on youd never be a surrogate then hopeful hopeful presenting an earnest expression deborah thought im sorry no its just too close to the heart if you understand what i mean i dont think i could do it would you know anyone anyone i could speak to anyone who might consider lucy looked at the ground at her boots they were attractive boots deborah thought italian by the look of them not inexpensive lucy finally said you might want to look in conception magazine you mean surrogates advertise in it god no thats illegal but sometimes someone you might possibly track down a donor that way if a woman is willing to donate eggs she might be willing to do more or she could well know someone whod help you by carrying a baby yes it must be well extraordinarily expensive no more than having your own child aside from the in vitro part of it the surrogate herself can only ask you for reasonable expenses anything more than that is of course against the law so one has to find a woman of extraordinary compassion i daresay deborah said for her to be willing to put herself through that in the first place and then to hand the baby over it would take someone special it would yes thats what it amounts to lucy keverne stood then and offered deborah her hand to shake she said i hope ive been some help to you she had in some ways deborah thought but in other ways there were miles still to go nonetheless she stood and expressed her gratitude she knew more now than shed known before how it related to the death of ian cresswell even if it related was still unclear victoria london the name raul montenegro took barbara havers a few steps forward she got onto a photograph of the bloke along with an article written alas in spanish she followed a few links by means of this article and finally found herself looking at alatea vasquez y del torres she was quite a creation looking like a south american film star it was difficult to understand what she was doing in the photo on the arm of a bloke who resembled a toad warts and all this was raul montenegro he was a good eight inches shorter than alatea and an even better thirty years older he wore a frightening elvis presley rug and he had a growth on his nose the approximate size of portugal but he was grinning like a cat with the cream the canary and sixteen mice and barbara had a feeling his expression was all about possessing the woman on his arm of course barbara couldnt be sure of that and there was only one way to know for certain she printed the page in question and she dug her mobile out of her shoulder bag she rang azhar at university college london he would help her of course he told her when she had him on his mobile latching on to a spanish speaker would not be a problem at all barbara asked should she come to bloomsbury azhar said he would let her know it would take him some time to locate the person he had in mind who could do the translation she needed where was barbara in the bowels of the beast she told him ah he said youre at work then is it best if we come to you just the opposite barbara told him my life is safer if i do a runner then he would ring her as soon as possible knowing that their meeting would have to take place elsewhere azhar told her and then he said carefully i must apologise as well why barbara asked and then she remembered his morning altercation with angelina she said oh you mean the row well it happens doesnt it i mean two people living together one always wants to think love conquers all books and films and happilyeverafter with the love of ones life i dont know much in that department but what i do know tells me the everafters a road with potholes no matter who you are seems to me the way of the wise is to hold on to whats there even though its not always easy eh i mean what else is there at the end of the day but what we have with our fellows he was silent in the background barbara could hear the noise of crockery and raised conversation he must have taken her call in a cafeteria or a restaurant this made her think of food and the fact that she hadnt had any for hours he finally said i shall ring you back presently sounds good to me she told him and azhar hmm thanks for helping me out that he told her will always be my pleasure they rang off and barbara considered the likelihood of another runin with the superintendent if she went in search of food this would take her to the canteen if she had something relatively nutritious in mind otherwise there were vending machines or there was leaving the yard altogether and waiting somewhere for azhars return call there was also having a smoke which sounded bloody good to her at that point this meant slinking off surreptitiously and hoping not to get caught in the stairwell or it meant going outside decisions decisions barbara thought she decided to buck up and stay and see if there was anything more that she could dig up by plugging away at raul montenegro bryanbarrow cumbria tim decided to go to school without protest because kaveh was going to have to drive him it was the only way he was going to get kaveh alone and alone was where he wanted the bloke because there was no way the two of them were going to have the little talk they needed to have if gracie was there gracie was already upset enough she didnt need to hear that kaveh had future plans with a wife with parents and with bryan beck farm that involved the elimination of irritating impediments with the surname cresswell so he surprised kaveh by getting out of bed on time and getting himself organised to go to margaret fox school for terminal nutcases such as himself he helped gracie get ready by setting out all her breakfast choices and making her a tuna and sweet corn sandwich which he packed into a lunch bag along with an apple a packet of crisps and a banana she thanked him with a dignity that told him she was still grieving for bella so one of the things he did instead of eating his own breakfast was to go to the garden and dig the dolls coffin out of the soil so that he could stuff her into his rucksack and ultimately get her repaired in windermere he replaced the coffin and the soil and made it look the way gracie had left it after bellas funeral then he returned to the house in time to bolt down a piece of marmite toast before they had to leave he didnt say anything to kaveh while gracie was in the car instead he waited till theyd dropped her off at her c of e school in crosthwaite and were well on their way up the lyth valley at that point he leaned against the passenger door and studied the bloke what came into his head was the mental picture of kaveh taking it from his father and both of them sweating so that the dim light in the room shone slick on their skin only it wasnt a mental picture at all but really a memory because hed seen it all through a sliver of open doorway and hed been a witness to that moment of ecstasy and collapse with his dad calling out hoarsely oh god yes the whole sight had been sickening to tim filling him with loathing and hate and horror but it had touched something else as well had stirred in him something unexpected and the truth of the matter was that just for a moment the blood in him had rushed and heated so afterwards hed used a pocket knife to cut himself and hed poured vinegar on the wound to cleanse his hot and sinful blood but he could see how it had all come about and in the car he noted that kaveh was young and handsome a bent man like his dad would have fallen hard for that even as things were apparently turning out if kaveh wasnt so bent himself kaveh glanced at tim as they headed towards winster loathing after all was something one could feel in the air kaveh said rather uneasily its good youre going to school this morning tim your dad would be pleased my dad tim said is dead kaveh said nothing he shot another look at tim but the road was narrow and curved and he couldnt afford more than just that look which tim knew was an attempt to assess how he was feeling and what he was likely to do which makes things real good for you tim added what kaveh said dad being dead that makes things exceptionally good kaveh surprised him then they were coming up to a layby and he pulled into it and crushed the brake with his foot the morning traffic was heavy someone honked and gave kaveh two fingers but he either didnt notice or he didnt care what kaveh asked him are you talking about dad dead and good for you you mean yes thats exactly what i mean what are you talking about tim looked out of the window there was little enough to see next to the car was a drystone wall and the wall grew ferns like the plumes on ladies hats there were probably sheep somewhere behind that wall but he couldnt see them he could only see the rise of one of the fells in the distance and a wispy crown of cloud encircling its summit i asked you a question kaveh said answer it please i dont have to answer questions tim said not from you and not from anyone you do when you make an accusation kaveh told him and thats what youve done you can try to pretend you havent but thats not going to work so why dont you tell me what you mean why dont you keep driving because like you i dont have to tim had desired this confrontation but now he wasnt sure he really did want it after all there he was in an enclosed car with the man for whom his father had destroyed their entire family and wasnt there a sense of menace here wasnt the case that if kaveh mehran had been capable of walking into tims birthday party and laying down the bald facts like a hand of cards he was capable of pretty much anything no tim told himself he would not be afraid because if anyone was going to be afraid it was kaveh mehran liar cheat rotter and everything else he said so whens the wedding kaveh and whatre you planning to tell the bride s she going to be brought into the picture of what youve been up to in this part of the world or is that why youre getting rid of me and gracie i dont spose well be invited to the wedding guess thatd be a bit much gracied like to be a bridesmaid though kaveh said nothing tim had to credit him for thinking a bit instead of blurting out something like his plans being none of tims business he was probably madly going through responses since the one thing he didnt know was how tim had managed to winkle out the truth tim added did you give mum the news let me tell you thats not exactly going to make her day what surprised tim was what he was feeling as he spoke he didnt know what to call it it was filling him up inside and making him want to do something to make it go away but he couldnt name what the feeling was and he didnt want to he hated it when he felt something as a result of what other people did he hated that he reacted to things he wanted to be like a sheet of glass with everything rolling off him like rain and the fact that he wasnt that he hadnt managed it yet that there was no indication that hed ever manage it this knowledge was just as bad as feeling something in the first place it spoke of a kind of condemnation an eternal hell of being at the mercy of everyone else and no one being at the mercy of him you and gracie belong with your mother kaveh said choosing what was the easiest route for their conversation ive been happy to have you with me id continue to be happy to have you with me but but the wife might not be so happy about that tim sneered and with the parents as well i guess the place would start getting a little crowded wouldnt it man this worked out perfect for you didnt it like you even had it planned kaveh went perfectly still only his lips moved they formed words and the words were what exactly are you talking about there was something behind those words that was unexpected that sounded like anger but more than anger tim thought in that instant that danger was anger with a d in front of it and maybe thats where danger came from born out of anger and what people did when anger came upon them people like kaveh but he didnt care let the bloke do anything and what difference did it make hed already done his worst im talking tim said about the fact that youre getting married having decided i spose that taking it up the shoot from a bloke got you what youd wanted from the first and now that you have it youre ready to move on you reckoned the farm is a good enough payment for what you had to do to get it so you can bring on the wife and the kiddies now only of course theres the problem of me and what i might say in front of the wife and in front of the parents like what about you and blokes kaveh what about you and my dad whyd you change over to ladies then arsehole getting stretched out of shape or something you dont know what youre talking about kaveh said he glanced over his shoulder at the coming traffic he signaled his intention to rejoin the stream of cars im talking about you taking it from my dad tim said up the arse night after night you think some womans going to want to marry you if she knows what youve been up to kaveh night after night kaveh said his brow furrowing taking it from your dad what are you talking about tim he began to move the car to the edge of the layby tim reached over and killed the engine with a twist of the key you and my dad fucking each other tim said thats what im talking about kavehs jaw actually dropped fucking whats wrong with your head whatve you been thinking that your father and i kaveh made an adjustment to his seat as if with the intention of settling in for a proper natter with tim he went on your father was dear to me tim a close and dear friend i held him in the highest esteem and we loved each other as close friends do but that there might have been more than that that he and i were are you thinking we were homosexual lovers how could you have come to think that i had a room in his house only as his lodger you know that tim stared at the man his face was perfectly serious he was lying with such skill and such grace that for a moment tim could actually almost quite nearly be poised on the edge of believing that everyone including himself had been completely wrong about kaveh and about tims father and most of all about what theyd been to each other except tim had been there the night his father had declared his love for kaveh mehran in front of his wife and his children and tim had seen his father with kaveh so he knew the truth i watched you he said through the door didnt know that did you makes your situation a bit different doesnt it you up on your hands and knees and dad giving it to you in the arse and both of you liking it just fine i watched you okay i watched you kaveh looked away from him for a moment then he sighed tim thought he was going to say something along the lines of being caught out and tim needing to keep mum on the subject round kavehs family please but kaveh it seemed was full of surprises he brought out another for tims entertainment he said i used to have the same sort of dreams when i was your age theyre very real arent they theyre called waking dreams they generally happen at the moment your body is making the transition from waking to sleeping and they seem so real that one actually thinks whats happening in them is life itself people believe all sorts of things because of waking dreams theyve been abducted by aliens theyve seen someone in the bedroom with them theyve had a sexual experience with a parent or a teacher or even a mate and on and on but all the time theyre merely asleep as you were of course when you saw what you think you saw between your father and myself tims eyes widened he wet his lips to respond but kaveh went first the fact that what you dreamed you saw between us was sexual in nature comes from the age you are tim at fourteen a boy is all hormones and desire and this is due to how his bodys changing he has dreams of sex often often he ejaculates during them and this could be and probably is an embarrassment to him if no one has explained its perfectly normal your dad did explain this didnt he he ought to have done or perhaps your mum tims next breath felt like a stab not only in the lungs but in the brain and right to the centre of who he knew he was and not to the centre of whoever kaveh was making him out to be he said you fucking liar and to his horror he felt tears rising and god how he knew that kaveh would use them he could even see the endgame now how it would all play out no matter which way he turned or what he threatened or what indeed he said to anyone but especially what he said or might say to kavehs parents and his intended bride and there was no one else to tell those people the truth about kaveh no one would be motivated to do it and even if that were not the case kavehs relations would themselves not be the least motivated to believe what strangers reported to them without a shred of proof plus kaveh was the consummate liar wasnt he he was the consummate con man and the consummate player in the chess game of life tim could speak the truth he could rant he could rail kaveh would know how to twist his words you must excuse young tim kaveh would declare solemnly you must not worry what he says and does he goes to a special school you know for children who are disturbed in one way or another there are times when he makes claims when he does things he ripped his little sisters favourite doll to pieces for example and just the other day or week or month or whatever i found him trying to kill the ducks in the village stream and people would believe him of course first because people always believed what they wanted and needed to believe second because every bloody word he said would be the truth it was as if kaveh had planned his whole game from the first the very moment he locked eyes on tims dad tim reached for the handle of the door he grabbed up his rucksack and jerked the door open what are you doing kaveh demanded stay in the car youre going to school and youre going to hell tim said he leaped out and slammed the car door behind him victoria london raul montenegro certainly wasnt a dead end barbara havers concluded an hour or more of following various links connected to his name could easily have gleaned her half a ream of paper eaten up with printing stories about the bloke so she tried to be selective it was all in spanish but there were enough words similar to english for barbara to be able to make out that montenegro was a very big nob in industry and the industry in which he operated had something to do with natural gas in mexico from this she concluded that somehow alatea fairclough nee alatea vasquez y del torres had got herself from argentina to mexico for reasons that remained unclear she had moved herself either from a town still unknown to barbara or what was more likely considering the reaction of the woman to whom barbara had attempted to speak in argentina shed disappeared from santa maria de la cruz de los angeles y de los santos there perhaps she had lived as a member of the mayors extended family as a niece or a cousin or equally perhaps and probably more likely she had been married to one of his five sons at least that would explain all the excited quiens and dondes barbara had heard on the other end of the line when shed managed to get someone within the mayors house to speak to her had alatea done a runner from her marriage to one of the sons of the mayor that son of the mayor might well like to know where shed ended up especially barbara thought if he and alatea were still legally married all this was supposition of course she needed azhar to get back to her with someone who could translate spanish and so far shed heard not a word from him so she kept struggling and following leads and vowing to take a tutorial from winston nkata on the use and abuse of the world wide web she also learned that raul montenegro was rolling in barrels of lolly she got this from an online edition of hola that journalistic mother ship from which hello had been launched the two magazines were identical in their dedication to glossy photographs of celebrities of all ilks all of whom possessed the kind of white teeth one needed to don sunglasses to gaze upon all of whom dressed in designer gear and posed either at their own palatial estates or if they lived too modestly for the magazines readers at expensive period hotels the only difference was in the subjects of the stories since with the exception of film actors or members of various and sometimes obscure european royal families hola generally appeared to feature individuals from spanishspeaking countries spain itself being the most frequently used but mexico had been included more than once and there was raul montenegro with his frightening nose showing off his estate which appeared to be somewhere along the coast of mexico where there were many palm trees lots of other colourful vegetation and a host of nubile girls and boys willing to lounge at his poolside there was also a shiny photo of montenegro at the helm of his yacht with various members of his youthful male crew striking crewlike poses around him in their very tight white trousers and equally tight blue teeshirts what barbara gathered from all this was that raul montenegro liked to be surrounded by youth and beauty since both at his home and on his yacht there was no one who wasnt occupying a place somewhere on the scale between beautiful and lightningstruck gorgeous where she wondered as she looked at the pictures did these amazinglooking people come from she reckoned one never saw so many tan lithe supple and scrumptious human beings in one place outside of a casting call which of course made her wonder if all these individuals were indeed auditioning for something if they were she also reckoned she knew what that something was money always had a way of singing a siren song didnt it and if nothing else raul montenegro appeared to be swimming in money what was interesting though was that alatea fairclough nee all the rest of her names did not appear in any of the hola pictures barbara compared the dates on the magazine with the date on the article shed found with the photo of alatea hanging on to montenegros arm the hola photos predated the other and barbara wondered if montenegro had changed his stripes once he had alatea on his arm alatea had the kind of looks that allowed a woman to lay down the law you want me get rid of the others otherwise believe me i can easily move on which brought barbara back to the situation in santa maria de la cruz de los angeles y de los santos whatever that situation might be she had to find out so she printed out the hola article and went back to mayor esteban vega y de vasquez of santa maria di and all the rest of it tell me your tales senor she thought at this point pretty much anything would do lake windermere cumbria ive pulled barbara havers from your am i to call this your case or what thomas lynley had veered to the side of the road to take the call on his mobile he was on his way back to ireleth hall to go over st jamess conclusions with bernard fairclough he said isabelle on a sigh youre angry with me with very good reason im terribly sorry yes well arent we both barbaras brought winston into things by the way is that down to you as well i put a stop to it but i wasnt happy to find them cheektocheek over a computer terminal on the twelfth floor lynley lowered his head looked at his hand on the steering wheel of the healey elliott he was still wearing his wedding ring and had not been able in the months since helens death even to think about removing it it was a plain gold band engraved inside her initials and his and the date of their marriage more than anything on earth he wanted her back that desire would continue to govern every decision he made until he was able finally and forever to let her go by embracing the fact of her death instead of struggling with its grim reality day after day even when he was with isabelle helen was there both the spirit of her and the delightful essence of who she had been this was no ones fault least of all isabelles it was simply ineluctably how things were he said no i didnt ask winstons help but please isabelle dont blame barbara for this shes only been trying to track down some information for me on this matter in cumbria on this matter in cumbria id thought as she had time off coming yes i do see what you thought tommy he knew isabelle was both wounded and hating the fact that she was wounded when people felt like that they needed to wound in turn and he recognised that as well as understood it but all of this was unnecessary at the moment and he wanted perhaps futilely to make her see that he said none of this was meant as a betrayal and what makes you think im seeing it that way because in your position id see it that way myself youre the guv im not i have no right to make requests of members of your team had there been any other way that i could have got the information quickly believe me i would have used it but there was another way and thats what concerns me that you didnt see that other way and that you apparently still dont see it you mean that i could have come to you but i couldnt isabelle i had no choice in the matter once hillier gave the order i was on the case and no one was to know about it no one youre thinking of barbara but i didnt tell her she worked it out because it came down to bernard fairclough and things i needed to know about him things in london and not in cumbria as soon as she looked into him for me she put it together tell me what would you have done in my position id like to think i would have trusted you because were lovers essentially i suppose thats it but it cant be he said isabelle think about things ive done little else and thats a real problem as you can imagine i can i do he knew what she meant but he wanted to forestall her although he could not have said exactly why he thought it had something to do with the vast emptiness of his life without helen and how ultimately as social creatures mankind did not do well in isolation but he knew this might be the crassest form of selfdelusion dangerous both to himself and to isabelle still he said there has to be a separation doesnt there there must be a surgical cut if you will between what we do for the met and who we are when were alone together if you go forward in this job as superintendent there are going to be moments when youre put in a position of knowledge by hillier or by someone else that you cant share with me id share them anyway you wouldnt isabelle you wont did you did i what dyou mean i mean helen tommy did you share information with helen how could he possibly explain it he wondered he hadnt had to share information with helen because helen had always known shed come to him in the bath and pour a bit of oil on her hands and work on his shoulders and murmur ah david hillier again hmm really tommy i tend to think that never has knighthood caused such inflation in a mans selfesteem he might then talk or he might not but the point was it didnt matter to helen what he said was a matter of indifference to her who he was was everything he hated missing her most of all he could bear the fact that hed been the one to decide upon when her life such as it had been at that point maintained by hospital machinery would end he could bear that shed carried their child with her into the grave he was coming to terms with the horror of her deaths being a senseless street murder that had come from nothing and resulted in nothing but the hole that losing her had created within him he hated it so much that there were moments when its presence brought him perilously close to hating her isabelle said what am i to make of your silence he said nothing nothing at all just thinking and the answer hed honestly forgotten the question to helen she said i wish there were one he replied god knows id give it if i knew where to find it she altered then on the edge of a coin in that way of hers that somehow kept him unbalanced with her but still bound to her she said quietly god forgive me tommy im devastating you you dont need that im ringing you when im meant to be doing other things anyway this isnt the time for this conversation i was upset about winston and thats not down to you well speak later yes he said have you any idea when youll be back that was he thought wryly the question in a nutshell he looked out of the window he was on the a in a heavily wooded area where the trees seemed to grow thickly right down to the shore of lake windermere a few last leaves still stubbornly clung to the maples and the birches here but another good storm would finish them off he said soon i expect tomorrow perhaps the day after ive had simon with me and hes finished his part with the forensics deborahs still onto something though ill need to be here to see that part through im not sure it relates but shes being stubborn and i cant let her stay here alone in case things go badly in some way she was quiet for a moment and he waited for her to make one of two choices dictated by his mention of simon and deborah when she made it he wanted to think it had been effortless for her but he knew how unlikely this was she said its good theyve been able to help you tommy it is he said well speak when you return we will they rang off then and he spent a moment in the layby looking at nothing there were facts and feelings that had to be sorted out and he knew he would have to get to them but for the moment there was cumbria along with what needed to be sorted out here he drove the rest of the distance to ireleth hall and found the gates standing open when he reached the hall he saw that a car was parked in front of it he recognised this as one of the two vehicles hed seen in great urswick faircloughs daughter manette would be here then shed not come alone he discovered she had her former husband with her and lynley found them with manettes parents in the great hall in the aftermath of what apparently had been a visit from nicholas when lynley and fairclough exchanged a look valerie was the one to speak im afraid we havent been entirely truthful with you inspector she said and its looking more and more like this is the moment for truth lynley looked at fairclough again fairclough looked away lynley knew hed been used for some reason unspoken at the moment and at this he felt the inner burning that comes from the most useless sort of anger he said if youd care to explain to valerie of course im the reason youve been brought up to cumbria inspector no one knew this except bernard and now manette freddie and nicholas know it for an utterly mad moment lynley thought the woman was actually confessing to murdering her husbands nephew the setting after all was perfect for it in the best tradition of more than one hundred years of teainthevicarage and murderinthelibrary paperback novels sold in railway stations he couldnt imagine why she might be confessing but hed also never been able to understand why the characters in those novels sat quietly in the drawing room or the sitting room or the library while a detective laid out all the clues leading to the guilt of one of them no one ever demanded a solicitor in the midst of the detectives maundering hed never been able to sort that one out valerie clarified quickly probably in answer to the confusion on his face it was simple enough she and not her husband had been the one who wanted to have the death of ian cresswell more closely looked into that lynley thought explained a great deal particularly when he considered what theyd uncovered about faircloughs private life but it did not go the entire distance why still hung out there waiting for an answer why valerie and not bernard was foremost why at all was next since a conclusion of murder most likely would have meant that a member of her own family was culpable lynley said i see im not sure it matters entirely he went on to explain the results of his examination of everything connected to the death in the boathouse everything he had looked at and everything looked at by simon st james was in agreement with the coroners conclusion a tragic accident had taken ian cresswells life it could have happened to anyone using the boathouse the docks stones were ancient some were loose those that had been dislodged had not been tampered with had cresswell been getting out of a different sort of boat he might have merely stumbled but getting out of a scull was trickier the combination of its delicate balance and the docks loose stones had done him in hed pitched forward hit his head gone into the water and drowned no foul play had been involved in these circumstances lynley thought one would expect a general sigh of relief to go around the room one would expect something along the lines of thank goodness from valerie fairclough but what came next was a long tense silence in which he finally realised that something more than ian cresswells death had been the real reason for the investigation and into this silence the front door opened and mignon fairclough came into the hall she pushed her zimmer frame in front of her she said freddie can you manage the door darling its a bit awkward for me and as freddie mcghie rose to do so valerie cut in with a sharp i expect you can cope quite well on your own mignon mignon tilted her head and managed an arch look at her mother she said very well then and made something of a minor production out of turning herself and her zimmer and dealing with the door she said there then when it was closed and shed turned back to them such an excitement of comings and goings today my darlings manette and freddie a deux my heart flutters with all the possibilities attendant on that then nick roars up then nick roars away and now our handsome scotland yard detective is back among us pitterpattering our collective hearts forgive the idle curiosity mother and dad but i couldnt bear to be outside looking in another moment with everything thats going on round here its just as well valerie said to her were discussing the future whose may i ask everyones including yours ive just learned today that for quite some time youve had something of pay rise in your monthly stipend thats at an end as is the entire allowance mignon looked startled clearly this was a turn of events she hadnt anticipated mother darling well obviously im disabled i can hardly go out like this and expect to become gainfully employed so you cant but thats where youre wrong mignon i can and i do mignon looked round apparently for the source of this sudden alteration to her circumstances she settled her gaze on manette her eyes narrowed and she said you little bitch i wouldnt have thought you had it in you i say mignon freddie declared i expect you do mignon replied to him what else will you say when we begin to talk about her and ian freddie there is no me and ian and you know it manette cut in theres a shoe box crammed with letters darling some of them burned but the rest in very good condition i can easily fetch them believe me ive been waiting years to do so i had an adolescent infatuation with ian make more of it if you like it wont get you far not even the bits about wanting you more than ill ever want anyone and darling ian please be my first oh please manette said in disgust i could go on you know ive endless bits memorised and none of us want to hear them valerie snapped enough has been said were finished here not nearly as finished as you think mignon made her way to the sofa on which her sister and freddie mcghie were sitting she said if you dont mind darling freddie and began to lower herself he had no choice but to have her in his lap or to move he opted for the second and joined his former fatherinlaw at the fireplace lynley could see everyone regrouping mentally all of them seemed to know something was coming although he reckoned that no one knew what it was mignon had obviously been gathering information for years on the members of her family shed not had to use it in the past but now she seemed to be preparing to do so she cast one look at her sister and another at her father she kept her eyes on him and with a smile said you know i dont think things are going to change quite so much mother and neither does dad i daresay valerie took this on board easily enough she said vivienne tullys payments are being stopped as well if thats what youre getting at and it is what youre getting at isnt it mignon youve been holding vivienne tully over your fathers head for years i expect no wonder so much moneys gone out to you and this is turntheothercheek time mignon asked her mother is that where we are where you are with him where i am as you put it with your father is none of your business no ones marriage is your business so let me make sure i understand mignon said he carries on with vivienne tully in london he buys her flat he has a bloody second life there with her and im to pay because i had the common decency not to tell you about it please dont paint yourself as the noble character in this situation valerie said here here murmured freddie valerie continued you know very well why you didnt tell me about it the information was useful and youre a common blackmailer you ought to get down on your very capable knees and thank god im not asking the inspector to arrest you beyond that everything about vivienne tully is a matter between your father and me it doesnt concern you she doesnt concern you the only thing that ought to concern you is what you intend to do with your life because its beginning tomorrow morning and i expect it to look very different from how it looks just now mignon then turned to her father she was in that moment every inch the woman holding all the valuable cards in the deck she said to fairclough is that how you want it to be then mignon he murmured youve got to say nows the moment dad dont take this further bernard said to her its not necessary mignon im afraid it is valerie bernard appealed to his wife he was lynley thought a man who was watching his life as hed known it come tumbling down i think all points have been touched upon if we can agree upon upon what valerie broke in sharply upon showing a modicum of mercy here that terrible fall all those years ago launchy gill shes not been well shes never been the same you know shes not capable of supporting herself shes as capable as i am manette put in shes as capable as anyone in this room honestly dad mums right for gods sake its time to put an end to this nonsense that has to be the most expensive fractured skull in history considering how mignons played it valerie however was watching her husband lynley could see that sweat had appeared on faircloughs forehead his wife apparently saw this as well because she turned to mignon and said quietly lets have the rest then dad mignon said for gods sake valerie give her what she wants i will not she said i absolutely will not then its time we had a chat about bianca mignon declared her father shut his eyes whos bianca manette demanded our baby sister as it happens mignon replied she turned to her father care to talk about this dad arnside cumbria when lucy keverne phoned her alatea fairclough was alarmed their arrangement was that lucy would never phone either alateas mobile or the land line at arnside house lucy had the numbers of course because giving her the numbers had been one of the ways in which alatea had made a stab at legitimatising that which could never be legitimate between them but shed impressed upon her from the first that ringing the number could bring an end to everything and neither of them wanted that what shall i do in case of an emergency lucy had asked not unreasonably then of course you must phone but youll understand i hope if at the moment i cant speak to you well need some sort of code for that for what for your not being able to speak at the moment you cant just say im not able to speak to you now if your husbands in the room that would be rather obvious wouldnt it of course yes alatea had thought about it i shall say no im sorry ive sent for no package and then ill ring you back as soon as im able but it might not be at once it might not be until the next day theyd agreed to this arrangement and as things developed between them lucy had had no reason to phone because of this all the uneasiness alatea naturally felt in embarking upon a confidential journey with this woman had faded over time so when lucy rang not terribly long after their rendezvous in lancaster alatea knew that something had gone wrong how badly wrong became clear within moments theyd been seen at the university together lucy told her theyd been seen inside the george childress centre it was probably nothing but a woman had followed them from the university back to the disabled soldiers home she wanted to talk about surrogacy she was looking for a surrogate mother to carry her child again it could be nothing but the fact that this woman had settled on lucy to talk to instead of alatea she claimed you have the look lucy said she claimed it was a look she recognised well because she knows she has it herself and because of this she reckoned i was the one to talk to about the possibility of surrogacy and not you alatea alatea had taken the call in the inglenook of the main hall it was a sheltered place topped by a whimsical minstrels gallery and she liked it because it gave her a choice between the lshaped window seat at one end of the inglenook looking out on the lawn or the confines of a pewlike shelter at the other side of the fireplace one that hid her from anyone who might come into the hall she was alone shed been leafing through a design book relevant to the restoration of arnside house but shed been thinking not of the house but rather of the progress she and lucy were making shed been considering how each step of the process was going to be successfully managed very soon now shed decided miss lucy keverne a struggling playwright from lancaster who made ends meet by working as a social director in the kenthowath foundation for disabled veterans would come into her life as a newfound friend from that point forward things would be easier they would never be perfect but that was of no account one had to learn how to live with imperfection when lucy mentioned the woman whod followed them alatea knew at once who this woman had to be she thus put the pieces together very quickly and she arrived at the only possible conclusion she herself had been followed from arnside and the redhaired woman called deborah st james she of the faux documentary film had done the following alateas earlier fears had revolved around the newspaper reporter shed seen the source and she knew its appetite for scandal was insatiable the mans first visit to cumbria had been an ordeal for her his second a torment but the worst his presence had ever suggested was a photograph that might lead to discovery with the redhaired woman discovery was here just a knockonthedoor away what did you tell her alatea asked as calmly as she could manage the truth about surrogacy but she already knew most of it which truth are we talking about the various ways and means the legalities that sort of thing id thought at first there was nothing in it it rather made sense in a bizarre sort of way i mean when women are desperate lucy hesitated alatea said quietly go on when theyre desperate well they will go to extremes wont they so considering everything how extreme was it really that a woman whos gone to the george childress centre for a consultation would see us at some point in one corridor or another perhaps as shes coming out of someones office and what and think there was a chance i mean essentially thats how you and i met no we met via an advertisement yes of course but the feeling is what im talking about that sense of desperation which was what she described so i believed her at first at first then what well thats why ive rung you when she left i walked with her to the front of the building the way one does you know she headed up the street and i thought nothing of it but i walked to a window along the corridor and happened to see quite by chance that shed reversed directions i thought she intended to come back for another word but she passed altogether and got into a car some way down the street perhaps shed forgotten where shed parked alatea said although she reckoned there was more to come something that had further intrigued lucy and so there was thats what i thought at first but when she got to the proper car it turned out that she hadnt come alone i couldnt see who was with her but when she reached the car the door swung open as if someone had pushed it from inside so i continued to watch till the car drove by she wasnt driving it was a man that made it all suspicious you see i mean if she had her husband with her why not come to talk to me together why not mention him indeed why not say he was waiting in the car why not say he was in agreement with her in the matter or he was against her in the matter or he was anything at all but she said nothing so on top of her story of having stumbled upon us the fact that there was a man what did he look like lucy i didnt get a good look merely a quick glimpse but i thought it best to ring you because well you know were on very thin ice as things stand and i can pay more thats not why im ringing good heavens thats all been agreed to im not about to squeeze more money out of you of course moneys always nice isnt it but weve agreed on a sum and im not the sort to go back on my word still i wanted you to know we must get on with it then and soon we must well thats just the thing you see im suggesting we slow things down a bit i think we need to make sure this woman whoever she is is completely out of the picture perhaps then in a month or two no weve made our arrangements we cant i think we should alatea i think we must look at it this way once we know it was just a oneoff this woman turning up a strange coincidence meaning nothing then well move forward im at bigger risk than you after all alatea felt numb someone straitened on all sides with those sides pressing in till she reached the point when shed no longer be able even to breathe unconstricted she said im in your power of course alatea my dear this isnt about power this is about safety yours and mine this is about dancing round the law i daresay this is also about a number of other things as well but weve no need to touch on those what sort of things alatea demanded nothing nothing its just a turn of phrase listen i must get back to work well speak in a few days till then youre not to worry all right im still on board just not at this precise moment not till we know for certain that this womans appearance in my life meant nothing how will we know that as i said well know it if i dont see her again lucy keverne rang off then amid urgings and murmurings that alatea was not to worry was to remain calm was to have a care she lucy would be in touch they would be in touch everything would go according to plan alatea sat in the inglenook for several minutes trying to understand what her options were or whether at this point she had any options left shed known from the first that the redhaired woman had spelled danger no matter what nicholas had said about her now that lucy had seen her in the presence of a man alatea finally saw what the danger was certain people had no right to live as they wished to live and shed had the misfortune of having been born as one of those wretched people she had great beauty but it meant nothing it was indeed what had doomed her from the first at the far end of the house she heard a door slam she frowned rose quickly and looked at her watch nicky should have gone to work from there he should have gone to the pele project but when he called her name and sounded panicked in the calling of it she knew hed gone elsewhere she hurried to find him she called out here nicky im here they met in the long oaken corridor where the light was dimmest she couldnt read his face but his voice frightened her so intense was it its down to me he said ive ruined everything allie alatea thought of the previous day nicholass distress and the fact that scotland yard was in cumbria looking into the circumstances of ian cresswells death for a terrible moment her conclusion was that her husband was confessing to his cousins murder and she felt lightheaded as she was struck with the knowledge of where this terrible admission could take them should they not be able to hide the truth if terror had a presence it was there in the darkened corridor with them she took her husbands arm and said nicky please you must tell me very clearly whats wrong then we can decide what to do i dont think i can why whats happened what can be so terrible he leaned against the wall she held on to his arm and she said to him is it this scotland yard matter have you been to speak to your father does he actually think none of that matters nicholas said were surrounded by liars you and i my mother my father probably my sisters that damn reporter from the source that filmmaking woman only i didnt see it because i was so intent on proving myself he spat the penultimate word ego ego ego he said and with each repetition he hit his forehead with his fist all i cared about was proving to everyone but especially to them that im not the person they used to know the drugs are gone the alcohol is gone and theyre gone forever and they were meant to see that not only my family but the whole bloody world so i took every opportunity to show myself off and because of that and nothing else were where we are just now his mention of the filmmaking woman sent fear coursing down alateas spine more and more everything was coming down to that woman whom they had blindly admitted into their home with her camera her questions and her apocryphal concern from the first alatea had known there was something very wrong about her presence and now shed been to lancaster to see lucy keverne so quick she was to follow the clues alatea wouldnt have thought it was possible she said where are we then just now nicky he told her and she tried to follow he spoke of the reporter from the source and of that mans belief that the redhaired woman had come from new scotland yard he spoke of his parents and a confrontation hed had with them that day over this very matter in the presence of his sister manette and freddie mcghie he spoke of his mother and her admission to having brought scotland yard into the mix and he spoke of the surprise of all of them when he railed about the detective whod been sent into his house the woman whod upset alatea so very much and that was where he stopped alatea said carefully what then nicky did they say something did something more occur his words sounded hollow shes not the scotland yard detective at all i dont know who she is but because shes been hired to come up to cumbria to take those photographs oh she claimed she needed none of you that you werent going to be part of that bloody film but someone had to hire her because there is no filmmaker and shes not scotland yard and do you see why its down to me now allie whats going to happen is down to me i thought it was bad enough that my parents wanted a detective to investigate ians death because of me but then to know that nothing thats happened here in this house with that woman has anything to do with ians death but rather has happened because i agreed because of my ego because a stupid story in a stupid magazine gave someone a licence a clue a way in she knew then where this was heading she supposed shed known where it had been heading all along she murmured the name montenegro you think she was hired by raul who the hell else could it possibly be and i did this to you allie how am i supposed to live with that he pushed past her he made his way along the corridor and into the drawing room there she could see him more clearly in what remained of the daylight he looked ghastly and for a completely mad moment she felt herself responsible for this although he and not she had been the one to allow the putative documentary scout into their lives but she couldnt help herself it was the role she played in their relationship just as his role was to need her so desperately that from the first he had questioned nothing about her as long as hed been assured of her love which was what she herself had been looking for a place of permanence where she could abide where no one would ask the kind of dangerous questions that grew from a moments wonder outside alatea could see that the afternoon was bringing on midautumns dusk the sky and the bay beneath were identical in colour with grey clouds encroaching on apricot streaks cast across both water and air by the setting sun nicholas went to the bay window he sank into one of the two seats there and he dropped his head into his hands ive failed you he said ive failed myself alatea wanted to shake her husband she wanted to tell him that this was not the time for him to feel himself the sun round which all the brewing troubles revolved she wanted to shout that he could not possibly begin to understand how bad things were about to become for both of them but to do any of that was to waste what little ability she had left to come up with a way to forestall an inevitable conclusion of which he was still entirely ignorant nicholas thought that raul montenegros reintroduction into her life meant the end of things he could not possibly have known the truth of the matter raul montenegro was only the beginning bloomsbury london barbara took herself to bloomsbury in order to be in his vicinity when she finally heard from taymullah azhar faced with her need to get more information on the topic of raul montenegro not to mention sorting out everything that there was to sort out about santa maria de la cruz de los angeles y de los santos she reckoned an internet cafe was in order shed kill two birds while she waited for azhar to produce a spanish translator for her before nkata had left the mets library hed said softly look for key words and follow the trail its not brain surgery barb youll get better as you go on from this barbara reckoned that she was to do searches on the names she came across in the articles she had regardless of what language the articles were in when she found an internet cafe not far from the british museum then that was what she did it was not the most pleasant environment in which to conduct her web search she had stopped to purchase an englishspanish dictionary on the way to the spot and now she was sandwiched between an overweight asthmatic in a mohair sweater and a gumpopping goth with a septum ring and a score of eyebrow studs who kept receiving calls on her mobile phone from someone who apparently did not believe she was sitting at a computer because each time he rang she barked well then come to the bloody place if you dont believe me clive dont be so bloody stoopid im not fucking emailing anyone i cant can i since you keep bloody ringing me every thirty seconds in this atmosphere barbara tried to concentrate she also tried to ignore the fact that the mouse looked like it hadnt been disinfected since the day it had come out of its box as best she could she attempted to type without actually touching the keys hitting them only with her fingernails although these were mostly too short to make a proper job of it but she reckoned the keyboard was crawling with everything from the bubonic plague to genital warts and she didnt intend to leave the place with her future writ large in the clutches of some disease after a few false trails she was able to find an article on the mayor of santa maria et cetera that included a picture it looked like an anniversary photograph perhaps a graduation picture but in any case it was something having to do with the nuclear family because they were all spread out on the steps of an unidentifiable building the mayor his wife and their five sons barbara examined this picture one fact was obvious immediately with or without a translation in the roll of the genetic dice the five sons of esteban and dominga had hit the jackpot barbara read their names carlos miguel angel santiago and diego they were a handsome lot ranging in the photo from nineteen years old down to seven years old but a scrutiny of the article told barbara that the picture had been taken twenty years earlier so any of them could easily have been married at this point perhaps one of them to alatea the next step according to nkatas explanation of how these things worked would be to check on the five sons carlos would be first all barbara had to do was cross her fingers no luck though as far as any marriage went she found carlos far more easily than she would have thought possible but he appeared to be a catholic priest there was an article that seemed to be about his ordination and the entire family posed with him again this time on the steps of a church his mother was clinging to his arm gazing up at him adoringly his father was grinning a cigar clutched in his hand his brothers were looking vaguely embarrassed at all the attendant religious hoopla so much for carlos barbara thought she went on to miguel again it didnt take long indeed it was so easy that barbara wondered why she hadnt been checking up on her neighbours for years in the case of miguel she found his engagement picture the wifetobe looked vaguely like an afghan hound all hair and thin face with a suspicious lack of forehead suggesting a paucity of marbles in the prefrontal lobe miguel himself was a dentist barbara decided either that or he was in need of dental work her spanish dictionary was a little iffy on the topic but at any rate it didnt seem to matter it took her no step closer to discovering anything about alatea fairclough she was about to go on to angel when her mobile chimed out the first two lines of peggy sue she flipped it open said havers and heard azhar at long last telling her that he had found someone who could translate spanish for her where are you at present he asked internet caff she told him im down the street from the bm i cn come to you easier than anything cafeteria near your office or something he was silent for a moment perhaps thinking about this at last he said there was a wine bar in torrington place near chenies mews and gower street they would meet her there in a quarter of an hour right she said ill find it she printed the documents shed so far found and went to the till where the shop assistant named an exorbitant price for them and said colour printer luv when barbara protested colour robbery more like it barbara said she took her copies in a paper bag and made it over to torrington place where the wine bar was easy to spot and azhar was waiting inside with a leggy girl in a cashmere jacket upon whose shoulders spilled a luxury of dark curls her name was engracia no last name provided and she was a graduate student from barcelona the girl smiled at azhar as he passed this information to barbara i will do what i can to help you she said although barbara reckoned it was azhar to whom she wished to be useful and who could blame her they made a nicelooking couple but then so did azhar and angelina upman so would azhar and pretty much anyone she said ta to the girl in my next life i plan to be multilingual i shall leave you to it then azhar said heading back barbara asked him heading home he replied engracia my thanks de nada she murmured at one of the tables inside the wine bar barbara handed over the documents beginning with the article that accompanied the photograph of the mayor and his family she said i got a spanishenglish dictionary but it wasnt much help i mean it was a bit but looking up every word of course engracia read for a moment holding the article in one hand while she played with a gold hoop earring with the other after a moment she said this is connected to an election for mayor si the man esteban he runs for mayor of the town and this article introduces him to people its an article without import how do you call this a puff piece she smiled she had very nice teeth and very smooth skin she wore lipstick but it was barely noticeable so perfectly had it been chosen yes a puff piece she replied it says in the town there is such a large family of the mayor that if his family members all vote he will win the election but that i believe is a joke because it also says the towns population is seventyfive thousand people engracia read a bit further and said there is information about his wife dominga and about her family both families have lived in santa maria de la cruz de los angeles y de los santos for many years many generations what about the boys the boys ah carlos is a seminarian miguel wishes to be a dentist angel she pronounced it ahnhail plans to study architecture and the other two boys are too young to know although santiago says he wants to be an actor and diego she read further and chuckled it says he wishes to be an astronaut in the unlikely event that argentina develops a space programme that is a little joke i think the reporter was humouring him there wasnt a lot of grist in all that barbara reckoned she brought out the next pieces both of them about raul montenegro she handed them over with what about these and she asked engracia if she wanted a glass of wine or something since they were taking up space in the wine bar which wasnt going to turn out to be a popular move if they didnt place an order engracia said mineral water would be nice and barbara fetched it for her along with a glass of the house plonk for herself when she returned with the drinks she saw that engracia was concentrating on the article whose accompanying photo had alatea hanging on montenegros arm this she said was an article about a very important fundraiser in mexico city having to do with the construction of a symphony music hall the man was the biggest contributor to this project and consequently would have the honour of naming the music hall and barbara said expecting the hall to be named for alatea since she was looking so pleased as she hung on his arm magdalena montenegro centre for music engracia said named for his mama latin men are close to their mothers as a rule what about the woman with him in the picture it says only that she is his companion not his wife lover partner only his companion im afraid could be a euphemism for lover or partner engracia studied the photo a moment this is difficult to say but i do not think so so she could have been merely his evenings companion even an escort he hired for the night it is possible engracia said she could even be someone who stepped into the picture with him at the moment i suppose damn damn damn barbara muttered and when engracia looked remorseful as if shed somehow failed barbara said oh sorry not you just life i see this is important to you can i help in some other way engracia asked barbara thought about this there was something else she calculated the time difference and said let me make a phone call and she took out her mobile they dont speak english at the other end so if you cn talk to whoever answers she explained to engracia that they were phoning the mayors home in santa maria et cetera the fourhour time difference made it early afternoon there her job was to see if there was information to be had about one alatea vasquez y del torres should someone answer the phone the woman in the picture engracia said with a nod at the article about raul montenegro that would be the case barbara told her when the call went through and the phone began ringing she handed the mobile over to the spanish girl what happened next was rapidfire spanish during which barbara caught only alateas name coming from argentina though she could hear the sound of a womans voice it was high and excited and she could see from engracias intent expression that something was developing from this call to santa maria de la cruz de los angeles y de los santos there was a pause in the dialogue and engracia glanced at barbara she said that was a cousin elena maria do we have the wrong number then no no shes at the house visiting dominga the mayors wife this is her aunt shes gone to fetch her shes most excited to hear alateas name pay dirt barbara murmured this is sorry just an expression we might be getting somewhere she smiled ah pay dirt i like this very much then her expression altered as a distant voice bridged the thousands of miles between london and argentina the rapidfire spanish began again there were many comprendos and many more sis a few sabes and several no sabos and then gracias over and over again when the call was completed barbara said well yes whatve we got a message for alatea engracia said this woman dominga says to tell alatea she must come home she says to tell her that her father understands she says the boys also understand carlos she says has made all of the family pray and what they pray for is for her safe return did she happen to mention who the hell she is a member of the family it seems a sister who didnt get in that old picture a sister born after the picture was taken a wife of one of the boys a cousin a niece what she did not say at least not clearly but she told me the girl ran from her home when she was fifteen they thought she went to buenos aires and they search for her there for many years particularly elena maria searches dominga said elena marias heart was broken and alatea must be told that as well how many years are we talking about that shes been gone then alatea thirteen engracia said and she ended up in cumbria barbara murmured by what route and how the hell shed been speaking to herself but engracia replied reaching for one of the copied articles shed already looked at barbara saw it was the piece on raul montenegro engracia said perhaps this man helped her if he has enough money to pay for a symphony music hall he has more than enough to purchase a ticket to london for a beautiful woman no or a ticket to any place else indeed to any place she might like to go lake windermere cumbria they were like a tableau for thirty seconds or so although the thirty seconds seemed much longer during this period mignon directed her gaze from one person to another and her face blazed with a triumph that shed obviously been waiting years to feel manette felt like a character in the midst of a stage play this was the climax of the drama and everything afterwards was going to provide them with the catharsis guaranteed in all greek tragedies valerie was the first person to move she stood and said in that wellbred fashion of hers that manette knew so well please excuse me and she began to leave the great hall mignon said in a burble of laughter dont you want to know more mum you cant leave now wouldnt you like to have it all valerie hesitated then turned and looked at mignon you make a very good case for strangling ones children at birth she said and she left them the inspector followed her obviously new light was being shed upon everything and there was now a very good chance manette thought that he was reconsidering whatever conclusions hed drawn about ians death she was doing the same herself because if ian had known about this child of her fathers if hed made some kind of threat regarding this child and what he knew about her if indeed it had come down to a choice between the truth being revealed or a lie continuing to be lived manette saw how her cousins life had been in danger and she reckoned the detective saw it as well she didnt want to believe what mignon had revealed about this child bianca but she could see by the expression on her fathers face that mignons revelation was the truth she didnt know how she felt about this and she didnt know when she might even be able to sort through her feelings in the matter but she saw how mignon felt about it just another reason to blame their father for whatever she believed had been lacking in her life mignon said to him happily oh my dad well at least you and i are going down in this ship together arent we i do expect theres some consolation in that for you to be doomed but to see your favourite child that would be me wouldnt it doomed alongside you rather like king lear and cordelia only whos playing the fool bernards lips were as thin as a bowl of workhouse gruel he said i think youre rather mistaken mignon although youve got the serpentstooth part of it bang on the money she wasnt the least taken aback dyou think marital forgiveness actually runs that far he said i dont think you know the first thing about marriage or forgiveness at this manette glanced at freddie he was watching her his dark eyes concerned she understood he was worried for her anxious about how she was taking in being a witness to her familys destruction before her eyes the world as shed known it was undergoing a cataclysmic change she wanted to tell him she could cope with that but she knew she didnt want to cope alone mignon said to their father did you really think you could keep bianca a secret forever my god what an enormous ego you have tell me dad what was poor little bianca to make of everything when she learned about her father and his other family his legitimate family but you hadnt got that far along in your consideration of the future had you as long as vivver was willing to play the game your way you probably didnt think one moment beyond what kind of fuck she was and how often you could manage it vivienne her father replied is going home to new zealand and this conversation is quite finished ill say when its finished mignon told him not you never you shes younger than we are this vivienne of yours shes younger than nick bernard walked to the front door then passing mignon to do so she tried to grab his arm but he shook her off manette expected her sister to use that gesture as an opportunity to topple from the sofa to the floor and proclaim herself the victim of abuse but instead she merely carried on talking she said ill speak to mother ill tell her the rest how long youve been having an affair with vivienne tully is it ten years dad longer than that how old she was when it all began she was twentyfour wasnt she or was she younger how bianca came about she wanted her didnt she she wanted a baby and you did as well didnt you dad because when bianca was born nick was still out there doing his nick thing and you were still hoping that someone somewhere some bloody time was going to give you a decent male child werent you dad and wont mother just love hearing that bernard said do your worst mignon it is i think what youve always wanted i hate you she said as always he replied did you hear me i hate you for my sins bernard said believe me i know and perhaps i deserve it now leave my house there was a moment of impasse during which manette thought her sister might refuse mignon stared at her father as if waiting for something that manette knew very well was never going to appear finally she shoved her zimmer to one side she smiled rose and strolled easily out of her fathers life when the door was closed upon her bernard took a linen handkerchief from his pocket he wiped his glasses with it then he used it against his face manette could see that his hands were shaking everything was on the line for him not the least a marriage of more than forty years he finally looked from manette to freddie and back to manette he said im so sorry my dear there are so many things im not sure they matter any longer how odd manette thought shed waited most of her life for this moment with herself in a superior position and bernard made vulnerable with bernard looking at her and actually seeing her not as a daughter not as a substitute for the kind of son hed wished for but as a person in her own right fully capable of anything he himself could do she no longer knew why all of that had been so important to her she only knew that she didnt feel what shed expected to feel with his recognition of her washing over her at last bernard nodded he said freddie freddie said if id been told i would have probably stopped it all from happening but then i dont know do i im not sure youre a good honest man fred stay that way bernard excused himself and went to the stairs he climbed them heavily and manette and freddie listened to his footfalls eventually they faded a door closed quietly somewhere above them we should probably leave old girl freddie said to manette if youre able that is he came to her and she allowed him to help her to her feet not because she needed it but because it felt good to feel someone solid at her side they left the great hall and went outdoors it wasnt until they were in the car and heading along the drive in the direction of the gate that she began to weep she tried to do this silently but freddie glanced in her direction he pulled the car over at once and stopped gently he took her into his arms he said its a tough one seeing ones parents like that knowing how one has demolished the other i expect your mother knew something wasnt quite right but perhaps it was easier just to ignore it thats the way these things are sometimes she cried against his shoulder but she shook her head he said what well of course your sisters mad as a rabid dog but theres nothing much new in that is there i do wonder though how you managed to emerge so well so normal manette its rather miraculous when you think about it at this she wept harder it was all too late what she now knew what she should have seen and what she finally understood lake windermere cumbria lynley found valerie fairclough walking along one of the paths already laid out in the unfinished childrens garden when he joined her she began to speak as if they had been interrupted in the midst of a conversation about this very spot she pointed out where work on the wrecked ship had already begun and told him about the ropes swings and sand that would be a feature of it she indicated the spot designated for monkey bars and a roundabout she took him past the smaller childrens section where horses kangaroos and large frogs already stood on their heavy spring bases waiting for riders who would laugh and crow with the simple fun of bouncing upon them there would be a fort as well she said because boys loved forts to play soldiers in didnt they and for the girls there would be a playhouse stocked with everything in miniature that one would find in a real house because wasnt the truth of the matter and all sexism aside that girls liked to play inside houses and make up games in which they were married with children and a husband who came home at night and presided over dinner she laughed mirthlessly when she said that last bit then she went on to say that the childrens area would be in short every childs dream place to play lynley thought it all quite odd what she was building was more suitable for a public park than a private home he wondered what her expectation of its use really was whether she had a larger picture in mind one that meant opening ireleth hall to the public in the manner of so many great houses across the country it was quite as if shed known an enormous change was coming and was preparing for it he said to her why did you arrange for me to come to cumbria valerie looked at him at sixtyseven years old she was a striking woman in her youth she would have possessed great beauty beauty and money a powerful combination she could have chosen from a score of men of similar background to her own but she had not done so because ive suspected for quite some time what bernard what he was up to i didnt know for certain that he was up to vivienne tully of course but i probably should have realised that as well when he didnt mention her after the second time she and i met those trips to london of his that became more frequent so many things associated with his foundation that needed his attention there are always signs inspector there are always clues red flags whatever you wish to call them but its generally easier to ignore them than to face the unknown thats going to arise out of the wreckage of a fortytwoyear marriage she picked up a discarded plastic coffee cup something left by one of the workers she frowned at this and crushed it into her pocket she shaded her eyes and looked out at the lake at storm clouds that were brewing on the hills to the west i am surrounded by liars and knaves i wanted to smoke them out of their hiding places you and here she cast him a small smile you were my fire inspector what of ian poor ian mignon could have killed him she had motive a very strong motive if it comes to that by your own admission she was in the boathouse she could have gone in there earlier and loosened the stones somehow in an undetectable way she could even have been in there when he returned she could have pulled him from the scull pushed him from it inspector that sort of revenge is far beyond mignons ability to plan besides she would have seen no immediate monetary gain in that and the only thing mignon has ever been able to see clearly is the monetary gain of the moment she turned from the lake then and looked at lynley she said i knew the stones were loose id told ian as much more than once he and i were the only ones who used the boathouse regularly so i told no one else there was no need i warned him to take care getting in and out of his scull he said not to worry that he would take care and when he had a moment hed fix the dock but i think that night he had other things on his mind he must have done it was quite out of the ordinary that he came to row that late anyway i think he wasnt paying close enough attention it was always an accident inspector i knew that from the first lynley considered this and that filleting knife i found in the water with the stones i threw it there just to keep you here in case you decided too soon it was an accident i see he said are you terribly angry i ought to be they turned and headed back towards the house above the walls of the topiary garden the towering mass of shaped shrubbery loomed and behind it ireleth hall itself sand coloured and teeming with history he said didnt bernard think it unusual what your asking for an investigation into his nephews death perhaps he did but what could he say i dont want that i would have asked why he would have tried to explain perhaps he would have said it was unfair to nicholas to manette to mignon to suspect them but i would have argued its better to know the truth about ones children than to live a lie and that inspector would have taken us far too close to the truth bernard himself didnt want me to know he had to run the risk you wouldnt unearth vivienne he really had no choice in the matter for what its worth shes returning to new zealand she made no response to this she took his arm as they worked their way along the path she said whats odd is this after more than forty years of marriage a man often becomes a habit i must consider whether bernard is a habit i would prefer to break might you i might but first i want the time to think she squeezed his arm and looked up at him youre a very handsome man inspector im sorry you lost your wife but i hope you dont intend to remain alone do you i havent thought about it much he admitted well do think about it we all have to choose eventually windermere cumbria tim spent hours in the business centre waiting for the time to be right it hadnt taken him that long to reach the town once hed left kaveh that morning hed leaped over a drystone wall and jogged across a lumpy paddock in the direction of dense woods comprising fir trees and birches hed remained there in a shelter of autumnhued bracken backed by the trunk of a fallen spruce until he was certain kaveh had driven off and then hed worked his way over to the road to windermere where two lifts took him to the middle of town at which point he began his search hed had no luck in finding a restorer of broken toys at long last hed had to settle upon an establishment called j bobak amp son a shop dedicated to the repair of all things electrical inside this place three aisles crammed with broken kitchen appliances led to the back where j bobak turned out to be a woman with grey plaits a lined face and bright pink lipstick that ran up the cracks above her lips while son turned out to be a kid in his twenties with downs syndrome she was tinkering with something that looked like a miniature waffle iron he was working on an oldtime wireless that was nearly the size of a mini all round both son and his mother stood various appliances in various stages of repair television sets microwaves mixers toasters and coffeemakers some of which looked as if theyd been waiting for expert electrical ministrations for a decade or more when tim presented j bobak with bella shed shaken her head this poor lump of arms and legs and body couldnt be repaired at all he was told even if j bobak amp son repaired toys which they did not at least she couldnt be repaired in a way that would be pleasing to her owner hed be better off saving his money to buy a new doll there was a toy shop it had to be this doll he told j bobak he knew it was rude to interrupt and the expression on j bobaks face indicated she was about to tell him so he went on to explain the doll belonged to his little sister and their dad had given it to her and their dad was dead this got to j bobak she laid the dolls pieces out on the shop counter and pursed her bright pink lips thoughtfully her son came to join her he said hi to tim and i dont go to school any longer but youre supposed to be in school eh betcher doing a bunk today his mum said trev you see to your own job luv theres a good boy and patted him on his shoulder as he snuffled noisily against his arm and went back to the enormous radio she said to tim sure you dont want to buy a new doll luv as could be tim told her could she repair it there was no other shop hed tried all over town she said reluctantly that shed see what she could do and tim told her he would give her the address where the doll had to be sent when it was completed he took out a crumpled wad of bank notes and some coins all of which hed cadged over time from his mothers bag his fathers wallet and a tin in the kitchen where kaveh kept pound coins to use when he ran out of money and hadnt thought to stop at the cash point in windermere on his way home from work j bobak said what you not coming back for it yourself he said no he wouldnt be here in cumbria by the time the doll was repaired he told her to take as much money as she liked she could send any change back with the doll then he gave her gracies name and the address which was simple enough bryan beck farm bryanbarrow near crosthwaite gracie might well be gone by then but even if shed returned to their mother certainly kaveh would send the doll on hed do that much no matter what sort of lie he was living with his pathetic little wife at that point and shed be pleased to see it would gracie perhaps shed even forgive tim for having wrecked the poor doll in the first place that done hed found his way to the business centre and there he stayed on his way with what remained of his money he bought a packet of jam mallows a kit kat bar an apple and a nachos kit of chips and salsa and refried beans and squatting between a filthy white ford transit and a wheelie bin overloaded with soaking styrofoam he ate it all when the car park began to empty as people left the various businesses for the day he ducked behind the wheelie bin and kept out of sight he fixed his eyes upon the photo shop and just before the hour when it was to close he went across to it and opened the door toyyou was taking the cash drawer out of the till his hands full he didnt have the chance to remove his name tag tim saw part of it william con before the man flicked away he ducked into the back and when he returned he was without the cash drawer and without the name tag he was also without good humour he said i told you id text whatre you doing here tim said it happens tonight toyyou said get this straight im not playing power games with some fourteenyearold i told you id let you know when i had it set up set it up now you said not alone this time and that means you know someone get him over here were doing it now tim pushed past the man he saw toyyous face darken it didnt matter to tim if it came to blows blows were just fine one way or another things were going to be concluded he went into the back room hed been here before so nothing about it surprised tim it wasnt a large space but it was divided into two distinct sections the first was for digital printing supplies and articles relating to the photographic business the second at the far end of the room was a studio in which subjects posed for their pictures in front of various backgrounds at the moment the studio took the form of a photographic parlour from another century the sort of place where people used to pose stiffly sitting or standing or both it contained a chaise longue two plinths upon which sat artificial ferns several overstuffed chairs thick faux curtains drawn back with fancy tasselled cords and a backdrop the backdrop made it look as if anyone posing had dragged their furniture outside to the top of a cliff it comprised a painted landmass ending in a deep sky filled with cumulus clouds tim had learned that this setup was all about contrast and contrast hed also learned was all about two things being in direct opposition to each other when this had been explained to him on his first visit hed thought immediately of the contrast between what hed once counted upon as his life a mum a dad a sister and a house in grangeoversands and what his life had been reduced to which was nothing entering the space now he thought about the contrast between how kaveh mehran had lived with his dad at bryan beck farm and how kaveh mehran intended to live in what was going to go for the next phase of his miserable excuse for a life when this thought came upon him tim forced himself to think instead of the real contrast that lay ahead which was the contrast between the mock innocence of this setting for photos and what the photos themselves consisted of toyyou had explained all this to him the first time he had posed for the pictures as he had been instructed to pose certain kinds of people hed been told liked to look at or purchase photos of nude young boys they liked the boys posing in certain ways they liked to see certain body parts sometimes it was just the suggestion of a body part and sometimes it was the real thing sometimes they wanted a face included in the picture sometimes they didnt a pout was good so was something toyyou referred to as a youcanhaveit look make a stiffie for the camera and it was even better certain people would pay a good sum of money for a picture of a boy a pout desire in the eyes and a decent stiffie as well tim had gone along he after all had been the one to start this ball rolling towards its destination but money wasnt what hed wanted hed wanted action and so far that action had been denied him that was going to change toyyou had followed him into the back room he said to tim you need to leave i cant have you here tim said i already told you call your friend or whoever it is tell him im ready tell him to get down here were doing the pictures now hes not about to do that no fourteenyearold tells him how to run his affairs he tells us when the time is right we dont tell him what is it about this that you dont understand i dont have the time tim protested the time is now im not waiting any longer if you want me doing it with some bloke then this is your chance because youre not getting another thats the way it is then toyyou said with a shrug now get out what you think youll find someone else to do it you think itll be that easy there are always kids looking for money he said for a picture maybe theyll take your money for a picture theyll stand there naked and maybe theyll even do it hard but the rest you think someonell do the rest someone besides me and you think youre the only one whos found me online you think this is a bit of work ive just taken up recently for my health or something you think youre the first the one and only therere dozens of you out there and theyre willing to do it the way i want it done because they want the money they dont make the rules they follow the rules and one of the rules is that they dont show up this is twice now you little bugger and make demands toyyou had been standing among the supplies but he came forward as he spoke he wasnt big and tim had always reckoned he could take him down if that was going to be necessary but when the man grabbed him by the arm tim felt a strength emanating from him that he hadnt suspected was there i dont play games toyyou told him i dont get manipulated by little bits of boyass like you we had a deal and bugger your deal its over its off you promised you said i dont need this shit toyyou jerked him hard tim saw that he meant to eject him from the premises that couldnt happen hed worked too hard and hed done too much he pulled away he cried no i want it to happen and i want it now and he began to tear at his clothes he pulled off his anorak his heavy sweater buttons flew from his shirt as he ripped it off he began to shout you promised if you dont do it ill go to the cops i swear i will ill tell them what i did what you want the pictures your friends how to find you its all on my computer and theyll know and shut up shut up toyyou looked back over his shoulder in the direction of the shop he strode to the doorway that had brought them both into the back room and he slammed it shut he returned to tim he said christ calm down all right but it cant happen now cant you get that i want i swear the copsll come all right the cops i get it i believe you just calm the fuck down look im going to make the call now in front of you ill set it up for tomorrow well do the pictures then he appeared to think for a moment then he looked tim over he said itll be film though live action and all the way this time you understand but you said im taking a risk here toyyou roared youll make it worth my while do you want it or not tim flinched cowed but he knew fear only for a moment before he said i want it good two blokes as well do you get it you and two blokes and the real thing live on film do you know what that means because no way in hell are we starting this and finding out midway that youve changed your mind you and two blokes say you understand tim licked his lips me and two blokes i understand toyyou looked him over as if expecting something to ooze from his pores that would indicate the future tim stood his ground toyyou nodded sharply and punched in some numbers on the phone tim said and after when its over you promise i promise when its over you die just like you want it however you want it you get to make the rules for that november milnthorpe cumbria when lynley phoned her early in the morning he was clever enough to ring the inn and not her mobile because of this deborah answered simon or tommy shed reckoned would ring the mobile shed see the callers number and decide whether to answer or not even the reporter from the source rang her mobile a call on the phone inside her hotel room meant reception was probably enquiring about the length of her stay thus deborah winced as lynleys pleasant baritone came over the line when he said simons not happy with either of us she could hardly pretend hed phoned the wrong number it was quite early and she was still in bed clever tommy to have thought of that as well catch her before she left the inn and there was little she could do to avoid him she sat up pulled the blankets closer against the chill and said as she rearranged the pillows well im not happy with simon either right i know but as it happens he was correct deb from the start oh isnt he always she said tartly what are we talking about anyway ian cresswells death he could have prevented it if hed been paying closer attention to where he was tying up his scull that night and weve reached this conclusion because deborah waited to hear him say hed reached his conclusion because of simons insufferably logical presentation of the facts but he didnt go in that direction instead he told her about a family imbroglio hed witnessed among the faircloughs and a conversation hed had with valerie fairclough afterwards he concluded it all with so it seems ive been brought up here as a means of valeries delving into her husbands doings it was a fools errand with me as the fool hillier as well i daresay hes not going to be happy when i tell him how weve both been used deborah shoved off the blankets swung her legs over the side of the bed and looked at the clock she said and you believe her as she read the time a phone call from tommy at six thirty in the morning could mean only one thing and she was fairly certain she knew what that was he said in the ordinary course of things i might not but with the coroners conclusion and with simons assessment along with what valerie told me she could be lying there are motives tommy without anything more than motives theres no case to present deb thats how it works frankly people often have motives to do away with other people they often have the wish to do away with other people and still they never lift a finger against them thats what apparently happened here its time to return to london even without putting the matter of alatea fairclough to rest deb just listen to me for a moment everything about alatea suggests secrecy people with secrets have motive to do all sorts of things to protect those secrets that may be but whatever she might have done or might be doing to protect her secrets assuming she has them what she didnt do was murder ian cresswell thats why we came up here we now know the truth as i said its time to go home deborah got out of the bed the room was cold she shivered and moved to the electric fire it had clicked off in the night and she turned it on there was moisture climbing the window against which she brushed her hand to look out at the day it was still quite dark outside she saw the road and the pavement wet the glitter of the street lamps and the traffic lights on the corner winked brightly against it she said tommy those missing pages from conception magazine have said from the first that somethings going on with alatea i dont disagree was his perfectly reasonable reply and we have a good idea of what that something is conception but you already knew that didnt nicholas fairclough tell you that when you first met yes but its reasonable that she wouldnt want to talk about this with a stranger deborah do you like to talk about it with anyone that was an unfair blow and he had to know it but deborah wasnt about to let her reaction to the question get the better of her ability to reason she said none of this makes much sense talking about conception or not this woman lucy keverne told me she has her eggs harvested all right perhaps she does then what was she doing at lancaster university in the company of alatea fairclough why was she in the george childress centre with her perhaps donating an egg to alatea lynley said the egg needs to be fertilised wouldnt nicholas need to be there perhaps alatea had his sperm with her in a turkey baster you mean deborah asked pointedly so why would lucy be there as well to donate eggs on the spot really fine all right then why wouldnt nicholas be there to donate sperm as fresh as possible real little swimmers that sort of thing lynley sighed deborah wondered where he was on a land line somewhere since his sigh had come to her so clearly this suggested he was still at ireleth hall he said deb i dont know i dont know how its done i dont know how it all works i know you dont but i do believe me and one thing i know is that even if they do the business with one egg or two dozen from lucy and sperm from nicholas theyre not implanting them in alatea on the spot so if lucys a donor as she claims to be and if shes giving alatea eggs for some reason and if sperm from nicholas are being used none of it matters lynley cut in firmly because it has nothing to do with ian cresswells death and we need to get back to london you need to i do not deborah his voice was losing that patient tone deborah heard simon in it how alike they were at the end of the day he and tommy the differences between them were only superficial what she asked sharply im heading back to london this morning you know thats why ive phoned what id like to do is stop in milnthorpe follow you to the car hire so you can return your car then take you back to london with me because you dont trust me to get there on my own she demanded i rather wanted the company he replied its a long drive she said shed never be a surrogate tommy if all shes going to do is donate eggs for alatea to use why not just say that why tell me she wouldnt discuss it i have no idea and its not important it doesnt matter ian cresswells death was no ones fault but his own he knew about the loose stones in the boathouse he didnt take care thats where things lie deb and nothing about this woman in lancaster is going to change that so the question is why cant you let it go and i think we both know the answer to that his words were quiet enough but they were unlike tommy they spoke of the degree to which simon had persuaded him to take his side but then why wouldnt he deborah asked herself they had years of history tommy and simon they had decades of history they shared one terrible automobile accident and the love for a murdered woman as well these things bound them to each other in ways she would never be able to surmount that being the case there was only one alternative she said very well you win tommy what does that mean it means that ill go back to london with you deborah no she gave a hearty sigh one she knew hed be able to hear i do mean it tommy i give up what time shall we leave are you being quite serious of course i am im stubborn but im not a fool if theres no point carrying on with this business then theres no point is there you do see i do one cant argue with forensics thats how it is she waited a moment for this to sink in then she repeated when do we leave you woke me up by the way so ill need time to pack to shower do my hair whatever id like breakfast as well ten oclock he said thank you deb i do see its better this way she lied windermere cumbria zed benjamin had barely slept his story was crumbling what had started out too hot to be handled without oven gloves was fast becoming cold fish on a platter he hadnt the slightest clue what to do with the information he had because he had no information that amounted to a blockbuster of a story in his daydreams it had been an expose front page material in which was revealed that a secret investigation launched by new scotland yard was digging up dirt about nicholas fairclough and about what truly went for his recovery from years of drug abuse which was the murder of a cousin standing in the way of his success it was the tale of a bloke who had managed to pull the wool over the eyes of his parents his family and his fellows by posing as a dogooder while all the time engaged in vile machinations to eliminate someone blocking his access to the family fortune the story was accompanied by photos ds cotter fairclough his wife the pele project and fairclough industries among others and its length and quality begged for a leap onto page and from there to and as well all of it rested beneath the byline zedekiah benjamin his name in journalistic lights for that to happen however the story had to be about nicholas fairclough but if nothing else his day with ds cotter had proved that nick fairclough was of no interest to the met the day had also proved that faircloughs wife was a monumental dead end nothing im afraid was how the redhaired detective had reported upon her interview with the woman theyd followed from the kenthowath foundation for disabled veterans to lancaster university and back again all in the company of alatea fairclough what dyou mean nothing had been zeds demand shed said the woman lucy keverne was her name and alatea had gone to see a specialist at the university about female troubles they were lucys female troubles evidently and alatea had accompanied her as a friend shit hed muttered thats bloody nowhere isnt it it does put us back to square one she replied no he thought it put her back to square one it put him in danger of losing his job he found that he wanted to talk to yaffa she was wise and if anyone was going to be able to suggest how he could get himself out of this mess and onto a story that rodney aronson would find a suitable return for the money invested by the source it was going to be yaffa so he rang her when he heard her voice he felt nearly overcome with relief he said morning darling she said zed hello and mama benjamin its our lovely man ringing to tell him susanna was somewhere nearby i miss you dearest and she laughed at something susanna said in the distance she said mama benjamin tells me to stop trying to ensnare her son he is an uncatchable bachelor she tells me is that true not if youre trying to do the catching he replied ive never had bait i wanted to bite so badly you wicked boy and to the side no no mama benjamin i will absolutely not tell you what your son is saying i will say that hes making me a bit faint though and to zed you are you know im quite lightheaded well good thing its not your head im interested in she laughed then she said in a completely altered voice ah shes gone into the loo were safe how are you zed he found he wasnt ready for the shift from yaffa the putative lover to yaffa the coconspirator he said missing you yaf i wish you were with me let me help you from a distance im happy to do that for an insane moment zed thought she was actually suggesting phone sex and in his present state that would have been a welcome diversion but then she said are you close to the information you need you must be worried about the story that brought him round cold water on his ardour he said with a groan that bloody story he told her where he was with it he told her everything as hed been doing all along and as shed been doing all along she listened he concluded with so theres sodall to report on i could massage the facts and write that scotland yards up here investigating nick fairclough due to the untimely and suspicious death of his cousin who happened to hold the purse strings of fairclough industries and we all know what that means dont we gentle readers but the truth of the matter happens to be that scotland yard look like theyre investigating alatea fairclough and getting about as far with her as ive got with her husband were in the same position the met and i the only difference is this detective can toddle back to london and give the highups the allclear but if i return without a story im done for he heard his tone as he concluded and he said hastily sorry im whingeing a bit zed you can whinge all you need to ta yaf youre well youre just how you are he could hear the smile in her voice when she said thank you i think now let us put our heads together when one door closes another opens meaning meaning perhaps its time you did what you were intended to do youre a poet zed not a tabloid journalist remaining one is going to bleed your soul of its creative power its time for you to write your poetry no one supports himself on his poetry zed laughed selfderisively look at me im twentyfive years old and im living with my mum i cant even support myself as a reporter for the love of god ah zed dont talk this way you need only someone to believe in you i believe in you bloody lot of good that does me youre going back to tel aviv there was a silence at the other end into it came the indication of another phone call to zeds mobile he said yaffa you still there oh yes im here she said the other call was insistent rodney probably it was close to the time he had to face the music he said yaffa ive got another call i probably should i dont have to she said quickly i dont even need to you think about that zed then she rang off for a moment he stared at nothing at all then he took the other call it was the scotland yard detective she said im going to speak to this woman in lancaster again theres more here than meets the eye its time you and i worked together to twist her arm barrowinfurness and grangeoversands cumbria one of the last people manette expected to see turn up on the premises of fairclough industries was kaveh mehran as far as she could recall hed never been there before ian had certainly never taken him round for formal introductions and kaveh hadnt come on his own expecting to be introduced nearly everyone knew of course that ian had walked out on his marriage because of a young man but that was the extent of it so when kaveh was shown into her office she blinked in confusion before she realised hed probably come to collect ians personal belongings it needed to be done and no one had yet thought about doing it his reason for showing up at the firm however turned out to be somewhat different tim was missing hed jumped out of kavehs car on the previous morning on the way to school and hed not returned home last night manette said did something happen why did he jump out of your car did he go to school did you phone the school the school kaveh said had phoned the house yesterday tim was absent and when one of the day pupils didnt turn up the school rang the home because well because of the sort of school it was if manette knew what he meant well of course she bloody knew what he meant the whole family knew what margaret fox school was all about it was hardly a secret kaveh then said that hed driven the route from bryanbarrow to margaret fox school that morning to see if tim was perhaps hitchhiking there on the way hed stopped in great urswick on the chance that tim had gone to manettes home to spend the night or was holed up somewhere on her property without her knowledge hed stopped at the school next and now he was here could tim be here here manette asked dyou mean in the factory of course hes not here what would he be doing here have you seen him at all has he phoned for obvious reasons i havent checked with niamh kaveh had the grace to look uncomfortable but manette knew there was something rather large and important that he wasnt saying ive not heard from him and hes not been in great urswick whyd he jump out of your car kaveh looked over his shoulder as if he wanted to close the door to her office this alone made manette gird herself for something she wasnt going to want to hear he said i think he overheard a conversation i was having with george cowley the farmer what on earth it was about the future the farm i expect you know cowleys wanted the farm for himself ian told me yes and what of the farm and mr cowley and why would tim care a fig about either she wondered i mentioned to mr cowley my intentions regarding bryan beck farm he said i suspect tim overheard and what are your intentions are you thinking of raising sheep yourself manette sounded tart and couldnt help it the farm after all should have gone to tim and gracie it should not now be the sole property of this man whod done his best to ruin their lives to keep it of course but also i did tell him that tim and gracie would be returning to their mother tim may have overheard that manette drew her eyebrows together she knew of course that this was the logical progression of events farm or no farm tim and gracie could hardly continue to live with their fathers lover now that their father was dead it wouldnt be easy moving to their mothers home niamh being niamh but there wasnt an alternative as long as they were underage tim would understand this he would doubtless have been expecting it and he doubtless would also have been preferring it so would have gracie thus to have this piece of information set him off to the extent that he would jump out of kavehs car and run off this didnt make sense she said i dont mean to be offensive kaveh but i cant imagine the children would want to live with you now that their dads dead so is there something else is there something youre not telling me kaveh looked at her squarely if there is i cant tell you what will you help manette i dont know what else ill handle it she said when hed departed she phoned the school for ease of information she claimed to be niamh she learned at once that tim wasnt there for a second day the school was worried as it would be losing one of their pupils could mean all sorts of things and not a single one of them was good manettte phoned niamh next the answer machine took the call in niamhs irritating purr doubtless designed as a sirens song for potential suitors manette left a message but then switched to tim are you there listening to this if you are pick up love this is your cousin manette nothing but of course that didnt mean much if he was in hiding he was hardly going to reveal it to someone searching for him and he would know manette was looking for him he would know everyone was looking for him there was nothing to do but set out on a search manette didnt want to do it alone however she went to freddies office not there she went to ians office and there freddie was beavering away at ians computer trying to make sense of the money trails she watched him for a moment before she spoke she thought dear freddie and her heart hurt briefly as if making her aware of its presence for the first time in years she said have you a moment fred he looked up smiled whats up and then whats happened because he read her as well now as hed read her when they were married she told him the gist tim was missing and she needed to make the drive to niamhs which seemed to be the only place left where he could be in hiding but she didnt want to make the drive alone or better said she didnt want to confront tim alone things were iffy with the boy she felt a little well a little in need of backup if it was going to come down to another confrontation with him of course freddie agreed when had freddie not agreed he said in a tick meet you at the car and he set about doing whatever he needed to do to close up shop for a while he was as good as his word in less than ten minutes he was climbing into the passenger seat of her car saying dont want me to drive she said one of us might have to jump out and tackle him and id rather it was you if you dont mind they made good time to grangeoversands taking the coastal route along the empty bay when they pulled up in front of niamhs white house it was to see her on the doorstep bidding a fond farewell to the same bloke manette had encountered the last time shed been in grangeoversands charlie wilcox of milnthorpe chinese takeaway fame she thought she murmured his name to freddie but she didnt need to say anything more about the mans relationship with tim and gracies mother niamh herself was making that clear enough she was wearing a dressing gown with enough leg showing through its opening at the moment to indicate she had nothing on beneath it charlie was wearing last nights clothing an outonthetown getup with a jacket and trousers white shirt and tie rakishly unknotted round his neck niamh cast a quick look in the direction of manettes car and then gave herself to a serious goodbye kiss locking her leg around poor charlies leg and doing a bit of bump and grind against him her mouth was so wide upon his she might have been excavating for his wisdom teeth with her tongue manette sighed she glanced at freddie he was blushing he shot her a look she shrugged they got out of the car as the kiss ended charlie was walking dazedly to his saab still parked in the drive and he nodded a hello that was utterly unembarrassed seemed like he was getting quite comfortable coming and going and doing what niamh needed to have done manette thought just like a plumber seeing to the pipes she snorted at the thought and approached the front door niamh hadnt closed it shed gone inside however most likely thinking that manette and freddie would do likewise they did shutting the door behind them niamh called ill be with you in a moment im putting on something decent manette didnt comment on this she and freddie went to the sitting room which displayed the remains of a tryst wine bottle two glasses a plate bearing crumbs and bits of cheese and chocolate sofa cushions shoved onto the floor and a pile of niamhs clothing lying nearby niamh was manette thought certainly having the time of her life sorry havent got to this yet manette and freddie turned at the sound of niamhs voice her something decent turned out to be a black leotard which hugged every curve of her body and did everything possible to emphasise her breasts these stood to attention like infantrymen in the presence of their commanding general their nipples strained against the thin cloth manette glanced at freddie he was looking out of the sitting room window at the fine view of the bay that it provided with the tide out plovers and knots by the thousands were in freddie wasnt a bird man but he was giving them considerable attention the tips of his ears were absolutely magenta niamh smiled slyly at manette she said now what can i do for you two and she bustled round as well as one could be said to bustle in a leotard she put the cushions back onto the sofa and plumped them nicely then picked up the wine bottle and glasses and took them into the kitchen there the remains of a chinese takeaway dinner were on the worktops and the table it seemed that charlie wilcox was providing all sorts of sustenance manette thought stupid sod manette said to her i phoned did you not hear it niamh she fluttered her fingers in a poohpooh gesture i never answer the phone when charlies here she said would you in my position im not sure which one is your position oh never mind i dont care to know yes id answer the phone if i heard the message and the message was about my son niamh was at the worktop picking up the takeaway cartons inspecting them for remains that were salvageable what about tim she asked manette felt freddie come into the kitchen behind her she moved to one side to give him room she glanced at him he stood with his arms crossed inspecting the mess freddie wasnt big on the pickings of daily life being left round to clutter up a place manette gave niamh the story in brief one missing son two days truant from school has he been here she finished fairly sure of the answer not that i know of niamh said i havent been home every moment i suppose he could have come and gone wed like to check freddie said why dyou think hes under a bed do you think im hiding him from you we think he might be hiding from you manette put in and who could blame him lets be honest niamh theres a limit to what life can ask one boy to endure and i expect hes reached his what exactly are you saying i think you know very well and with what youve been up to freddie touched her arm briefly to halt her words he said reasonably tim might have slipped into the house while you were sleeping he could be in the garage as well dyou mind awfully if we have a look itll just take a moment and then well be out of your hair niamhs expression said shed have liked to carry the conversation further but manette knew that doing so would lead them in the single direction niamh would want to go ians sins against her and against the family constituted the broken record of her life and she had no wish to repair it no matter charlie wilcox and his chinese takeaway niamh would never get beyond ians betrayal because she had no wish to do so she said do as you like freddie and turned her back to begin putting the kitchen in order searching the house was the business of less than five minutes it was small and upstairs there were three bedrooms and a bathroom tim would hardly have hidden himself in his mothers room since doing so would have risked having to listen to niamhs lovemaking likely to be an acoustically enthusiastic affair that left his room and gracies room manette took these on as freddie did the honours with niamhs garage they met back in the sitting room they shook their heads time to move to another location but manette felt that she couldnt do so without a final word with tims mother niamh emerged from the kitchen with a cup of coffee she made no offer of the like to her unwanted visitors all to the good manette thought as she didnt want to remain any longer than it would take to say what needed to be said this was its time for the children to come home youve made your point niamh and theres really no reason to take it further niamh said oh dear and went to a chair beneath which something had been shoved she brought it out and shot them a coy smile charlie will have his games she said manette saw it was a sex toy a vibrator by the looks of it complete with various attachments in various shapes that lay on the floor as well niamh scooped these up and placed them along with the vibrator on the coffee table she said what point are you talking about manette you know very well what point im talking about its the same point that sent you on your way to the plastic surgeon and its the same point that has that poor stupid bloke sniffing round you every night manette freddie murmured no manette said its time someone took her to task for this nonsense you have two children and a duty to those children and that has nothing to do with ian with his rejection of you with his love for kaveh with stop it niamh hissed i will not have that name spoken inside this house which one ian the father of your children or kaveh the man he left you for you were hurt fine all right everyone knows it you had a right to be and believe me everyone knows that as well but ians dead and the children need you and if you cant see that if youre so selfabsorbed if youre so bloody needy if you have to continue to prove to yourself over and over that some man any man for the love of god wants you what on earth is the matter with you were you ever a mother to gracie and tim manette freddie murmured really how dare you niamhs voice was fury how bloody dare you to stand there to tell me you who threw away a man for this isnt about me oh it never is is it youre perfect arent you while the rest of us are beneath your contempt what do you know of what i went through what do you know of discovering that the man you love has been meeting with other men for years public lavatories city parks nightclubs where they grope each other and stick their cocks into strangers arseholes do you know how it feels to have that knowledge descend on you to realise your marriage has been a sham and worse that youve been exposed to every possible variety of filthy disease because the man youve given your life to has been living a lie for years dont you tell me how to live my life now dont you bloody tell me im all about myself im needy im pathetic im whatever else is on your goddamn mind shed begun to weep as she spoke and she dashed the tears away from her face she said get out of here and dont come back if you do manette i swear to god ill phone the police i want you out of here and i want you to leave me alone and tim and gracie what of them i cant have them here it was freddie who spoke what dyou mean they remind me always i cant bear it them manettes lips parted she took in the meaning behind niamhs words she finally said why on earth did he choose you why did he not see what niamh demanded what what from the very first you were totally about yourself even now niamh thats how it is i dont know what youre talking about niamh said dont worry about that manette said i finally do lancaster lancashire deborah felt a twinge of guilt about lynley but a twinge was all she allowed herself to feel he would arrive at the crow and eagle and she wouldnt be there but he wouldnt know shed gone to lancaster since her hire car would still be sitting in the car park she reckoned hed think at first shed gone for a final walk round milnthorpe perhaps over to the towns market square or beyond it to the church to have a look at the graveyard or perhaps hed think shed gone along the route to arnside for a stroll to watch the marsh birds for the tide was out and the mudflats were thickly populated at the moment with flocks of every sort of bird one could think of wintering in britain from harsher climes there was the bank as well just across the road from the hotel he might think shed be there or perhaps still at breakfast but in any case it didnt matter what mattered is that she wouldnt be there for him to cart home to simon she could have left him a note of course but she knew tommy one indication that she was on her way to lancaster for another go with lucy keverne on the subject of alatea fairclough and hed be after her like a hound chasing down a hare after her phone call to him zed benjamin arrived in record time she was waiting for him just inside the doorway of the inn having booked herself in for at least one more night so she stepped outside and into his car as soon as hed made the threepoint turn that would put them in the direction of lancaster she didnt tell him shed lied to him earlier about why lucy keverne and alatea fairclough had been together at lancaster university the way she reckoned it she didnt owe any tabloid reporter a thing be it the truth a pack of lies or even a spurious apology she made the situation simple for zed she reckoned that lucy keverne had lied to her on the previous day her tale about some kind of female problem needing to be looked into by someone at the university didnt make sense the more deborah had thought about it after all lucy had gone to a reproductive centre and why would she need the support of a friend for that she might want the support of a husband or a partner if she had reproduction on the mind but a friend no it seemed more likely that there was something more going on between lucy keverne and alatea fairclough and she deborah needed zeds presence in order to find out being orientated towards the source zed immediately jumped to a secret lesbian liaison between lucy keverne and alatea fairclough looking for a connection with the death of ian cresswell he went from there to the dead man knowing about the secret lesbian liaison and threatening to tell nicholas fairclough about it zed offered several variations on this theme most of which included lucy keverne and alatea fairclough managing to do away with ian cresswell together which was fine with deborah as it kept zed occupied and away from questioning why on earth a putative detective from new scotland yard would welcome the source into the midst of an ongoing investigation what she did tell him was that she reckoned it was going to come down to money what she didnt tell him was that if lucy keverne had been advertising herself as an egg donor as she claimed then she hadnt been doing it out of the goodness of her heart but rather for the cash zed was going to hand over tabloid money for her story whatever her actual story was he didnt know that yet but he would soon the one subject deborah didnt think about was why this part of the cresswell case was important to her the local coroner had been convinced that the death of ian cresswell had been an accident simon was absolutely certain of that fact and it was his job to be certain of such things tommy had agreed it seemed as if the entire reason for tommy to be in cumbria had relatively little to do with ian cresswells death in the first place so for her to be tenaciously maintaining that there was more here than met the eye was a matter calling for close introspection deborah knew that at heart but she didnt want to go there in mind the chain of thought created by such selfexamination was not going to be pleasant at the kenthowath foundation for disabled veterans she said heres how it has to be to which zed replied wait a bloody minute doubtless at the thought that once again he would be playing chauffeur while she gathered information that she might or might not share with him well who could blame him for being miffed she asked herself the last time theyd gone this route hed ended up with little more than a halfempty tank of petrol ill ring you once i have her alone she said if she sees us both at once i guarantee shell not say another word about alatea fairclough and why should she if shes up to something illegal shes hardly going to confess it is she he didnt ask why the hell they were there at all then which was just as well deborah knew she was going to have to do some considerable fancy dancing with lucy keverne and she needed most of her wits to do that not to create fictive reasons for why zed had to play the part she was going to orchestrate for him she didnt really know if shed get that far with lucy keverne anyway she was flying without radar on this one the same old gentleman whod welcomed her on the previous day did so today he remembered her because of her hair which was one of the few benefits she reckoned of being a redhead he asked if she wanted to speak with miss lucy keverne again he held up a sheaf of papers and said reading er play i am and lemme tell you if its not a west end winner then im the queen of sheba so she was a playwright deborah thought perhaps supporting herself by working here at the disabled soldiers home and topping up her funds with the occasional donation of eggs that was the grimmest sort of news to be had since perhaps the only action shed been taking in the company of alatea fairclough was in the nature of research well one way or another they had to know deborah thought meanwhile she had no intention of letting on that shed been told about the playwriting no need to give the woman in advance a direction in which to spin her story lucys face registered surprise when she walked into the lobby and saw who was waiting to speak to her then her face altered at once to suspicion deborah didnt give her a chance to speak first she quickly strode to her and placed a hand on her arm she said to her quietly heres what you need to know ms keverne new scotland yard is here in cumbria and so is a reporter from the source one way or another youre going to end up telling your story the true one this time and its up to you how and when you want to tell it lucy said i cant youve no choice any longer i deceived you yesterday i apologise for that but id hoped to get to the root of the matter without bringing in anyone who might make you uncomfortable obviously alatea faircloughs being investigated the trail has led directly to you ive done nothing illegal so you say deborah said and if thats the case it is then you can decide which route has more to offer you lucys eyes narrowed the word offer had done the trick what are you talking about deborah looked round furtively and said with great meaning we cant speak here in the lobby come with me then even better deborah thought this time they didnt go to the garden but rather to an office which seemed to be her own there were two desks in it but the other wasnt occupied lucy closed the door behind them and stood in front of it she said whos offering what tabloids pay for their stories you must know that is that who you are a tabloid journalist no but ive got one with me and if youll consent to talk to him im here to make sure you get paid for what you have to say my part is to assess the value of the story you tell me i negotiate with him that cant possibly be how it works lucy said shrewdly what are you then an agent for the source some kind of what news scout or something im not sure it matters who i am deborah said i think it matters more what i have to offer i can ring the di from new scotland yard whos here in cumbria on a matter of murder or i can ring a journalist wholl walk in listen to your story and pay you for it murder whats going on thats not important at the moment this situation between you and alatea fairclough is you must decide whats it to be a visit from new scotland yard or a journalist happy to hear what you have to say lucy keverne thought this over while outside the office some sort of trolley trundled down the corridor she finally said how much then and deborah breathed more easily now that lucy was swimming closer to the bait she said i suppose that depends on how sensational your story is lucy looked towards a window that faced the garden in which she and deborah had spoken on the previous day a gust of wind shuddered the slim branches of a japanese maple outside dislodging the rest of the leaves still clinging to it stubbornly deborah waited with please please please running through her mind this was she knew the only option left to get at the truth if lucy keverne didnt go for it there was nothing more to do but return to london as bidden lucy finally said there is no story at least there is no story that could possibly interest the source all there is is an arrangement between two women id make more of it if i could believe me because i could use the money id prefer not to work here id prefer to sit at home and write my plays and send them off to london and see them produced but thats not happening any time soon so i work here in the mornings and i write in the afternoons and occasionally i top up my income by donating eggs which was why i placed the advertisement in conception magazine i told you this you also told me you would never consider being a surrogate all right that part wasnt true so why did you lie about this yesterday obviously it was a private matter its still a private matter and the money what about it as i understand how everything works deborah pointed out youre paid for allowing your eggs to be harvested but if youre a surrogate for someone you receive nothing just your expenses eggs equal profit while surrogacy comes from the goodness of your heart isnt that how it works lucy was silent into her silence deborahs mobile rang she jerked it impatiently from her shoulder bag and saw the incoming number are you playing me for a bloody idiot zed demanded when she answered what the hells going on im going to have to ring you back she said no sodding way im coming in thats not a good idea no well its the best ive come up with and when i get there thered better be a story waiting for me and itd better have to do with cresswells murder i cant promise but he ended the call before she could finish she said to lucy the source reporter is on his way in this is out of my hands unless you wish to tell me more something i can spin to keep him away from you its to do with money i expect youve agreed to be a surrogate for alatea and alatea is willing to pay you more than just your expenses isnt she that would put you on the wrong side of the law it explains why you misdirected me yesterday lucy said with some passion look at me look at this job all i need is time to finish my play to have it workshopped to be able to revise it and i dont have time and i dont have money and the surrogacy agreement between us was going to give me both so you can make a story out of that if youd like but i hardly think itll sell any papers do you she was of course dead right scion of fairclough fortune in illegal surrogacy deal might sell some newspapers but the story would have legs only if there existed a bouncing baby whose winsome picture could be run along with the tabloids disclosure along with a typical tabloid caption something like purchased baby fairclough sold by surrogate mum for the story of an illegal deal going unfulfilled couldnt even be sold to any tabloid since there would be nothing to prove it save lucys claim which would be denied by alatea fairclough the story of a deal in which an infant could be produced as proof would be hot and lively but since there was no baby to speak of there was also no story on the other hand deborah now knew why alatea fairclough was in a panic about her the only question was whether ian cresswell had discovered this situation in some manner and had threatened alatea in the one way she could be threatened by him through money if lucy was to be paid for the surrogacy then the money would have had to come through ian cresswell he had been the man in control of the fairclough fortune unless she had funds of her own alatea would have had to strike some kind of deal with ian this of course brought up nicholas faircloughs role in the surrogacy arrangement he would have had to know and to agree which meant he would have had to be part of digging up the funds to pay for everything she said to lucy what about nicholas alateas husband lucy said he only but that was as far as she got the maddening zed benjamin burst into the room he said to deborah enough of these scotland yard double crosses were doing this together or not at all lucy cried scotland yard double crosses scotland yard zed said to her jerking his thumb at deborah who the hell dyou think youve been talking to here lady godiva arnside cumbria alatea had managed to send nicholas off to work he hadnt wanted to go and chances were very good she knew that he wouldnt stay there but the only thing she had to cling to at this point was a semblance of normalcy and what constituted normal was nicky heading to barrow and after that to the pele project hed been unable to sleep again he was filled with remorse seeing himself as the person who was bringing raul montenegro down upon her nicky knew theyd been lovers she and raul shed never lied about that hed also known she was on the run from montenegro in a world in which fixated stalking had become just one more thing a woman had to worry about nicky had had no trouble believing that she needed to be protected from this multimillionaire from mexico city a powerful man determined to have what shed promised him a man in whose home shed lived for five years but nicky had never known everything about her about raul and about what theyd been to each other the only one who knew the story from start to finish was montenegro himself hed changed his life to be with her hed altered hers to bring her into a world shed had no chance to make her own before shed met him but there had been elements of raul that hed never made quite clear to her just as there had been elements of herself that shed never made quite clear to him the result had been a nightmare from which the only chance of awakening was to run she was pacing and considering her final options when lucy keverne rang she made her announcement tersely the woman from the previous day had returned and she hadnt come alone i had to tell her the truth alatea or at least a version of it she left me no choice what do you mean what did you tell her i kept it simple i told her that youve had trouble becoming pregnant she does think your husband knows however i had to make her think that you didnt tell her about the money did you how much im paying or the rest she doesnt know the rest she knows about the money she worked that out easily enough because id told her about the egg harvesting yesterday and she knew money was connected to that so she reckoned there had to be money connected to the surrogacy and i could hardly deny it but did you tell her thats all she knows i needed money end of story not about i didnt tell her how if thats what youre worried about she doesnt know and no one will ever know i swear it about faking the pregnancy that part is yours and mine to hold the friendship between us the holiday together too close to the due date the delivery of the baby she knows nothing of that and i didnt tell her but why did you alatea she gave me no choice it was either tell her or face arrest and that would hardly put me into the position of helping you later when all this dies down if it dies down but if she knows and then theres a baby later on alatea went to the bay window and sat she was in the yellow drawing room its cheerful colour doing little to mitigate the dull grey day outside the house theres more alatea lucy said im afraid theres more alateas lips felt stiff as she said what what more she had a reporter with her the choice she gave me was to talk to him or to have scotland yard oh my god alatea slumped in the chair her head lowered her hand holding her brow but why is scotland yard interested in you and why is the source trying to write about you i have to ask because the one thing you promised you guaranteed this alatea was that no one could possibly root out the deception now between scotland yard and a tabloid we both stand in very good stead to be its not you its not me alatea told her its nicky its the fact that his cousin drowned what cousin when whats this got to do with you nothing its got nothing to do with me and nothing to do with nicky its just what brought scotland yard up here in the first place the journalist was here to do a story on nicky and the pele project but that was weeks ago and i dont know why hes come again this is a mess lucy said you do know that dont you look i do think ive managed to keep the reporter from getting a story out of all this whats there to report you and i talking about a surrogacy arrangement theres no story in that but as to the woman she claimed that she could produce the detective from scotland yard with a wave of her hand and he said that she was the detective which she denied but she wouldnt say more and by that time things were falling apart and for the love of god who was this woman alatea what does she want with me what does she want with you shes gathering her information alatea said shes making sure she knows who i am what do you mean who you are the instrument of another she thought eternally never who i wish to be victoria london barbara havers spent the morning keeping her nose to isabelle arderys assigned grindstone which had a great deal to do with meeting a clerk from the cps on the invigorating subject of comparing all the statements taken from everyone connected to the summer death of a young woman in a north london cemetery she hated this kind of work but she did everything save salute when ardery gave it to her better to prove herself in ways beyond her manner of dress she reckoned which was today letter perfect as a matter of fact shed donned her aline skirt navy tights and perfectly polished court shoes well there was one little scuff but some spit had taken care of that and shed topped this with a new wool sweater that was finely knitted and not mind you of her usual heavygauge fishermans variety over that shed shrugged into a subtle plaid jacket and shed even put on the single piece of jewellery she owned which was a filigree necklace purchased the previous summer at accessorize in oxford street hadiyyah had heartily approved of her ensemble that very morning which told barbara she was developing more skill in the puttingoneselftogetherprofessionally department shed come to barbaras bungalow as barbara was indulging in the last bit of her poptart and heroically shed ignored the fag smouldering in the ashtray in favour of complimenting barbara on her growing talents in fashion barbara noted that hadiyyah was not wearing her school uniform and she asked about this holiday today hadiyyah bounced from foot to foot hands on the back of one of the two chairs at barbaras kitchen table which was little larger than a chopping board and generally did duty as that as well the little girl said mummy and i its special barbara its for dad and i must take the day off school mummy phoned and said i was ill today but it was only the littlest lie because of what we have planned its a surprise for dad she hugged herself in glee oh just wait wait wait she cried me why am i part of the surprise i want you to be so mummy says you can know but you mustnt say a word to dad dyou promise see mummy says she and dad had a row well adults do row sometimes dont they and she wants to give him a cheeryouup surprise so thats what were doing today taking him somewhere surprising him at work oh no the surprisell be when he gets home special dinner ill bet much much better than that to barbaras way of thinking there wasnt anything better than a special dinner especially if she wasnt the one who had to cook it she said what then tell me im sworn to secrecy dyou promise and double promise hadiyyah asked triple promise if that will do it hadiyyahs eyes danced along with her feet she pushed away from the table and spun so that her hair flew round her shoulders like a cape she said my brother and sister my brother and sister barbara did you know i have a brother and a sister barbara felt the smile melt from her face she forced it back on a brother and sister really you have a brother and a sister i do i do hadiyyah cried see dad was married once before and he didnt like to tell me cause i spose he thought i was too young but mummy told me and she said its not such a bad thing to be married once before is it and i said no of course it isnt cause lots of kids have parents who arent married any longer and i know them from school so mummy said well thats what happened with dad only his family got so cross with him that they didnt want him to see his children anymore and thats not nice is it well i suppose not barbara said but she was developing a very bad feeling about where this was heading and what the possible outcome would be and how the hell had angelina upman tracked these people down she wondered so hadiyyah allowed a dramatic pause yes barbara prompted so mummy and i are going to fetch them she cried wont that be a wonderful surprise i get to meet them and im ever so excited to have a brother and a sister i never knew and dad gets to see them next and hell be ever so excited as well cause mummy says hes not seen them in years and she doesnt know how old they are even except she thinks that one of them is twelve and the other is fourteen imagine barbara i got an older brother and sister dyou think theyll like me i hope so cause i know ill like them barbaras mouth had gone so dry that she could hardly move her jaw so tightly were her cheeks adhering to her teeth she gulped a mouthful of tepid coffee and said well well well which was just about the only thing she could manage while her brain was racing with thoughts of the bloodyhellwhatshouldido variety friendship demanded that she warn azhar of the impending disaster about to befall him angelina upman presenting him with a fait accompli that he would have had neither time nor opportunity to prevent but did friendship extend that far she asked herself and if she told him what would he do and what effect would whatever he did have on hadiyyah who was as far as barbara could see the most important person involved ultimately barbara had done nothing because she couldnt come up with a plan that didnt culminate in utter havoc being wrought upon too many lives talking to angelina felt like a betrayal of azhar talking to azhar felt like a betrayal of angelina it seemed the better course to stay out of it altogether and let nature or whatever it was take its course shed have to be there to sweep up the pieces but perhaps there would be no pieces to sweep up hadiyyah after all deserved to know her brother and sister perhaps everything would come out of the wash of affairs smelling sweet as roses in june perhaps thus barbara had taken herself to work as usual shed made certain superintendent ardery got the complete eyeful of her days ensemble although shed presented herself to dorothea harriman for a thumbsup first harriman had been copious in her praise detective sergeant havers your hair your makeup stunning although when shed gone on to talk about a new mineralbased foundation that barbara had to try and did the detective sergeant want to pop out at lunchtime and see if they could find it locally barbara drew the line shed said thanks made her bow to superintendent ardery whod handed her the demands from the cps while she spoke to someone on the phone about what sort of cockup is this anyway are you people ever on top of things over there which barbara assumed had to do with so and matters pertaining to forensics she herself got down to work with the cps clerk and it was some time later when she was finally able to resume the work shed been doing for lynley this was easier than before since ardery had to leave to attend to the cockup apparently and if it was a forensics cockup shed be across the river for god only knew how long the moment barbara learned she was out of the building it always paid to be on friendly terms with the blokes who manned the yards underground car park access she was out of there like a cannonball and on her way to the mets library excuses made to the cps bloke who was happy enough to take a very long lunch hour barbara took her englishspanish dictionary with her having gathered enough information on the first two sons of esteban vega y de vasquez and dominga padilla y del torres de vasquez the first two sons being the priest carlos and the dentist miguel and having seen a good enough photo of miguels wife to know that no amount of plastic surgery in the world could have turned her into alatea fairclough barbara was ready to move on to angel santiago and diego to see what she could unearth if none of them had a connection with alatea then she was going to have to look at the rest of the extended family and from what the spanish student had told her on the previous day there could be hundreds of them as it turned out there was very little on angel who despite his name appeared to be the black sheep of the family using her dictionary and moving at a pace so tedious that she thought her outrageously expensive knightsbridge haircut might grow out before she discovered anything useful she ultimately was able to put together the fact that hed caused a car crash that had crippled his passenger for life the passenger had been a fifteenyearold girl barbara followed this lead the fifteenyearold girl being at least the first female shed come across aside from miguels unfortunate wife but she came up with nothing but a dead end no photo was available of her and while there was one of angel he appeared to be round nineteen years old and it didnt matter anyway because after the accident he dropped directly off the media map if he was north american and preferably from the united states at that point he would either have gone into a rehab programme or discovered jesus but this was south america and whatever happened to him after that accident the available media didnt talk about it too small a fish probably theyd quickly moved on to other things so did she santiago she found a story about the boys first communion at least she reckoned it was his first communion because he was standing in a neat arrangement of children in suits the boys and bride getups the girls and either the moonies had decided to begin marrying them off when they were round eight years old or this was a group of children who as catholics in argentina had just been elevated to worthy recipients of the sacrament it was rather odd that there would be a story about a group first communion so barbara struggled through a bit of it she got the gist that the church had burned down and theyd been forced to have their first communion in a city park or so it seemed to barbaras extremely limited skill with spanish truth was the church could have been destroyed by a flood or even an earthquake or perhaps theyd tented the place for termites because god god god this was tedious work having to translate everything a single word at a time she squinted at the photo of the children and looked at it one girl at a time she brought out the internet picture she had of alatea fairclough and she began to compare it to each of the girls their names were listed and there were only fifteen of them and certainly she could do an internet search on each of them but that would take hours and she didnt have hours because once superintendent ardery returned if she wasnt beavering away at the witness statements shed been ordered to deal with at the side of the cps clerk there would be hell to pay she considered choosing the most likely suspect among the girls and having an age progression done upon her but she hardly had the time and she certainly didnt have the authority so she went back to the santiago trail because if he had nothing more to offer her there was nothing else to do other than to move on to diego she found an older picture of santiago playing othello sans black pancake in the eponymous play as an adolescent there was a final picture of him with the school football team and an enormous trophy but then there was nothing just like angel of the car crash he fell off the radar it was as if once the boys reached midadolescence if they hadnt accomplished something important preparing for the priesthood or for dentistry being cases in point then the local news media lost interest in them either that or they became useless to their father politically because after all he was a politician with a politicians bent for trotting out his family in election years to demonstrate their essential wholesomeness for the voters barbara thought about this family politics the voting public she thought about angel she thought about santiago she stared at every photo shed come up with and she ended with the children in the park at their first communion finally she picked up the photograph of alatea fairclough again what is it she whispered tell me your secrets luv but there was nothing a string of noughts stretched out to infinity she muttered a curse and reached for the mouse to log off the internet and get back to diego the final brother later but then she looked a last time at the football photo then at othello from them she went to alatea fairclough then alatea on montenegros arm then she went back to the first communion then she riffled through the photos of alatea faircloughs modelling years she went back and back and back through those photos back through time back to the first one she could find she studied it she finally saw eyes on the terminals screen she reached for her mobile she punched in lynleys number bryanbarrow cumbria can she be forced manette asked freddie they were coursing through the lyth valley at a good speed with freddie behind the wheel theyd just made the turn into the southwest end of it where the emerald fields spread out behind crusty drystone walls on either side of the road and the fells rose above them with peaks that wore the grey shawls of cloud on their shoulders it would be misty up there and soon it would be misty on the valley floor as well a good fog was probably going to develop as the day wore on manette had been consumed by their conversation with niamh cresswell how she wondered could she have known niamh for so many years without really knowing her at all freddie it seemed had been thinking thoughts unrelated to niamh and their call upon her because he glanced manettes way and said who niamh freddie who else can she be forced to take the children back freddie looked doubtful i dont know the law when it comes to parents and children but really old girl what sort of plan would that be to get the law involved oh lord i dont know but we should at least find out what the options are because the very idea that shed just leave tim and gracie to their fate especially little gracie good god freddie does she expect them to go into care can she give them into care for that matter cant someone force her solicitors judges and social services freddie asked how dyou see that sort of thing affecting the children tims in a bad enough way already what with margaret fox school and all that i daresay knowing his mum has been forced by a court to take him back would send the poor lad right over the edge perhaps my mum and dad then manette suggested with that enormous play area shes building mum and dad could take them theyve got the space and the kids would love to be near the lake and to use the play area certainly freddie slowed the car up ahead a flock of sheep were being moved from one paddock into another in a manner typical to cumbria they were in the middle of the road with a border collie directing them and the farmer strolling along behind the pace was as always glacial freddie changed gears and said to manette tims a bit old for play areas wouldnt you say manette and anyway what with this business with vivienne tully just coming to light having the kids move into ireleth hall might be even worse for them than well than whatever other arrangement can be made of course youre right manette sighed she thought about everything shed learned in the last twentyfour hours about her parents but especially about her father she said what dyou think shes going to do your mother he shook his head no idea ive never understood what attracted her to dad in the first place manette said and believe me i havent a clue what vivienne saw in him or continues to see in him because its looking like shes been seeing him for years why on earth would she ever have found dad attractive it cant be money the moneys mothers not his so if theyd divorced hed do fine but he wouldnt have been exactly rolling in the dosh i mean of course hes always had access to it and perhaps vivienne never knew it wasnt actually his its unlikely that she even thought of money when it came to your dad freddie replied i expect it was his selfassurance women like that in a man and your fathers always had selfassurance in spades i wager its what attracted your mother to him manette glanced his way he was still watching the sheep on the road but the tips of his ears were giving him away there was more here than met the eye so she said and hmm the selfassurance bit right well ive always admired that about your father honestly wished i had just a bit of what hes got the ears got redder you not selfassured how can you say that and look at all the women whove been crawling on their knees across broken glass to get at you lately that sort of thing is easy manette its the biological imperative women want a man without knowing why they want him all he has to do is perform and if a man cant perform when a womans pulling his trousers down to have a ride on the pogo stick freddie mcghie manette laughed in spite of herself its true old girl the whole species dies out if the bloke cant do it when a womans getting him ready for it so thats all it is biology the performance is rote technique isnt of course but any bloke can learn a decent technique the sheep ahead of them reached the next field where the gate stood open between the drystone walls the border collie expertly got them through and freddie put the car back into gear he said so we can say your dad developed a good technique but he had to have something to attract women in the first place and thats his confidence he has the sort of confidence that makes a man believe he can do anything and not only does he believe he can do anything but he proves it to people manette could see how this was the case certainly when it came to her parents relationship their initial meeting was part of family lore that fifteenyearold boy strutting up to eighteenyearold valerie fairclough and announcing his intentions towards her shed been intrigued by his cockiness in a world where his kind generally knew where to find their forelocks that feeling of intrigue was all bernie dexter had required the rest was history she said but freddie you can do anything as well have you never believed that about yourself he shot her a diffident smile couldnt hang on to you could i and what mignon said yesterday i always knew you preferred ian prhaps that was the crux of our problems that isnt true manette protested the seventeenyearold girl i was might have preferred ian the woman i became preferred no one but you ah he said but he said nothing more nor did she although she could feel an uneasiness come between them a tension that hadnt been there before she kept quiet as they made the turn that would take them up to bryanbarrow village and ultimately to bryan beck farm when they arrived it was to see a removals van in front of the cottage where george cowley and his son daniel lived when they parked and began to approach the old manor house cowley came out of the cottage and apparently seeing them strolled over to have a word it was brief enough to begin with got what he wanted all along i dare say he spat unappealingly on the stone path that led past gracies trampoline to the front door see how he likes to have a farm not bringing in a bloody penny and hell be changing his tune i beg your pardon freddie was the one to speak he didnt know george cowley and while manette knew him by sight shed never actually spoken to the man hes got big plans he has cowley said using uppercase by means of his intonation were finished here me an dan we take our sheep with us and let him see how he likes it and let him see his way to finding another farmer willing to rent the land and live in that hovel over there and pay through the nose for the pleasure him and his wife and family manette wondered if the cottage was actually large enough for a man his wife and a family as well but she didnt say anything just is tim here mr cowley were looking for him dont know do i george cowley said something wrong with that kid anyways and the others an odd one s well jumping on that trampoline for hours bloody glad i am to be gone from this place you see that bollock licker you tell him i said so you tell him i dont believe his nonsense for a bloody minute no matter what hes got up his sleeve certainly will do freddie said he took manettes arm and steered her to the front door under his breath he said best give him a very wide berth hmm manette agreed clearly the man was a bit off his nut what on earth had he been talking about no one was at home in the old manor house but manette knew where a spare key was kept beneath a lichencovered concrete mushroom halfburied in the garden at the base of an old wisteria leafless now with its massive trunk climbing towards the roof key in their possession they entered the door took them through a passage and into the kitchen where everything was pinneat and the old woodwork of the sagging cabinets had been polished to a glow the place looked better than it had looked prior to ians death clearly kaveh or someone else had been at work upon it this gave manette a feeling of disquiet she was of a mind that devastating grief should produce in someone an equal devastation of spirit of the sort that precluded doing ones house up as if in the expectation of visitors but nothing was out of place in this room not a single cobweb clung to the heavy oak ceiling beams and even in the hidden area high above the old fireplace where meat had once hung to be smoked and preserved during long winters it appeared that someone had used a mop and a cleaning agent on the smoky walls freddie said well no one can claim hes letting the place go to ruin eh as he looked round manette called out tim are you here this was mostly for effect since she knew very well that even if tim was present he was hardly going to come leaping down the stairs or in from the fire house openarmed in greeting nonetheless they checked the place systematically as they went the hallan was empty the fire house was as well like the kitchen every room into which they popped their heads was neat and clean it all looked as it had when ian had been alive only better kept up as if a photographer might be arriving at any moment to shoot pictures for a magazine article on elizabethan buildings they went up the stairs a building of this age would have hideyholes aplenty and they did their best to search them out freddie voiced his opinion that tim was long gone and who could really blame him after what hed been going through but manette wanted to make absolutely sure she looked under beds and poked into wardrobes and even pressed on some of the ancient paneled walls to see if there were hidden chambers she knew she was being ridiculous but she couldnt help herself there was something essentially wrong with the entire picture of bryan beck farm and she was intent upon understanding what it was because for all they knew the real truth was that kaveh had done something to tim to drive him off and then had made a show of looking for him afterwards tims bedroom was the last place they looked and here too all was in order the fact that it was the bedroom of a fourteenyearold boy was nowhere in evidence although his clothing still hung in the wardrobe and his teeshirts and jerseys were folded within the chest of drawers ah freddie said approaching a table that did service as a desk beneath a window on this sat tims laptop computer its top open as if it had been recently used this might give us something he told manette he sat down stretched his fingers and said lets see what we can see manette went to his side and said we dont have his password what do we know about delving into other peoples computers without passwords freddie looked at her and smiled ah you of little faith he said he began to whittle away at the problem which didnt turn out to be much of a problem at all tims computer was set to remember his password they needed only his user name which manette knew since she had done her best to email tim regularly the rest as freddie said was bingo he chuckled at the ease of it all and said to manette i do wish your back had been turned old girl you might actually have thought i was some sort of genius she squeezed his shoulder youre genius enough for me my dear as freddie set about examining emails and trails to various websites manette looked at what was on the desk along with the computer school books an ipod with its docking station and speakers a notebook filled with disturbing pencil drawings of grotesque alien beings consuming various body parts of humans a book on bird watching where had that come from she wondered a pocket knife that she unfolded to see a chilling brown crust of blood on its largest blade and a map printed from the internet she took this last and said freddie could this be car doors slammed outside the house manette leaned over the table to look out of the window she thought it likely that kaveh had returned that perhaps hed found tim himself and had brought him home in which case she and freddie would need to be off the boys computer posthaste but the arrivals werent kaveh as things turned out they were instead an older asian couple possibly iranian like kaveh with them was a teenage girl who looked up at the manor house with a longfingered hand pressed against her lips she shot a glance at the older couple the woman took her arm and together all three of them approached the front door they had to belong to kaveh in some fashion manette thought there were few enough asians in this part of cumbria and hardly any at all in the countryside theyd come on a surprise visit perhaps theyd come to call on their way from point a to point z who knew why theyd come it didnt matter because theyd knock on the door and no one would answer and then theyd skedaddle so that she and freddie could get on with things but that didnt happen apparently with a key in their possession they let themselves inside manette murmured what on earth and then freddie someones arrived its an older couple and a girl i think they belong to kaveh shall i freddie said damn im getting somewhere here can you i dont know can you handle them in some way manette left the room quietly closing the door behind her she made a suitable amount of noise as she descended the stairs she called out hullo hullo cn i help you and she came facetoface with everyone in the passage between the kitchen and the fire house the best course was bluffing manette decided she smiled as if there was nothing unusual in her being inside the manor house she said im manette mcghie im ians cousin you must be friends of kaveh hes not here at the moment they were more than friends of kaveh as it happened they were his parents come up from manchester theyd brought his fiancee newly come from tehran to see what was going to be her home in a few short weeks she and kaveh had not yet met it was not the usual done thing for her future inlaws to bring the bride to call but kaveh had been anxious well what bridegroom wouldnt be and so here they were just a little premarital surprise the girls name was iman and shed dropped her gaze in an appealingly diffident fashion while all this was being said her hair copious lustrous and black fell forward to hide her face but the glimpse manette had caught of it had been enough to see she was very pretty kavehs fiancee manettes smile froze as she took this on board at least there was an explanation now for the pristine state of the house but as to everything else these waters were deep and this poor girl was probably going to drown in them manette said i had no idea kaveh was engaged ian never told me about that whereupon the waters became deeper still who is ian kavehs father asked en route to london when his mobile rang lynley was nearly seventy miles from milnthorpe fast approaching the junction for the m and more than a little disturbed hed been played for a fool by deborah st james and he was far from happy about it hed turned up at the crow and eagle as agreed at half past ten expecting to find her with her bags packed and ready for the drive back to london hed not been concerned at first when she was not waiting for him in the lobby since hed seen her hire car in the car park so he knew she was somewhere about the place if youd ring her room please hed said to the receptionist a girl in a crisp white blouse and black wool skirt whod done so obligingly with a who shall i tell her tommy he said and he saw the flash of a knowing look strike her features the crow and eagle was perhaps a hotbed of hot beds as sergeant havers would have put it a central location for daily assignations among the landed gentry he added fetching her for the drive back to london and then was immediately irritated with himself for doing so he walked away and studied the ubiquitous rack of brochures featuring tourist highlights in cumbria the receptionist cleared her throat after a moment and said no answer sir could be shes in the dining room but she wasnt nor was she in the bar although what deborah would have been doing in the bar at half past ten in the morning was a mystery to him since her car was there right next to where hed parked the healey elliott he sat down to wait there was a bank across the street from the hotel a market square in the town a old church with an appealing graveyard he reckoned she could be having a final look round the place before the long drive it didnt occur to him for some ten minutes that if the receptionist had been ringing deborahs room she clearly hadnt yet checked out of the hotel when it did occur to him he moved fairly rapidly from there to a conclusion of bloody maddening woman he rang her mobile at once of course it went immediately to her voice mail he said you must know im rather unhappy with you at the moment we had an arrangement you and i where the hell are you but there was nothing more to add he knew deborah there was no point in trying to move her from the obdurate stand she had taken with regard to matters in cumbria still he had a look round the town for her before he left telling himself he owed simon that much this ate up more of his day and accomplished nothing save an extended study of milnthorpe which for some reason appeared to have a plethora of chinese takeaways round the market square he finally returned to the inn wrote her a note left it with the receptionist and went on his way when his phone rang on the approach to the m then he thought at first it was deborah ready to be profuse with her apologies he answered without glancing at the incoming number barking what only to hear sergeant haverss voice instead she said right well hullo back at you which one is it then did you have a personality transplant or a tossandturn night he said sorry im on the motorway heading home where else not a good idea sir why whats going on just ring me when you can talk find a services area i dont want you crashing that expensive motor of yours ive already got the bentley on my conscience the next services area was a welcome break and he had to travel some way to find it it was a quarter of an hour before he got there but the car park wasnt crowded and there was virtually no one inside the unappealing sprawl of stickyfloored cafeteria shops newsagents and childrens play area he bought himself a coffee and took it to a table he rang haverss mobile hope youre sitting down were her words when she answered i was sitting down the first time we spoke he reminded her okay okay she brought him up to the minute on what shed been doing which appeared mostly to be keeping out of isabelle arderys sight in order to do research on the internet for which she seemed to be developing a distinct liking she talked about a spanish graduate student her neighbour taymullah azhar with whom lynley was acquainted the town of santa maria de la cruz de los angeles y de los santos and finally the five sons of the mayor of that town she ended with the purpose of her call always someone who liked to build to dramatic moments and heres the situation in a nutshell there is no alatea vasquez y del torres or perhaps better put there is and there isnt an alatea vasquez y del torres hadnt you already established that alateas probably from another part of the family to borrow unblushingly from rock n roll history sir that was yesterday and yesterdays gone meaning meaning alateas from this part of the family shes just not alatea who is she then shes santiago lynley tried to take this in around him a cleaner was industriously mopping the floor casting meaningful glances in his direction as if with the hope hed vacate the premises giving access to the floor beneath his chair he said barbara what on earth do you mean i mean exactly what i say sir alatea is santiago santiago is alatea either that or they are identical twins and if i remember my biology correctly there is no such thing as identical twins of the malefemale sort a biological impossibility so were talking about what exactly are we talking about crossdressing sir impeccable female impersonation a tasty secret one would hope to keep from the family wouldnt you say i would say yes in certain circumstances but in these circumstances havers cut in sir heres how it is the trail on santiago goes dead when hes about fifteen years old thats when i daresay he started passing himself off as someone called alatea he ran away from home round then as well i got that among other details from a phone call to the family she began to tell him what shed learned from her earlier meeting with the graduate student engracia after that call the young woman had placed to argentina the family wanted alatea to come home her father and her brothers now understood carlos hes the priest havers reminded lynley made them understand everyone was praying for alateas return theyd been searching for years she must not continue to run elena marias heart was broken whos elena maria lynley felt as if his head were filling with wet cotton wool cousin havers said way i figure it santiago did a runner because he liked to crossdress which lets face it probably didnt go down a treat with his brothers and his dad latin types you know macho and all that if youll pardon the stereotyping anyway somewhere along the line he met up with raul montenegro who the dickens rich bloke in mexico city rolling in enough lolly to build a concert hall and name it for his mum anyway santiago meets him and raul likes him as in raul likes him because raul likes to bat for the same side if you know what i mean and he prefers his partners young and nubile from what ive seen in photos he prefers them well oiled as well but thats neither here nor there eh anyway weve got heaven in a basket for these two blokes on the one hand we have santiago who likes dressing up and making himself up like a woman which over time hes learned to do bloody well on the other hand we have raul who meets santiago and has no problem whatsoever with santiagos dressing habits since he raul is bent like a twig but would rather not have anyone actually know that so he takes up with santiago who when hes fixed himself up looks like a gorgeous dolly bird and raul can even take him out in public they keep company so to speak until something better comes along that something better being nicholas fairclough i expect lynley shook his head it was all so wildly improbable he said havers tell me are you surmising all this or do you actually have any real facts she was unoffended sir it all fits santiagos mum knew exactly who we were talking about when engracia asked her about alatea she didnt know who engracia was other than someone looking for alatea so she also wouldnt have known that wed already turned up the fact that there were only sons in the family since we knew there were only sons engracia and i both thought alatea was someone else in the extended family just like you did but when i followed the trail on santiago and then went back in time with alateas modeling pictures to find the youngest ones of her believe me sir shes santiago he ran off to take up life as a woman with no one the wiser because of how he looks and once he met raul montenegro he was set things probably just went swimmingly between them alatea and raul till nicholas fairclough came along lynley had to admit there were possibilities in this for nicholas fairclough former drug addict and drunk was probably not going to want his parents to know that he was now living with a man posing as his wife with a false marriage certificate the only documentation that would give this person the right to remain in the country anyway could ian cresswell somehow have discovered all this lynley said more to himself than to havers give that barker a bone was how havers put her agreement to this consideration cause all things considered sir when he first saw her whod have known what he was looking at better than ian cresswell milnthorpe cumbria deborah was feeling rotten even before the receptionist at the crow and eagle handed her tommys message for everything that shed been trying to do was falling apart at the seams shed tried to draw the horrible reporter from the source along the primrose path of there being no story to be got from what they learned from lucy keverne in lancaster since zed benjamin still thought of deborah as the scotland yard detective hed assumed her to be from the first she had hoped that when she said well my work here is finished hed go along and conclude his own work was finished in cumbria as well after all if the putative detective had decided there was no case to answer it stood to reason there was also no story but that was not how zed benjamin looked at matters as things turned out he said the story was just beginning this had filled deborah with horror at what she might be exposing alatea and nicholas fairclough to so she had asked zed benjamin what sort of story he thought he had two people want to pay a woman more than theyre supposed to pay her to be a surrogate mother for their child she pointed out how many people like that are there in the country how many people dont have a friend or a relative whos willing to be a surrogate for free just for compassions sake its a ridiculous law and theres no story to write but again that wasnt how zed benjamin saw it the law itself was the story he declared it produced desperate women looking for desperate remedies using desperate means to attain them deborah said pardon me for saying so mr benjamin but i hardly think the source is going to issue a clarion call for womens reproductive issues upon your recommendation well see hed promised theyd parted ways at the door to her lodgings and shed trudged inside only to be given a sealed envelope with her name written on the outside in a cursive she recognised from years of receiving letters from tommy while she studied photography in california the message was brief deb what can i say tommy and it was true enough what could he say shed lied to him shed ignored his phone call on her mobile and now he was as upset with her as simon was what a mess shed made of things she went to her room and began to pack up her belongings as she did so she considered the various ways in which shed utterly bollocksed up everything first there was the matter of simons brother david whom shed strung along by refusing to make up her mind about the open adoption he was trying to arrange purely out of a desire to help them then there was simon whom shed alienated in any number of ways but particularly by being so bloody minded about remaining in cumbria when it was clear that their real business in the county which had been to assist tommy with his enquiry into ian cresswells death was completed finally there was alatea fairclough whose hopes for a surrogacy were now probably dashed by deborahs bashing into her private affairs when all she wanted was what deborah herself wanted the chance to bring a child into the world deborah stopped packing for a moment and lowered herself to the bed she thought about how much of her life had been dominated over the last few years by something completely out of her control it was beyond her power to grant her own wish she could do nothing to make herself a mother simply because she wanted to be one alatea fairclough had probably gone through exactly what she herself was going through deborah could see at last why the south american woman had been so fearful of her presence and so reluctant to talk to her she and her husband were set to pay someone to carry a baby for them and for all she knew deborah had been sent there to cumbria by lancaster universitys reproduction scientists to sniff out the truth behind her arrangement with lucy keverne before they went forward with all the procedures required for a surrogate pregnancy and thered be a handful of them no doubt about it none of which would begin until the scientists and the doctors were certain about alatea fairclough and the surrogate so deborah had been dogging the poor woman since the moment she herself had set foot in cumbria when all along she and alatea fairclough had in common the most agonising of desires something granted so easily to other women something often even deemed a mistake in the lives of other women as well deborah realised she owed apologies everywhere for how shed conducted herself over the past few days she had to begin those apologies with one to alatea fairclough before leaving cumbria for the south she resolved that was what she was going to do milnthorpe cumbria so much of what zed had said to the scotland yard detective was bluster and he knew it after he dropped her off at her hotel he didnt return to windermere instead he went across the main road through milnthorpe and made his way to the street that ran east to west along the market square there was a spar shop at a junction where another street led off to a grimlooking housing estate of unremittingly grey roughcast and he parked nearby and went inside it was cluttered and hot and it suited both his mood and his thoughts he browsed aimlessly for a few minutes before caving in and buying a copy of the source this he carried the short distance to milnthorpe chippy which stood not far from an impressive butcher shop in whose front window an array of venison pies was displayed inside the chippy zed bought a double order of haddock and chips and a fanta orange once he had his food arranged on the table in front of him he unfolded the source and he girded himself to look at the days lead story and worse at its byline that louse mitchell corsico had both it was a nothing story a real piece of rubbish a very minor member of the royal family had been outed with a bastard child who was mixedrace photos included she was a girl she was five years old she was also pretty in that way that mixedrace people often are having received the best of every chromosome from her progenitors her royal father could not accede to the throne unless the present monarch and family and extended family were all partying on a ship in the atlantic the moment that it hit an iceberg and that detail robbed the story not only of legs but also toes however this fact clearly was of no matter to mitchell corsico or obviously to rodney aronson who would have made the decision to give the tale the front page no matter how minor the minor member of the royal family was the front page suggested this could well be the explosive revelation of the year the decade or even the century and the source was squeezing it like the udders of a dying cow rodney had given it the full treatment threeinch headline photos grainy and otherwise the byline for mitch and a jump to page now that said volumes about what rodney really thought he was offering for public consumption didnt it where the story went into the uninspiring background of the childs mother and the even less inspiring background of the minor royal who unlike a lot of the monarchical family at least had been born with a chin of course the tabloid had to take care political correctness being all the rage but really it was a whobloodygivesatoss piece to offer to the public anyway zeds conclusion was that it had to have been a very slow day in the sewers for this to be what rodney had come up with zed reckoned this might actually put him in a good position to snag the front page when he lined up his cumbria facts and worked them into a story so he pushed the source to one side doused his haddock and chips with malt vinegar popped open his fanta orange and began to sort through what hed gathered on nick fairclough and the delectable alatea big was not a word that could be used to describe the story he had the scotland yard detective had been right in that nick fairclough and his wife were going to pay a woman more than just her expenses to have a baby for them and while this wasnt legal it also wasnt a story the question was how to make it into one a sensational one or at least a memberoftheroyalfamilyhasabastardchild one zed considered his options which were all those details he had to work with essentially he had eggs sperm man woman another woman and money whose eggs whose sperm which man which woman and whose money were the various topics to be massaged into an epic piece of journalism here too there were possibilities perhaps poor alateas eggs were not good enough was there such a thing he wondered to do what they needed to do such as to drop did they drop into her wherever to meet up with nicks youknowwhat since they werent good enough someone elses eggs had to be used but nick and alatea didnt want the family wise to this for reasons of what inheritance what were the laws on inheritance these days was there an inheritance involved anyway beyond a firm manufacturing toilets and other unappealing products the mention of which could turn the story into a real boffola with zed the butt of every joke in fleet street or perhaps nicks swimmers werent up to the job years of drug use had rendered them too weak to make the journey or to do much poking when they reached the destination so someone elses swimmers were being used with the resulting baby being passed off as a bona fide fairclough that would be nice or perhaps it was all about the money that was going to be paid to lucy keverne with nicks history wasnt it possible that he was selling a little something on the side other than toilets to collect enough money to pay the woman could the doctors be on the take as well that was another possibility by the time zed had finished his double order of haddock and chips hed reached the conclusion that the best angle from which to write the tawdry tale of buying a babymaking machine which was how he was going to sell it to rodney was to begin with nick fairclough his reasoning behind this was simple enough he knew human nature perhaps not perfectly but well enough and what he knew about human nature told him that the moment he and the scotland yard detective had left lucy keverne shed picked up the phone to ring alatea fairclough and to let her know the worst that left him with nick and putting a little pressure on him for the real tale behind the deal with the woman in lancaster he gathered up his copy of the source and returned to his car he glanced at his watch and saw from the time of day that nicholas fairclough would probably be at the middlebarrow pele project so to the pele project zed would go his route took him past the crow and eagle and onto the route that led to arnside he zipped alongside milnthorpe sands which were indeed sands at the moment albeit soupy ones because the tide was gone as if it had never been leaving the river kent a narrow gleam of water at the edge of which curlews plovers and redshanks highstepped in their endless search for food beyond from the direction of humphrey head the fog was beginning to creep towards the shore the mist was heavy and the air was laden moisture clung to cottage windows and dripped from trees the road was wet and slick at the pele project zed parked not far from the tower itself he saw no one working at present but when he got out of the car into the damp air he heard at once a burst of raucous male laughter and he followed this to its source which turned out to be the dining tent within all of the men were gathered they sat at the tables but they were not eating their attention was fixed on an older bloke who stood before them in a posture of ease with one foot up on a chair and his elbow resting on his knee he appeared to be telling the others some sort of tale the others appeared to be enjoying it mightily they were also enjoying cups of coffee and tea and their cigarette smoke made the atmosphere eye stinging zed clocked nick fairclough at the same instant that nick fairclough clocked him hed been sitting at the far side of the tent his chair tipped back and his feet on the tabletop but he dropped the chair legs to the ground as his eyes met zeds he came rapidly over to the tents entrance he took zed by the arm and directed him outside he said its not an open meeting and he didnt sound particularly friendly about it at this zed concluded that hed witnessed a bit of what kept the men on the straight and narrow alcoholics anonymous jonesing johnnies united hogs for hope or whatever it was he also concluded that he wasnt going to be welcomed back into nicholas faircloughs life with open arms well that couldnt be helped id like a word zed said to him fairclough tilted his head towards the tent replying ive a meeting as you saw itll have to wait dont think thats possible actually zed took out his notebook to underscore the declaration faircloughs eyes narrowed whats this about lucy keverne who lucy keverne or perhaps you know her by another name shes the surrogate you and your wife are employing fairclough stared at him and zed recognised immediately what the look on the other mans face was telling him the expression itself said are you mad the reason for the question however had nothing whatsoever to do with madness surrogate fairclough said surrogate for what what do you think zed said a surrogate mother id like to talk to you about the deal you and your wife have struck with lucy keverne to carry your child deal nicholas fairclough said there is no deal what the hell are you talking about zed felt the pleasure of the moment wash through him at the same time as bingo chimed in his mind he had his story lets take a little walk he said bryanbarrow cumbria manette was still trying to take in the information as she climbed the stairs having settled kavehs parents and his fiancee in the fire house and having assembled for them tea and biscuits which shed delivered on a tray shed rustled out of a kitchen cupboard god alone could explain why shed done the bit with the tea she thought but at the end of the day she reckoned good manners in conjunction with habit would always out theyd cleared up the confusion about who exactly ian cresswell had been in kavehs life at least as far as his parents had known a few moments discussion of this matter had produced the revelation that in his parents minds kaveh merely lodged chastely with the owner of a farm and the christian name of said owner had never yet been mentioned in any phone calls notes cards or letters from their son miracle of miracles the farm owner had supposedly left the farm to kaveh in his will when he himself had as they say in the vernacular unexpectedly bought the farm more miracle of miracles this at last freed kaveh to marry since he now had a home into which he could welcome his wife of course hed not needed a home as mum and dad had tried to point out to him time and again year after year since he and his wife could live with his parents in a manner traditional to their people in iran where extended families dwelt together for generations but kaveh had been a modern young man with the ideas of a modern british young man and british young men did not bring wives home to live with their parents it was not the done thing although truth to tell the opposite was going to happen kaveh was insisting that his parents join him and his soontobewife on the farm it was they said a successful conclusion to a decade of badgering him to give them grandkids the amount that these good people did not know about their son was staggering and manette made the quick decision not to be the person to burst their bubble she felt a tug of guilt about poor iman and the future that lay before her marrying a man who would most likely set out to lead a double life not unlike the one ian himself had led but what could she do about it and if she did something such as saying excuse me dont you know kavehs been having it off with blokes for years where would that take them aside from into an imbroglio that was not her concern kaveh could do what he liked she decided his family would discover the truth eventually or they would remain blissfully or purposefully ignorant of the matter her job at the moment was to find tim cresswell but at least she knew why tim had run off doubtless kaveh had filled him in on his upcoming nuptials that would have pushed the poor lad over the edge but into what was the question she returned to tims bedroom to see if freddie was making any headway into answering it he was apparently he was still at tims laptop but hed turned it away from the door so someone entering the room couldnt see its screen that someone being her manette reckoned his face was grave she said what is it pornography it goes back quite a way in time what sort are we talking about she made a move to go round his chair which hed also shifted so that he could see when she came into the room he held up his hand you dont want to see this darling freddie what is it it starts out mild not much more than what youd see if a boy managed to get his hands on one of those magazines they keep encased in black wrappers you know what i mean naked women showing off their privates in rather more detail than is actually attractive photographically boys do this kind of thing all the time did you well yes and no i was more of a breast man frankly their artful presentation and all that but times do change eh and then well i met my first girlfriend when i was young enough for this to be freddie dear im talking about the computer is there something more you said it starts out mild oh yes but then it goes on to men and women engaged well you know still normal curiosity perhaps id say but then it changes to men with men because of ian and kaveh perhaps because of his own doubts always a possibility a likelihood even tim would have wanted to understand himself them whatever but freddie sounded so sombre when he said all this that manette knew there was more she said and then what freddie well then it switches from photographs to film live action and the actors or whoever they are change as well he rubbed at his chin and she could hear the scritch of his palm against the whiskers on his flesh and it came to her how comforting a sound that was although she couldnt have told him why she said do i want to know how the actors change men and boys he said young boys manette they look round ten to twelve years old and the films themselves freddie hesitated before he looked at her squarely his dark eyes reflecting the depth of his concern young boys performing on older men sometimes alone but more often in groups i mean its always just one young boy but sometimes theres more than one man theres even well its a mockery of the last supper except it isnt feetwashing that jesus is engaged in and jesus looks round nine years old dear god manette tried to put it together why tims interest would have gone from naked women displaying their genitals to malefemale sex to malemale sex and then eventually to manyoung boy sex she didnt know enough about young adolescent males to understand if this was natural curiosity or something more sinister she feared the latter who wouldnt she thought she said what dyou think we should but had no way to frame the rest of the question because she didnt know what the next step was beyond handing it all over to the police and a child psychologist and hoping for the best from there she said i mean for him to be searching this stuff out well have to tell niamh at the very least but of course what good will that do freddie shook his head hes not been searching manette i dont understand you just said aside from the pictures of women and men and the malemale sex which we might be able to attribute to his confusion about his father and kaveh hes not been searching at all then she twigged hes been sent this stuff theres a trail of emails from someone calling himself toyyou they lead all the way back to a chat room for photography i should guess that various routes through that chat room lead on to types of photography or photographic models or quirky photography or nude photography or any number of potential subjects from which users can then go into moreprivate chat rooms for moreprivate chats the web is called the web for a reason threads lead everywhere you just have to follow them what does this toyyou have to say what youd expect of a slow seduction bit of harmless fun shows affection between consenting adults of course must be of age and then the switch to have a look at this and tell me what you think would you ever consider et cetera freddie whats tim saying in reply freddie tapped his fingers on the desk he appeared to be trying to formulate an answer either that or he was attempting to put together the pieces manette prompted him by saying his name again he finally said tim actually appears to be striking a bargain with this person with toyyou hmm yes the bloke i assume its a bloke says in the last one you do something like this and ill do whatever you want whats this manette asked although she wasnt sure she wanted to know hes referring to another video attached do i want to know garden of gethsemane freddie said but the roman soldiers dont make any arrest manette said my god and then with her eyes widening and her hand lifted to cover her mouth ill do anything you want freddie oh my god do you think tim arranged for this person to kill ian freddie rose quickly the chair scraping the floor he came to her and said no no and touched her cheek briefly that last one it postdates ians drowning whatever tim wants its something besides his fathers death and it looks to me like hes going to receive it in exchange for being part of a pornographic film but what could he want and where is he freddie we have to find him we do indeed but how then she recalled the map shed seen and she rustled for it again among the items that had been on tims desk she said wait wait and then she found it but a glance told her the map was going to be of little use for it was an enlarged section of some unnamed town and unless freddie knew where lake oldfield alexandra woodland and holly roads were they were going to have to waste time trying to rustle up a street atlas sort out how to use this information on the internet or perform some magical feat to discover what town in cumbria contained these places she said its nothing nothing its just streets freddie and she shoved the map at him she said what next we must find him we must he gave the map a glance and folded it quickly he unplugged the laptop and said lets be off where she asked where on earth do you know god she thought why had she ever divorced this man no idea he said but ive a notion who will arnside cumbria lynley made excellent time the healey elliott had been designed originally as a racing car and despite its age it did not disappoint he had no flashing lights to use but the time of day and year did not make them necessary he was coursing off the motorway in an hours time at which point the slickness of the streets and the heaviness of the mist encouraged him to have care with regard to his speed the difficult bit was getting from the motorway over to milnthorpe and from milnthorpe to arnside off the motorway the roads were narrow not one of them was straight there were few laybys into which slow drivers could pull to allow him to pass and every farmer in cumbria appeared to have chosen this day to move his tractor like a lumbering pachyderm from one spot to another lynley felt a sense of rising urgency it had to do with deborah god only knew what she would stumble into at this point but she was obstinate enough to do something mad that would put her straight into the path of danger how he wondered did simon manage not to wring her neck along the route from milnthorpe to arnside at last he saw the fog unlike the little cats feet of the poem this bank of grey was moving across the empty plain of morecambe bays ebbed tide with startling swiftness as if pulled along by unseen horses dragging a mantle of coal smoke behind them he slowed at arnside village hed not been to arnside house but he knew where it was from deborahs description he passed a pier jutting into the wide and waterless channel of the estuarial river kent and he braked to allow a woman with a pushchair to cross the street a child hanging on to her trousers with a mittened hand and otherwise bundled against the chill as they crossed taking their bloody time about it he thought and why was it that when one was in a hurry all occasions conspired against one he read the sign warning all the dangers of this place fast rising tides it shouted quicksands hidden channels danger beware why on earth he wondered futilely would someone want to bring up children here when one wrong move at one wrong time of day would snatch them towards a watery end the woman and child crossed safely to the pavement on the other side of the road he went on through the village down the promenade with its display of victorian mansions lined up on a rise of land overlooking the water and then he was on the drive into arnside house where the promenade ended the building was set at an angle that made the most of its view across an expanse of lawn from the water that view was obscured today as the fog became more and more like wet cotton wool once singed by fire arnside house itself looked deserted with no lights burning in the windows despite the gloom of the day he couldnt decide if this was bad or good no car meant at least there was a very good chance that deborah had not bulldogged her way into a bad situation the best scenario of all would be no one at home but he couldnt rely on that he braked the healey elliott at the top of the driveway where the gravel shaped into a winnow for parking when he got out of the car he found that the air had altered in the few hours hed been gone it felt nearly tubercular in his lungs he moved through it like someone separating curtains along the path to the heavy front door he heard the bell ring somewhere inside the place he expected no answer but this was not the case he heard footsteps against a stone entry and the door swung open then he faced the most beautiful woman hed ever seen he was unprepared for the shock of alatea fairclough the tawny skin the wealth of wild curly hair captured in tortoiseshell slides the large dark eyes and sensuous mouth the shape of a woman who was entirely woman only her hands betrayed her and even then it was only by their size he had no trouble at all seeing how alatea and nicholas fairclough had duped everyone around them had barbara havers not sworn this woman was in fact santiago vasquez y del torres lynley would not have believed it truth to tell he still couldnt so he was careful with his words mrs fairclough he said when she nodded he took out his identification he said di thomas lynley new scotland yard ive come to talk to you about santiago vasquez y del torres she went white so quickly that lynley thought she would faint she took a step away from the door he repeated the name santiago vasquez y del torres it seems the names familiar to you she felt behind her for the oak bench that ran the length of one of the panelled walls of the entrance she lowered herself onto it lynley shut the door behind him there was little light what there was came from four small windows in the entrance all of them stained glass in a stylised pattern of red tulips surrounded by greenery which cast a subtle glow against the skin of the woman or he thought whatever she was who sat slumped on the bench he still wasnt certain of his facts but he chose to take a stab at being direct and waiting for the consequences so he said we must speak ive reason to believe youre santiago vasquez y del torres from santa maria de la cruz del los angeles y de los santos in argentina please dont call me that is that your true name not since mexico city raul montenegro she reared up at that her back against the wall has he sent you is he here ive not been sent by anyone i dont believe you she rose then she hurried past him nearly losing her footing on the step that gave access through a doorway into a dark corridor panelled like the entrance in oak he followed her a short distance along the corridor she slid open two pocket doors with stained glass panes of lilies surrounded by drooping fronds and she passed through them and into a hall it was half restored and half in tatters an odd mixture of medieval revival and arts and crafts and there she made for an inglenook fireplace where she sat in the most sheltered corner drawing her knees up to her face please leave me she said although she seemed to be speaking more to herself than to him please leave im afraid thats not possible you must leave dont you see no one here knows you must leave at once lynley thought it unlikely that no one knew indeed he thought it wildly improbable he said i daresay ian cresswell knew at that she raised her head her eyes were luminous but her expression was shifting from distraught to confused ian she said theres no possible way how could he ever have known as a homosexual man still in the closet his was a double life he would have come into contact with people like you it would have been easier for him than for other people to recognise is that what you think i am she asked a homosexual man a transvestite a crossdresser a dawning knowledge came over her face she added youre thinking that i killed ian arent you because he what he discovered something because then he threatened to betray me if i didnt what pay him money that i didnt have oh my god had that only been the case lynley found himself quite down the rabbit hole the nature of her initial response to the name santiago vasquez y del torres had indicated she was indeed the longago adolescent boy whod run off from the town of his birth and somehow ended up on the arm of one raul montenegro but her reaction to the suggestion that ian cresswell had come to know who and what she was was beginning to alter lynleys thoughts on the subject she said ian didnt know no one here knew not a single person are you telling me that nicholas doesnt know lynley stared at her he tried to take her in making sense of what she was telling him demanded he take a leap into an area that was completely unknown to him he was like a blind man trying to get himself to a hidden doorway in a room cluttered with furniture whose misshapen nature only confused him he said if thats the case i dont quite understand how could nicholas not have known because she said i never told him but i daresay his own eyes and then lynley began to understand what she was actually revealing about herself if shed never told nicholas fairclough about santiago vasquez y del torres and if nicholas faircloughs own eyes hadnt told him there was only one reason for this yes she said apparently reading the dawning knowledge on his features only my immediate family in argentina know along with one cousin elena maria and elena maria she always knew right from the first even when we were children alatea pushed her hair from her face a distinctly feminine gesture that was discommoding to lynley putting him off balance as perhaps she intended she shared with me her dolls when we were children her clothes and her makeup when we grew older alatea looked away for a moment then back at him directly her expression earnest as she said can you understand this it was a way for me just to be it was the only way for me just to be and this elena maria understood i dont know how or why but she simply did before anyone she knew who and what i was a woman lynley finally put it into words trapped in a mans body but still a woman yes alatea agreed lynley took this in he could see that she was waiting for his reaction perhaps steeling herself to whatever it would be revulsion confusion curiosity disgust pity abhorrence interest acceptance shed been one of five brothers in a world where being male equated with being accorded privileges that women had had to fight for and were still fighting for she would know that most men would never comprehend why any man from that world would wish to change the gender into which hed been born yet this apparently was what she had done as she went on to clarify saying even when i was santiago i was a woman i had the body of a male but i was not male to live like that belonging nowhere having a body that is not your own body so that you look upon it with loathing and would do anything to alter it in order to be who you are so you became a woman lynley said i transitioned she said this is what its called i left santa maria because i wished to live as a woman and could not do it there because of my father his position our family many things and then came raul he had the money i needed to become a woman and he had his own needs so we made a deal he and i no one else was involved and no one else knew she looked at him then over the years hed seen the various expressions that flitted across the faces of desperate crafty or sly people when they attempted to play with the truth they always thought they could hide who they were but only the sociopath ever succeeded because the reality was that eyes were indeed windows into the soul and only the sociopath was soulless there was a bench seat opposite alateas position in the inglenook lynley went to it and sat he said the death of ian cresswell i had nothing to do with that if i were to kill anyone it would be raul montenegro but i dont want to kill him i never wanted to kill him i just wanted to flee him and even then it wasnt because rauls intention was to betray who i am he wouldnt have done that because he needed to have a woman on his arm not a real woman you see but a man who could pass as a woman to safeguard his reputation in his world what he didnt understand and what i didnt tell him was that i didnt want to pass as a woman because i already was one i only needed surgery to make it so he paid for it in exchange he thought for the perfect relationship between two men one of whom looks to all of the world like a woman a homosexual relationship a form of one which really cannot exist when one of the partners is not of the same sex you see our problem mine and rauls was that we did not clearly understand each other before we began this this venture or perhaps i deliberately misunderstood what he wanted from me because i was desperate and he was my only way out why do you think hes pursuing you now she said without irony or selfcongratulation wouldnt you thomas lynley he spent a great deal of money to make me and hes had little enough return on his investment what does nicholas know nothing how can that be i had the final surgery many years ago in mexico city when i knew i could not be what raul wanted me to be i left him and mexico i was here and there never remaining any place long finally i was in utah and so was nicky but you would have had to tell him why do you think that because well it was obvious there were certain things her body was never going to be able to do she said i thought i could go forever as a woman without nicky knowing but then he wished to come home to england and he wished even more to make his father proud he saw a single way to do it a certain guarantee of his fathers happiness we would do what neither of his sisters had managed to do we would have a child and give bernard a grandchild and this would heal forever the damage nicky had done to his relationship with his father and his mother during all his years of addiction so now you must tell him she shook her head how can i tell him of such betrayal could you i dont know i could love him i could be a lover to him i could make a home for him and do everything a woman might do for a man except this one thing and to submit to a doctors examination as to why i havent yet become pregnant ive lied to nicky from the first because i was used to lying because thats what we do because thats what we have to do to get on in the world its called stealth and its how we live the only difference between me and the rest of the people who have transitioned from male to female is that i hid it from the man i love because i thought if he knew he would not wish to marry me and take me to a place where raul montenegro would never find me that was my sin you know you must tell him i must indeed do something she said arnside cumbria he was drawing his car keys from his pocket when deborah drove her hire car up to arnside house he remained where he was and their eyes locked on each other she pulled up next to the healey elliott got out and stood there looking at him for a moment at least he thought she had the grace and decency to look regretful she said im so sorry tommy ah he said well have you waited all this time no i was on my way back to london about an hour from here barbara rang my mobile there were a few loose ends i thought it best to tie them what sort of loose ends none that actually have anything to do with ian cresswells death as things turn out where have you been lancaster again you know me too well yes therell always be that between us wont there he looked past her to see that during his time inside arnside house the fog had reached the seawall it was beginning to billow up and over it reaching long cold fingers onto the lawn he needed to leave at once in order to reach the motorway before the mist became impenetrable but with it fast making all of cumbria dangerous he didnt see how he could in conscience depart unless deborah was with him deborah said i needed to speak to her one more time lucy keverne but i knew youd not allow it lynley raised an eyebrow i dont allow or not allow anything youre a free agent deborah i told you on the phone i merely wanted your company on the drive back to town she dropped her head that red hair of hers always her most becoming feature swung down from her shoulders and he saw how quickly it was being affected by the mist curls of it were separating forming other curls medusa he thought well shed always had that effect on him hadnt she as it turns out i was right she said i mean there was more to the story than lucy keverne told me im just not sure it would go far as a motive for anyone to murder ian cresswell what is it then that alatea was indeed going to pay her to carry a baby more than her expenses that is so well i suppose the storys not as sensational as i thought it might be i cant really imagine anyone committing murder over it this told lynley that lucy keverne whoever she was either didnt know the full truth about alatea fairclough or shed not told the full truth to deborah for the actual story was sensational in spades driven by those three prongs that dominated human behaviour sex power and money the story gave anyone in possession of it reason to ride it as far as it would go but to murder as well deborah was probably correct in this the one part of the story ian cresswell might have been murdered over was the part of the story lucy keverne had not known if alatea fairclough was to be believed and he thought she was and now he said to deborah actually ive come to apologise to alatea ive made her life a misery for these past days and i think ive put paid to her plans with lucy as well i didnt intend to but that infernal reporter from the source burst into our conversation and announced that i was the scotland yard detective in cumbria to investigate ian cresswells death and she sighed she shook her hair off her shoulders and fingered it back in a gesture exactly like alateas she said if ive made lucy afraid to carry this baby for alatea tommy ive done her a serious wrong shell have to go back to square one and find another surrogate i thought well we have something in common she and i dont we this business about babies i wanted to tell her that much at least along with an apology and the truth about who i am she meant well lynley thought but he couldnt help wondering if she would make things worse for alatea he didnt see how deborah didnt know the full truth and he wasnt about to tell her there was no need at this point his business was finished here ian cresswell was gone and who alatea fairclough was and what she would reveal to her husband were matters for a divinity which he certainly was not deborah said will you wait for me ill not be long perhaps at the hotel he thought about it it seemed the best solution still he said if you change your mind ring me this time all right i promise she said and i wont change my mind milnthorpe cumbria zed didnt go back to his b amp b in windermere all things considered it was too far to drive with what he had simmering on the back burner of his brain and what he had was a stopthepresses story one that he had to get written in order to stop those presses as soon as possible he felt more alive than he had in months nick fairclough had tried to hide everything from him but he succeeded just about as well as a fat man trying to remain unseen by hiding behind a sapling from start to finish the poor dumb bloke had been completely in the dark about what his wife had been cooking up with lucy keverne the way zed reckoned it the two women had planned to go the turkey baster route and spring the situation on poor nick when lucy was too far up the duff for nick to cry foul and demand they do something about it zed didnt quite have all the finer points of the tale since so far nick had been as mute as a lump of coal on the topic of his semen and what alatea had been doing with it or whether even shed got her hands on it but the way he saw it that was a minor detail the crux of the story was a husband being duped by two women for a delicious reason that was bound to emerge once the first part of the tale appeared on the front page of the source within twentyfour hours of that occurring the usual suspects would crawl out from beneath their rocks to spill whatever beans they were holding in their pots on the topic of nick lucy and alatea not to mix too many metaphors zed thought but the truth behind his kind of journalism was that one story always led to another like day to night to day again first though he had to get the story he had thus far onto the front page of the paper and oh what a story it was scotland yard in cumbria to investigate a murder only to stumble upon a nefarious plot in which a duplicitous wife meets a scheming young playwright willing to sell off her womb like a room to let there were shades of prostitution here as well zed reckoned for if lucy keverne was selling one part of her body didnt it stand to reason that at one time or another shed been selling other parts of her body as well since zeds route took him by the crow and eagle he pulled into its car park theyd have an internet connection here wireless or otherwise because how likely was it that a hotel hoping to stay in business in this day and age existed sans a connection to the web no hotel at all he put his money on that he had no laptop with him but that wasnt going to matter he intended to hand over a wad of cash for the use of the hotels computer at this time of year there werent going to be hordes of potential tourists sending enquiries to the place via emails needing instantaneous answers twenty minutes online was all he required hed finetune the piece once rod read it and rod would read it for as soon as zed was finished with the piece hed fire it off to his editor and ring him as well zed zipped into the car park and gathered up his notes these he always carried with him they were his stock in trade his jewels his little precious where he went they went for the simple reason that one never knew where a story would appear inside the place he approached the reception desk with his wallet out and his money ready he counted out one hundred pounds hed put it on his expense account later right now though there was a story waiting he leaned over her desk and put the money onto the keyboard of the young womans computer its screen was on but she hadnt been using it instead shed been yammering on the phone to someone apparently requiring information about the exact dimensions of every bedroom in the place she looked at zed then at the money then at zed she said moment please into the phone and held the earpiece against her bony shoulder as she waited for zeds explanation he gave it quickly enough and she was quick enough to decide she rang off on whoever had been at the other end of her phone conversation scooped up the money and said let voice mail take the calls if any come in you wont say and she gestured round to complete her question youve gone to see about a room for me he assured her ive just booked in and youre letting me use this thing to check for crucial messages twenty minutes she nodded she pocketed the ten and twentypound notes and headed for the stairs to play her part he waited till shed mounted them and made the turn round the landing before he began to write the story led in every direction its parts were like tributaries pouring into the amazon and all he had to do was paddle up them he began to do so he went first with the scotland yard angle and the irony attached to it a detective sent up to cumbria to investigate the drowning of ian cresswell ends up stumbling upon an illegal surrogacy deal that could bet on it lead to an entire illegal surrogacy ring that fed on the desperation of couples struggling to conceive then he touched on the artistic angle the struggling playwright so desperate to support herself that she was willing to sell her body in pursuit of the higher calling of her art he moved directly from there to the deception angle and was pounding away at the tale of nick faircloughs ignorance in the manner of his wifes deal with lucy keverne when his cell phone rang yaffa he thought he needed to tell her that all was well she would be worrying about him she would want to encourage him she would have words of wisdom and he wanted to hear them and more than that he wanted to interrupt her with the news of his impending triumph got it he said darling its hot i didnt know you and i were that close rodney aronson said where the bloody hell are you why arent you back in london by now zed stopped typing im not in london he said because ive got the story all of it from bloody alpha to sodding omega hold the front page because youre going to want this plastered across it what is it rodney didnt sound like a man experiencing a cometojesus moment zed rattled it all off the surrogacy deal the starving artist the husband in ignorance he saved the very best for last the humble reporter that would be me he pointed out working handinglove with the detective from new scotland yard she and i cornered the woman in lancaster zed announced and once we had her hang on rodney said she and i right the scotland yard detective and i shes called ds cotter detective sergeant shes the one investigating the cresswell death only she got sidetracked onto nick fairclough and his wife and as it turned out that was a dynamite direction not for her of course but for me rodney said nothing at his end zed waited for the kudos to flow he waited in vain for a moment he thought theyd been cut off he said rod you there rodney finally said you are one fucking loser zedekiah you know that dont you one fucking classa loser sorry there is no detective cotter you idiot but detective inspector lynley is up there the bloke whose wife took a bullet from a twelveyearold kid last winter sound familiar it was frontpage news for two weeks he didnt wait for zed to make a reply instead he went on with jesus you are pathetic you know get back to town collect your wages you and the source are through arnside cumbria alatea saw them in the driveway their body language told her everything this was not a conversation between strangers who happen to come upon each other in passing at the same destination this was an exchange between colleagues friends or associates the exchange was one of information shared she could tell this much when the woman tilted her head towards arnside house in the manner of someone speaking about it or more likely speaking about a person within it or most likely speaking about her about alatea once santiago about her past and what would now be her future alatea didnt wait to see anything more pass between the woman and the man from scotland yard her world was collapsing so quickly around her that the only idea she had in her mind was flight she would have run like a lioness in pursuit of food if she had a single place she could go but her routes were limited so she was forced to calm herself long enough to think just to think the woman needed confirmation of alateas identity the detective obviously would give it courtesy of alatea herself who could have denied who should have denied but who had not thought quickly enough to deny that much was established for what else could they have to discuss with each other the only questions that possibly remained were those that alatea herself could ask had the woman outside with the scotland yard detective sent photos of alatea to raul montenegro already if she had not was she open to bribery a payment for maintaining silence for reporting to raul that santiago vasquez y del torres who had become alatea vasquez y del torres who had married nicholas fairclough to escape a past that tied her to a man she had learned to hate was not in cumbria was not in england was nowhere in the uk to be found if she was open to bribery alatea was safe only for now of course but now was all she had she ran to the stairway she flew to the bedroom she shared with nicholas and from beneath the bed she brought out a locked box a key from her dressing table gained her access and within the box she had money not a lot not a fortune not what raul was paying to find her surely but along with her jewellery perhaps there was enough to tempt this woman who was closing in now who was hearing the truth from the detective even as alatea gathered what she could to keep that truth from spilling out of the hidden corners of her life she was back down stairs when the expected knock sounded against the front door the woman would not know alatea had seen her in conversation with inspector lynley for a moment this gave alatea the upper hand and she intended to use it she pressed her slick hands against her trouser legs she closed her eyes briefly and said dios mio por favor and then she opened the door with as much assurance as she could muster the redhaired woman spoke first saying mrs fairclough ive not been truthful with you may i come in and explain what do you want from me for her part alatea was stiff and formal there was nothing to shame her she told herself she had already paid the price of rauls help in altering her body she would not pay more ive been following you and watching you the woman said you must know that what is he paying you alatea asked theres no money involved theres always money involved i cant afford to pay what hes paying but i ask you no i beg you alatea turned from the woman to where shed placed the strongbox and her jewellery i have this she said as she scooped up these things i can give you this the woman took a step backwards she said i dont want these things im here only to you must take them and then you must leave you dont know him you cannot know what people like him are capable of the woman thought her brows drawn together and her eyes on alatea as she weighed the words shed heard alatea thrust the money and the jewellery at her once again but the woman nodded and she said ah i do see im afraid it might be too late mrs fairclough some things are unstoppable and i think he could be one of them theres a desperation to him he doesnt say exactly but i get the impression theres a lot on the line for him just now hed make you believe that thats how he is it was clever of him to use a woman for reassurance he thinks to calm my fears while all the while his intention is to destroy me he has the power to do this and he intends to use it theres no story though no real story not a story that a paper like the source would care about and this is supposed to reassure me alatea demanded what does a story in the source have to do with anything what does it have to do with what hes asking of you youve photographed me havent you youve followed me and youve photographed me and thats the proof he wants you dont understand the other woman said he doesnt need proof these types never do proof is nothing to them they start their business just this side of the law and if they slip over onto the other side they have a score of solicitors to take care of the problem then let me buy your photos alatea said if he sees them if he sees me in them she took off her wedding rings the diamond and the band she took off a large emerald that valerie fairclough had given her as a wedding gift she said here please take these as well in exchange for your photos but photos are nothing theyre meaningless without words its the words that count its whats written that counts and anyway i dont want your money and i dont want your jewellery i just want to apologise for well for everything but especially for how i might have ruined things for you were much the same you and i with different cause i daresay but otherwise the same alatea clung to what an apology from this woman might mean she said so you wont tell him the woman looked regretful im afraid he knows thats the point thats why ive come i want you to be ready for what might come next and to know its my fault and to know how terribly sorry i am i tried to keep things from him but these people have ways of finding things out and once he came to cumbria im so sorry mrs fairclough alatea took this in fully and realised what it meant not only to her but to nicky and to their life together she said hes here in cumbria hes been here for days i thought you would have known didnt he where is he now tell me windermere i think other than that i dont know nothing else remained to be said but many things remained to be done alatea said goodbye to the woman and like someone in a dream she gathered everything shed brought down from the bedroom in the hope of bribing her it was just as well she thought that the woman had refused her offerings she would need them now herself in the coming days for shed run out of options she went back up the stairs to the bedroom and threw the jewellery and money onto the bed from the box room at the end of the corridor she brought out a small valise there was little enough time to gather the things she would need back in the bedroom she went to the chest of drawers it stood between two windows and the sound of a car door slamming outside drew her attention to the front of the house again she saw that on the worst possible day nicky had come home from the pele project early he was now in conversation with the redhaired woman he was violent faced his voice grew loud although through the glass of the window alatea could not understand his words but understanding the words didnt matter only the fact that they were speaking to each other mattered that in conjunction with nickys expression gave testimony to the topic between them seeing this alatea saw also that even when it came to escape she was out of options she could not leave in her car for nicky and the woman stood on the fan of gravel across which she would need to drive she could not go by foot to the railway station at the far end of arnside village for the only route there went directly between her husband and the woman where they stood talking so she prayed for some kind of answer to come to her and she paced the room until she saw it it was through the window just as the vision of nicky and the redhaired woman had been but it was the window on a wall perpendicular to that which overlooked the driveway this window offered a view of the lawn and beyond it the seawall sketched a stony line of demarcation between the lawn and the sea walk along the bay beyond which was the bay itself today was one of the days during which the tide had ebbed for miles this meant the remaining sands were hers she could cross them and make for grangeoversands a few miles away another railway station awaited her there all she needed to do was to reach it just a few miles then that was all she needed and she would be free windermere cumbria tim had spent the night beneath a caravan at fallbarrow park at the edge of the lake on his way there from shots hed pinched a blanket from the windermere fire station where a smokescented stack of them just inside an open door seemed like a message telling him that here were his means of passing the time until toyyou was ready for him he himself was ready for toyyou he felt the need for escape like a weight on his chest soon he told himself hed have the only answer hed wanted to the question that his life had become since kaveh mehran had sauntered into it the caravan provided him shelter from the nights rain and against a tyre and huddled into his stolen blanket he escaped the worst of the cold thus hed slept rough and when he returned to the business centre towards the end of an afternoon the day of which hed spent sulking round the town he looked as bad as he felt most of his bones aching and every inch of him reeking toyyou directed one glance at him and had one whiff of him and said in brief no way in hell he pointed him in the direction of the loo told him to do what he could to make himself less malodorous and when tim emerged he handed him three twentypound notes go into town and get something decent to wear he told him if you think youre going to meet your fellow actors looking like that think again they wont want anything to do with you tim said whats the problem its not like well have our clothes on is it toyyou made a thin line of his lips get something to eat as well i dont want you complaining in the middle of things that youve missed your dinner im not going to complain thats where they all begin fuck tim said as he took the money whatever exactly right toyyou said sardonically thats the spirit mate fuck whatever when he left shots tim headed back for the shops he found oddly enough that he was hungry hed thought it unlikely hed ever be eating again but a hunger came on him as he passed the fire station again and the scent of bacon on the grill formed a cloud through which he passed the smell made his mouth water unexpectedly it put him in mind of breakfasts in his childhood hot bacon rolls and scrambled eggs his stomach rumbled accordingly okay he thought so he would find something to eat hed get the clothing first though he knew where an oxfam was in the centre of town and that would do when it came to trousers and some kind of jersey no way in hell was he about to purchase something new from one of the other shops waste of money that he wouldnt need new clothes after today at oxfam he found a pair of old corduroy trousers worn in the arse but they were in his size and that was good enough for tim to this he added a poloneck sweater and as he already had shoes socks and an anorak he needed nothing else the purchase left him with plenty of money to buy a meal but he reckoned hed just get a sandwich from the grocery perhaps a bag of kettle chips and a drink as well the rest hed post to gracie inside a card hed write a message about taking care of herself first and worrying about the rest of the world later because no one he would tell her was about to take care of her no matter how nice she tried to be to them then hed apologise about bella he still felt dead awful that hed damaged bella he hoped the woman at the electronics repair shop could fix her properly it was funny though tim thought as he left oxfam with his purchases and made for the grocery he was actually feeling a bit lighter hed made a decision and relief came with it it was odd to consider that for so very long hed felt so terribly wretched when all he ever had had to do was simply decide windermere cumbria they had to wait nearly a half hour at the police station in windermere which was where freddie drove them they had tims laptop with them as well as the map the boy had printed out both of them had thought that simply walking into the police station and announcing they had information about a child pornography ring was going to light a serious conflagration under someones office chair but that had not been the case like a doctors surgery they had to wait their turn and as each moment passed manettes anxiety climbed roofward its all right old girl freddie had murmured more than once hed taken to holding her hand as well and he made gentle finger circles upon it just as hed done in the early days of their marriage well manage it all in time whatever it is manette said freddie you and i both know it could already have happened it could be going on while were waiting here he could be they could be i blame niamh for this no point in blaming freddie said quietly thats not going to get us the boy when at last they were ushered into an office freddie quickly logged on to tims email and brought up the exchanges the boy had had with toyyou as well as the photos and videos that had been sent to him once again and ever the gentleman freddie made sure that manette couldnt see what the films were but she could tell from the expression on the constables face that they were indeed as bad as freddie had indicated the constable picked up a phone and punched in three numbers he said to whoever answered connie youre going to want to look at a laptop ive got my paws on will do he rang off and said to freddie and manette five minutes whos connie manette asked superintendent connie calva he said head of vice have anything else manette remembered the map she fished it out of her bag and handed it over she said tim had this amongst the things on his desk freddie thought it best to bring it i dont know how useful i mean we dont know the streets involved they could be anywhere freddie said i reckoned youd have someone who could go back and find the map tim began with this is an enlargement he printed the full map should be easy enough to find for someone better versed than i am in internet maps the constable took it from freddie reaching into his desk simultaneously and bringing out a magnifying glass it was the oddest thing for him to have manette thought harking back to sherlock holmes but he made a reasonable use of it applying it to the map in order to read the names of the streets more clearly he was saying as he did all this this sort of things usually done in barrow at the constabulary weve a forensic computer specialist there and ah hang on this is easy enough he looked up at them as a woman in jeans kneehigh leather boots and a tartan plaid waistcoat stepped into the room presumably superintendent calva she said whatve we got ewan and nodded to manette and freddie ewan handed over the laptop and waved the map at her as well enough of the bad nasty on that to make you fear lightning strikes from god he said in reference to the computer and this is a printout map of the area round the business centre you know where these streets are manette asked it seemed too much to hope for oh aye ewan said theyre right here in town not ten minutes away manette grabbed freddies arm but spoke to the constable we must go there at once they intend to film him theyll be doing it there we must stop them the constable held up his hand bit of trouble with that route he said connie calva had gone to a desk nearby and had begun to study the laptop as she removed a piece of gum from its silver wrapper and folded it into her mouth she wore the weary expression of a woman whod already seen it all but that expression altered as she moved from image to image manette could tell when shed reached the videos she stopped chewing her face altered to a careful blank what sort of trouble freddie was asking in the meantime these streets are lined with private homes and b amp bs theres a fire station there and like i said a business centre as well we cant go barging in left and right without something to go on the laptops filled with it aye but how dyou make the connection between the laptop and this map aside from the user having found the map online dyou see what i mean now youve brought us some excellent information and superintendent calva will get onto it directly and when we know more but the boy is missing manette cried hes been gone for over twentyfour hours and with this on his computer and a blatant invitation to be part of a film in which god only knows what is about to happen hes fourteen years old the constable said got that but weve the rule of law bugger the law manette cried do something she felt freddie then his arm went round her waist ah yes he said we see she cried are you mad theyve got to follow their procedure but freddie manette his gaze shifted to the door and his eyebrows rose lets let them get on with it eh she knew that he was asking for her trust but in that moment she trusted no one still she couldnt take her eyes off freddie who was on her side in all things she haltingly said yes yes all right and once theyd given every possible piece of information they could to the constable and to superintendent calva they went out to the street what manette said to freddie in anguish what we need a map of the town freddie told her which we should be able to find in a bookshop easily enough and then she asked him then we need a plan he said either that or one monumental excellent piece of luck windermere cumbria they had the latter the police station was on the outskirts of town straddling bownessonwindermere and windermere itself when they left the station freddie drove further into windermere and they were traveling up lake road just coming upon new road when manette spotted tim he was leaving a small grocery a striped blue and white plastic bag in his hands he was inspecting its contents and he fished inside to bring out a bag of crisps which he proceeded to tear open with his teeth manette cried there he is pull over freddie hang on old girl freddie drove on she cried but what are you and she squirmed in her seat well lose him a short distance along freddie pulled to the kerb once tim was safely behind them and walking in the opposite direction he said to manette youve got your mobile of course but freddie listen darling theres more involved here than just scooping up tim but hes in danger as are a lot of other children you have your mobile set it to vibrate and follow him ill park and ring you all right he should lead us to wherever theyre going to film if thats what hes here for she saw logic in this cool and clearheaded freddie logic she said yes yes of course youre right and grabbed her bag and made certain of her mobile she started to get out of the car but then she stopped and turned to him what he said youre the most wonderful man freddie mcghie she told him nothing thats happened before this moment matters as much as much as what as my loving you she shut the car door smartly before he replied arnside cumbria nicholas fairclough made very short order of letting deborah feel his wrath he jerked his car to a halt in the driveway and leapt out onto the gravel he strode towards her saying who the hell are you then what are you doing here for a man whose previous meetings with her had been conducted in such a mildmannered fashion fairclough was completely transformed if eyes could be said to blaze his were doing just that where is he how much time do we have deborah felt pinned by the ferocity of the questions and only able to express herself inarticulately she stammered i dont know how long do these things take im not sure mr fairclough i tried you see i did tell him there was no story to be had because thats the truth of the matter there is no story fairclough drew himself up at that as if deborah had placed her hand on his chest to stop him he said story what who the hell are you christ dyou work for the source as well montenegro didnt send you deborah frowned the source no thats something entirely who on earths montenegro nicholas looked from her to arnside house and back to her who the hell are you he demanded deborah st james as i always was as i said i was but theres no film theres no documentary weve worked that out theres bloody nothing youve told us thats true so what do you want what do you know youve been to lancaster with that bloke from the source hes told me as much or can i not believe him either deborah licked her lips it was cold and damp and miserable out of doors and the fog was becoming thicker as they spoke she wanted a coal fire and something hot to drink if only to hold the cup in her hands but she couldnt leave with fairclough blocking her way and her only option left was the truth she was there to help the scotland yard detective she informed nicholas fairclough shed come with her husband a forensic specialist who evaluated evidence during investigations the newsman from the source had for some reason concluded that she was the detective from the met and shed let him think that in order to give the real detective and her husband time to do the work theyd come to do regarding the death of ian cresswell undisturbed by a tabloid i dont know anyone called montenegro she concluded ive never heard of him if it is a him and i daresay it is who is he raul montenegro someone trying to find my wife so thats what she meant deborah murmured youve talked to her at cross purposes i expect deborah said she must have thought we were speaking of this raul montenegro while i thought we were speaking of the reporter from the source im afraid i told her hes in windermere but i meant the reporter oh my god fairclough headed towards the house saying over his shoulder where is she now inside and as he began to jog towards the door mr fairclough one thing more he stopped turned she said i tried to tell her this i tried to apologise what i mean is the surrogacy situation youve absolutely nothing to fear i told mr benjamin there was no story in it and there isnt and besides i completely and utterly understand were rather your wife and i were rather sisters in this matter he stared at her he was pasty faced anyway but deborah saw that now all colour had left his lips as well rendering him ghostlike in appearance aided by the fog that curled at his feet sisters he said yes indeed i too so much want a baby and i havent been able to but he was gone before she was able to conclude windermere cumbria when tim returned to shots toyyou was behind the counter chatting with an anglican priest they both turned as tim entered the shop and the priest gave him the kind of onceover that spoke of an evaluation being made tim concluded he was there as a fellow actor for toyyous film and he registered this with a lurch of his gut that rapidly formed itself into a hot ball of anger a fucking vicar he thought just another bleeding hypocrite like the rest of the world this pathetic excuse for a human being stood up in front of a congregation every sunday and did his bit with the word of god and handed out communion wafers and then on the side when no one was the wiser off he went to do his filthy business with daddy daddy into the shop burst two children a boy and a girl in neat school uniforms and behind them a woman looking rather harried and studying her watch and saying darling i am so terribly sorry are we too late she went to the priest and kissed his cheek and linked her arm through his the priest said mags ninety minutes really and sighed well william and i have examined abraham and isaac esau and jacob ruth and naomi and the alien corn and the brothers of joseph from every angle and its been most illuminating and i think that william will agree entertaining as well but alas you are too late now well have to rearrange williams got something on and ive an appointment as well murmurs of apology profuse from the wife children hanging upon the priests either hand a rescheduling of the familys annual christmas picture to be sent to all the relatives and off they went tim was hanging back lurking in a corner of the shop with the pretence of examining the digital cameras all locked to their display shelves and rather in need of dusting when the priest and his family made their noisy happy exit tim came forward william concord was on toyyous name tag tim wondered what it meant that the bloke kept it on as he approached he reckoned it had nothing to do with having forgotten to remove it toyyou wasnt a forgetful kind of man he came round the counter and locked the door of the shop he reversed the open sign to closed he turned off the overhead lights and jerked his head to indicate that tim was to follow him into the back tim saw that the back of the shop had been altered and it was little wonder that toyyou wasnt able to accommodate the priest and his family for their yearly photo a man and a woman were in the process of setting up an entirely different design from what had been in the studio and now a rough replica of a victorian childrens nursery stood in place of the dramatic columns and background sky as tim watched them at work they brought in three narrow beds one of them occupied by a childsize department store mannequin wearing shrek pyjamas and oddly a schoolboy cap the other two were empty and at the foot of one the woman laid an enormous stuffed dog a st bernard by the look of it the man rolled into position a faux background window that opened onto a starry night sky and in the distance a crude representation of big ben shone with the hour midnight tim didnt know what to make of all this until another individual materialised from the storage area like tim he was a young adolescent unlike tim he was very sure of himself and moved with purpose onto the set where he leaned against the mock window and lit a cigarette he was outfitted head to foot in green with slippers that curled up at the toes and a cocked hat set at a jaunty angle on his head he jerked his chin in a hello to toyyou as the other two individuals faded through the storage area from which tim could hear the murmur of conversation and the sound of shoes and clothes dropping to the floor as toyyou did some business with a rolling tripod and a rather impressive video camera the man and the woman returned to the set she was now in a white nightdress with a high ruffled neck he was outfitted as a pirate captain unlike the other two he was the only one wearing a mask although the hook that emerged from his right sleeve was enough of a clue to the permanently clueless as to the blokes supposed identity of course the permanently clueless would never wonder what he was meant to be doing in victorian london instead of where he should have been which was naturally on a sailing ship in never never land tim looked from these characters to toyyou he felt momentarily queasy as he wondered what his part was supposed to entail then he spied a nightshirt lying at the foot of one of the beds with a pair of roundframed spectacles folded on top and from this he understood that he was the older of the two brothers and at some point meant to put on the costume provided it all seemed the height of stupid to tim but there was a modicum of relief in the setup when hed seen the last supper film and the jesusinthegarden piece hed reckoned theyd be engaged in something equally blasphemous here although he hadnt liked to think what it would be and while he truly didnt much care at this point whether the subject of their film was going to be blasphemous or not hed rather worried over the possibility that his upbringing would out at the very last moment and hed find himself unable to perform according to whatever directions would be recited to him from the other side of the camera he neednt have worried as things turned out as wendy moved onto the nursery set and captain hook took up a position offcamera toyyou approached tim with a small glass of water which he handed over from his pocket he took a vial and from the vial he shook out two different pills he gave them to tim with a nod that indicated he was meant to swallow them whatre something to help with authentic closeups toyyou said among other things what dthey do a smile flicked at the corners of his mouth whiskers grew there he hadnt shaved well that day they aid with the performance we require of you go ahead take them youll see soon enough how they work and i expect youll enjoy their effect but toyyous voice altered he whispered fiercely take them goddamn it this is what you wanted so bloody do it weve not got all night tim swallowed them he felt nothing and wondered if they were something to make him relax or to make him unconscious were they the daterape drug was that a pill he wasnt sure he said do i put on that nightshirt im john darling arent i youre only halfstupid then toyyou said just stand by the camera till you get the call what call christ shut up and see and to peter pan and wendy he said you two ready and without waiting for an answer he moved behind the camera and the other young boy and the nightgowned woman took up position the boy on the edge of the windowsill and the woman kneeling upright on the bed tim saw from the lighting that her nightgown was so sheer that all of her was visible through it he swallowed and wanted to look away but he found he couldnt for she was lifting the nightgown slowly and sensually over her head as peter pan advanced upon her she presented her breasts to him and toyyou said now to tim but whatm i sposed to do he asked desperately even as he felt the stirring within him as all of his organs began doing what they were meant by nature to do getting to bed a bit late you are toyyou murmured as he filmed the action on wendys bed where she was lowering peters tights and peter was presenting himself to the camera she began to minister to him up to the wee hours reading in the library you were into the nursery you go only to find your sister and peter pan in the midst of tut tut tut but you fancy peter yourself once you see what hes got on him you do so i what do i do fuck it just go onto the set follow your inclinations for gods sake i know you have them we both know you have them and the worst was he did he did because even as they were holding their whispered conversation tim couldnt tear his eyes away from what was being filmed and he didnt know what it meant that peter unveiled himself engorged with blood and tim kept watching and his body kept reacting and he wanted to watch and he wanted something else only he didnt know what it was go bloody go toyyou said peter and wendy will show you what to do he looked away from the camera for a moment directing his gaze to tims crotch he smiled ah the miracles of modern medicine dont worry about a thing what about him tim asked as toyyou turned back to the camera who the captain you know dont worry about him either he fancies peter always has done fancies all the lost boys fancies you as well hell show up and sort you out for consorting with peter once wendy exits stage right okay you got it now get bloody in there because were wasting time hows he going to sort me toyyou shot him a look exactly the way youve wanted to be sorted from the first all right got it but you said you would fuck it you idiot what did you really expect death on a biscuit now go go milnthorpe cumbria deborah drove back to the crow and eagle in milnthorpe as the fog began to billow across the road in a great grey mass like the effluent of a thousand smokestacks somewhere out in the bay the railway viaduct that took trains into the arnside station was only a shadowy form that she passed beneath on her way out of the village and milnthorpe sands was entirely lost to view with only the wading birds closest to shore punctuating the grey with a darkness that huddled and shifted in a solid mass as if the ground itself were sighing the headlamps of cars did little to pierce the gloom merely reflecting the light back onto the driver when occasionally a pedestrian was present foolhardy enough to be walking along the verge in such weather he emerged without warning as if popping out of the ground like a halloween ghoul it was an unnerving experience to be on the road deborah was grateful when she reached the car park of the inn without incident tommy was waiting for her as hed promised he was in the bar with a coffee service in front of him and his mobile pressed to his ear his head was bent and he didnt see her but she caught the remainder of his conversation quite late he was saying shall i come to you anyway ive no idea of the time and perhaps youd rather yes all right quite anxious as well isabelle im terribly sorry how this has indeed very well later then right he listened for a moment and evidently felt deborahs presence for he turned in his chair and saw her approaching he said shes just arrived so i daresay well be off in a few moments with a raised eyebrow in deborahs direction to which she nodded very good he said yes i have the key with me he rang off deborah wasnt sure what to say two months earlier shed concluded that tommy was sleeping with his superior officer what she hadnt worked out was how she felt about the fact it was a given that tommy had to move on with his life but the how of his moving on was something that made her unsure of her footing with him she settled for could i have a coffee before we leave tommy i promise to swill it like a priest going after the altar wine swilling wont be necessary he replied ill have another id prefer both of us wide awake for the drive its going to be a long one she sat as he went to place the order hed been doodling on a paper napkin she saw as hed spoken to isabelle ardery in london hed sketched a rough cottage in a wide meadow somewhere with two smaller buildings and a stream nearby and hillsides rising on either side not bad by the look of it she thought shed never considered tommy as an artist a second calling she said to him indicating the sketch when he turned to the table one of a thousand similar places in cornwall thinking of going home not quite yet he sat smiled at her fondly and said someday i suppose he reached for the napkin folded it and put it into the breast pocket of his jacket ive rung simon he told her he knows well be coming home and well of course he finds you the most maddening sort of woman but then dont we all she sighed saying yes well i think ive made things worse tommy between you and simon no no ill put that right it does help to be married to the most tolerant man on the planet but im talking about nicholas fairclough and his wife ive had an awkward conversation with her followed by an awkward conversation with her husband she told him about both conversations sketching in all the details as she remembered them including the reactions of both alatea and her husband she explained alateas offer of jewellery and money and she included the revelation about the man montenegro tommy listened as he always had done his brown eyes fixed on hers their coffee service came as she was talking he poured them both a cup as she was concluding her final words were so all along alatea apparently thought i was talking about this raul montenegro while i thought we were talking about the reporter from the source i suppose it wouldnt have mattered much except for the fact that i told her he was in windermere at least i think thats where he went when he dropped me here after lancaster and when i told her that she simply panicked obviously thinking i meant montenegro nicholas panicked as well lynley added a packet of sugar to his coffee he stirred it looking thoughtful all the while indeed he looked so thoughtful that deborah understood something she should have recognised earlier she said to him you know whats actually going on with these people dont you tommy i expect youve known from the first whatever it is i wish youd told me at least i could have refrained from blundering in and doing whatever it is ive now managed to do to them lynley shook his head actually no i think ive known less than you since id not met alatea before today shes beautiful isnt she shes quite he seemed to search for a better word perhaps a more accurate one he lifted his fingers as if to say that any choice he made would not do her justice he settled on rather amazing actually had i not known about her before going to see her i would never have believed she began life as a man deborah felt her jaw loosen with the surprise that swept through her she said what santiago vasquez y del torres thats who she was what do you mean was is she impersonating no she had surgery financed by this bloke montenegro his intention apparently was to have her play his female lover in public to maintain his reputation and social position but in private to make love to her as a male to a male deborah swallowed dear god she thought about lancaster about lucy keverne about what she and alatea fairclough could have and must have actually planned between them she said but nicholas surely he knows she hasnt told him oh surely tommy hed be able to tell i mean good heavens thered be signs wouldnt there thered be marks of incisions scars whatever in the hands of a worldclass surgeon with all the tools at hand with lasers to deal with potential scarring deborah everything would be altered even the adams apple can go if the mans appearance was feminine to begin with because of an extra x chromosome perhaps then the shift to female would be even simpler but not to tell nicholas why wouldnt she have told him desperation worry fear of his reaction fear of rejection with montenegro looking for her and apparently having the funds to go on looking indefinitely she would need a safe place to achieve it she allowed nicholas to believe what he wanted to believe about her she married giving her the right to remain in england once she came here deborah saw how this fitted in with what tommy and simon had come to cumbria to do she said ian cresswell did she murder him did he know lynley shook his head consider her deborah shes something of a masterpiece no one would know unless there was a reason to delve back into her past and there was no reason for all intents and purposes shes nicholas faircloughs wife if anyone bore looking into with regard to ians death it would have been nicholas as things happened we didnt need to go that far because simon was right from the first and so was the coroner theres not a single sign of ian cresswells death being anything other than an accident someone may have wanted him to die his death might have been a convenience to more than one person but no one orchestrated it deborah said and now that terrible reporters going to write his story about this surrogacy situation and alateas photo will be in the paper and im responsible what can i do appeal to his better angels he works for the source tommy there is that he admitted her mobile rang deborah hoped it was zed benjamin reporting on a change of heart or perhaps simon telling her he understood the passions that had driven her to make such a mess of things at arnside house but it turned out to be nicholas fairclough and he was in a panic whatve you done to her deborahs first horrified thought was that alatea fairclough had harmed herself she said whats happened mr fairclough and she looked at tommy shes gone ive searched the house and the grounds her car is still here and she couldnt have passed us in the driveway without being seen ive walked the length of the seawall as well shes gone shell be back she wont have gone far how could she have done with the weather so bad shes gone onto the sands surely not i tell you shes gone onto the sands she has to have done its the only place shes taken a walk then to have a think shell be back soon and when she comes back you can tell her i was talking about the reporter from the source not raul montenegro you dont understand he cried god in heaven you dont understand shes not coming back she cant come back whyever not because of the fog because of the quicksands but we can we cant dont you see what youve done please mr fairclough we can find her we can phone theres going to be someone theres no one not for this not for this this whats this the tidal bore you stupid woman the floodwaters are coming the sirens just gone off todays a tidal bore windermere cumbria when her mobile phone finally vibrated manette was in a welter of nerves she was lurking in the car park of the business centre close to a wheelie bin tim had gone inside a business called shots a photographic studio by the look of the front window which displayed enormous enlargements of the village of ambleside in autumn and hed been followed some minutes later by a harriedlooking woman with two children in tow that woman had left moments later on the arm of an anglican priest and theyd all climbed into a saab estate car and vanished upon which time someone within shots had switched the open sign to closed and manette had given up on freddie and phoned the police her conversation with superintendent connie calva was as unproductive as it was brief and manette ended it by wanting to hurl her mobile onto the tarmac of the car park she told the head of vice about the business centre and what was going on and how the open sign had been turned to closed and they both knew what that meant didnt they because tim cresswell aged fourteen was here to film one of those horrible souldestroying pieces of filth and the police had to come and they had to come now but connie calva said they had to get tims laptop to barrow where the forensic computer specialist would go through it and discover the exact location from which toyyou had been sending his emails whereupon they would apply for a search warrant and bugger that for a lark manette whispered fiercely im telling you exactly where he is exactly where this toyyou monster is exactly where theyre going to film and you bloody goddamn better get someone over here to deal with this now to this superintendent calva had replied in the nicest possible voice which indicated she was used to speaking with people on the edge which was something they probably taught in training college it was a case of mrs mcghie i know youre upset and worried but the only way to bring down something like this so that the entire thing doesnt get thrown out of court on its ear is to do it within the confines of the law i know you dont like this and i certainly dont like it but we have no choice manette said bugger the confines of the bloody law and she ended the call then she rang freddie because god only knew where he was he answered at once saying damn it manette i rang you you were supposed to talking to the police she cut in i had to freddie hes in a photo studio where are you walking back from the railway station where are you the business centre she told him the route surprising herself with her own memory he repeated it back to her and she said hurry please do hurry freddie the police wont come when i rang them they said they need a search warrant they need to take that computer to barrow they need to god i dont know what and hes in there and theyre going to film him i just know it but i couldnt make her see darling im on my way he said ill try to get inside the shop she told him ill bang on the door theyll stop what theyre doing wont they surely manette do nothing do you understand me these are dangerous people im on my way wait manette didnt know how she could but she rang off after promising him that until he arrived there was no way she could do that although she tried three minutes of waiting did her in she ran to the front door it was locked as she knew it would be but that was of no account she banged upon it she rattled it it was mostly glass but the glass was thick and the door was unmoving even in its jamb and as for the noise possibly disturbing the action inside shots whatever that action was she could see how unlikely the case was that she was achieving that for a door behind the shop counter was also closed and if they were filming within the building noise would also be associated with that she bit her nails she looked around she thought of the possibilities and came up with the back of the business centre for the shops in the centre would have more than one door surely in case of fire only one means of egress from a place of business had to be illegal didnt it she dashed round the back only to encounter a line of doors and all of them unmarked she hadnt thought to count up the shops in front in order to do the same in the rear so she went back round the front at a run to do so just as freddie came tearing into the car park she flung herself towards him he was breathing like a mountaineer without oxygen he gulped out treadmill starting tomorrow and then which one where as she clung to his arm she told him that the door was locked that there was an inner door that there were also doors round the back she said that she could bang on the back door and freddie could wait at the front door for all of them to come pounding out of the place to make a run for it when they did that absolutely not he said were not about to set these people off theyve a lot vested in not getting caught we need the police but they wont come she wailed i told you that they wont come unless they get a bloody warrant freddie looked round the car park he spied the heavy wheelie bin he said to manette oh i think we can give them a reason to come he trotted over to the wheelie bin and put his shoulder to it she saw what he intended and joined him in the effort they began to roll the bin towards the shops picking up speed on a slope of the car park as they approached the front of shots freddie murmured give it your best now darling and hope he set the burglar alarm he had done so they discovered when the wheelie bin crashed through the front door of the photo shop and the alarm began to howl freddie winked at manette and rested his hands on his thighs to catch his breath voila he said bobs your uncle she replied morecambe bay cumbria alatea was motionless a statue more than two miles from where shed leapt off the seawall and into the empty channel of the river kent when shed set off from arnside shed seen the fog but at that point she could still make out in the distance the peninsula that was holme island and she knew that round the tip of it lay grangeoversands and escape shed thought to put on her hiking boots deciding she had just time for that and an anorak as nicky and the redhaired woman had their conversation out on the driveway shed grabbed her bag faded out of the house via the drawing room doors and made for the seawall shed swung herself over it and out onto the sands where shed begun to run as best she could the channel and the bay it fed into both were virtually waterless the river kent was a mere leapable creek at that point the water of the bay was nonexistent she had sufficient time to make the crossing she reckoned as long as she took care she knew how to do that she had a walking stick to help her and even if she hit a patch of the quicksand for which the bay and its surrounds were notorious she knew what to do should she become caught in it what she hadnt counted on was the fog while shed seen it far to the northwest of arnside and while she knew the likelihood of its advancing towards shore what she hadnt understood was how quickly it was going to roll in and roll it did like a diaphanous barrel of immense proportions that silently rumbled forward inexorably swallowing everything in its path when it reached her alatea knew in an instant that this was more a pestilential miasma than was it mere fog because she understood that this substance brought with it a deadly danger what began as a vapour nothing more than a hoary veil that was cold and damp but still not impossible to navigate within moments became a grey drapery so thick that it felt to alatea as though her eyes were playing tricks upon her for the simple reason that she could not see and this seemed impossible because it was daylight but other than the fact that the sun was out somewhere rendering visible the colours of her boots her anorak and the fog itself she could see nothing at all there was no depth to her vision no width no height there was only fog shed had no choice but to turn back for arnside which was closer than grangeoversands but in less than five minutes shed stopped moving forward because she no longer knew if it was forward that she was moving there were sounds that should have helped her negotiate the route back to her home but she couldnt tell where they were coming from the first she heard was the train crossing the railway viaduct which spanned the kent channel from arnside and ultimately carried passengers onward to grangeoversands but she couldnt make out whether the train was going to or coming from grangeoversands and further she couldnt even tell in what direction the railway track lay according to her reckoning it should have been to her left if she was on the route back to arnside but it sounded as if it was coming from behind her which would mean she was heading out to sea she turned to correct her course then and began to walk again she hit a puddle sank up to her calf and quickly pulled back someone shouted in the distance somewhere she couldnt tell where the shout was coming from but it sounded close and this was good she turned towards it and resumed her progress a tractor roared at least it sounded like a tractor but it was directly behind her or so it seemed so that would be the best route to shore she turned towards it she called out hello hello im here over here but she heard nothing in reply only the tractors engine and it seemed to groan and strain as if the machine was pulling an inconceivably heavy load and then a horn honked yes she thought that way was the road only the road seemed to be where the sea was supposed to be and if she went in that direction shed be lost surely she would wander among the little hillocks of sand through the puddles and ultimately shed stumble into a scour where the waters of the bay did exactly that scoured out the sand to form a trough upon which sand resettled in a new form that was too much liquid to bear the weight of anything other than the smallest bird and then she would sink she stopped again she turned she listened she called out in reply came the cry of a gull a moment later the air seemed to part for an instant with the sound of a gunshot or the backfire from a car then silence utter and complete that was the moment alatea knew there was no escape that there never had been any real escape from this instant out in the far east part of morecambe bay there might be some form of either flight or rescue but from her life and the lies shed constructed so that she might dwell safely within it there was not it was time she faced up to that she decided for every occasion of her life had led her to a moment of revelation shed foolishly thought she could avoid forever but there simply was no avoiding it any longer that was the only truth that remained all right so be it she would take what was coming to her because she surely deserved it she opened her bag it was only when she found her purse her chequebook her makeup case and not her mobile phone inside that she saw in her minds eye where she had left the device sitting on the kitchen worktop plugged into a socket recharging itself she stared mutely into her bag then and understood that speaking the truth to nicholas was not the final challenge remaining for her hers would be to take the leap into accepting the icy embrace of what was inevitable how could she have thought it would ever have been otherwise she wondered for hadnt each step shed taken since shed run away from her family brought her to this single spot on earth in this one perilous moment of time there had never really been an escape only a postponement and she finally understood this while science and surgery had provided her a way to shed the terrible carapace that had been her prison rendering her the strangest of strangers in a very strange land there was no taking flight from what had gone into her making and this was the stuff of her memories which could not be shed no matter how she tried the worst part she thought had been the boxing lessons that followed the declaration that her brothers couldnt be expected to fight the battles of santiago vasquez y del torres forever it was time santiago learned to defend himself against bullies his father insisted but the fear was bright like a silver coin in his eyes as he spoke and he frowned with more than concern and displeasure when santiago didnt want horseplay with his brothers when santiago wasnt interested in building fortresses or playing soldiers in wrestling in trying to direct his pee as far as carlos could and the fear was bright in his mothers eyes when she came upon her santiago playing dressingup cradling a doll or planning a tea party with cousin elena maria the faces of santiagos parents said the same thing without speaking what have we borne into this world his fathers worry was an obvious one for a man of his culture his age his religion and his upbringing he worried he had foisted upon the world another depraved homosexual his mothers worry was more subtle and more in keeping with her nurturing disposition in general how would her santiago cope in a world ill equipped to understand him escape at the time meant elena maria to her santiago had told it all shed heard his explanation of being a soul inside a body that he did not even recognise as his own he looked out of this body he told her and looked down upon it and saw it was male and knew it as male but it did not function as the body of a male and he did not wish it to function so he couldnt even stand to touch it he said it was like touching someone else i dont know what it is he told her i dont know what it means i just dont want it i cant live with it i have to be rid of it and if i cant be rid of it then i will die i swear i will die with elena maria then there was relief for those few hours for a day trip to one of the larger towns for a weekend once in which they were adolescent girls on their own at a beach this allowed the young santiago to see what he truly wanted what he had to be but this could not happen in a world in which his father believed that toughening him up was the only answer in order to live as he had been born to live santiago had run and hed continued running until hed run into the arms of raul montenegro so was the worst really those boxing lessons alatea asked herself now or was the worst the promise that raul montenegro had held out to her and the reality of how shed been intended to keep up her end of the bargain theyd struck with each other she wasnt sure but what she did know was that raul montenegro was a driven man just as hed been unwavering in his promise to fulfill the feminine dreams of his young lover santiago vasquez y del torres so was he equally unwavering in his decision to find alatea vasquez y del torres so that she could repay him in coin hed long ago determined and now here she was as lost as ever with no choice left but to move or to die so she moved in the direction she hoped against hope was arnside although she no longer knew within ten yards she hit the quicksand a scour she had feared shed stumble upon in an instant she was up to her thighs and cold cold so horribly cold no panic was necessary she told herself she knew what to do nicholas had told her a longago walk across the expanse of the empty bay and she remembered his words its completely counterintuitive darling but youve got to do it he had said she knew that she prepared herself that was when the siren began to blare arnside cumbria are you certain sir the voice asked lynley the man at the coast guard station on walney island spoke with the kind of calm authority meant to soothe whoever was phoning in an emergency of the sort that lynley was reporting he spoke with coolheaded reason which could lead to a decision because he and he alone had the authority to put the wheels in motion i dont want to launch a boat out into the bay unless we know for a fact that the womans out there conditions are deadly has she rung on her mobile was there a note neither but were certain lynley described for the officer the position of the house the lack of an escape route and what theyd done to attempt to find alatea vasquez y del torres the only possibility besides the bay had been the walk along the seawall a public footpath that branched into half a dozen other public footpaths leading to arnside knot to the village of silverdale and ultimately onto the lancaster coastal way but alatea didnt know those footpaths other than the footpath to arnside knot and she had no reason to climb to the knot in the fog while she had every reason to try to make a run for it across the bay what reason would this be sir the officer had asked not unreasonably lynley told him he was in the midst of an enquiry into a drowning which could have been a murder and all the et ceteras he was not only stretching the truth of the matter he was actually lying to the man but there seemed no choice available other than setting out themselves for arnside knot to search for her there which hed managed to persuade nicholas fairclough to do hopeless task though it was fairclough had agreed to do this although hed built a bonfire first on the seawall path this deborah was keeping at a roar feeding into it armfuls of whatever was flammable logs branches newspapers magazines old pieces of furniture the fire had attracted the attention of the fire brigade as well as the good citizens of arnside who joined in the effort to make from these combustibles a beacon that might glow through the fog and signal to alatea the route she needed to take in order to return it was more something to do than was it useful and lynley knew this for if alatea was indeed out there in morecambe bay and if the tide was coming in it was hardly likely that shed be able to outrun it hence his call to the coast guard the officer on walney island said to him sir i can put out a boat but lets not deal in fantasy here visibility just now is less than twenty yards the bay is over one hundred square miles with the combination of fog and the tidal bore im not putting a crew out there on a whim i assure you this is not a whim lynley told him surely if you set a course for arnside well chance it all right the officer cut in but shes a dead woman sir and we both know that meanwhile ring the lifeboat service to see what they can do to assist you might want to phone the guide to the sands for his opinion as well the guide to the sands was established across the water to the south of grangeoversands near a little enclave called berry bank he sounded a kindhearted soul when lynley rang him but in over fifty years of walking curious daytrippers across morecambe bay and after a lifetime spent between cockling from the fishing village of flookburgh to trawling for shrimp in the river leven he bloody well knew how to read the sands sir and if a lady was out there in the fog for any reason on gods good earth and he didnt much care to know the reason she was well on her way to being a corpse and thats the unfortunate truth of the matter im sorry to tell you was there nothing to be done lynley asked for the coast guard was setting out from walney island and he was about to ring the rnli for a lifeboat as well depends on how many corpses you want to look for when the fog lifts was how the guide to the sands put it but he made one thing clear after all his years of reading the sands and knowing the safe routes from those fraught with danger he wasnt about to join the foolhardy who went out now in search of anyone nor it turned out was the rnli they were volunteers after all they were trained to help and they wanted to help but they needed water to launch their boats sir and the bay was at present empty while it was true that it wasnt going to be empty for long when the water rushed in it was going to take that woman quickly because if she didnt drown hypothermia would get her theyd set off with the tide as soon as they were able but it was useless were so sorry sir so the fire roared and someone thought to bring a loudhailer from which alateas name was shouted continuously in the meantime out in the distance somewhere the phenomenon that was the tidal bore was coming awesome to witness lynley heard someone murmur but deadlier to encounter windermere cumbria the burglar alarm was loud enough to raise skeletons from tombs they had to shout to each other to be heard above it they used all their force to wedge the wheelie bin into the shop in order to give themselves a means of access and once inside freddie turned to manette and yelled you wait here which naturally she was not about to do he went for the inner door and rattled its handle it was locked and although he yelled open this police and then tim tim cresswell it was clear to them both that whoever was within the other room wasnt about to cooperate ill have to break it manette read his lips rather than heard him she said how because of all the things freddie was he was hardly a man in possession of the brute force that was needed to break in a door and this door wasnt like a telly door or a film door substantial in appearance but in reality flimsy enough to be kicked in with a single thrust of a manly foot powered by an even manlier thigh this was a door with intentions and those intentions were to keep out trespasssers nonetheless freddie went at it first with his foot then with his shoulder then they took turns and all the time the burglar alarm kept howling it was a good five minutes perhaps more when they finally broke the lock through the doorjamb freddie stumbled inside the inner room shouting over his shoulder manette you must wait again she ignored him if he was walking into danger she wasnt about to let him walk into danger alone they were in a digital printing room that gave onto a storeroom two aisles comprised this at the end of which strong lights were shining although the rest of the place was in darkness the alarms noise continued unabated so they watched for movement from the shadows but a cold breeze wafting towards them spoke of an escape having been effected out of the back door they could only hope someone had been left behind they could only hope that someone was tim at the far end where the light was brightest they saw the crude film set manette took it all in in an instant beds window big ben in the distance dog at the foot of a bed before she saw him he was a figure lying on his side in what looked like a nightshirt but the nightshirt was pulled above his head green tights were tied round the top of it like a sack and the boy himself lay on his side with his hands bound in front of him and his genitals on display he was fully erect an x on the floor not far from the bed on which he lay indicated where the camera had been positioned and what its primary focus had been manette said oh god freddie turned to her she read his lips because there was no way to hear him not while the alarm kept shrieking like a banshee come to claim a soul you stay here you stay here because she was frightened at that point she remained where she was if tim was dead the truth of the matter was that she simply did not want to see freddie went to the bed manette saw his lips form hes bleeding and then tim old man i say old man as he reached for the tights that bound the nightshirt closed above tims head tims body jerked freddies lips said easy there its freddie my man let me get you out youre all right old man and then he had the nightshirt released from its binding and he was lowering it gently to cover tims body and manette saw from the boys eyes and his face that he was drugged which in that moment she thanked god for because if he was drugged there was a small chance that he would not remember what had happened to him here phone the police freddie said but she knew there was no need for that even as she approached ians son where he lay on the bed even as she reached to untie his hands the alarm ceased howling and she heard the voices bloody damn mess someone called out from the shop itself how true she thought morecambe bay cumbria everything you do in quicksand is counterintuitive nicky had told her when you hit it your inclination is to freeze in place it seems that struggling will make you sink faster any movement at all will presage more danger and an inconceivable end but you must remember several things darling the first is that you have no idea how deep the sand really is youre only in a scour and while it might be deep enough to swallow a horse or a tractor or an entire tour coach its more likely that youre in one of the shallower scours which will suck you in only to your knees or at worst your thighs leaving you otherwise free until rescue comes but you dont want to discover that especially if youre going to go in up to your chest because if you sink that far theres no getting out because of the suction involved at that point only more water can get you out water from a fire hose blasting into the sand to free you or water from the incoming tide driving sand from the scour again so you must move quickly once youre in the sand if youre very lucky its not deep and before it can suck upon your boots and entrap them you can move across it or back away from it if you cant do that then you must lie on the surface of the quicksand lie down upon it as soon as youre able youll see that youll sink no deeper and youll be able to roll away from it but no matter the words of her husband who had lived his life in this strange part of the world to alatea the thought was madness she was in the sand up to her thighs so no quick movement out of the scour was possible this meant lying on the top of the sand and she could not bring herself to do it she told herself to she said aloud you must you must but all she could think of as she settled more slowly downward was the insidious movement of the sand inching up her supine body crawling into her ears touching her cheeks slithering like menace incarnate towards her nose she wanted to pray but her mind would not produce the appropriate words that could effect a miracle instead what it produced were images and central to them was santiago vasquez y del torres thirteen years old a runaway only as far as the closest city to santa maria de la cruz de los angeles y de los santos there in a church he had stowed himself for refuge dressed in elena marias clothing face painted with elena marias cosmetics a shoulder bag containing some little money and a change of clothing and three tubes of lipstick and a scarf covering hair that was too long for a boy and too short for a girl when the priest found her he called her my child and daughter of our heavenly father and he asked her if she was there to confess and confession seemed like the path she should take go santiago go where god points elena maria had whispered so santiago vasquez y del torres had confessed not to sin but to his need for help because if he could not be what he needed to be he knew he would end his life the priest listened he spoke gently of the grave sin of despair he said that god did not create mistakes then he said come with me child and together they walked to the rectory where santiago was given absolution for whatever sin he had committed in running from his home and a meal of beef and boiled potatoes which he ate slowly as he looked round the simple kitchen where the priests housekeeper eyed him with thick black eyebrows drawn together and a furrowed brow when he was finished with his meal he was led to a parlour to rest my dear child for your journey has been a long and difficult one has it not and yes it had oh it had so he lay on a sofa covered in corduroy and he fell asleep his father awakened him face like a stone mask hed said thank you padre and hed taken his wayward son by the arm thank you for everything and hed made a hefty donation to the church or perhaps to the betraying priest himself and home they had gone a beating would change him his father decided so would being locked into a room until he saw clearly the crime he had committed not only against gods law but also against his family and their good name and nothing would change about his situation do you understand me santiago until he agreed to stop this mad behaviour so santiago had tried on manhood for all the illfitting suit of clothes it was but pictures of naked ladies shared in secret with his brothers only made him want to be like the ladies not to have them and when his brothers touched themselves in guilty pleasure at the sight of these women the thought of touching himself in a similar way made him both nauseous and faint he did not develop as a boy hairy of arm and leg and chest bearded and needing to shave it was so clear that something was wrong with him but the only answer seemed to be toughening him up with contact sports with hunting with rock climbing with daredevil skiing with anything in short that his father could think of to make him into the man he was intended by god to be for two long years santiago made the attempt for two long years santiago saved every bit of money he could at fifteen then he ran for the final time and he made it by train to buenos aires where no one knew he was not a female unless he wished to make the fact known to them alatea recalled the train ride the sound of the engine and the scenery passing she recalled her head against the cool glass of the window she recalled her feet upon her suitcase she remembered her ticket being punched and the man saying gracias senorita and being senorita from that time forward as the train carried her away from her home she could almost hear the train at this moment so vivid was the memory of that time and that place it rumbled and roared it gushed and it thundered it took her relentlessly into her future and even now she was on it escaping her past when the first of the water hit her she understood that what shed been hearing was the tide she realised then what that siren had meant this was the tidal bore coming coming as fast as a horse could gallop and while the water meant that she would soon be free of the scour that held her fast she understood that there were things from which she would never be free she thought of how thankful she was that she would not suffocate in the sand as she had feared she might as the first of the water crashed against her body she understood also that she would not drown for one did not drown in water such as this one merely lay back and fell asleep november arnside cumbria there had been nothing really that could be done all of them had known it all of them had pretended otherwise the coast guard went out into the fog taking the route from walney island into lancaster sound but it was miles from there into morecambe bay and miles farther into the channel of the river kent she could have been anywhere and this was something that everyone had known as well if it had been the tidal bore alone there might have been a chance slight though it was that she could be found but with the tidal bore conjoining the fog the situation had been without hope from the very first they did not find her the rnli had attempted to help as well once there was enough water for them to set out but they hadnt got far before they knew that it was a body they would be looking for with this the case for them to remain out in the fog ran the risk of there being more bodies to find at the end of the day and to compound the tragedy was foolish only the guide to the sands could assist they reported to lynley upon their return to land for the guides job in a situation such as this was to speculate on the probable places that a body would wash up his job was to help them find the body as quickly as possible because if they did not find it when the fog lifted there was a very good chance they would not find it at all the water would wash it away and the sand would bury it some things out in morecambe bay were never found and some things lay buried for one hundred years it was the nature of the place the guide to the sands told them lynley and deborah had gone into arnside house at last after hours upon hours of stoking the bonfire even after the point when the tidal bore had surged into and then filled the channel and all of them knew there was not a single hope left but nicholas wouldnt leave the fire so they continued to feed it with him even as they cast worried looks upon his devastated face he wasnt ready to stop until evening when exhaustion had combined with knowledge and the dawning of grief to rob him of the desire to continue then hed stumbled towards the house and lynley and deborah had followed him as the people of arnside village parted to let them pass and their words of sympathy had matched the looks of sorrow on their faces inside the house lynley had phoned bernard fairclough he reported only the barest of facts that his sons wife was missing and probably drowned out in morecambe bay apparently out for a walk lynley told them and caught up in the tidal bore well be there at once bernard fairclough had said tell nicholas were on our way theyll want to know if im going to use now nicholas said numbly when lynley relayed his fathers message well who wouldnt worry that i might with my history eh he went on to say that he would not see them or anyone else if it came to that so lynley had waited and when nicholass parents arrived he gave them the information and he himself decided that his part in all this was not to betray alatea he would hold her secrets in his heart he would take her secrets to his grave he knew that deborah would do the same it was too late by then to begin the journey back to london so he and deborah had returned to the crow and eagle booked two rooms had a largely silent dinner and had gone to bed in the morning when he could bear to talk he phoned new scotland yard there were he saw seven messages on his mobile phone he didnt listen to any of them he rang barbara havers instead he told her briefly what had happened she was silent except for the occasional oh damn and oh hell sir he told her that they would need to get word to alateas family in argentina could barbara find the graduate student once again and make the necessary phone call yes she could she told him she was that bloody sorry about the way things had worked out as well havers said how are you sir you dont sound good anything else i cn do at this end tell the superintendent that i was detained in cumbria he said ill be on my way in an hour or two anything else i should tell her havers asked want me to let her know whats happened lynley considered this only briefly before he made his decision best to let things lie as they are he said she said right and rang off lynley knew he could trust her to do as hed asked and it occurred to him then that hed not thought at all about ringing isabelle either on the previous night or this morning upon waking from a very bad sleep hed not considered her deborah was waiting for him when he descended the stairs into reception at the crow and eagle she was very ill looking her eyes grew bright with tears when she saw him and she cleared her throat roughly to keep them from falling she was sitting on a wooden bench opposite the reception desk he sat next to her and put his arm round her shoulders she sagged into him and he kissed the side of her head she reached for his other hand and held it and he felt the change in both of their bodies as they began to breathe as one he said dont think what youre thinking how can i not im not sure but i know that you mustnt tommy she would never have gone out into the bay if i hadnt been pursuing this whole mad surrogate mother business and that had nothing to do with ian cresswells death which you and simon knew all along im at fault deb darling secrets and silence caused all of this lies caused this not you youre being very kind im being truthful it was what alatea couldnt bear to tell him about herself that took her onto the sands it was that information that took her to lancaster in the first place you cant make her secrets and her death your fault because theyre not and thats how it is deborah said nothing for a moment her head was bent and she seemed to be studying the toes of her black leather boots she finally murmured but therere things one must be silent about arent there he thought about this about everything that remained and would remain forever unspoken between them he replied with and who knows that better than we two and when he loosened his arm from her shoulders she looked at him he smiled at her fondly london he said london she replied arnside cumbria no matter nicholass desire for solitude valerie had insisted to her husband that they would remain in arnside house the rest of that night shed phoned manette to give her the news telling her to stay away shed phoned mignon as well but with little worry that mignon would bring herself all the way to arnside since shed been holed up in her tower from the moment shed understood that her parents had no intention of continuing to be at her monetary emotional and physical beck and call mignon hardly mattered to valerie at this point anyway her concern was nicholas her worry was what he might do in the wake of this disaster his message to them via the detective from new scotland yard had been terse but forthright he wanted to see no one that had been all valerie had said to lynley shell have people in argentina well need to let them know there will be arrangements lynley had told her that the met would handle informing alateas people since he had an officer who had tracked them down as for arrangements perhaps they all ought to wait to see if a body could be found she hadnt thought of that that there might not be a body there had been a death so there would be a body she wanted to insist after all a body was a form of finality without one how would grief ever be navigated when lynley had left with the woman hed introduced as deborah st james unknown to valerie and frankly unimportant at this point save the knowledge that shed been present during the time of alateas disappearance valerie climbed the stairs and made her way to nicholass room shed said to the panels of his door were here darling your father and i well be downstairs and shed left him alone throughout the long night she and bernard had sat in the drawing room a fire burning in the grate near three in the morning shed thought she heard movement above them on the first floor of the house but it turned out to be only the wind the wind blew away the fog and brought with it the rain the rain beat against the windows in steady waves and valerie thought aimlessly about heaviness enduring for a night but joy coming in the morning something that came from the book of common prayer she recalled but the words did not apply in this terrible case she and bernard did not speak he attempted to draw her into conversation four times but she shook her head and held up her hand to make him stop when he finally said for the love of god valerie you must talk to me sometime she understood that in spite of everything that had passed in the last twelve or more hours bernard actually wanted to talk about them what was wrong with the man she asked herself wearily but then hadnt she always known the answer to that it was just after dawn when nicholas came into the drawing room hed moved so quietly she hadnt heard him and he was standing in front of her before she realised it was not bernard whod entered the room for bernard had never left the room although that too was something she hadnt taken note of she started to get to her feet nicholas said dont she said darling but she stopped when he shook his head he had one eye closed as if the lights in the room were painful to him and he cocked his head as if this would help bring her into focus he said just this its not my intention bernard said what nick i say its not my intention to use again he said thats not why were here valerie said so you stayed because his lips were so dry they seemed to stick together there were hollows beneath his eyes his cherub hair was flat and matted his spectacles were smudged we stayed because were your parents bernard said for the love of god nick its my fault valerie said if i hadnt brought the scotland yard people up here to investigate upsetting you upsetting her if its anyones fault its mine bernard said your mother is blameless if i hadnt given her cause to want an investigation no matter the bloody reason stop nicholas raised his hand and dropped it in an exhausted movement he said yes its your fault both of you but that doesnt really make a difference now he turned and left them in the drawing room they heard him shuffle along the corridor in a moment they heard him trudging up the stairs they went home in silence as if knowing they were coming down the long drive from the road perhaps shed been watching for them from the roof of the tower where valerie now knew shed doubtless been skipping up the stairs to spy upon everyone for years mignon stood waiting for them shed wisely discarded the zimmer frame no doubt understanding that her jig was decidedly up and she was wrapped up in a wool coat against the cold the morning was fine as it sometimes is after a good rain and the sun was as bright as an undashed hope casting gold autumn light on the lawns and the deer grazing upon them in the distance mignon advanced on the car as valerie got out she said mother what happened why did you not come home last night i was sick with worry i couldnt sleep i nearly phoned the police valerie said alatea well of course alatea mignon declared but why on earth did you and dad not come home valerie gazed at her daughter but she couldnt quite seem to make her out yet hadnt that always been the case mignon was a stranger and the workings of her mind were the foreign country in which she dwelt im far too tired to speak to you now valerie told her and headed for the door mother mignon thats enough her father said valerie heard bernard following she heard mignons wail of protest she paused for a moment then turned back to her you heard your father she said enough she went into the house she was monumentally exhausted bernard said her name as she made for the stairs he sounded tentative unsure in ways that bernard fairclough had never been unsure she said im going to bed bernard and she climbed the stairs to do so she was acutely aware of the need for a decision of some sort life as shed known it was something of a shambles now and she was going to have to work out how to repair it which pieces to keep which pieces to replace which pieces to send to the rubbish tip she was also aware of how much the burden of responsibility fell upon her shoulders for she had known all along about bernard and his life in london and that knowledge and what shed done with that knowledge were the sins that would weigh on her conscience till the end of her days ian had told her of course although it was his own uncle whose use of the firms money he was reporting upon ian had always recognised where the true power in fairclough industries lay oh bernard ran the daytoday business and indeed made many of the decisions bernard manette freddie and ian had together kept the concern moving forward modernising it in a way that valerie would never have considered but when the board met two times a year it was valerie who took the position at the head of the table and not one of them ever questioned this because that was how it had always been you could climb the ranks but there was a ceiling and breaking through it was a matter of blood not strength something curious and rather unsettling was how ian had reported it to her frankly aunt val id thought not to tell you at all because well youve been good to me and so has uncle bernie of course and for a while i thought i might be able to move funds around and cover the expenditures but its got to the point where i cant quite see how to do it a nice boy ian cresswell had been when hed come to live with them to attend school after his mothers death in kenya a nice man ian cresswell had become it was unfortunate that hed hurt his wife and children so badly when hed decided to live the life hed been intended to live from birth but sometimes these things happened to people and when they did you had to muddle on so valerie had seen his concern shed respected the battle of loyalities he was fighting and she was grateful that hed come to her with the printouts that showed where the money was going shed felt ghastly when hed died accident though it was she couldnt help thinking that she hadnt stressed enough the perilous condition of that dock in the boathouse but his death had given her the opening shed been looking for the only suitable manner in which bernard could be dealt with shed decided was humiliation in front of his entire family his children needed to know exactly what sort of man their father was theyd abandon him then to his london mistress and his bastard child and theyd circle the wagons of their devotion around their mother and that would be how bernard would pay for his sins for the children were faircloughs by blood the three of them and they would not brook the obscenity of their fathers double life for an instant then after a suitable amount of time had passed she would forgive him indeed after nearly fortythree years what else was valerie fairclough to do she went to her bedroom window it looked out upon lake windermere thankfully she thought it did not look out on the childrens garden that now probably would not be instead what she gazed upon was the great wide platter of the lake itself still as a mirror flung onto the earth reflecting as a mirror would do the fir trees along the shore the fell rising opposite the land of ireleth hall and the great cumulous clouds which were the usual aftermath of a stormy night it was a perfect autumn day appearing clean and polished valerie looked upon it and knew she didnt belong in it she was old and used up her spirit was dirty she heard bernard come into the room she didnt turn she heard his approach and she saw from the corner of her eye that hed brought a tray with him and was placing it on the demilune table between the rooms two lakeside windows above this table a large mirror hung and reflected in it valerie saw the tray held an offering of tea toast and boiled eggs she also saw reflected her husbands face he was the one to speak first i did it because i could my lifes been like that ive done what ive done because i could do it i suppose it was a challenge to myself much like winning you much like making more of the firm than your father and grandfather had been able to do i dont even know what it means that ive done what ive done and thats the worst of it because that tells me i might well do it all again isnt that a comforting thought she said dryly im trying to be honest with you another highly comforting thought listen to me the devil of it is that i cant say it meant nothing to me because it did mean something i just dont quite know what sex she said virility bernard not being such a little man after all that hurts he said as its intended she looked back at the view there were things to know before she decided and she might as well know them she told herself have you always he did her the courtesy of not misunderstanding yes he said not all the time only occasionally all right frequently usually when business took me elsewhere manchester perhaps birmingham edinburgh london but never with an employee until vivienne and even with her it was like the rest at first it was because i could but then things went further between us and i thought i saw a way to have two lives clever you she said clever me he replied she glanced at him then such a little man actually he was shorter than she by nearly five inches small a little delicate mischievous looking cocky grinning my god she thought all he needed was a hunchback a doublet and tights shed been as easily seduced as the lady anne she said to him why bernard and when his eyes narrowed she added why two lives one is usually more than enough i know that he said its the curse i live with one life was never enough for me one life didnt i dont know but she knew and perhaps shed known all along one life couldnt prove to you that you were more than bernie dexter from blake street in barrowinfurness one life could never do that he was silent outside the honking of ducks drew valeries attention back to the window and she saw a v of them flying in the direction of fell foot park and she thought of how ducks taking flight or landing made such a silly awkward spectacle but ducks in flight were as graceful as any bird and the equal of any bird doing what birds do it was only the getting there that was strange and different bernard said yes i suppose thats it blake street was the pit i climbed out of but its sides were slippery any wrong move and id slide back down i knew that she moved away from the window then she went to the tray and saw hed brought only enough for her one cup and saucer two boiled eggs but only one egg cup cutlery for one a single white napkin he wasnt so certain of himself after all there was a small mercy in this who are you now she asked him who do you want to be he sighed valerie i want to be your husband i cant promise that this the two of us you and i and what weve built wont all end up going down the fairloo in another six months but thats what i want to be your husband and thats all you have to offer me after nearly fortythree years thats all i have to offer he said why on earth would i accept that you as my husband with no promise of anything else such as fidelity such as honesty such as she shrugged i dont even know any longer bernard what what i want from you i no longer know she poured herself a cup of tea hed brought lemon and sugar no milk which was how shed always taken it hed brought toast without butter which was how shed always eaten it hed brought pepper but no salt which was how shed always seasoned her boiled egg he said valerie we have history together ive done you and our children a terrible wrong and i know why ive done it and so do you because im bernie dexter from blake street and thats all ive had to offer you from the first the things ive done for you she said quietly to you for you in order to please you to satisfy you and you have he said what it took from me you cant know that bernard youll never know that theres an accounting that needs to be made do you understand that can you understand that i do he said valerie i can she was holding her cup of tea to her lips but he took the cup from her he placed it carefully back onto its saucer please let me begin to make it he said great urswick cumbria the police had taken tim directly to hospital in keswick indeed theyd radioed for an ambulance to do so manette had insisted that she ride inside the vehicle with the boy because if she knew nothing else about tims condition and the prospects for his healing she knew that he needed to be close to what was standing in place of his immediate birth family from this time forward that was manette the alarm had still been howling like a warning of the apocalypses imminent arrival when the police burst onto the scene manette had been sitting on the makeshift bed with tims head in her lap and his body shrouded by the nightshirt and freddie had been crashing about looking for the guilty parties long since flown as well as for evidence of what had been going on in this place the camera was gone as was any sign of a computer but in their haste the other members of the cast and crew of the spectacle being filmed had overlooked such items as a jacket containing a mans wallet and credit cards a womans bag containing a passport and a rather heavy safe who knew what would be inside manette thought the police would find out soon enough tim had said nothing other than two numbly spoken sentences the first was he promised and the second please dont tell he wouldnt clarify who promised what to whom as to what he meant with please dont tell that was fairly clear manette rested her hand on his head his hair too long too greasy too unnoticed by anyone for far too long and she repeated no worries tim no worries the police had comprised uniformed constables on the beat but when they saw what they had walked into theyd used their shoulder radios and made a request for detectives and officers from vice thus manette and freddie had found themselves facetoface with superintendent connie calva once again when she stepped into the room and swept her gaze over the victorian bedroom the open window big ben in the distance the dog at the foot of the bed the discarded costumes and tim lying with his head in manettes lap she had said did you ring for an ambulance to the constables who nodded then to manette she said im sorry my hands were tied its the law and manette had turned away freddie had said dont tell us about the goddamn law and hed spoken so fiercely that manette felt such a wave of tenderness sweep over her that she wanted to weep for how stupid shed been not to see freddie mcghie clearly before this moment superintendent calva took no offence she fixed her eyes on manette and said you stumbled upon this i take it heard the burglar alarm saw the mess outside and reckoned what was going on thats what happened manette looked down at tim hed begun to shiver and she made her decision she cleared her throat and said no they hadnt just stumbled upon the scene although thank you superintendent for assuming they might have done she and her husband she forgot to refer to freddie as former or erstwhile or anything other than what hed once been to her when shed had common sense had broken into the place they had taken the law into their own hands and would have to embrace the consequences they hadnt arrived soon enough to stop some piece of filth from raping a fourteenyearold boy and filming it for the delectation of perverts around the globe but she and freddie would leave that part of it in the hands of the police as well as what the police wished to do about the fact that they she and her husband as she referred to him again had broken and entered or whatever the police wished to call it an accident i think superintendent calva had said perhaps malicious mischief by persons unknown in either case these wheelie bins need to have better braking devices on them ones that lock i daresay so they cant get out of hand and roll into the front doors of shops shed looked round the place and directed her officers to begin the process of collecting evidence shed concluded with well need a statement from the boy but not now manette told her theyd taken him then tim had been handled tenderly by the emergency staff at the hospital in keswick and ultimately released to his cousin manette she and freddie had taken him home provided him with a warm bath heated soup for him buttered soldiers to go along with it sat with him as he ate it and put him to bed then they had retired to their separate bedrooms in hers manette had spent a sleepless night in the early morning with darkness still pressing against the windows she made coffee she sat at the kitchen table and gazed unseeing at her reflection in the glass backed by night outside and the pond somewhere in that night and somewhere on the pond the swans tucked into the reeds together she considered what they had to do next which was to phone niamh shed already phoned kaveh to tell him only that tim was safe and inside her own home at this point and would he please let gracie know so that she wouldnt worry about her brother now she had to do something about niamh as tims mother niamh had a right to know what had occurred but manette wondered about niamhs need to know if she were informed and tim learned she had been informed and she did nothing after being informed the boy would be further devastated wouldnt he and wasnt that one pill of pain he didnt need to swallow on the other hand niamh had to be told something at some point since she knew her son had gone missing manette sat there at the kitchen table going back and forth and in and out trying to make a decision betraying tim seemed unthinkable to her on the other hand he was going to need help margaret fox school could give it to him if he cooperated with them but when had tim been known to cooperate and did what happened to him mean he might cooperate now why should he for gods sake whom could he trust god it was such a mess manette thought she didnt know where to begin to help the boy she was still sitting at the table in the kitchen when freddie came into the room she realised she must have dozed in her chair because it was fully light outside by then and freddie was dressed and pouring himself a cup of coffee when she snapped to ah she lives freddie came to the table with his mug of coffee took hers and dumped its cold contents into the sink he gave her a fresh cup and rested his hand on her shoulder briefly buck up old girl he said to her affably youll feel better after having a good run on that blasted treadmill of yours i daresay when he sat opposite her manette noted that he was dressed in his best suit which was not something he ever put on when he went to work he had on what he called his weddingsbaptismsandfunerals togs which he wore with a crisp white shirt with french cuffs and a linen handkerchief folded into the breast pocket of his jacket he was percent freddie mcghie at ease with himself and sparkling from his head to the tips of his polished shoes quite as if the previous day had not been a nightmare beginning to end he nodded at the handset of the phone which manette had left sitting in front of her on the table while she dozed he said hmm in reference to this and manette told him shed phoned kaveh he said what about niamh to which her reply was thats the question isnt it she told him that tim had begged her not to tell his mother hed amplified on please dont tell when shed gone into the bedroom to make sure he had everything he needed for the night i suppose i should ring her though manette concluded just to let her know hes with us but im reluctant even to do that much why the obvious she said the same reason tim doesnt want me to tell her anything from yesterday sometimes its just easier to speculate what might happen rather than to know the truth about people tim can think or i can think lets admit it that she wont care or she wont do anything or shell just feel bothered by the news and thats it but he and i wont know for sure will we so he and i can also think perhaps if she knew though shed jump into action shed shed this skin of indifference that shes been wearing shed i dont know freddie but if i phone her i cant avoid finding out the complete truth of niamh cresswell im not sure i want to know it just now and tim certainly doesnt freddie listened to all this in his usual fashion he finally said ah i see well that cant be helped can it and he reached for the phone he gave a glance to his watch punched in a number and said bit early but with good news early is always welcome and then after a moment sorry niamh its fred have i awakened you ah bit of a restless night here really so glad of it i say niamh weve got tim over here oh bit cold from exposure he was sleeping rough the imp ran into him in windermere quite by chance manettes looking after him yes yes thats just it could you phone the school and let them know oh well of course certainly youve put manette on his card as well eh very good of you niamh and i say manette and i would very much like to have tim and gracie stay here with us for a while how dyou feel about that hmm yes oh grand niamh manette will be thrilled shed quite fond of both of them that was it freddie ended the call put the handset back on the table and took up his coffee once again manette gaped at him what on earth are you doing making the necessary arrangements i see that but have you gone mad we cant have the children here whyever not freddie our lives are a terrible muddle what tim and gracie dont need is another uncertain situation in which to live oh yes a muddle i do know that tim thought that man was going to kill him freddie he needs help well thats understandable isnt it the killing part he must have been terrified he was in the midst of something he didnt understand and no you dont understand he thought that man meant to kill him because that was the deal theyd struck he told me last night he said hed agree to the film if this toyyou person would kill him afterwards because he said he lacked the bottle to kill himself he wanted to but he couldnt and above everything he didnt want gracie to think hed been a suicide freddie listened to this gravely chin on his thumb and index finger pressed agaist his lips he said i see good because that boys in such a state of confusion and emotion and passion and hurt and god i dont know what else so to bring him here into this situation perhaps permanently how could we do that to him first of all freddie replied after a moment of thought hes in a very good school where he can sort himself out if hes a mind to it our part is to give him that mind hes wanting a mum and a dad to stand behind him and believe in him and in the possibility that one can actually pick up the pieces of ones life and go on oh very well and good but how long can we give him that if we take him now what do you mean come along freddie manette said patiently dont be obtuse youre quite a wonderful catch and one of these women youre dating is going to reel you in then tim and gracie will face another broken situation and how can we ask either one of those children to go through that freddie looked at her steadily and said ah well have i been wrong then wrong about what about us because if i have ill dash back upstairs and get myself out of my wedding togs she looked at him till she could no longer see him for her blurring of vision she said freddie oh freddie no youre not wrong excellent i was feeling well a bit more certain than perhaps i should have done so i spoke to the registrar whos perfectly willing to make an exception in our case and allow us a wedding today ill need a best man and youll want a bridesmaid shall i rouse tim for the job do manette said ill phone gracie st johns wood london zed benjamin sat in the car park outside his mothers flat and he stared at the route he needed to walk to get inside he knew what awaited him there and he wasnt anxious to confront it it wasnt going to take long for his mother to work out the fact that hed lost his job and that was going to be a real teeth grinder to deal with in addition to that there was yaffa to be faced and what he really didnt want to see was her expression when she listened to the tale of how hed failed in every possible way pursuing his story of the century in cumbria worse he felt like hell hed awakened that morning in a budget hotel along the motorway hed left cumbria at once on the previous day directly after speaking to rodney aronson and collecting his things in windermere hed driven as far as he could towards london before hed had to stop for the rest of the night that night had been spent in a grubby room reminiscent of those japanese sleeping boxes hed once read about he felt as if hed attempted slumber inside a coffin make that a coffin with a loo he thought hed risen that morning as rested as a man could be after having a fight break out in his hotel corridor at three am necessitating an appearance by the local police hed got back to sleep at half past four but at five the various workers for the day shift in the various shops and takeaway food stalls of the services area had begun to arrive and they did their arriving with the accompaniment of the slamming of car doors and the shouts of greeting to each other so round half past the hour zed had given up on sleep altogether and crammed himself into the upright packing crate that went for a shower in the bathroom hed gone through the rest of his morning rituals by rote shaving cleaning his teeth dressing he hadnt felt like eating but he wanted a cup of coffee and he was in the cafeteria of the services building when the daily newspapers arrived zed couldnt help himself it was force of habit hed picked up a copy of the source and had taken it back to his table to see that the tabloid was running a followup to the earthshattering corsico piece about the mixedrace child of the minor royal the paper was giving it major breaking story treatment this time with the banner headline he declares his love accompanied by suitable photographs it seemed that the minor royal in question who appeared to be getting more minor by the moment intended to marry the mother of his bastard child since the revelation of his relationship to the woman had just obliterated her career as a thirdrate bollywood star turn to page to see who the mother of the bastard child might be zed did so he found himself looking at a sensuous woman with more than her share of mammaries posing with her royal suitor cum fiance with their child abounce on the royals knee he was grinning toothily on his face a selfsatisfied expression declaring to the men of his country look what i managed to get for myself you wankers and it was true the idiot had a title to recommend himself whether he had brains to go with the title was another matter entirely zed had tossed the paper to one side what a load of tosh it all was he thought he knew what would be going on at the source as a result of this piece and the one that had preceded it though it would be celebration of mitchell corsicos unerring ability to sniff out a story shape the public debate and manipulate a member of the royal family no matter how obscure to take an action predetermined by the tabloid he zedekiah benjamin struggling poet was better off shot of the place he shoved his way out of his car he could no longer avoid the inevitable he thought but he could damn well paint it as a positive alteration in his life if the proper words would come to him he had nearly reached the door when yaffa came out of the building she was wrestling with her rucksack so he reckoned she was on her way to the university she didnt see him and he considered ducking into the shrubbery in an attempt to hide from her but she looked up and clocked him she halted she stammered zed what a well what a a lovely surprise you didnt say you were returning to london today it wont be so lovely when i give you the news why im here whats wrong she sounded so concerned she took a step towards him and put her hand on his arm whats happened zed the sack her lips parted how soft they looked he thought she said zed youve lost your job but you were doing so well what about your story the people in cumbria all of the mystery surrounding them and what they were hiding what were they hiding the how and why and whoknowswhatandwhen about having babies he told her theres nothing else she frowned and scotland yard zed they cannot have been investigating having babies well thats just the worst of it yaff he admitted if there was anyone from scotland yard up there i never saw him but who was the woman then the scotland yard woman she wasnt scotland yard havent the foggiest who she was and it doesnt much matter now im through eh he was carrying his laptop and he shifted it from one hand to the other before going on fact is he said i was rather enjoying our little charade yaff the phone calls and all that she smiled me too he shifted the laptop again he didnt seem to know what to do with his hands and his feet all of a sudden he said right well so when dyou want to schedule our breakup better be sooner rather than later you ask me if we dont engineer it in the next couple of days mumll be talking to the rabbi and baking the challah yaffa laughed she said in a way that sounded like teasing and is that such a very bad thing zedekiah benjamin which part he asked the rabbi or the challah either both is that so bad the front door opened an elderly woman toddled out a miniature poodle in the lead zed stepped aside to let her pass she looked from him to yaffa to him she leered he shook his head jewish mums they didnt even have to be ones mum to be ones mum he thought with resignation he said to yaffa i dont think micah would much like it do you ah micah yaffa watched the old lady and her poodle the poodle lifted its tufted leg and did some business against a shrub zed i fear there is no micah he peered at her earnestly what damn you broke up with the bloke he never was the bloke she said he was actually zed he never was at all it took zed a moment then the moment felt like the dawn although it was morning and broad daylight in front of his mothers flat in st johns wood he said are you telling me she broke in with yes im telling you he began to smile what a very clever girl you are yaffa shaw he said i am she agreed but then i always have been and yes by the way yes to what to wanting to be your wife if you will have me despite the fact that i set out to ensnare you with your own mothers help but why would you want me now he asked i have no job i have no money i live with my mum and such are the mysteries of love she declared bryanbarrow cumbria gracie came dashing outside the moment the car stopped at the front gate she flung herself at tim and clung to his waist and tim could barely take in her words so rapidly did they come at him he was having a bit of trouble taking in the rest of things as well cousin manette had phoned margaret fox school to bring them up to date on his whereabouts shed requested permission for tim to miss just one more day shed promised shed have him back there tomorrow shed dressed herself in a peacock silk skirt and a milkycoloured cashmere pullover and a grey tweed jacket with a scarf that made all the colours good together and shed said they all had a wedding to attend at which tim was going to have to be best man that is if tim was willing to do so tim saw from her face that the wedding was her own he saw from freddies face that he was going to be the bridegroom he said i guess but he looked away quickly from the happiness that was blazing between his cousin and her soontobeonceagain husband and he thought how he didnt belong in that blaze how to enter it even for a moment promised the bleak reality of leaving it as well and he was tired of the constant leaving that had been colouring his life he added whatm i sposed to wear because clearly he had nothing suitable in great urswick we shall find something perfect manette had replied her arm through freddies but first gracie kavehs kept her home from school because of course i shall need a bridesmaid which was the topmost subject on gracies mind as she hung on tims waist a wedding a wedding a wedding she sang were going to a wedding timmy cn i get a new dress cousin manette should i wear white tights will there be flowers oh there must be flowers gracie needed no answer to any of this for she went on to other matters all of them having to do with tim and bella you must never run off again she told him i was that worried and scared tim i know i was cross with you but it was cause you hurt bella but bellas only a doll and i do know that its just that see dad gave her to me and he let me pick her out himself and she was special cause of that but im so glad youre back and whatre you going to wear and then to manette and freddie will there be guests will there be cake cousin manette where will you get flowers are your mum and dad coming as well what about your sister oh i expect the walk would be too much for her tim had to smile and it was odd because he hadnt felt like smiling in more than a year gracie was like a newly bloomed flower and he wanted to keep her that way all of them went into the house so that tim could find something to wear to a wedding he climbed the stairs to his room while gracie remained chatting to manette and freddie below but once inside the place looked different to him he saw things and knew them for his belongings but somehow they werent really his he resided there but he didnt reside there he wasnt sure what this meant or how to feel about it he had nothing nice to wear to a wedding all he had was his school uniform and he certainly didnt intend to wear that he thought for a moment about what it would mean if he took the next necessary step it seemed an enormous one something that might engulf and drag him under in ways he could neither anticipate nor recover from but there was a wedding and it was manette and freddies wedding and there seemed nothing else to do but to go into his fathers bedroom and to search round and ultimately pull from beneath the bed the black garbage bags of his fathers clothing that kaveh had shoved there preparatory to carting them all off to oxfam in advance of bringing his bride to the farm ians trousers were large on tim but a belt did the trick and in another year they would probably fit him anyway he sifted through the rest of the clothing more trousers and shirts ties and waistcoats teeshirts and sweaters and he thought of how well his dad had dressed and of what this meant about who his dad had been just a bloke tim thought just an ordinary bloke hurriedly he grabbed up a shirt a tie and a jacket he went back to the others who were waiting for him in the old kitchen of the manor house where gracie was taping a note to kaveh onto the cupboard in which he kept his tea gracie and timmy have gone to a wedding was written on the note what fun after this the lot of them set off to windermere on the way out to the car though they saw george cowley removing the last of his belongings from the tenants cottage daniel was there hanging back a bit and tim wondered that dan wasnt in school their eyes met then slid away from each other gracie called out bye dan bye dan were off to a wedding and we dont know if well ever be back it wasnt until theyd wended their way from bryanbarrow village to the main road through the lyth valley that manette turned in her seat and spoke to them she said what if you never came back at all gracie what if you and tim came to great urswick and lived with freddie and me gracie looked at tim she looked back at manette her eyes were round with expectation but she turned her gaze to the window and the passing scenery it offered her she said could i bring my trampoline manette said oh i think we have room for that gracie sighed she moved on the seat to be closer to tim she rested her cheek on his arm lovely she said so the drive to windermere was spent in a tangle of plans being laid tim closed his eyes and let the sounds of their conversation wash round him freddie slowed the car as they came to the town and manette said something about the register office which was when tim opened his eyes again he said cn i do something first i mean before the wedding manette turned to him and said of course he could so he directed freddie to the appliance repair shop where hed left bella the doll had been seen to her arms and legs were reconnected shed been cleaned up she wasnt what shed been before tim had pounced upon her but she was still unmistakably bella thought you wanted it posted the woman behind the counter said to him things changed tim said as he accepted the doll dont they always the woman said in the car he handed bella to his sister she clutched the doll to her budding little bosom and said you mended her you mended her and cooed to the thing as if it were a live baby and not a realistic depiction of one he said im sorry shes not as good as new ah freddie said as he moved the car away from the kerb but which one of us is november chelsea london when lynley and deborah arrived back in london it was after midnight theyd made the drive mostly in silence although lynley had asked her if she wanted to talk she knew he understood that she was carrying the heavier of both of their burdens because of her part in alateas flight and her death and he wanted to relieve her of at least part of the weight but she couldnt allow it may we just be quiet with each other shed asked him and so they had been although from time to time hed reached over and covered her hand with his own they hit traffic near the junction for liverpool and manchester they came upon road works near birmingham and a tailback from an accident at the junction for the a to northampton at this last they got off the motorway for a meal and spent ninety minutes hoping the route would be less congested at the meals conclusion they didnt reach the cricklewood roundabout until midnight and chelsea at half past the hour deborah knew that her husband was still up despite the time she knew he would be waiting for her in his study on the ground floor of the house because before she climbed the front steps to the door she saw that the light was on she found him reading he had the fire on and peach was snoozing in front of it on a cushion that simon had placed there for her the dachshund removed herself from this only slowly as deborah entered and she stretched her front legs and then her back legs before toddling over for a latenight greeting simon set his book to one side deborah saw it was a novel which was unusual for him simon was strictly a nonfiction reader favouring biographies and the recounting of superhuman acts of survival in the wild shackleton was his foremost hero he got to his feet always an awkward business for him he said i wasnt sure what time she said traffic was bad in places and then tommy told you he nodded his grey eyes taking in her face and gauging as he always would her expression and what it said about her state of mind he read upon her the heaviness she felt and he said he rang me when you stopped for petrol im terribly sorry my love she stooped to pick up the dachshund who squirmed in her arms and tried to climb to her face you were right about everything deborah said to her husband as she rubbed her cheek against the dogs silky head but then you usually are it gives me no pleasure which part being right always or being right just now neither one gives me pleasure and im not always right in matters of science i feel fairly certain that the ground im walking on is solid but in matters of the heart in matters affecting you and me believe me i have no idea deborah im a wanderer in the dark it was conception it became some sort of obsession for me i saw a sisterhood forming between us because of that magazine and i let that thought the thought that someone was as determined as i was as as empty as i was dominate everything else so im responsible for her death if i hadnt made her feel so vulnerable if i hadnt frightened her if i hadnt pursued her i thought she was talking about that mad journalist from the source when all along she thought id come from the man whod been searching for her the man she thought had been searching for her simon corrected her gently when you hold your truths as close as she did those truths can undermine your life the world becomes a suspicious place you were there at tommys request deborah the rest came from her but we both know thats not quite the truth deborah said i made more of what i saw in arnside house because i wanted to and both of us simon know exactly why i did that she went to one of the armchairs and sat peach settled into her lap deborah caressed the dog and then said to her husband whys she not sleeping with dad i required her presence i didnt want to wait for you alone deborah took this in how strange she finally said i wouldnt have thought alone would bother you youve always been so selfcontained so sure thats how ive seemed to you always how else could you seem so cool so rational so confident sometimes i just want you to explode simon but you never do and now even with this there you stand youre waiting for something from me i can feel that but i simply dont know what it is do you not or how to give it to you simon sat then not in the chair where hed been sitting when shed entered the room but rather on the arm of hers she couldnt see his face and he couldnt see hers she said i simply must get past this i do understand that but i dont know how to do it why can i not get past this simon how can i not be obsessed with something i want so much perhaps to want it less he said how do i manage that through resignation but that means ive given up that weve given up so where does that leave me wandering he said hungry she said thats what its like inside of me always this this hunger that nothing is able to assuage its horrible its why i always feel well empty i know i cant keep living this way but i dont know how to make the hunger stop perhaps youre not meant to he said perhaps youre meant to cope with it either that or to come to realise that the hunger and the appeasement of the hunger are two entirely different things theyre unrelated one will never quell the other deborah thought about this she considered how much of herself and the way in which shed lived so long had been tied up with a single unfulfilled desire she finally said this is not who i want to be my love then be someone else where on earth do i begin with that project he touched her hair with a good nights sleep he said wandsworth london lynley had thought about going directly home from chelsea his town house in belgravia was less than five minutes by car from the st jameses home but as if of its own volition the healey elliott had taken him to isabelles and he was putting his key in the lock and letting himself inside before he truly thought about why he was doing so the flat was dark as it would be at this time of night he went to the kitchen and turned on the dim light above the sink he examined the contents of the fridge and after this hating himself for doing so but doing it anyway he looked through the rubbish in its bin opened and closed the cupboards quietly and glanced into the oven to make sure it was empty he was doing this last when isabelle came into the room he didnt hear her shed flipped on the overhead lights before he was aware of her presence so he had no idea how long shed watched him prowling through her kitchen on his search she said nothing nor did he she merely looked from him to the open oven door before she turned and went back to her bedroom he followed her but in the bedroom it was more of the same and he couldnt help himself his glance went to the bedside table to the floor next to the bed to the top of the chest of drawers it was as if an illness had come over him she watched him that hed awakened her from sleep was obvious but what sort of sleep how it had been induced if it had been induced these were suddenly troubling matters that he had to sort out or so hed thought until he saw her expression acceptance along with its clansman resignation was in her eyes he said in a thousand different ways im sorry as am i she replied he went to her she wore only a thin nightgown and this she lifted over her head he put his hand on the back of her neck warm with sleep it was and he kissed her she tasted of sleep interrupted and of nothing else he broke from her looked at her then kissed her again she began to undress him and he joined her in the bed pulling the covers away off to the floor so that nothing could come between them but it was there nonetheless even as their bodies joined even as she rose above him and his hands sketched curves from her breasts to her waist to her hips even as they moved together even as he kissed her it was all still there no avoiding he thought no running no escape the pleasure of their connection was a celebration it was also however a pyre that bore the touch of a torch and then did what pyres always do afterwards their bodies slick and satisfied he said that was the last time wasnt it she said yes but we both knew that and after a moment it couldnt have worked tommy but i have to say how i wanted it to he sought her hand which lay palmdown on the mattress he covered it and her fingers spread his curved into hers this isnt about helen he told her you must know that i do she turned her head and her hair fell against her cheek for a moment it had become mussed during their lovemaking and he smoothed it for her brushing it back and behind her ear tommy i want you to find someone she said not to replace her for who could replace her but someone to continue your life with because thats all life is isnt it just continuing going on i want that as well he said i wasnt sure at first and its likely therell be days when i step backwards another time and tell myself theres no real life without helen in it but that will be a moments thought only ill come through it and out of it ill move on she reached up and used the back of her fingers against his cheek her expression was fond she said i cant say that i love you not with my demons and not with yours understood he said but i wish you well please know that no matter what happens i do wish you well belgravia london it was half past three in the morning when lynley finally returned to his home in eaton terrace he let himself inside the silent house felt for the light switch to the right of the heavy oak door and flipped it on his eyes lit on a pair of womens gloves that had been resting in place against the newel post at the bottom of the stairway for the last nine months he studied them for a moment before he crossed the entry took them in hand and held them briefly to his nose for a final scent of her faint but there the smell of citrus he felt the gloves softness against his cheek before he placed them in a small drawer of the coat tree near the door it came to him that he was very hungry the feeling was odd it had been many months since hed experienced real honest hunger in the pit of his stomach mostly hed been going through the motions of eating just to keep his body alive he went to the kitchen there he opened the refrigerator and saw that it was well stocked as always god knew he was pathetic as a cook but he reckoned he could manage scrambled eggs and toast without burning the house to the ground he removed what he would need for his makeshift meal and he began to search for the proper utensils with which to cook it he had not got far before charlie denton stumbled into the room in his dressing gown and slippers wiping his spectacles on his belt denton said whatre you doing in my kitchen m lord to which lynley replied as he always had done with a patient denton sorry denton said halfasleep what the bloody hell are you doing sir obviously im making something to eat lynley told him denton came to the worktop and examined what lynley had laid out eggs olive oil marmite jam sugar what exactly would that be he enquired scrambled eggs and toast where do you keep the frying pan for gods sake and wheres the bread that shouldnt require a search party should it denton sighed here let me youll only make a bloody mess of everything and ill be cleaning it up what were you intending with the olive oil doesnt one need something so the eggs dont stick sit sit denton waved at the kitchen table look at yesterdays paper go through the post ive not put it on your desk yet or do something useful like setting the table wheres the cutlery oh for gods sake just sit lynley did so he began to go through the post there were bills as always there was also a letter from his mother and another from his aunt augusta both of whom refused to have anything to do with email indeed his aunt had only recently begun resorting to a mobile to make her pronouncements from on high lynley set both letters to one side and unfurled a handbill from the elastic band that had kept it rolled he said what this and denton glanced his way dont know something on the doorknob he replied they were up and down the street yesterday i hadnt looked at it yet lynley did the looking he saw that it was an advertisement for an event at earls court in two days time not the normal sort of event he found but rather an exhibition of a sport the sport was flat track roller derby and he saw that boadiceas broads from bristol love the alliteration he thought were going to meet londons electric magic in an exhibition matchup that was described with large print that read the spills the chills the thrills come to witness the spectacular artistry and skatetokill drama of the women who live for the jam below this were the names of the sportswomen and lynley couldnt stop himself from reading through the list from looking for one name in particular a name he had certainly never thought hed see again and there it was kickarse electra the nom de guerre of a large animal veterinarian from the zoo in bristol one daidre trahair a woman who took the occasional country weekend in cornwall where he had met her lynley smiled at this then he chuckled denton looked up from the scrambling of eggs and said what what do you know about flat track roller derby what in hell is that if one might ask denton enquired i think we ought to find out you and i shall i purchase tickets for us charlie tickets denton looked at lynley as if hed gone halfmad but then he fell back against the stove and he struck a pose one arm lifted to his forehead he said my god has it actually come to this are you dare i say asking me out on a date lynley laughed in spite of himself i appear to be doing so what have we come to denton sighed ive absolutely no idea lynley answered november chalk farm london the day hadnt been an easy one for barbara havers it had largely depended upon the use of two skills that she possessed alas in minuscule proportion the first was an ability to ignore the obvious the second was the production of compassion for persons unknown ignoring the obvious meant saying nothing to di lynley about whatever it was that had happened between him and superintendent ardery from what barbara could tell their personal relationship was finished there was a sadness in both of them that they each attempted to mask with courtesy and kindness and from this barbara took the fact that their breakup was a mutual decision which was at least all to the good it would have been a real nightmare in the workplace had one of them wished to end their affair while the other continued to cling like a starfish to a piling at least this way they both could forge onward without blameful glances and meaningful remarks being flung about by the aggrieved party for the next six months but they were feeling the end of things there was so much melancholy in the air round them that barbara decided that avoidance was the better part of valour in this situation her lack of skill in the compassion department didnt relate to lynley and superintendent ardery though neither of them was about to unburden a heavy heart onto her shoulders so she was relieved about that she was less relieved when she met engracia in the wine bar near gower street a second time and asked the spanish student to place another phone call to argentina while engracia spoke to carlos the brother of alatea vasquez y del torres barbara fed her the information he happened to be there at his parents home making a call upon his mother and in his company was his cousin elena maria with whom engracia also spoke she went between what barbara was telling her and what the argentines were saying in reply and in this manner they navigated the waters of a familys sorrow please tell them alatea has drowned please let them know that as of yet there is no body because of the conditions in morecambe bay where she was lost the sands shift due to the tide it has to do with various elements rivers running into it something thats called the tidal bore mudflats quicksand we do believe the body will turn up and weve been given a good idea where will be buried by her husband yes she was married yes she was very happy shed merely gone for a walk so terribly sorry ill see about photos yes so understandable that youd want to know definitely an accident definitely an accident absolutely no doubt that it was a terrible and tragic accident whether it was or wasnt an accident didnt matter barbara thought in the final analysis dead was dead she and engracia parted outside the wine bar both of them feeling the regret of having to pass along the news of alateas death engracia had wept as shed spoken to carlos and then to elena maria and barbara had marvelled at this at the idea of weeping over the death of someone she had never met in fellow feeling with individuals thousands of miles away whom she would also never meet what was it that prompted such a rush of compassion within one she wondered what was wrong with her that she didnt feel it or was this separation of self from event merely part and parcel of the career shed chosen she didnt want to think about any of it lynleys gloom isabelle arderys melancholy an argentine familys grief so on the way home that evening she thought instead of something more pleasant which was her upcoming dinner this would comprise steak and kidney suettopped pie thrown into the microwave a can of red wine popped open toffee cheesecake and a cup of reheated morning coffee afterwards then an evening propped up on the daybed with passions sweet promise open on her lap and an hour or two to discover if grey mannington would finally embrace his love for ebony sinclair in typical romance novel fashion having much to do with heaving bosoms muscular thighs probing tongues and searing pleasures shed turn the electric fire on within the mousehole fireplace as well she thought for it had been bitterly cold all day and the promise of a deadly winter was being made each morning written in the frost on her windowpanes it was going to be a bad one and a long one she thought best get out the woolies and prepare to sleep nightly between brushed cotton sheets at home she saw that azhars car was in the driveway but the lights were not on in the familys flat they were probably out to dinner she reckoned having walked the short distance to chalk farm road or haverstock hill perhaps everything had worked out after all she thought perhaps azhars other children and his neverdivorced wife were at this moment dining en famille at the local chinese with azhar hadiyyah and angelina perhaps theyd all come to terms with a brilliant way to share in each others lives the wife forgiving the husband for having walked out on her for a university student whom hed impregnated the husband abjuring guilt for having done so the former university student proving her worth as mother and quasistepmother to all of the children everyone living in one of the odd family situations becoming so prevalent in their society it could have happened barbara thought of course all the pigs in england could have taken to the air today as well meantime it was as cold as the heart of a serial killer and she hurried down the path alongside the edwardian house it was very dimly lit as two of the five garden lights had burnt out and no one had replaced them yet and it was darker still at the front of her bungalow since shed not thought to turn the porch light on when shed left that morning there was enough illumination however to see that someone was sitting on the single step in front of her door this was a hunched figure forehead on knees fists raised to temples the figure rocked slightly and when he raised his head at her approach barbara saw that it was taymullah azhar she said his name as a question but he didnt speak she saw then as she approached that he was wearing only one of his workday suits no overcoat or hat or gloves and as a result he was shivering so badly that his teeth made a death rattle inside his skull barbara cried azhar whats happened he shook his head a compulsive movement when she dashed to him and helped him to his feet he managed only two words theyve gone barbara knew at once she said come inside and with one arm round his waist she unlocked the door she guided him to a chair and helped him sit he was icy cold even his clothing felt stiff as if it were in the process of freezing to his skin she raced to the daybed and pulled off the counterpane she wrapped this round him put on the kettle and went back to the table to warm his hands with hers she said his name because it was the only thing she could think of to say to ask whats happened once again meant she was going to find out and she didnt think she wanted to know he was looking at her but she could tell he wasnt seeing her his were the eyes of a man gazing into the void the kettle snapped off and barbara went to it flung a bag of pg tips into a mug and sloshed the boiling water in after it she carried the tea to the table with a spoon and sugar and a carton of milk she slopped some of both into the mug and told him to drink she told him he had to get warm he couldnt hold the mug so she did this for him raising it to his lips one hand on his shoulder to keep him steady he took a gulp coughed and took another he said shes taken hadiyyah barbara thought he had to be mistaken surely angelina and hadiyyah had only gone for azhars other children surely despite the foolhardy nature of what angelina upman had planned it would only be a matter of an hour or so before angelina and hadiyyah tripped up the path with those children in tow and the big surprise about to unfold but barbara knew she knew she was lying to herself just as angelina had lied over azhars shoulder barbara saw that her answering machine was blinking with messages perhaps she thought perhaps perhaps she curved azhars hand round the tea and went to the machine two messages were indicated and the first voice she heard was angelinas hari will be quite upset tonight barbara the womans pleasant voice said will you check on him at some point id be ever so grateful there was a pause before angelina went on with make him understand this isnt personal barbara well it is and it isnt will you tell him that and then following that brief and inconclusive message the second was azhars voice breaking on barbara barbara their passports her birth certificate and his terrible sobbing before the line went dead she turned back to him he was bent over the table she went to him she said oh my god azhar what has she done except the worst of it was that she knew what angelina upman had done and she realised that had she only spoken had she told him about the surprise that hadiyyah had revealed to her he might well have twigged what was about to happen and he might well have been able to do something to stop it barbara sat she wanted to touch him but she was afraid that a gesture of concern from her might shatter him like glass she said azhar hadiyyah told me about a surprise she said she and her mum were planning to fetch your other children the children the children from your marriage azhar azhar i didnt know what to tell you i didnt want to betray her confidence and bloody hell what is wrong with me i should have said something i should have done something i didnt think he said numbly she doesnt know where they are she must have found out how she doesnt know their names not the childrens not my wifes she couldnt have but hadiyyah would have thought even now she must think he said nothing more we must phone the local police barbara said even though she knew that it was useless for hadiyyah wasnt with a stranger she was with her own mother and no divorce existed with complicated custody arrangements attached to it for there had been no marriage in the first place there had only been a man a woman and their daughter who had lived for a short time in relative peace but then the mother had run off and although shed returned it now was clear to barbara that angelina upmans intention had always been to come for her child and to leave again first to soothe azhar into a false sense of all being well and then to take hadiyyah away from her father and to fade with her into obscurity how they had all been duped and used barbara thought and what what what was hadiyyah going to think and feel when she began to understand that she had been ripped away from the father she adored and the only life she had ever known to be taken where barbara thought where no one vanished without a trace barbara was a cop and she knew very well that no one ever managed to flee without a single clue being left behind she said to azhar take me to the flat i cannot go in there again you must azhar its the route to hadiyyah slowly he got to his feet barbara took his arm and guided him along the path to the front of the house at the flagstone area before the door he stopped but she urged him forward she was the one to open the door though she found the lights and she switched them on illumination revealed the sitting room altered by angelina upmans impeccable good taste barbara saw the alteration now for what it was and for what it had been which was just another way to seduce not only azhar but hadiyyah and barbara herself if it came down to it what fun we shall have doing it darling hadiyyah and how we shall surprise your father azhar stood there between the sitting room and the kitchen immobile and ashen barbara thought there was every chance the man might simply pass out so she took him into the kitchen the room least altered by angelina and she sat him at the small table there she said wait and then azhar its going to be all right were going to find her well find them both he didnt reply in his bedroom barbara saw that all of angelinas belongings were gone she couldnt have packed everything and taken it off in suitcases so she must have shipped things on ahead with no one the wiser this meant shed known where she was going and possibly to whom an important detail on the bed a strongbox lay its lid open and its contents dumped out barbara looked through all this noting insurance papers azhars passport a copy of his birth certificate and a sealed envelope with will written on the front in his neat cursive as he had said everything relating to hadiyyah was missing and this state of affairs was underscored by the little girls bedroom her clothing was gone with the exception of her school uniform which lay on the bed spread out as if in mockery of tomorrow morning when hadiyyah would not be there to don it also still there was her school rucksack and inside her schoolwork was neatly placed within a threering binder on her little desk tucked beneath a window her laptop was in position and sitting on top of it was a small stuffed giraffe that barbara knew had been given to hadiyyah by a goodhearted girl in essex the previous year in balfordlenez on the pleasure pier hadiyyah barbara thought would want that giraffe she would want her laptop she would want her school things she would want above everything else her father she returned to the kitchen where azhar sat staring at nothing she said to him azhar youre her father you have a claim upon her shes lived with you since she was born youve a building full of people right here whore going to testify to that the police will ask them and theyll say youre the parent of record hadiyyahs school will say that as well everyone my name is not on her birth certificate barbara it never was angelina would not put it on it was the price i paid for not divorcing my wife barbara swallowed she took a moment she forged ahead all right well work with that it doesnt matter there are dna tests shes half you azhar and well be able to prove it in what manner without her here and what does it matter when she is with her mother angelina defies no law she defies no court order she does not fly in the face of what a judge has told her must be the way in which hadiyyah is shared shes gone shes taken my daughter with her and they are not returning he looked at barbara and his eyes were so pained that barbara couldnt hold his gaze she said uselessly no no thats not how it is but he put his forehead against his upraised fists and he hit himself once twice and barbara grabbed his arm she said dont well find her i swear well find her im going to phone now im ringing some people there are ways there are means shes not lost to you and you must believe that will you believe it will you hang on ive nothing to hang on to he told her and ive less to hang on for chalk farm london who could she blame barbara asked herself who on gods bloody earth could she possibly blame she had to blame someone because if she could not find a person to wear the mantle of guilt she was going to have to blame herself for being seduced for being awed for being stupid for being it all came down to isabelle ardery she decided if the bloody superintendent hadnt ordered insisted recommended strongly that barbara alter her appearance none of this would have happened because barbara wouldnt have come to know angelina upman in the first place so she would have maintained a distance from her that might have allowed her to see and to understand but what really did that matter because angelina had intended to take her daughter away from the very first hadnt she and that had been the argument barbara had heard that day between angelina and azhar it had been her threat and his reaction to her threat azhar had lost his temper as any father might in the face of her declaration that she would take away his child but when angelina had explained the cause of the argument to barbara barbara had stood there in her little shop of deceit and shed bought up her lies every one of them she didnt want to leave azhar alone but she had no choice once she decided to make her phone call she didnt want to do it in his presence because she wasnt sure of the outcome despite her words of assurance to the man she said i want you to lie down azhar i want you to try to rest ill be back i promise you you wait here ill be gone a little while because i have some phone calls to make and when i return ill have a plan but in the meantime i have to phone azhar are you listening can you hear me she wanted to ring someone to come to him and to comfort him in some way but she knew there was no one other than herself all she could do was get him into his bedroom cover him with a blanket and promise she would return as soon as she could she hurried to her bungalow to place the call there was only one person she could think of who might be of help who would be able to think clearly in this situation and she rang his mobile lynley said yes barbara is that you over a tremendous roaring of noise and music in the background barbara felt a surge of gratitude and she said sir sir yes i need he said barbara i cant actually hear you im going to have to his voice was overwhelmed by the cheers of a crowd where in gods name was he she wondered at a football game he said as if in answer im at the exhibition centre earls court more cheers and roaring and lynley saying to someone charlie has she gone out of bounds my god the womans aggressive can you tell whats happened someone said something in reply and this was followed by lynleys laughter lynley laughing barbara realised as shed not heard him laugh since before last february when it had seemed his laughter had died forever he said into his mobile roller derby barbara and she could barely hear him over the background noise although she managed to catch that woman from cornwall and she thought is he on a date with a woman from cornwall what woman from cornwall and what is roller derby and who is charlie someone otherwise called charlotte he couldnt mean charlie denton could he what on earth would lynley be doing out and about with charlie denton she said sir sir but it was hopeless another roar from the crowd and he said to someone is that a point and then to her barbara may i ring you back i cant hear a thing she said yes and she thought about texting him instead but there he was in a moment of happiness and pleasure and how on earth could she tear him from it when the truth of the matter as she bloody well knew despite her words to azhar was that there was nothing he could do there was nothing anyone could do officially whatever happened next was going to have to happen in an extremely unofficial manner she ended the call she stared at the phone she thought of hadiyyah it had been only two years since barbara had met her but it did seem as if shed known her the length of her very short life a little dancing girl with flying plaits it came to barbara that hadiyyahs hair had been different the last few times shed seen her and she wondered how much different it was going to become in the ensuing days how will she make you look barbara wondered what will she tell you about your disguise more what will she tell you about where youre going once it becomes clear there are no half siblings for you to meet at the end of your journey and where will that journey take you into whose arms is your mother fleeing for this was the truth of the matter and what could be done to stop it when angelina upman was only a mother whod come to claim her child a mother whod returned from canada or wherever shed been with whomever shed been with who was of course the very same person to whom she was running some bloke whod been seduced by her just like azhar just like all of them seduced into waiting instead of believing what had angelina done and where had she gone she had to get back to azhar but barbara began to pace every black cab in london she thought every mini cab and there were thousands every bus and after that the cctv films from the chalk farm tube station then the railway stations the eurostar after that the airports luton stansted gatwick heathrow every hotel every b amp b every flat and every hidey hole there was from the centre of london working out to the edges and then beyond the channel islands the isle of man the inner and outer hebrides europe itself france spain italy portugal how long would it take to find a beautiful lighthaired woman and her darkhaired little girl a little girl who was going to want her father soon who was going to manage god in heaven she would manage wouldnt she to get to a phone and to ring her father so that she could say daddy daddy mummy doesnt know im ringing and i want to come home so do we wait for the call barbara asked herself do we set out to find her do we simply pray do we convince ourselves with any amount of lies that no harm is meant and no harm will be done because this is after all a mother who loves her child and who knows above all that hadiyyah belongs with her father because hes given up everything to stand at her side and has as a result absolutely nothing without her god how she wanted lynley to be there he would know what to do he would know what to say he would listen to the entire anguished tale and he would have the right words of hope to give to azhar the words she herself couldnt muster because she hadnt the skill she hadnt the heart but still she had to do something say something find something because if she didnt what sort of friend was she to a man in agony and if she couldnt find the words or develop a plan was she in truth a friend at all it was nearly ten oclock when barbara finally went to her bungalows small bathroom lynley had not yet rung her back but she knew he would he would not fail her because di lynley did not fail people that was not who he was so he would ring as soon as he was able and barbara believed this she clung to this because she had to believe something and there was nothing else left to believe and she certainly didnt believe in herself in the bathroom she turned on the shower and waited for the water to heat she was shivering not from the cold for the electric fire had finally warmed the bungalow but rather from something else far more insidious and more deeply felt
