introduction by elizabeth george whether the story is a murder mystery a tale of suspense a psychological study of the characters affected by a devastating event the retelling of a famous criminal act a courtroom drama an expos√© a police procedural or a truthful account of an actual offense the question remains the same why crime whether the characters involved are fbi agents policemen and women forensic scientists journalists military personnel the man or woman on the street private detectives or the little old lady who lives next door the question remains the same why crime be it murder singular serial or mass mayhem robbery assault kidnapping burglary extortion or blackmail we still want to know why crime why exists this fascination with crime and why above all exists this fascination with crime on the part of female writers i think there are several answers to these questions crime writing is practically as old as writing itself and is consequently very much part of our literary tradition the earliest crime stories come to us from the bible in a jealous rage cain kills abel in a jealous conspiracy josephs brothers sell him into slavery in egypt and fake his death for their devastated father in lustful jealousy david sends bathshebas husband to the front lines in battle so that he might have the winsome woman for himself in unrequited lust two respected elders bear false witness against the virtuous susanna condemning her to death for adultery unless someone can come forward and disprove their story fathers lie with their daughters in criminal acts of incest brothers kill fight with lie about and otherwise abuse their brothers women demand the heads of men on platters judith decapitates holofernes judas betrays jesus of nazareth king herod slays the newborn male children of the hebrewsits a nasty place in the old and new testament and we feed off this place from our earliest years crime is mankind on the edge in extremis but more than that crime is mankind stepping outside of the norm for every cain there are a billion brothers who have coexisted throughout the centuries for every david there are ten million men whove turned away from a woman they want when they learn she is committed to another but this is what makes crime so interesting it isnt what people normally do it would be nice to believe that cars slow down on the freeway when there is an accident because of the drivers heightened sense of caution everyone sees the flashing lights up ahead the smoke the flares the ambulances the fire trucks and hits the brakes so as not to end up in the same condition as the unfortunates currently being extricated from mangled metal but this is not generally why people slow down they slow down to gawk their curiosity piqued why because an accident on the freeway is an anomaly and anomalies interest us they always interest us have done from the beginning of time and will do till the end of it brutal murders garner frontpage space kidnappings disappearances riots fatal auto accidents plane crashes terrorist bombings armed robbery snipers firing on the unsuspectingall of this cuts into everyday life awakening us to the fragility of our individual existences as it simultaneously whets our appetite to know we grind to a halt as a nation to listen to the verdict in the o j simpson case because there are base passions involved in whatever happened on bundy drive and the base passions of that double killer awaken the base passions within ourselves blood spilled cries out for more blood to spill in retribution for the act we seek a punishment to fit each crime crime is as old as humanity but so is sensation so is vengeance crime literature gives us a satisfaction that we are often denied in life in life we never do know who really killed nicole and ron we only suspect there was a second gunman on the grassy knoll we are left to wonder about dr shepherds wife and jeffrey macdonalds capacity for truth or selfdelusion the green river killer disappears into the primordial slime from which he rose the zodiac killer joins him there and we are left with only the questions themselves who were these people and why did they murder but in crime fiction the killers face justice it can be real justice poetic justice or psychological justice but face it they do they are unmasked and normalcy is restored there is vast satisfaction for the reader in that certainly more satisfaction than is garnered from the investigation into and punishment for an actual crime for the writer who wishes to explore characters there is nothing so catastrophically catalytic as the intrusion of a crime into an otherwise peaceful landscape a crime places everyone into a crucible the investigators the perpetrator the victims and those in relationship to the investigators the perpetrator and the victims within this crucible of lifes most monstrous acts the mettle of the characters is tested it is when characters confront the most serious challenges to their beliefs their peace their sanity and their way of life that their pathology is triggered and it is the pathology of the individual character clashing with the pathology of all the other characters that is the stuff of drama and catharsis some of our most enduring pieces of literature have a heinous crime as their backdrop hamlets monumental mental struggle to overcome his conscience and act the part of nemesis could not occur had the poisoning of his father not happened in a brutal act of fratricide oedipus could not fulfill his destiny without first killing king laius on the road to thebes medea would not be in the position in which she is placed in corinth an outcast about to be cast out by a nervous creon all too aware of her abilities as a sorceress had her reputation as the mastermind behind king peliass death not preceded her so it should come as no surprise to anyone who reads that crimes continue not only to fascinate writers but also to serve as the backbone for much of their prose what a crime does in a piece of literature is twofold first it serves as a throughline for the story to follow the crime must be investigated and solved within the twists and turns of the plot but secondly and perhaps more importantly the crime also acts as a skeleton for the body of the tale that the writer wishes to tell on this skeleton the writer can hang as much or as little as she likes she can keep the skeleton down to the bones alone and tell a story that moves smoothly concisely and without deviation or decoration to its revelation and conclusion or she can hang upon the skeleton the muscles tissues veins organs and blood of such diverse elements of storytelling as theme exploration of character life and literary symbols subplots etc as well as the specific crimeoriented story elements of clues red herrings suspense and a list of timehonored motifs peculiar to mysteries the hermetically sealed death chamber or locked room the most obvious place the trail of false clues left by the real killer the fixed idea and on and on thus her characters can march handinhand in the direction of an ineluctable conclusion or they can become sidetracked by the myriad possibilities offered to them through means of an expanded storyline and a more complicated structure why then would a writer ever consider dabbling in anything else there is no reason that i can see for as long as a writer adheres to the notion that the only rule is there are no rules the skys the limit within this field this still doesnt answer the question about female writers attraction to crime literature and it is indeed a question ive been asked over and over again by journalists with a rather tedious regularity the golden age of mystery in great britain and the commonwealth which i would consider spanning the years from the twenties through the fifties is dominated by women indeed their names comprise a pantheon into whose company every modern writer aspires to join agatha christie dorothy l sayers ngaio marsh margery allinghamits not terribly difficult to sort out why women writers throughout the twentieth century endeavored to join this distinguished company once one woman made an inroad into an area of literature other women were quick to follow the fascination with crime writing on the part of females can thus be explained with ease women chose to write crime stories because they were successful at it success on the part of one woman breeds the desire for success on the part of another in the united states this also holds true but the difference in the united states is that the golden age of mystery is dominated by men and that women are janetcomelatelies to it when we think of the golden age in america we think of dashiell hammett and raymond chandler of firstperson narratives with toughguy private eyes who smoke drink bourbon live in seedy apartments and dismissively refer to women as dames they use guns and their fists and theyve got tude to spare theyre loners and they like it that way breaking into this maledominated world required guts and tenacity on the part of women writers some of them opted to write kinder gentler mysteries in order to offer something more in keeping with the delicate sensibilities of the female readers they were hoping to attract others decided to barge right in and join the men creating female private eyes who were as hardbitten as the men they sought to replace sue grafton and sara paretsky proved irrefutably that a female pi would be accepted by an audience of both men and women readers and a score of other female writers began to follow in grafton and paretskys footsteps thus the arena widened in the united states as well offering women another outlet for their creative energies creating crime fiction offers writers a vast landscape as broad and as varied as crime itself because there are no hardandfast rules and because those few rules that exist exist to be broken witness the uproar over the murder of roger ackroyd when it was first published in the writer can choose any setting on earth which she can then people with teenagers as sleuths children as sleuths old ladies as sleuths animals as sleuths shutins and agoraphobics as sleuths teachers as sleuths doctors as sleuths astronauts as sleuths and on and on as far as the imagination can carry her with this as a basic tenet of crime writing the real question should be not why do so many women write crime stories but why doesnt everyone write crime stories this volume doesnt attempt to answer that question what it does however is present for your entertainment a centurys collection of crime and suspense stories by women what youll notice about this collection is that it includes names closely associated with crime writing dorothy l sayers minette walters sue grafton and others but it also includes some names one doesnt normally associate with crime writing at all names like nadine gordimer and joyce carol oates ive tried to come up with as wide a range of female authors as possible because a wide range reflects my primary belief about crime writing and that is this crime writing does not have to be considered genre writing it is not confined to a few moderately talented practitioners and most importantly it is indeed something that can stand will stand and has already stood the test of time one of the greatest sources of irritation to me as a writer is the number of people who stubbornly consider crime writing a lesser form of literary endeavor throughout the years that ive written crime fiction ive had numerous conversations with people that reflect this very strange point of view one man at a writing conference told me that he was going to write crime fiction as practice and then later on he would write a real novel like making tacos until you can graduate to chocolate cake from scratch i asked him innocently a journalist in germany once asked me what i thought of the fact that my novels werent reviewed in a highbrow newspaper that i had never heard of gosh i dont know i guess that paper doesnt have much impact on sales i told her several times people have stood up during qa at the end of speeches ive given and asked me why a writer like you doesnt write serious novels i consider crime fiction serious i tell them but always there is this underlying belief on the part of some readers and some critics crime fiction isnt something that should be taken seriously this is an unfortunate point of view while its true that some crime fiction is lowbrow formulaic and without much merit the same can be said of anything else thats published some books are good some are indifferent and some are downright bad but the reality is that a great deal of crime fiction has done what mainstream literary fiction only dreams of doing it has successfully stood the test of time for every sir arthur conan doyle whose sherlock holmes still inspires devotion and enthusiasm over one hundred years after his creation there are thousands of writers whose work of ostensible literature has faded into complete obscurity given the choice between being labeled a literary writer and disappearing ten years after i hang up my spurs or being labeled only a crime writer and having my stories and novels read one hundred years from now i know which choice i would make and i can only assume any writer of sense would make the same one for my money literature is whatever lasts during his lifetime no one would have accused william shakespeare of writing great literature he was a popular playwright who peopled his productions with characters who satisfied every possible level of education and experience in his audience charles dickens wrote serials for the newspaper penning them as quickly as he could in order to support his everburgeoning family and the aforementioned arthur conan doyle a young ophthalmologist building a practice wrote mysteries to while away the time as he waited for patients to show up in his surgery none of these writers was worried about immortality none of them wrote while wondering whether their work would be considered literature commercial fiction or trash they were each concerned about telling a great story telling it well and placing it before an audience the rest they placed as wise men and women do into the hands of time this collection of authors represents that same philosophy of writing what you want to write and writing it well some of them have done that died and achieved a modicum of immortality the rest of them remain earthbound still writing and waiting to see how time will deal with them all of them share in common a desire to explore mankind in a moment on the edge the edge equates to the crime committed how the characters deal with the edge is the story a jury of her peers susan glaspell susan keating glaspell was born in davenport iowa attended drake university and the university of chicago and worked as a journalist before turning to fulltime fictionwriting in her first novel the glory of the conquered appeared in and her first story collection lifted masks in but she would achieve her greatest fame as a playwright culminating in a controversial pulitzer prize for alisons house inspired by the life of emily dickinson from to she was a member of the provincetown players a bohemian theatrebased community founded by her idealist husband george cram cook among the other members were edna st vincent millay djuna barnes edna ferber john reed and the writer who would become the greatest american playwright of the time eugene oneill after early stories that were popular romances of the localcolor school glaspell was influenced to adopt a more naturalistic approach along with socialist political attitudes by her husband and floyd dell the rebellion of women against the domination of simpleminded males was a continuing subject one of her plays the oneact trifles became the basis for her most famous story a jury of her peers theres no denying this is a detective story indeed in the fashion of the time one in which amateur sleuths are more perceptive than professionals but it is a highly unconventional oneofakind detective story in which the detection is used to make a serious thematic point when martha hale opened the stormdoor and got a cut of the north wind she ran back for her big woolen scarf as she hurriedly wound that round her head her eye made a scandalized sweep of her kitchen it was no ordinary thing that called her away it was probably further from ordinary than anything that had ever happened in dickson county but what her eye took in was that her kitchen was in no shape for leaving her bread all ready for mixing half the flour sifted and half unsifted she hated to see things half done but she had been at that when the team from town stopped to get mr hale and then the sheriff came running in to say his wife wished mrs hale would come too adding with a grin that he guessed she was getting scary and wanted another woman along so she had dropped everything right where it was martha now came her husbands impatient voice dont keep folks waiting out here in the cold she again opened the stormdoor and this time joined the three men and the one woman waiting for her in the big twoseated buggy after she had the robes tucked around her she took another look at the woman who sat beside her on the back seat she had met mrs peters the year before at the county fair and the thing she remembered about her was that she didnt seem like a sheriffs wife she was small and thin and didnt have a strong voice mrs gorman sheriffs wife before gorman went out and peters came in had a voice that somehow seemed to be backing up the law with every word but if mrs peters didnt look like a sheriffs wife peters made it up in looking like a sheriff he was to a dot the kind of man who could get himself elected sheriff a heavy man with a big voice who was particularly genial with the lawabiding as if to make it plain that he knew the difference between criminals and noncriminals and right there it came into mrs hales mind with a stab that this man who was so pleasant and lively with all of them was going to the wrights now as a sheriff the countrys not very pleasant this time of year mrs peters at last ventured as if she felt they ought to be talking as well as the men mrs hale scarcely finished her reply for they had gone up a little hill and could see the wright place now and seeing it did not make her feel like talking it looked very lonesome this cold march morning it had always been a lonesomelooking place it was down in a hollow and the poplar trees around it were lonesomelooking trees the men were looking at it and talking about what had happened the county attorney was bending to one side of the buggy and kept looking steadily at the place as they drew up to it im glad you came with me mrs peters said nervously as the two women were about to follow the men in through the kitchen door even after she had her foot on the doorstep her hand on the knob martha hale had a moment of feeling she could not cross the threshold and the reason it seemed she couldnt cross it now was simply because she hadnt crossed it before time and time again it had been in her mind i ought to go over and see minnie fostershe still thought of her as minnie foster though for twenty years she had been mrs wright and then there was always something to do and minnie foster would go from her mind but now she could come the men went over to the stove the women stood close together by the door young henderson the county attorney turned around and said come up to the fire ladies mrs peters took a step forward then stopped im not cold she said and so the two women stood by the door at first not even so much as looking around the kitchen the men talked for a minute about what a good thing it was the sheriff had sent his deputy out that morning to make a fire for them and then sheriff peters stepped back from the stove unbuttoned his outer coat and leaned his hands on the kitchen table in a way that seemed to mark the beginning of official business now mr hale he said in a sort of semiofficial voice before we move things about you tell mr henderson just what it was you saw when you came here yesterday morning the county attorney was looking around the kitchen by the way he said has anything been moved he turned to the sheriff are things just as you left them yesterday peters looked from cupboard to sink from that to a small worn rocker a little to one side of the kitchen table its just the same somebody should have been left here yesterday said the county attorney oh yesterday returned the sheriff with a little gesture as of yesterday having been more than he could bear to think of when i had to send frank to morris center for that man who went crazy let me tell you i had my hands full yesterday i knew you could get back from omaha by today george and as long as i went over everything here myself well mr hale said the county attorney in a way of letting what was past and gone go tell just what happened when you came here yesterday morning mrs hale still leaning against the door had that sinking feeling of the mother whose child is about to speak a piece lewis often wandered along and got things mixed up in a story she hoped he would tell this straight and plain and not say unnecessary things that would just make things harder for minnie foster he didnt begin at once and she noticed that he looked queer as if standing in that kitchen and having to tell what he had seen there yesterday morning made him almost sick yes mr hale the county attorney reminded harry and i had started to town with a load of potatoes mrs hales husband began harry was mrs hales oldest boy he wasnt with them now for the very good reason that those potatoes never got to town yesterday and he was taking them this morning so he hadnt been home when the sheriff stopped to say he wanted mr hale to come over to the wright place and tell the county attorney his story there where he could point it all out with all mrs hales other emotions came the fear that maybe harry wasnt dressed warm enough they hadnt any of them realized how that north wind did bite we come along this road hale was going on with a motion of his hand to the road over which they had just come and as we got in sight of the house i says to harry im goin to see if i cant get john wright to take a telephone you see he explained to henderson unless i can get somebody to go in with me they wont come out this branch road except for a price i cant pay id spoke to wright about it once before but he put me off saying folks talked too much anyway and all he asked was peace and quiet guess you know about how much he talked himself but i thought maybe if i went to the house and talked about it before his wife and said all the womenfolks liked the telephones and that in this lonesome stretch of road it would be a good thing well i said to harry that that was what i was going to say though i said at the same time that i didnt know as what his wife wanted made much difference to john now there he was saying things he didnt need to say mrs hale tried to catch her husbands eye but fortunately the county attorney interrupted with lets talk about that a little later mr hale i do want to talk about that but im anxious now to get along to just what happened when you got here when he began this time it was very deliberately and carefully i didnt see or hear anything i knocked at the door and still it was all quiet inside i knew they must be up it was past eight oclock so i knocked again louder and i thought i heard somebody say come in i wasnt sure im not sure yet but i opened the door this door jerking a hand toward the door by which the two women stood and there in that rockerpointing to itsat mrs wright everyone in the kitchen looked at the rocker it came into mrs hales mind that that rocker didnt look in the least like minnie foster the minnie foster of twenty years before it was a dingy red with wooden rungs up the back and the middle rung was gone and the chair sagged to one side how did she look the county attorney was inquiring well said hale she looked queer how do you mean queer as he asked it he took out a notebook and pencil mrs hale did not like the sight of that pencil she kept her eye fixed on her husband as if to keep him from saying unnecessary things that would go into that notebook and make trouble hale did speak guardedly as if the pencil had affected him too well as if she didnt know what she was going to do next and kind of done up how did she seem to feel about your coming why i dont think she minded one way or other she didnt pay much attention i said ho do mrs wright its cold aint it and she said is itand went on pleatin at her apron well i was surprised she didnt ask me to come up to the stove or to sit down but just set there not even lookin at me and so i said i want to see john and then she laughed i guess you would call it a laugh i thought of harry and the team outside so i said a little sharp can i see john no says she kind of dull like aint he home says i then she looked at me yes says she hes home then why cant i see him i asked her out of patience with her now cause hes dead says she just as quiet and dull and fell to pleatin her apron dead says i like you do when you cant take in what youve heard she just nodded her head not getting a bit excited but rockin back and forth why where is he says i not knowing what to say she just pointed upstairs like thispointing to the room above i got up with the idea of going up there myself by this time i didnt know what to do i walked from there to here then i says why what did he die of he died of a rope around his neck says she and just went on pleatin at her apron hale stopped speaking and stood staring at the rocker as if he were still seeing the woman who had sat there the morning before nobody spoke it was as if everyone were seeing the woman who had sat there the morning before and what did you do then the county attorney at last broke the silence i went out and called harry i thought i might need help i got harry in and we went upstairs his voice fell almost to a whisper there he was lying over the i think id rather have you go into that upstairs the county attorney interrupted where you can point it all out just go on now with the rest of the story well my first thought was to get that rope off it looked he stopped his face twitching but harry he went up to him and he said no hes dead all right and wed better not touch anything so we went downstairs she was still sitting that same way has anybody been notified i asked no says she unconcerned who did this mrs wright said harry he said it businesslike and she stopped pleatin at her apron i dont know she says you dont know says harry werent you sleepin in the bed with him yes says she but i was on the inside somebody slipped a rope round his neck and strangled him and you didnt wake up says harry i didnt wake up she said after him we may have looked as if we didnt see how that could be for after a minute she said i sleep sound harry was going to ask her more questions but i said maybe that werent our business maybe we ought to let her tell her story first to the coroner or the sheriff so harry went fast as he could over to high road the rivers place where theres a telephone and what did she do when she knew you had gone for the coroner the attorney got his pencil in his hand all ready for writing she moved from that chair to this one over herehale pointed to a small chair in the cornerand just sat there with her hands held together and looking down i got a feeling that i ought to make some conversation so i said i had come in to see if john wanted to put in a telephone and at that she started to laugh and then she stopped and looked at me scared at the sound of a moving pencil the man who was telling the story looked up i dunno maybe it wasnt scared he hastened i wouldnt like to say it was soon harry got back and then dr lloyd came and you mr peters and so i guess thats all i know that you dont he said that last with relief and moved a little as if relaxing everyone moved a little the county attorney walked toward the stair door i guess well go upstairs first then out to the barn and around there he paused and looked around the kitchen youre convinced there was nothing important here he asked the sheriff nothing that would point to any motive the sheriff too looked all around as if to reconvince himself nothing here but kitchen things he said with a little laugh for the insignificance of kitchen things the county attorney was looking at the cupboard a peculiar ungainly structure half closet and half cupboard the upper part of it being built in the wall and the lower part just the oldfashioned kitchen cupboard as if its queerness attracted him he got a chair and opened the upper part and looked in after a moment he drew his hand away sticky heres a nice mess he said resentfully the two women had drawn nearer and now the sheriffs wife spoke oh her fruit she said looking to mrs hale for sympathetic understanding she turned back to the county attorney and explained she worried about that when it turned to cold last night she said the fire would go out and her jars might burst mrs peterss husband broke into a laugh well can you beat the woman held for murder and worrying about her preserves the young attorney set his lips i guess before were through with her she may have something more serious than preserves to worry about oh well said mrs hales husband with goodnatured superiority women are used to worrying over trifles the two women moved a little closer together neither of them spoke the county attorney seemed suddenly to remember his manners and think of his future and yet said he with the gallantry of a young politician for all their worries what would we do without the ladies the women did not speak did not unbend he went to the sink and began washing his hands he turned to wipe them on the roller towel whirled it for a cleaner place dirty towels not much of a housekeeper would you say ladies he kicked his foot against some dirty pans under the sink theres a great deal of work to be done on a farm said mrs hale stiffly to be sure and yetwith a little bow to heri know there are some dickson county farmhouses that do not have such roller towels he gave it a pull to expose its full length again those towels get dirty awful quick mens hands arent always as clean as they might be ah loyal to your sex i see he laughed he stopped and gave her a keen look but you and mrs wright were neighbors i suppose you were friends too martha hale shook her head ive seen little enough of her of late years ive not been in this house its more than a year and why was that you didnt like her i liked her well enough she replied with spirit farmers wives have their hands full mr henderson and thenshe looked around the kitchen yes he encouraged it never seemed a very cheerful place said she more to herself than to him no he agreed i dont think anyone could call it cheerful i shouldnt say she had the homemaking instinct well i dont know as wright had either she muttered you mean they didnt get on very well he was quick to ask no i dont mean anything she answered with decision as she turned a little away from him she added but i dont think a place would be any the cheerfuler for john wrights bein in it id like to talk to you about that a little later mrs hale he said im anxious to get the lay of things upstairs now he moved toward the stair door followed by the two men i suppose anything mrs peters doesll be all right the sheriff inquired she was to take in some clothes for her you know and a few little things we left in such a hurry yesterday the county attorney looked at the two women whom they were leaving alone there among the kitchen things yes mrs peters he said his glance resting on the woman who was not mrs peters the big farmer woman who stood behind the sheriffs wife of course mrs peters is one of us he said in a manner of entrusting responsibility and keep your eye out mrs peters for anything that might be of use no telling you women might come upon a clue to the motive and thats the thing we need mr hale rubbed his face after the fashion of a show man getting ready for a pleasantry but would the women know a clue if they did come upon it he said and having delivered himself of this he followed the others through the stair door the women stood motionless and silent listening to the footsteps first upon the stairs then in the room above them then as if releasing herself from something strange mrs hale began to arrange the dirty pans under the sink which the county attorneys disdainful push of the foot had deranged id hate to have men comin into my kitchen she said testilysnoopin around and criticizin of course its no more than their duty said the sheriffs wife in her manner of timid acquiescence dutys all right replied mrs hale bluffly but i guess that deputy sheriff that come out to make the fire might have got a little of this on she gave the roller towel a pull wish id thought of that sooner seems mean to talk about her for not having things slicked up when she had to come away in such a hurry she looked around the kitchen certainly it was not slicked up her eye was held by a bucket of sugar on a low shelf the cover was off the wooden bucket and beside it was a paper bag half full mrs hale moved toward it she was putting this in here she said to herself slowly she thought of the flour in her kitchen at home half sifted half not sifted she had been interrupted and had left things half done what had interrupted minnie foster why had that work been left half done she made a move as if to finish it unfinished things always bothered her and then she glanced around and saw that mrs peters was watching her and she didnt want mrs peters to get that feeling she had got of work begun and then for some reason not finished its a shame about her fruit she said and walked toward the cupboard that the county attorney had opened and got on the chair murmuring i wonder if its all gone it was a sorry enough looking sight but heres one thats all right she said at last she held it toward the light this is cherries too she looked again i declare i believe thats the only one with a sigh she got down from the chair went to the sink and wiped off the bottle shell feel awful bad after all her hard work in the hot weather i remember the afternoon i put up my cherries last summer she set the bottle on the table and with another sigh started to sit down in the rocker but she did not sit down something kept her from sitting down in that chair she straightened stepped back and half turned away stood looking at it seeing the woman who sat there pleatin at her apron the thin voice of the sheriffs wife broke in upon her i must be getting those things from the front room closet she opened the door into the other room started in stepped back you coming with me mrs hale she asked nervously you you could help me get them they were soon back the stark coldness of that shutup room was not a thing to linger in my said mrs peters dropping the things on the table and hurrying to the stove mrs hale stood examining the clothes the woman who was being detained in town had said she wanted wright was close she exclaimed holding up a shabby black skirt that bore the marks of much making over i think maybe thats why she kept so much to herself i spose she felt she couldnt do her part and then you dont enjoy things when you feel shabby she used to wear pretty clothes and be lively when she was minnie foster one of the town girls singing in the choir but that oh that was twenty years ago with a carefulness in which there was something tender she folded the shabby clothes and piled them at one corner of the table she looked at mrs peters and there was something in the other womans look that irritated her she dont care she said to herself much difference it makes to her whether minnie foster had pretty clothes when she was a girl then she looked again and she wasnt so sure in fact she hadnt at any time been perfectly sure about mrs peters she had that shrinking manner and yet her eyes looked as if they could see a long way into things this all you was to take in asked mrs hale no said the sheriffs wife she said she wanted an apron funny thing to want she ventured in her nervous little way for theres not much to get you dirty in jail goodness knows but i suppose just to make her feel more natural if youre used to wearing an apronshe said they were in the bottom drawer of this cupboard yes here they are and then her little shawl that always hung on the stair door she took the small gray shawl from behind the door leading upstairs and stood a minute looking at it suddenly mrs hale took a quick step toward the other woman mrs peters yes mrs hale do you think she did it a frightened look blurred the other things in mrs peterss eyes oh i dont know she said in a voice that seemed to shrink away from the subject well i dont think she did affirmed mrs hale stoutly asking for an apron and her little shawl worryin about her fruit mr peters says footsteps were heard in the room above she stopped looked up then went on in a lowered voice mr peters says it looks bad for her mr henderson is awful sarcastic in a speech and hes going to make fun of her saying she didnt wake up for a moment mrs hale had no answer then well i guess john wright didnt wake up when they was slippin that rope under his neck she muttered no its strange breathed mrs peters they think it was such a funny way to kill a man she began to laugh at the sound of the laugh abruptly stopped thats just what mr hale said said mrs hale in a resolutely natural voice there was a gun in the house he says thats what he cant understand mr henderson said coming out that what was needed for the case was a motive something to show anger or sudden feeling well i dont see any signs of anger around here said mrs hale i dont she stopped it was as if her mind tripped on something her eye was caught by a dishtowel in the middle of the kitchen table slowly she moved toward the table one half of it was wiped clean the other half messy her eyes made a slow almost unwilling turn to the bucket of sugar and the half empty bag beside it things begun and not finished after a moment she stepped back and said in that manner of releasing herself wonder how theyre finding things upstairs i hope she had it a little more red up up there you knowshe paused and feeling gatheredit seems kind of sneaking locking her up in town and coming out here to get her own house to turn against her but mrs hale said the sheriffs wife the law is the law i spose tis answered mrs hale shortly she turned to the stove saying something about that fire not being much to brag of she worked with it a minute and when she straightened up she said aggressively the law is the law and a bad stove is a bad stove howd you like to cook on thispointing with the poker to the broken lining she opened the oven door and started to express her opinion of the oven but she was swept into her own thoughts thinking of what it would mean year after year to have that stove to wrestle with the thought of minnie foster trying to bake in that oven and the thought of her never going over to see minnie foster she was startled by hearing mrs peters say a person gets discouraged and loses heart the sheriffs wife had looked from the stove to the sink to the pail of water which had been carried in from outside the two women stood there silent above them the footsteps of the men who were looking for evidence against the woman who had worked in that kitchen that look of seeing into things of seeing through a thing to something else was in the eyes of the sheriffs wife now when mrs hale next spoke to her it was gently better loosen up your things mrs peters well not feel them when we go out mrs peters went to the back of the room to hang up the fur tippet she was wearing a moment later she exclaimed why she was piecing a quilt and held up a large sewing basket piled high with quilt pieces mrs hale spread some of the blocks on the table its logcabin pattern she said putting several of them together pretty isnt it they were so engaged with the quilt that they did not hear the footsteps on the stairs just as the stair door opened mrs hale was saying do you suppose she was going to quilt it or just knot it the sheriff threw up his hands they wonder whether she was going to quilt it or just knot it there was a laugh for the ways of women a warming of hands over the stove and then the county attorney said briskly well lets go right out to the barn and get that cleared up i dont see as theres anything so strange mrs hale said resentfully after the outside door had closed on the three men our taking up our time with little things while were waiting for them to get the evidence i dont see as its anything to laugh about of course theyve got awful important things on their minds said the sheriffs wife apologetically they returned to an inspection of the blocks for the quilt mrs hale was looking at the fine even sewing and preoccupied with thoughts of the woman who had done that sewing when she heard the sheriffs wife say in a queer tone why look at this one she turned to take the block held out to her the sewing said mrs peters in a troubled way all the rest of them have been so nice and even but this one why it looks as if she didnt know what she was about their eyes met something flashed to life passed between them then as if with an effort they seemed to pull away from each other a moment mrs hale sat there her hands folded over that sewing which was so unlike all the rest of the sewing then she had pulled a knot and drawn the threads oh what are you doing mrs hale asked the sheriffs wife startled just pulling out a stitch or two thats not sewed very good said mrs hale mildly i dont think we ought to touch things mrs peters said a little helplessly ill just finish up this end answered mrs hale still in that mild matteroffact fashion she threaded a needle and started to replace bad sewing with good for a little while she sewed in silence then in that thin timid voice she heard mrs hale yes mrs peters what do you suppose she was so nervous about oh i dont know said mrs hale as if dismissing a thing not important enough to spend much time on i dont know as she was nervous i sew awful queer sometimes when im just tired she cut a thread and out of the corner of her eye looked up at mrs peters the small lean face of the sheriffs wife seemed to have tightened up her eyes had that look of peering into something but the next moment she moved and said in her thin indecisive way well i must get those clothes wrapped they may be through sooner than we think i wonder where i could find a piece of paper and string in that cupboard maybe suggested mrs hale after a glance around one piece of the crazy sewing remained unripped mrs peterss back turned martha hale now scrutinized that piece compared it with the dainty accurate sewing of the other blocks the difference was startling holding this block made her feel queer as if the distracted thoughts of the woman who had perhaps turned to it to try and quiet herself were communicating themselves to her mrs peterss voice roused her heres a birdcage she said did she have a bird mrs hale why i dont know whether she did or not she turned to look at the cage mrs peters was holding up ive not been here in so long she sighed there was a man round last year selling canaries cheap but i dont know as she took one maybe she did she used to sing real pretty herself mrs peters looked around the kitchen seems kind of funny to think of a bird here she half laughed an attempt to put up a barrier but she must have had one or why would she have a cage i wonder what happened to it i suppose maybe the cat got it suggested mrs hale resuming her sewing no she didnt have a cat shes got that feeling some people have about cats being afraid of them when they brought her to our house yesterday my cat got in the room and she was real upset and asked me to take it out my sister bessie was like that laughed mrs hale the sheriffs wife did not reply the silence made mrs hale turn around mrs peters was examining the birdcage look at this door she said slowly its broke one hinge has been pulled apart mrs hale came nearer looks as if some one must have been rough with it again their eyes met startled questioning apprehensive for a moment neither spoke nor stirred then mrs hale turning away said brusquely if theyre going to find any evidence i wish theyd be about it i dont like this place but im awful glad you came with me mrs hale mrs peters put the birdcage on the table and sat down it would be lonesome for me sitting here alone yes it would wouldnt it agreed mrs hale a certain determined naturalness in her voice she picked up the sewing but now it dropped in her lap and she murmured in a different voice but i tell you what i do wish mrs peters i wish i had come over sometimes when she was here i wish i had but of course you were awful busy mrs hale your house and your children i couldve come retorted mrs hale shortly i stayed away because it werent cheerful and thats why i ought to have come ishe looked aroundive never liked this place maybe because its down in a hollow and you dont see the road i dont know what it is but its a lonesome place and always was i wish i had come over to see minnie foster sometimes i can see now she did not put it into words well you mustnt reproach yourself counseled mrs peters somehow we just dont see how it is with other folks till something comes up not having children makes less work mused mrs hale after a silence but it makes a quiet house and wright out to work all day and no company when he did come in did you know john wright mrs peters not to know him ive seen him in town they say he was a good man yes good conceded john wrights neighbor grimly he didnt drink and kept his word as well as most i guess and paid his debts but he was a hard man mrs peters just to pass the time of day with him she stopped shivered a little like a raw wind that gets to the bone her eye fell upon the cage on the table before her and she added almost bitterly i should think she wouldve wanted a bird suddenly she leaned forward looking intently at the cage but what do you spose went wrong with it i dont know returned mrs peters unless it got sick and died but after she said it she reached over and swung the broken door both women watched it as if somehow held by it you didnt know her mrs hale asked a gentler note in her voice not till they brought her yesterday said the sheriffs wife she come to think of it she was kind of like a bird herself real sweet and pretty but kind of timid and fluttery how she did change that held her for a long time finally as if struck with a happy thought and relieved to get back to everyday things she exclaimed tell you what mrs peters why dont you take the quilt in with you it might take up her mind why i think thats a real nice idea mrs hale agreed the sheriffs wife as if she too were glad to come into the atmosphere of a simple kindness there couldnt possibly be any objection to that could there now just what will i take i wonder if her patches are in here and her things they turned to the sewing basket heres some red said mrs hale bringing out a roll of cloth underneath that was a box here maybe her scissors are in here and her things she held it up what a pretty box ill warrant that was something she had a long time ago when she was a girl she held it in her hand a moment then with a little sigh opened it instantly her hand went to her nose why mrs peters drew nearer then turned away theres something wrapped up in this piece of silk faltered mrs hale this isnt her scissors said mrs peters in a shrinking voice her hand not steady mrs hale raised the piece of silk oh mrs peters she cried its mrs peters bent closer its the bird she whispered but mrs peters cried mrs hale look at it its neck look at its neck its all other side to she held the box away from her the sheriffs wife again bent closer somebody wrung its neck said she in a voice that was slow and deep and then again the eyes of the two women met this time clung together in a look of dawning comprehension of growing horror mrs peters looked from the dead bird to the broken door of the cage again their eyes met and just then there was a sound at the outside door mrs hale slipped the box under the quilt pieces in the basket and sank into the chair before it mrs peters stood holding to the table the county attorney and the sheriff came in from outside well ladies said the county attorney as one turning from serious things to little pleasantries have you decided whether she was going to quilt it or knot it we think began the sheriffs wife in a flurried voice that she was going to knot it he was too preoccupied to notice the change that came in her voice on that last well thats very interesting im sure he said tolerantly he caught sight of the birdcage has the bird flown we think the cat got it said mrs hale in a voice curiously even he was walking up and down as if thinking something out is there a cat he asked absently mrs hale shot a look up at the sheriffs wife well not now said mrs peters theyre superstitious you know they leave she sank into her chair the county attorney did not heed her no sign at all of any one having come in from the outside he said to peters in the manner of continuing an interrupted conversation their own rope now lets go upstairs again and go over it piece by piece it would have to have been some one who knew just the the stair door closed behind them and their voices were lost the two women sat motionless not looking at each other but as if peering into something and at the same time holding back when they spoke now it was as if they were afraid of what they were saying but as if they could not help saying it she liked the bird said martha hale low and slowly she was going to bury it in that pretty box when i was a girl said mrs peters under her breath my kitten there was a boy took a hatchet and before my eyes before i could get there she covered her face an instant if they hadnt held me back i would haveshe caught herself looked upstairs where footsteps were heard and finished weaklyhurt him then they sat without speaking or moving i wonder how it would seem mrs hale at last began as if feeling her way over strange groundnever to have had any children around her eyes made a slow sweep of the kitchen as if seeing what that kitchen had meant through all the years no wright wouldnt like the bird she said after thata thing that sang she used to sing he killed that too her voice tightened mrs peters moved uneasily of course we dont know who killed the bird i knew john wright was mrs hales answer it was an awful thing was done in this house that night mrs hale said the sheriffs wife killing a man while he slept slipping a thing round his neck that choked the life out of him mrs hales hand went out to the birdcage his neck choked the life out of him we dont know who killed him whispered mrs peters wildly we dont know mrs hale had not moved if there had been years and years of nothing then a bird to sing to you it would be awful still after the bird was still it was as if something within her not herself had spoken and it found in mrs peters something she did not know as herself i know what stillness is she said in a queer monotonous voice when we homesteaded in dakota and my first baby died after he was two years old and me with no other then mrs hale stirred how soon do you suppose theyll be through looking for evidence i know what stillness is repeated mrs peters in just that same way then she too pulled back the law has got to punish crime mrs hale she said in her tight little way i wish youd seen minnie foster was the answer when she wore a white dress with blue ribbons and stood up there in the choir and sang the picture of that girl the fact that she had lived neighbor to that girl for twenty years and had let her die for lack of life was suddenly more than she could bear oh i wish id come over here once in a while she cried that was a crime that was a crime whos going to punish that we mustnt take on said mrs peters with a frightened look toward the stairs i might a known she needed help i tell you its queer mrs peters we live close together and we live far apart we all go through the same things its all just a different kind of the same thing if it werent why do you and i understand why do we knowwhat we know this minute she dashed her hand across her eyes then seeing the jar of fruit on the table she reached for it and choked out if i was you i wouldnt tell her her fruit was gone tell her it aint tell her its all right all of it here take this in to prove it to her she she may never know whether it was broke or not she turned away mrs peters reached out for the bottle of fruit as if she were glad to take it as if touching a familiar thing having something to do could keep her from something else she got up looked about for something to wrap the fruit in took a petticoat from the pile of clothes she had brought from the front room and nervously started winding that round the bottle my she began in a high false voice its a good thing the men couldnt hear us getting all stirred up over a little thing like a dead canary she hurried over that as if that could have anything to do with with my wouldnt they laugh footsteps were heard on the stairs maybe they would muttered mrs halemaybe they wouldnt no peters said the county attorney incisively its all perfectly clear except the reason for doing it but you know juries when it comes to women if there was some definite thing something to show something to make a story about a thing that would connect up with this clumsy way of doing it in a covert way mrs hale looked at mrs peters mrs peters was looking at her quickly they looked away from each other the outer door opened and mr hale came in ive got the team round now he said pretty cold out there im going to stay here awhile by myself the county attorney suddenly announced you can send frank out for me cant you he asked the sheriff i want to go over everything im not satisfied we cant do better again for one brief moment the two womens eyes found one another the sheriff came up to the table did you want to see what mrs peters was going to take in the county attorney picked up the apron he laughed oh i guess theyre not very dangerous things the ladies have picked out mrs hales hand was on the sewing basket in which the box was concealed she felt that she ought to take her hand off the basket she did not seem able to he picked up one of the quilt blocks which she had piled on to cover the box her eyes felt like fire she had a feeling that if he took up the basket she would snatch it from him but he did not take it up with another little laugh he turned away saying no mrs peters doesnt need supervising for that matter a sheriffs wife is married to the law ever think of it that way mrs peters mrs peters was standing beside the table mrs hale shot a look up at her but she could not see her face mrs peters had turned away when she spoke her voice was muffled not just that way she said married to the law chuckled mrs peterss husband he moved toward the door into the front room and said to the county attorney i just want you to come in here a minute george we ought to take a look at these windows oh windows said the county attorney scoffingly well be right out mr hale said the sheriff to the farmer who was still waiting by the door hale went to look after the horses the sheriff followed the county attorney into the other room again for one moment the two women were alone in that kitchen martha hale sprang up her hands tight together looking at that other woman with whom it rested at first she could not see her eyes for the sheriffs wife had not turned back since she turned away at that suggestion of being married to the law but now mrs hale made her turn back her eyes made her turn back slowly unwillingly mrs peters turned her head until her eyes met the eyes of the other woman there was a moment when they held each other in a steady burning look in which there was no evasion nor flinching then martha hales eyes pointed the way to the basket in which was hidden the thing that would make certain the conviction of the other woman that woman who was not there and yet who had been there with them all through the hour for a moment mrs peters did not move and then she did it with a rush forward she threw back the quilt pieces got the box tried to put in in her handbag it was too big desperately she opened it started to take the bird out but there she broke she could not touch the bird she stood helpless foolish there was a sound of a knob turning in the inner door martha hale snatched the box from the sheriffs wife and got it in the pocket of her big coat just as the sheriff and the county attorney came back into the kitchen well henry said the county attorney facetiously at least we found out that she was not going to quilt it she was going to what is it you call it ladies mrs hales hand was against the pocket of her coat we call it knot it mr henderson the man who knew how dorothy l sayers dorothy leigh sayers is one of the most remarkable and influential figures in crime fiction history born in oxford and a graduate of somerville college oxford she was a language teacher publishers reader and advertising copywriter before becoming a fulltime writer in whose body she introduced one of the most famous gentleman detectives in literature lord peter wimsey a somewhat wodehousian character affected in speech and manner with pronounced silly ass tendencies who would become a much deeper and more fully developed figure as his career went on in strong poison wimsey met novelist harriet vane whom he would save from a charge of murder then in reckless disregard of the rules against romance in golden age detective novels woo through several novels including the academic classic gaudy night and finally wed in busmans honeymoon the final detective novel completed by sayers the fragmentary thrones dominations would be completed with remarkable fidelity many years later by jill paton walsh and published under their joint byline in sayers who became a feminist icon in the s in part because of the independence she personified in her own life and in part because of her creation of harriet vane has been the subject of more biographical works and critical analyses than any golden age of detection figure save agatha christie and certainly few equaled her in her devotion to the gamesplaying elements of the detective story however she left detective fiction in the latter part of her life in favor of other literary pursuits including some highly regarded religious plays and a translation of dante though dorothy l sayers wrote a number of short stories about lord peter wimsey her best shorter works tend to be those without a series detective in the man who knew how sayers is able to comment wittily on her detective fiction speciality while developing a situation that could as easily have taken the title of another of her best short stories suspicion the man who knew how is the sort of crime story ideally suited to radio adaptation as it was in a memorable suspense broadcast starring charles laughton as pender with hans conreid in the title role for the twentieth time since the train had left carlisle pender glanced up from murder at the manse and caught the eye of the man opposite he frowned a little it was irritating to be watched so closely and always with that faint sardonic smile it was still more irritating to allow oneself to be so much disturbed by the smile and the scrutiny pender wrenched himself back to his book with a determination to concentrate upon the problem of the minister murdered in the library but the story was of the academic kind that crowds all its exciting incidents into the first chapter and proceeds thereafter by a long series of deductions to a scientific solution in the last twice pender had to turn back to verify points that he had missed in reading then he became aware that he was not thinking about the murdered minister at all he was becoming more and more actively conscious of the other mans face a queer face pender thought there was nothing especially remarkable about the features in themselves it was their expression that daunted pender it was a secret face the face of one who knew a great deal to other peoples disadvantage the mouth was a little crooked and tightly tucked in at the corners as though savoring a hidden amusement the eyes behind a pair of rimless pincenez glittered curiously but that was possibly due to the light reflected in the glasses pender wondered what the mans profession might be he was dressed in a dark lounge suit a raincoat and a shabby soft hat his age was perhaps about forty pender coughed unneccessarily and settled back into his corner raising the detective story high before his face barrierfashion this was worse than useless he gained the impression that the man saw through the maneuver and was secretly entertained by it he wanted to fidget but felt obscurely that his doing so would in some way constitute a victory for the other man in his selfconsciousness he held himself so rigid that attention to his book became a sheer physical impossibility there was no stop now before rugby and it was unlikely that any passenger would enter from the corridor to break up this disagreeable solitude √† deux pender could of course go out into the corridor and not return but that would be an acknowledgment of defeat pender lowered murder at the manse and caught the mans eye again getting tired of it asked the man night journeys are always a bit tedious replied pender half relieved and half reluctant would you like a book he took the paperclip clue from his briefcase and held it out hopefully the other man glanced at the title and shook his head thanks very much he said but i never read detective stories theyre so inadequate dont you think so they are rather lacking in characterization and human interest certainly said pender but on a railway journey i dont mean that said the other man i am not concerned with humanity but all these murderers are so incompetent they bore me oh i dont know replied pender at any rate they are usually a good deal more imaginative and ingenious than murderers in real life than the murderers who are found out in real life yes admitted the other man even some of those did pretty well before they got pinched objected pender crippen for instance he need never have been caught if he hadnt lost his head and run off to america george joseph smith did away with at least two brides quite successfully before fate and the news of the world intervened yes said the other man but look at the clumsiness of it all the elaboration the lies the paraphernalia absolutely unnecessary oh come said pender you cant expect committing a murder and getting away with it to be as simple as shelling peas ah said the other man you think that do you pender waited for him to elaborate this remark but nothing came of it the man leaned back and smiled in his secret way at the roof of the carriage he appeared to think the conversation not worth going on with pender found himself noticing his companions hands they were white and surprisingly long in the fingers he watched them gently tapping upon their owners knee then resolutely turned a page then put the book down once more and said well if its so easy how would you set about committing a murder i repeated the man the light on his glasses made his eyes quite blank to pender but his voice sounded gently amused thats different i should not have to think twice about it why not because i happen to know how to do it do you indeed muttered pender rebelliously oh yes theres nothing to it how can you be sure you havent tried i suppose it isnt a case of trying said the man theres nothing uncertain about my method thats just the beauty of it its easy to say that retorted pender but what is this wonderful method you cant expect me to tell you that can you said the other man bringing his eyes back to rest on penders it might not be safe you look harmless enough but who could look more harmless than crippen nobody is fit to be trusted with absolute control over other peoples lives bosh exclaimed pender i shouldnt think of murdering anybody oh yes you would said the other man if you really believed it was safe so would anybody why are all these tremendous artificial barriers built up around murder by the church and the law just because its everybodys crime and just as natural as breathing but thats ridiculous cried pender warmly you think so do you thats what most people would say but i wouldnt trust em not with sulphate of thanatol to be bought for two pence at any chemists sulphate of what asked pender sharply ah you think im giving something away well its a mixture of that and one or two other things all equally ordinary and cheap for nine pence you could make up enough to poison the entire cabinet though of course one wouldnt polish off the whole lot at once it might look funny if they all died simultaneously in their baths why in their baths thats the way it would take them its the action of the hot water that brings on the effect of the stuff you see any time from a few hours to a few days after administration its quite a simple chemical reaction and it couldnt possibly be detected by analysis it would just look like heart failure pender eyed him uneasily he did not like the smile it was not only derisive it was smug it was almost gloating triumphant he could not quite put the right name to it you know pursued the man pulling a pipe from his pocket and beginning to fill it it is very odd how often one seems to read of people being found dead in their baths it must be a very common accident quite temptingly so after all there is a fascination about murder the thing grows upon one that is i imagine it would you know very likely said pender im sure of it no i wouldnt trust anybody with that formula not even a virtuous young man like yourself the long white fingers tamped the tobacco firmly into the bowl and struck a match but how about you said pender irritated nobody cares to be called a virtuous young man if nobody is fit to be trusted im not eh replied the man well thats true but it cant be helped now can it i know the thing and i cant unknow it again its unfortunate but there it is at any rate you have the comfort of knowing that nothing disagreeable is likely to happen to me dear me rugby already i get out here i have a little bit of business to do at rugby he rose and shook himself buttoned his raincoat about him and pulled the shabby hat more firmly down about his enigmatic glasses the train slowed down and stopped with a brief good night and a crooked smile the man stepped onto the platform pender watched him stride quickly away into the drizzle beyond the radius of the gas light dotty or something said pender oddly relieved thank goodness i seem to be going to have the compartment to myself he returned to murder at the manse but his attention still kept wandering from the book he held in his hand what was the name of that stuff the fellow talked about sulphate of what for the life of him he could not remember it was on the following afternoon that pender saw the news item he had bought the standard to read at lunch and the word bath caught his eye otherwise he would probably have missed the paragraph altogether for it was only a short one wealthy manufacturer dies in bath wifes tragic discovery a distressing discovery was made early this morning by mrs john brittlesea wife of the wellknown head of brittleseas engineering works at rugby finding that her husband whom she had seen alive and well less than an hour previously did not come down in time for his breakfast she searched for him in the bathroom where the engineer was found lying dead in his bath life having been extinct according to the medical men for half an hour the cause of the death is pronounced to be heart failure the deceased manufacturer thats an odd coincidence said pender at rugby i should think my unknown friend would be interested if he is still there doing his bit of business i wonder what his business is by the way it is a very curious thing how when once your attention is attracted to any particular set of circumstances that set of circumstances seems to haunt you you get appendicitis immediately the newspapers are filled with paragraphs about statesmen suffering from appendicitis and victims dying of it you learn that all your acquaintances have had it or know friends who have had it and either died of it or recovered from it with more surprising and spectacular rapidity than yourself you cannot open a popular magazine without seeing its cure mentioned as one of the triumphs of modern surgery or dip into a scientific treatise without coming across a comparison of the vermiform appendix in men and monkeys probably these references to appendicitis are equally frequent at all times but you only notice them when your mind is attuned to the subject at any rate it was in this way that pender accounted to himself for the extraordinary frequency with which people seemed to die in their baths at this period the thing pursued him at every turn always the same sequence of events the hot bath the discovery of the corpse the inquest always the same medical opinion heart failure following immersion in too hot water it began to seem to pender that it was scarcely safe to enter a hot bath at all he took to making his own bath cooler and cooler each day until it almost ceased to be enjoyable he skimmed his paper each morning for headlines about baths before settling down to read the news and was at once relieved and vaguely disappointed if a week passed without a hotbath tragedy one of the sudden deaths that occurred in this way was that of a young and beautiful woman whose husband an analytical chemist had tried without success to divorce her a few months previously the coroner displayed a tendency to suspect foul play and put the husband through a severe crossexamination there seemed however to be no getting behind the doctors evidence pender brooding over the improbable possible wished as he did every day of the week that he could remember the name of that drug the man in the train had mentioned then came the excitement in penders own neighborhood an old mr skimmings who lived alone with a housekeeper in a street just around the corner was found dead in his bathroom his heart had never been strong the housekeeper told the milkman that she had always expected something of the sort to happen for the old gentleman would always take his bath so hot pender went to the inquest the housekeeper gave her evidence mr skimmings had been the kindest of employers and she was heartbroken at losing him no she had not been aware that mr skimmings had left her a large sum of money but it was just like his goodness of heart the verdict of course was accidental death pender that evening went out for his usual stroll with the dog some feeling of curiosity moved him to go around past the late mr skimmingss house as he loitered by glancing up at the blank windows the garden gate opened and a man came out in the light of a street lamp pender recognized him at once hullo he said oh its you is it said the man viewing the site of the tragedy eh what do you think about it all oh nothing very much said pender i didnt know him odd our meeting again like this yes isnt it you live near here i suppose yes said pender and then wished he hadnt do you live in these parts too me said the man oh no i was only here on a little matter of business last time we met said pender you had business at rugby they had fallen into step together and were walking slowly down to the turning pender had to take in order to reach his house so i had agreed the other man my business takes me all over the country i never know where i may be wanted next you see it was while you were at rugby that old brittlesea was found dead in his bath wasnt it remarked pender carelessly yes funny thing coincidence the man glanced up at him sideways through his glittering glasses left all his money to his wife didnt he shes a rich woman now goodlooking girl a lot younger than he was they were passing penders gate come in and have a drink said pender and again immediately regretted the impulse the man accepted and they went into penders bachelor study remarkable lot of these bath deaths lately observed pender as he squirted soda into the tumblers you think its remarkable said the man with his irritating trick of querying everything that was said to him well i dont know perhaps it is but its always a fairly common accident i suppose ive been taking more notice on account of that conversation we had in the train pender laughed a little selfconsciously it just makes me wonder you know how one does whether anybody else had happened to hit on that drug you mentioned what was its name the man ignored the question oh i shouldnt think so he said i fancy im the only person who knows about that i only stumbled on the thing by accident myself when i was looking for something else i dont imagine it could have been discovered simultaneously in so many parts of the country but all these verdicts just show dont they what a safe way it would be of getting rid of a person youre a chemist then asked pender catching at the one phrase which seemed to promise information oh im a bit of everything sort of general utility man i do a good bit of studying on my own too youve got one or two interesting books here i see pender was flattered for a man in his position he had been in a bank until he came into that little bit of money he felt that he had improved his mind to some purpose and he knew that his collection of modern first editions would be worth money some day he went over to the glassfronted bookcase and pulled out a volume or two to show his visitor the man displayed intelligence and presently joined him in front of the shelves these i take it represent your personal tastes he took down a volume of henry james and glanced at the flyleaf that your name e pender pender admitted that it was you have the advantage of me he added oh i am one of the great smith clan said the other with a laugh and work for my bread you seem to be very nicely fixed here pender explained about the clerkship and the legacy very nice isnt it said smith not married no youre one of the lucky ones not likely to be needing any sulphate ofany useful drugs in the near future and you never will if you stick to what youve got and keep off women and speculation he smiled up sideways at pender now that his hat was off pender saw that he had a quantity of closely curled gray hair which made him look older than he had appeared in the railway carriage no i shant be coming to you for assistance yet a while said pender laughing besides how should i find you if i wanted you you wouldnt have to said smith i should find you theres never any difficulty about that he grinned oddly well id better be getting on thank you for your hospitality i dont expect we shall meet again but we may of course things work out so queerly dont they when he had gone pender returned to his own armchair he took up his glass of whiskey which stood there nearly full funny he said to himself i dont remember pouring that out i suppose i got interested and did it mechanically he emptied his glass slowly thinking about smith what in the world was smith doing at skimmingss house an odd business altogether if skimmingss housekeeper had known about that moneybut she had not known and if she had how could she have found out about smith and his sulphate ofthe word had been on the tip of his tongue then you would not need to find me i should find you what had the man meant by that but this was ridiculous smith was not the devil presumably but if he really had this secret if he liked to put a price upon it nonsense business at rugby a little bit of business at skimmingss house oh absurd nobody is fit to be trusted absolute power over another mans lifeit grows on you that is i imagine it would lunacy and if there was anything in it the man was mad to tell pender about it if pender chose to speak he could get the fellow hanged the very existence of pender would be dangerous that whiskey more and more thinking it over pender became persuaded that he had never poured it out smith must have done it while his back was turned why that sudden display of interest in the bookshelves it had had no connection with anything that had gone before now pender came to think of it it had been a very stiff whiskey was it imagination or had there been something about the flavor of it a cold sweat broke out on penders forehead a quarter of an hour later after a powerful dose of mustard and water pender was downstairs again very cold and shivering huddling over the fire he had had a narrow escape if he had escaped he did not know how the stuff worked but he would not take a hot bath again for some days one never knew whether the mustard and water had done the trick in time or whether the hot bath was an essential part of the treatment at any rate penders life was saved for the time being but he was still uneasy he kept the front door on the chain and warned his servant to let no strangers into the house he ordered two more morning papers and the news of the world on sundays and kept a careful watch upon their columns deaths in baths became an obsession with him he neglected his first editions and took to attending inquests three weeks later he found himself at lincoln a man had died of heart failure in a turkish bath a fat man of sedentary habits the jury added a rider to their verdict of accidental death to the effect that the management should exercise a stricter supervision over the bathers and should never permit them to be left unattended in the hot room as pender emerged from the hall he saw ahead of him a shabby hat that seemed familiar he plunged after it and caught mr smith about to step into a taxi smith he cried gasping a little he clutched him fiercely by the shoulder what you again said smith taking notes of the case eh can i do anything for you you devil said pender youre mixed up in this you tried to kill me the other day did i why should i do that youll swing for this shouted pender menacingly a policeman pushed his way through the gathering crowd here said he whats all this about smith touched his forehead significantly its all right officer said he the gentleman seems to think im here for no good heres my card the coroner knows me but he attacked me youd better keep an eye on him thats right said a bystander this man tried to kill me said pender the policeman nodded dont you worry about that sir he said you think better of it the eat in there has upset you a bit all right all right but i want to charge him said pender i wouldnt do that if i was you said the policeman i tell you said pender that this man smith has been trying to poison me hes a murderer hes poisoned scores of people the policeman winked at smith best be off sir he said ill settle this now my ladhe held pender firmly by the armsjust you keep cool and take it quiet that gentlemans name aint smith nor nothing like it youve got a bit mixed up like well what is his name demanded pender never mind replied the constable you leave him alone or youll be getting yourself into trouble the taxi had driven away pender glanced around at the circle of amused faces and gave in all right officer he said i wont give you any trouble ill come round with you to the police station and tell you about it what do you think o that one asked the inspector of the sergeant when pender had stumbled out of the station up the pole an alfway round the flag if you ask me replied his subordinate got one o them ideez fix what they talk about hm replied the inspector well weve got his name and address better make a note of em he might turn up again poisoning people so as they die in their baths eh thats a pretty good un wonderful how these barmy ones thinks it all out isnt it the spring that year was a bad one cold and foggy it was march when pender went down to an inquest at deptford but a thick blanket of mist was hanging over the river as though it were november the cold ate into your bones as he sat in the dingy little court peering through the yellow twilight of gas and fog he could scarcely see the witnesses as they came to the table everybody in the place seemed to be coughing pender was coughing too his bones ached and he felt as though he were about due for a bout of influenza straining his eyes he thought he recognized a face on the other side of the room but the smarting fog which penetrated every crack stung and blinded him he felt in his overcoat pocket and his hand closed comfortably on something thick and heavy ever since that day in lincoln he had gone about armed for protection not a revolver he was no hand with firearms a sandbag was much better he had bought one from an old man wheeling a pushcart it was meant for keeping out draughts from the door a good oldfashioned affair the inevitable verdict was returned the spectators began to push their way out pender had to hurry now not to lose sight of his man he elbowed his way along muttering apologies at the door he almost touched the man but a stout woman intervened he plunged past her and she gave a little squeak of indignation the man in front turned his head and the light over the door glinted on his glasses pender pulled his hat over his eyes and followed his shoes had cr√™pe rubber soles and made no sound on the pavement the man went on jogging quietly up one street and down another and never looking back the fog was so thick that pender was forced to keep within a few yards of him where was he going into the lighted streets home by bus or tram no he turned off to the left down a narrow street the fog was thicker here pender could no longer see his quarry but he heard the footsteps going on before him at the same even pace it seemed to him that they were two alone in the world pursued and pursuer slayer and avenger the street began to slope more rapidly they must be coming out somewhere near the river suddenly the dim shapes of the houses fell away on either side there was an open space with a lamp vaguely visible in the middle the footsteps paused pender silently hurrying after saw the man standing close beneath the lamp apparently consulting something in a notebook four steps and pender was upon him he drew the sandbag from his pocket the man looked up ive got you this time said pender and struck with all his force pender was quite right he did get influenza it was a week before he was out and about again the weather had changed and the air was fresh and sweet in spite of the weakness left by the malady he felt as though a heavy weight had been lifted from his shoulders he tottered down to a favorite bookshop of his in the strand and picked up a d h lawrence first at a price which he knew to be a bargain encouraged by this he turned into a small chophouse chiefly frequented by newspaper men and ordered a grilled cutlet and a halftankard of bitter two journalists were seated by the next table going to poor old buckleys funeral asked one yes said the other poor devil fancy his getting bashed on the head like that he must have been on his way down to interview the widow of that fellow who died in a bath its a rough district probably one of jimmy the cards crowd had it in for him he was a great crimereporter they wont get another like bill buckley in a hurry he was a decent sort too great old sport no end of a practical joker remember his great stunt sulphate of thanatol pender started that was the word that had eluded him for so many months a curious dizziness came over him looking at you as sober as a judge the journalist was saying no such stuff of course but he used to work off that wheeze on poor boobs in railway carriages to see how theyd take it would you believe that one chap actually offered him hullo interrupted his friend that bloke over there has fainted i thought he was looking a bit white i can find my way out ngaio marsh ngaio pronounced nyo marsh was born and lived most of her life in new zealand though she followed the antiregional custom of the time in setting the majority of her detective novels in england which she first visited in through most of her more lucrative career as a novelist she had a parallel existence in her first love the theater as actress producer director designer educator and playwright for thirty years beginning in she spent part of each year directing and touring plays with the student drama society of canterbury university college in christchurch new zealand following theatrical tradition marshs official birth date for many years shaved four years off her actual age marshs first novel a man lay dead had a stage background as did several of its successors including her final book light thickens in a more subtle expression of her theatrical enthusiasm most of her murders take place in the course of some sort of performance ironically according to biographer margaret lewis writing in st james guide to crime mystery writers fourth edition marsh was unable to duplicate the success of agatha christie in adapting her novels to the stage because she lost her sense of theatre and sought to preserve the general shape of the novels with all the interviews questions and answers marsh was unusual at a time of gentleman amateur detectives in giving center stage to a policeman but to be truthful roderick alleyn of scotland yard had more in common in personal and professional style with dorothy l sayerss lord peter wimsey and margery allinghams albert campion than he did with a real law officer alleyn also had in common with wimsey and campion eventual marriage in his case to agatha troy a character who resembled marsh herself and enjoyed the career of a successful painter marsh had envisioned for herself early in her life marsh had a remarkably consistent career as a writer of detective fiction the puzzle was at the center of her work from the beginning and she was a master of reader deception if her writing and characterization became richer the essential pattern of crime investigation and solution never changed remarkably her last novels published when she was in her mideighties showed no perceptible decline in quality from their predecessors in fact were among her best works a statement that unfortunately cant be made of such longrunning writers as agatha christie and erle stanley gardner one of the authors rare short stories i can find my way out is a roderick alleyn novel in miniature appropriately featuring marshs patented backstage setting at halfpast six on the night in question anthony gill unable to eat keep still think speak or act coherently walked from his rooms to the jupiter theatre he knew that there would be nobody backstage that there was nothing for him to do in the theater that he ought to stay quietly in his rooms and presently dress dine and arrive at say a quarter to eight but it was as if something shoved him into his clothes thrust him into the street and compelled him to hurry through the west end to the jupiter his mind was overlaid with a thin film of inertia odd lines from the play occurred to him but without any particular significance he found himself busily reiterating a completely irrelevant sentence she has a way of laughing that would make a mans heart turn over piccadilly shaftesbury avenue here i go he thought turning into hawke street towards my play its one hour and twentynine minutes away a step a second its rushing towards me tonys first play poor young tony gill never mind try again the jupiter neon lights i can find my way out by anthony gill and in the entrance the bills and photographs coralie bourne with h j bannington barry george and canning cumberland canning cumberland the film across his mind split and there was the thing itself and he would have to think about it how bad would canning cumberland be if he came down drunk brilliantly bad they said he would bring out all the tricks clever actor stuff scoring off everybody making a fool of the dramatic balance in mr canning cumberlands hands indifferent dialogue and unconvincing situations seemed almost real what can you do with a drunken actor he stood in the entrance feeling his heart pound and his insides deflate and sicken because of course it was a bad play he was at this moment and for the first time really convinced of it it was terrible only one virtue in it and that was not his doing it had been suggested to him by coralie bourne i dont think the play you have sent me will do as it is but it has occurred to me it was a brilliant idea he had rewritten the play round it and almost immediately and quite innocently he had begun to think of it as his own although he had said shyly to coralie bourne you should appear as joint author she had quickly over emphatically refused it was nothing at all she said if youre to become a dramatist you will learn to get ideas from everywhere a single situation is nothing think of shakespeare she added lightly entire plots dont be silly she had said later and still with the same hurried nervous air dont go talking to everyone about it they will think there is more instead of less than meets the eye in my small suggestion please promise he promised thinking hed made an error in taste when he suggested that coralie bourne so famous an actress should appear as joint author with an unknown youth and how right she was he thought because of course its going to be a ghastly flop shell be sorry she consented to play in it standing in front of the theater he contemplated nightmare possibilities what did audiences do when a first play flopped did they clap a little enough to let the curtain rise and quickly fall again on a discomforted group of players how scanty must the applause be for them to let him off his own appearance and they were to go on to the chelsea arts ball a hideous prospect thinking he would give anything in the world if he could stop his play he turned into the foyer there were lights in the offices and he paused irresolute before a board of photographs among them much smaller than the leading players was dendra gay with the eyes looking straight into his she had a way of laughing that would make a mans heart turn over well he thought so im in love with her he turned away from the photograph a man came out of the office mr gill telegrams for you anthony took them and as he went out he heard the man call after him very good luck for tonight sir there were queues of people waiting in the side street for the early doors at six thirty coralie bourne dialed canning cumberlands number and waited she heard his voice its me she said o god darling ive been thinking about you he spoke rapidly too loudly coral ive been thinking about ben you oughtnt to have given that situation to the boy weve been over it a dozen times cann why not give it to tony ben will never know she waited and then said nervously bens gone cann well never see him again ive got a thing about it after all hes your husband no cann no suppose he turns up itd be like him to turn up he wont turn up she heard him laugh im sick of all this she thought suddenly ive had it once too often i cant stand any morecann she said into the telephone but he had hung up at twenty to seven barry george looked at himself in his bathroom mirror ive got a better appearance he thought than cann cumberland my heads a good shape my eyes are bigger and my jawlines cleaner i never let a show down i dont drink im a better actor he turned his head a little slewing his eyes to watch the effect in the big scene he thought im the star hes the feed thats the way its been produced and thats what the author wants i ought to get the notices past notices came up in his memory he saw the print the size of the paragraphs a long paragraph about canning cumberland a line tacked on the end of it is it unkind to add that mr barry george trotted in the wake of mr cumberlands virtuosity with an air of breathless dependability and again it is a little hard on mr barry george that he should be obliged to act as foil to this brilliant performance worst of all mr barry george succeeded in looking tolerably unlike a stooge an achievement that evidently exhausted his resources monstrous he said loudly to his own image watching the fine glow of indignation in the eyes alcohol he told himself did two things to cann cumberland he raised his finger nice expressive hand an actors hand alcohol destroyed cumberlands artistic integrity it also invested him with devilish cunning drunk he would burst the seams of a play destroy its balance ruin its form and himself emerge blazing with a showmanship that the audience mistook for genius while i he said aloud merely pay my author the compliment of faithful interpretation psha he returned to his bedroom completed his dressing and pulled his hat to the right angle once more he thrust his face close to the mirror and looked searchingly at its image by god he told himself hes done it once too often old boy tonight well even the score wont we by god we will partly satisfied and partly ashamed for the scene after all had smacked a little of ham he took his stick in one hand and a case holding his costume for the arts ball in the other and went down to the theatre at ten minutes to seven h j bannington passed through the gallery queue on his way to the stage door alley raising his hat and saying thanks so much to the gratified ladies who let him through he heard them murmur his name he walked briskly along the alley greeted the stagedoorkeeper passed under a dingy lamp through an entry and so to the stage only working lights were up the walls of an interior set rose dimly into shadow bob reynolds the stage manager came out through the promptentrance hello old boy he said ive changed the dressing rooms youre third on the right theyve moved your things in suit you better at least than a black hole the size of a wc but without its appointments hj said acidly i suppose the great mr cumberland still has the starroom well yes old boy and who pray is next to him in the room with the other gas fire weve put barry george there old boy you know what hes like only too well old boy and the public i fear is beginning to find out hj turned into the dressingroom passage the stage manager returned to the set where he encountered his assistant whats biting him asked the assistant he wanted a dressing room with a fire only natural said the asm nastily he started life reading gas meters on the right and left of the passage nearest the stage end were two doors each with its star in tarnished paint the door on the left was open hj looked in and was greeted with the smell of greasepaint powder wetwhite and flowers a gas fire droned comfortably coralie bournes dresser was spreading out towels good evening katie my jewel said hj la belle not down yet were on our way she said hj hummed stylishly bella filia del amore and returned to the passage the starroom on the right was closed but he could hear cumberlands dresser moving about inside he went on to the next door paused read the card mr barry george warbled a high derisive note turned in at the third door and switched on the light definitely not a second leads room no fire a wash basin however and opposite mirrors a stack of telegrams had been placed on the dressing table still singing he reached for them disclosing a number of bills that had been tactfully laid underneath and a letter addressed in a flamboyant script his voice might have been mechanically produced and arbitrarily switched off so abruptly did his song end in the middle of a roulade he let the telegrams fall on the table took up the letter and tore it open his face wretchedly pale was reflected and endlessly rereflected in the mirrors at nine oclock the telephone rang roderick alleyn answered it this is sloane no youre on the wrong number no he hung up and returned to his wife and guest thats the fifth time in two hours do lets ask for a new number we might get next door to something worse the telephone rang again this is not alleyn warned it no i cannot take three large trunks to victoria station no i am not the instant all night delivery no theyre mrs alleyn explained to lord michael lamprey i suppose its just faulty dialing but you cant imagine how angry everyone gets why do you want to be a policeman its a dull hard job you know alleyn began oh lord mike said stretching his legs and looking critically at his shoes i dont for a moment imagine ill leap immediately into false whiskers and plainclothes no no but im revoltingly healthy sir strong as a horse and i dont think im as stupid as you might feel inclined to imagine the telephone rang i say do let me answer it mike suggested and did so hullo he said winningly he listened smiling at his hostess im afraid he began here wait a bit yes but his expression became blank and complacent may i he said presently repeat your order sir cant be too sure can we call at harrow gardens sloane square for one suitcase to be delivered immediately at the jupiter theatre to mr anthony gill very good sir thank you sir collect quite he replaced the receiver and beamed at the alleyns what the devil have you been up to alleyn said he just simply wouldnt listen to reason i tried to tell him but it may be urgent mrs alleyn ejaculated it couldnt be more urgent really its a suitcase for tony gill at the jupiter well then i was at eton with the chap said mike reminiscently hes four years older than i am so of course he was madly important while i was less than the dust thisll larn him i think youd better put that order through at once said alleyn firmly i rather thought of executing it myself do you know sir itd be a frightfully neat way of gatecrashing the show wouldnt it i did try to get a ticket but the house was sold out if youre going to deliver this case youd better get a bend on its clearly an occasion for dressing up though isnt it i say said mike modestly would you think it most frightful cheek if i well id promise to come back and return everything i mean are you suggesting that my clothes look more like a vanmans than yours i thought youd have things for heavens sake rory said mrs alleyn dress him up and let him go the great thing is to get that wretched mans suitcase to him i know said mike earnestly its most frightfully sweet of you thats how i feel about it alleyn took him away and shoved him into an old and begrimed raincoat a cloth cap and a muffler you wouldnt deceive a village idiot in a total eclipse he said but out you go he watched mike drive away and returned to his wife whatll happen she asked knowing mike i should say he will end up in the front stalls and go on to supper with the leading lady she by the way is coralie bourne very lovely and twenty years his senior so hell probably fall in love with her alleyn reached for his tobacco jar and paused i wonder whats happened to her husband he said who was he an extraordinary chap benjamin vlasnoff violent temper looked like a bandit wrote two very good plays and got run in three times for common assault she tried to divorce him but it didnt go through i think he afterwards lit off to russia alleyn yawned i believe she had a hell of a time with him he said all night delivery said mike in a hoarse voice touching his cap suitcase one here you are said the woman who had answered the door carry it carefully now its not locked and the catch springs out thanks said mike much obliged chilly aint it he took the suitcase out to the car it was a fresh spring night sloane square was threaded with mist and all the lamps had halos round them it was the kind of night when individual sounds separate themselves from the conglomerate voice of london hollow sirens spoke imperatively down on the river and a bugle rang out over in chelsea barracks a night mike thought for adventure he opened the rear door of the car and heaved the case in the catch flew open the lid dropped back and the contents fell out damn said mike and switched on the inside light lying on the floor of the car was a false beard it was flaming red and bushy and was mounted on a chinpiece with it was incorporated a stiffened moustache there were wire hooks to attach the whole thing behind the ears mike laid it carefully on the seat next he picked up a wide black hat then a vast overcoat with a fur collar finally a pair of black gloves mike whistled meditatively and thrust his hands into the pockets of alleyns mackintosh his righthand fingers closed on a card he pulled it out chief detectiveinspector alleyn he read cid new scotland yard honestly thought mike exultantly this is a gift ten minutes later a car pulled into the curb at the nearest parking place to the jupiter theatre from it emerged a figure carrying a suitcase it strode rapidly along hawke street and turned into the stagedoor alley as it passed under the dirty lamp it paused and thus murkily lit resembled an illustration from some edwardian spy story the face was completely shadowed a black cavern from which there projected a square of scarlet beard which was the only note of color the doorkeeper who was taking the air with a member of stage staff moved forward peering at the stranger was you wanting something im taking this case in for mr gill hes in front you can leave it with me im so sorry said the voice behind the beard but i promised id leave it backstage myself so you will be leaving it sorry sir but no ones admitted beind without a card a card very well here is a card he held it out in his blackgloved hand the stagedoorkeeper unwillingly removing his gaze from the beard took the card and examined it under the light coo he said whats up governor no matter say nothing of this the figure waved its hand and passed through the door ere said the doorkeeper excitedly to the stagehand take a slant at this thats a plainclothes flattie that was plain clothes said the stagehand them es disguised said the doorkeeper thats what it is es disguised isself es bloody well lorst isself beind them whiskers if you arst me out on the stage someone was saying in a pitched and beautifully articulate voice ive always loathed the view from these windows however if thats the sort of thing you admire turn off the lights damn you look at it watch it now watch it whispered a voice so close to mike that he jumped ok said a second voice somewhere above his head the lights on the set turned blue kill that working light working light gone curtains in the set were wrenched aside and a window flung open an actor appeared leaning out quite close to mike seeming to look into his face and saying very distinctly god its frightful mike backed away towards a passage lit only from an open door a great volume of sound broke out beyond the stage house lights said the sharp voice mike turned into the passage as he did so someone came through the door he found himself face to face with coralie bourne beautifully dressed and heavily painted for a moment she stood quite still then she made a curious gesture with her right hand gave a small breathy sound and fell forward at his feet anthony was tearing his program into long strips and dropping them on the floor of the op box on his right hand above and below was the audience sometimes laughing sometimes still sometimes as one corporate being raising its hands and striking them together as now when down on the stage canning cumberland using a strange voice and inspired by some inward devil flung back the window and said god its frightful wrong wrong anthony cried inwardly hating cumberland hating barry george because he let one speech of three words override him hating the audience because they liked it the curtain descended with a long sigh on the second act and a sound like heavy rain filled the theatre swelled prodigiously and continued after the house lights welled up they seem said a voice behind him to be liking your play it was gosset who owned the jupiter and had backed the show anthony turned on him stammering hes destroying it it should be the other mans scene hes stealing my boy said gosset hes an actor hes drunk its intolerable he felt gossets hand on his shoulder people are watching us youre on show this is a big thing for you a first play and going enormously come and have a drink old boy i want to introduce you anthony got up and gosset with his arm across his shoulders flashing smiles patting him led him to the back of the box im sorry anthony said i cant please let me off im going backstage much better not old son the hand tightened on his shoulder listen old son but anthony had freed himself and slipped through the passdoor from the box to the stage at the foot of the breakneck stairs dendra gay stood waiting i thought youd come she said anthony said hes drunk hes murdering the play its only one scene tony he finishes early in the next act its going colossally but dont you understand i do you know i do but youre a success tony darling you can hear it and smell it and feel it in your bones dendra he said uncertainly someone came up and shook his hand and went on shaking it flats were being laced together with a slap of rope on canvas a chandelier ascended into darkness lights said the stage manager and the set was flooded with them a distant voice began chanting last act please last act miss bourne all right the stage manager suddenly demanded shell be all right shes not on for ten minutes said a womans voice whats the matter with miss bourne anthony asked tony i must go and so must you tony its going to be grand please think so please dendra tony began but she had gone beyond the curtain horns and flutes announced the last act clear please the stagehands came off house lights house lights gone stand by and while anthony still hesitated in the op corner the curtain rose canning cumberland and h j bannington opened the last act as mike knelt by coralie bourne he heard someone enter the passage behind him he turned and saw silhouetted against the lighted stage the actor who had looked at him through a window in the set the silhouette seemed to repeat the gesture coralie bourne had used and to flatten itself against the wall a woman in an apron came out of the open door i say here mike said three things happened almost simultaneously the woman cried out and knelt beside him the man disappeared through a door on the right the woman holding coralie bourne in her arms said violently why have you come back then the passage lights came on mike said look here im most frightfully sorry and took off the broad black hat the dresser gaped at him coralie bourne made a crescendo sound in her throat and opened her eyes katie she said its all right my lamb its not him dear youre all right the dresser jerked her head at mike get out of it she said yes of course im most frightfully he backed out of the passage colliding with a youth who said five minutes please the dresser called out tell them shes not well tell them to hold the curtain no said coralie bourne strongly im all right katie dont say anything katie what was it they disappeared into the room on the left mike stood in the shadow of a stack of scenic flats by the entry into the passage there was great activity on the stage he caught a glimpse of anthony gill on the far side talking to a girl the callboy was speaking to the stage manager who now shouted into space miss bourne all right the dresser came into the passage and called shell be all right shes not on for ten minutes the youth began chanting last act please the stage manager gave a series of orders a man with an eyeglass and a florid beard came from farther down the passage and stood outside the set bracing his figure and giving little tweaks to his clothes there was a sound of horns and flutes canning cumberland emerged from the room on the right and on his way to the stage passed close to mike leaving a strong smell of alcohol behind him the curtain rose behind his shelter mike stealthily removed his beard and stuffed it into the pocket of his overcoat a group of stagehands stood nearby one of them said in a hoarse whisper es squiffy garn es going good so e may be going good and for why becos es squiffy ten minutes passed mike thought this affair has definitely not gone according to plan he listened some kind of tension seemed to be building up on the stage canning cumberlands voice rose on a loud but blurred note a door in the set opened dont bother to come cumberland said goodbye i can find my way out the door slammed cumberland was standing near mike then very close there was a loud explosion the scenic flats vibrated mikes flesh leapt on his bones and cumberland went into his dressing room mike heard the key turn in the door the smell of alcohol mingled with the smell of gunpowder a stagehand moved to a trestle table and laid a pistol on it the actor with the eyeglass made an exit he spoke for a moment to the stage manager passed mike and disappeared in the passage smells there were all sorts of smells subconsciously still listening to the play he began to sort them out glue canvas greasepaint the callboy tapped on doors mr george please miss bourne please they came out coralie bourne with her dresser mike heard her turn a door handle and say something an indistinguishable voice answered her then she and her dresser passed him the others spoke to her and she nodded and then seemed to withdraw into herself waiting with her head bent ready to make her entrance presently she drew back walked swiftly to the door in the set flung it open and swept on followed a minute later by barry george smells dust stale paint cloth gas increasingly the smell of gas the group of stagehands moved away behind the set to the side of the stage mike edged out of cover he could see the promptcorner the stage manager stood there with folded arms watching the action behind him were grouped the players who were not on two dressers stood apart watching the light from the set caught their faces coralie bournes voice sent phrases flying like birds into the auditorium mike began peering at the floor had he kicked some gas fitting adrift the callboy passed him stared at him over his shoulder and went down the passage tapping five minutes to the curtain please five minutes the actor with the elderly makeup followed the callboy out god what a stink of gas he whispered chronic aint it said the callboy they stared at mike and then crossed to the waiting group the man said something to the stage manager who tipped his head up sniffing he made an impatient gesture and turned back to the promptbox reaching over the prompters head a bell rang somewhere up in the flies and mike saw a stagehand climb to the curtain platform the little group near the promptcorner was agitated they looked back towards the passage entrance the callboy nodded and came running back he knocked on the first door on the right mr cumberland mr cumberland youre on for the call he rattled the door handle mr cumberland youre on mike ran into the passage the callboy coughed retchingly and jerked his hand at the door gas he said gas break it in ill get mr reynolds he was gone it was a narrow passage from halfway across the opposite room mike took a run head down shoulder forward at the door it gave a little and a sickening increase in the smell caught him in the lungs a vast storm of noise had broken out and as he took another run he thought its hailing outside just a minute if you please sir it was a stagehand hed got a hammer and screwdriver he wedged the point of the screwdriver between the lock and the doorpost drove it home and wrenched the screws squeaked the wood splintered and gas poured into the passage no winders coughed the stagehand mike wound alleyns scarf over his mouth and nose halfforgotten instructions from antigas drill occurred to him the room looked queer but he could see the man slumped down in the chair quite clearly he stooped low and ran in he was knocking against things as he backed out lugging the dead weight his arms tingled a high insistent voice hummed in his brain he floated a short distance and came to earth on a concrete floor among several pairs of legs a long way off someone said loudly i can only thank you for being so kind to what i know too well is a very imperfect play then the sound of hail began again there was a heavenly stream of clear air flowing into his mouth and nostrils i could eat it he thought and sat up the telephone rang suppose mrs alleyn suggested that this time you ignore it it might be the yard alleyn said and answered it is that chief detectiveinspector alleyns flat im speaking from the jupiter theatre ive rung up to say that the chief inspector is here and that hes had a slight mishap hes all right but i think it might be as well for someone to drive him home no need to worry what sort of mishap alleyn asked er well er hes been a bit gassed gassed all right thanks ill come what a bore for you darling said mrs alleyn what sort of case is it suicide masquerading within the meaning of the act by the sound of it mikes in trouble what trouble for heavens sake got himself gassed hes all right good night darling dont wait up when he reached the theatre the front of the house was in darkness he made his way down the side alley to the stagedoor where he was held up yard he said and produced his official card ere said the stagedoorkeeper ow many more of you the man inside was working for me said alleyn and walked in the doorkeeper followed protesting to the right of the entrance was a large scenic dock from which the double doors had been rolled back here mike was sitting in an armchair very white about the lips three men and two women all with painted faces stood near him and behind them a group of stagehands with reynolds the stage manager and apart from these three men in evening dress the men looked woodenly shocked the women had been weeping im most frightfully sorry sir mike said ive tried to explain this he added generally is inspector alleyn i cant understand all this said the oldest of the men in evening dress irritably he turned on the doorkeeper you said i seen is card i know said mike but you see this is lord michael lamprey alleyn said a recruit to the police department whats happened here doctor rankin would you the second of the men in evening dress came forward all right gosset its a bad business inspector ive just been saying the police would have to be informed if youll come with me alleyn followed him through a door onto the stage proper it was dimly lit a trestle table had been set up in the center and on it covered with a sheet was an unmistakable shape the smell of gas strong everywhere hung heavily about the table who is it canning cumberland hed locked the door of his dressing room theres a gas fire your young friend dragged him out very pluckily but it was no go i was in front gosset the manager had asked me to supper its a perfectly clear case of suicide as youll see id better look at the room anybody been in god no it was a job to clear it they turned the gas off at the main theres no window they had to open the double doors at the back of the stage and a small outside door at the end of the passage it may be possible to get in now he led the way to the dressingroom passage pretty thick still he said its the first room on the right they burst the lock youd better keep down near the floor the powerful lights over the mirror were on and the room still had its look of occupation the gas fire was against the lefthand wall alleyn squatted down by it the tap was still turned on its face lying parallel with the floor the top of the heater the tap itself and the carpet near it were covered with a creamish powder on the end of the dressingtable shelf nearest to the stove was a box of this powder farther along the shelf greasepaints were set out in a row beneath the mirror then came a wash basin and in front of this an overturned chair alleyn could see the track of heels across the pile of the carpet to the door immediately opposite beside the wash basin was a quart bottle of whiskey threeparts empty and a tumbler alleyn had had about enough and returned to the passage perfectly clear the hovering doctor said again isnt it ill see the other rooms i think the one next to cumberlands was like his in reverse but smaller the heater was back to back with cumberlands the dressingshelf was set out with much the same assortment of greasepaints the tap of this heater too was turned on it was of precisely the same make as the other and alleyn less embarrassed here by fumes was able to make a longer examination it was a common enough type of gas fire the leadin was from a pipe through a flexible metallic tube with a rubber connection there were two taps one in the pipe and one at the junction of the tube with the heater itself alleyn disconnected the tube and examined the connection it was perfectly sound a close fit and stained red at the end alleyn noticed a wiry thread of some reddish stuff resembling packing that still clung to it the nozzle and tap were brass the tap pulling over when it was turned on to lie in a parallel plane with the floor no powder had been scattered about here he glanced round the room returned to the door and read the card mr barry george the doctor followed him into the rooms opposite these on the lefthand side of the passage they were a repetition in design of the two he had already seen but were hung with womens clothes and had a more elaborate assortment of greasepaint and cosmetics there was a mass of flowers in the starroom alleyn read the cards one in particular caught his eye from anthony gill to say a most inadequate thank you for the great idea a vase of red roses stood before the mirror to your greatest triumph coralie darling cc in miss gays room there were only two bouquets one from the management and one from anthony with love again in each room he pulled off the leadin to the heater and looked at the connection all right arent they said the doctor quite all right tight fit good solid gray rubber well then next on the left was an unused room and opposite it mr h j bannington neither of these rooms had gas fires mr banningtons dressingtable was littered with the usual array of greasepaint the materials for his beard a number of telegrams and letters and several bills about the body the doctor began well get a mortuary van from the yard but surely in a case of suicide i dont think this is suicide but good god dyou mean theres been an accident no accident said alleyn at midnight the dressingroom lights in the jupiter theatre were brilliant and men were busy there with the tools of their trade a constable stood at the stagedoor and a van waited in the yard the front of the house was dimly lit and there among the shrouded stalls sat coralie bourne basil gosset h j bannington dendra gay anthony gill reynolds katie the dresser and the callboy a constable sat behind them and another stood by the doors into the foyer they stared across the backs of seats at the fire curtain spirals of smoke rose from their cigarettes and about their feet were discarded programs basil gosset presents i can find my way out by anthony gill in the managers office alleyn said youre sure of your facts mike yes sir honestly i was right up against the entrance into the passage they didnt see me because i was in the shadow it was very dark offstage youll have to swear to it i know good all right thompson miss gay and mr gosset may go home ask miss bourne to come in when sergeant thompson had gone mike said i havent had a chance to say i know ive made a perfect fool of myself using your card and everything irresponsible gaiety doesnt go down very well in the service mike you behaved like a clown i am a fool said mike wretchedly the red beard was lying in front of alleyn on gossets desk he picked it up and held it out put it on he said she might do another faint i think not now the hat yes yes i see come in sergeant thompson showed coralie bourne in and then sat at the end of the desk with his notebook tears had traced their course through the powder on her face carrying black cosmetic with them and leaving the greasepaint shining like snailtracks she stood near the doorway looking dully at michael is he back in england she said did he tell you to do this she made an impatient movement do take it off she said its a very bad beard if cann had only looked her lips trembled who told you to do it nobody mike stammered pocketing the beard i mean as a matter of fact tony gill tony but he didnt know tony wouldnt do it unless unless alleyn said she said frowning tony didnt want cann to play the part that way he was furious he says it was his dress for the chelsea arts ball mike mumbled i brought it here i just thought id put it on it was idiotic i know for fun id no idea you and mr cumberland would mind ask mr gill to come in alleyn said anthony was white and seemed bewildered and helpless ive told mike he said it was my dress for the ball they sent it round from the costumehiring place this afternoon but i forgot it dendra reminded me and rang up the delivery people or mike as it turns out in the interval why alleyn asked did you choose that particular disguise i didnt i didnt know what to wear and i was too rattled to think they said they were hiring things for themselves and would get something for me they said wed all be characters out of a russian melodrama who said this well well it was barry george actually barry coralie bourne said it was barry i dont understand anthony said why should a fancy dress upset everybody it happened alleyn said to be a replica of the dress usually worn by miss bournes husband who also had a red beard that was it wasnt it miss bourne i remember seeing him oh yes she said you would he was known to the police suddenly she broke down completely she was in an armchair near the desk but out of the range of its shaded lamp she twisted and writhed beating her hand against the padded arm of the chair sergeant thompson sat with his head bent and his hand over his notes mike after an agonized glance at alleyn turned his back anthony gill leant over her dont he said violently dont for gods sake stop she twisted away from him and gripping the edge of the desk began to speak to alleyn little by little gaining mastery of herself i want to tell you i want you to understand listen her husband had been fantastically cruel she said it was a kind of slavery but when she sued for divorce he brought evidence of adultery with cumberland they had thought he knew nothing there was an abominable scene he told us he was going away he said hed keep track of us and if i tried again for divorce hed come home he was very friendly with barry in those days he had left behind him the first draft of a play he had meant to write for her and cumberland it had a wonderful scene for them and now you will never have it he had said because there is no other playwright who could make this play for you but i he was she said a melodramatic man but he was never ridiculous he returned to the ukraine where he was born and they had heard no more of him in a little while she would have been able to presume death but years of waiting did not agree with canning cumberland he drank consistently and at his worst used to imagine her husband was about to return he was really terrified of ben she said he seemed like a creature in a nightmare anthony gill said this play was it yes there was an extraordinary similarity between your play and his i saw at once that bens central scene would enormously strengthen your piece cann didnt want me to give it to you barry knew he said why not he wanted canns part and was furious when he didnt get it so you see when he suggested you should dress and makeup like ben she turned to alleyn you see what did cumberland do when he saw you alleyn asked mike he made a queer movement with his hands as if well as if he expected me to go for him then he just bolted into his room he thought ben had come back she said were you alone at any time after you fainted alleyn asked i no no i wasnt katie took me into my dressing room and stayed with me until i went on for the last scene one other question can you by any chance remember if the heater in your room behaved at all oddly she looked wearily at him yes it did give a sort of plop i think it made me jump i was nervy you went straight from your room to the stage yes with katie i wanted to go to cann i tried the door when we came out it was locked he said dont come in i said its all right it wasnt ben and went on to the stage i heard miss bourne mike said he must have made up his mind by then he was terribly drunk when he played his last scene she pushed her hair back from her forehead may i go she asked alleyn ive sent for a taxi mr gill will you see if its there in the meantime miss bourne would you like to wait in the foyer may i take katie home with me certainly thompson will find her is there anyone else we can get no thank you just old katie alleyn opened the door for her and watched her walk into the foyer check up with the dresser thompson he murmured and get mr h j bannington he saw coralie bourne sit on the lower step of the dresscircle stairway and lean her head against the wall nearby on a gilt easel a huge photograph of canning cumberland smiled handsomely at her h j bannington looked pretty ghastly he had rubbed his hand across his face and smeared his makeup florid red paint from his lips had stained the cr√™pe hair that had been gummed on and shaped into a beard his monocle was still in his left eye and gave him an extraordinarily rakish look see here he complained ive about had this party when do we go home alleyn uttered placatory phrases and got him to sit down he checked over hjs movements after cumberland left the stage and found that his account tallied with mikes he asked if hj had visited any of the other dressing rooms and was told acidly that hj knew his place in the company i remained in my unheated and squalid kennel thank you very much do you know if mr barry george followed your example couldnt say old boy he didnt come near me have you any theories at all about this unhappy business mr bannington do you mean why did cann do it well speak no ill of the dead but id have thought it was pretty obvious he was morbiddrunk tight as an owl when we finished the second act ask the great mr barry george cann took the big scene away from barry with both hands and left him looking pathetic all wrong artistically but thats how cann was in his cups hjs wicked little eyes narrowed the great mr george he said must be feeling very unpleasant by now you might say hed got a suicide on his mind mightnt you or dont you know about that it was not suicide the glass dropped from hjs eye god he said god i told bob reynolds i told him the whole plant wanted overhauling the gas plant you mean certainly i was in the gas business years ago might say im in it still with a difference haha haha alleyn agreed politely he leaned forward look here he said we cant dig up a gas man at this time of night and may very likely need an expert opinion you can help us well old boy i was rather pining for a spot of shuteye but of course i shant keep you very long god i hope not said hj earnestly barry george had been made up pale for the last act colorless lips and shadows under his cheekbones and eyes had skillfully underlined his character as a repatriated but broken prisonerofwar now in the glare of the office lamp he looked like a grossly exaggerated figure of mourning he began at once to tell alleyn how grieved and horrified he was everybody he said had their faults and poor old cann was no exception but wasnt it terrible to think what could happen to a man who let himself go downhill he barry george was abnormally sensitive and he didnt think hed ever really get over the awful shock this had been to him what he wondered could be at the bottom of it why had poor old cann decided to end it all miss bournes theory alleyn began mr george laughed coralie he said so shes got a theory oh well never mind her theory is this cumberland saw a man whom he mistook for her husband and having a morbid dread of his return drank the greater part of a bottle of whiskey and gassed himself the clothes and beard that deceived him had i understand been ordered by you for mr anthony gill this statement produced startling results barry george broke into a spate of expostulation and apology there had been no thought in his mind of resurrecting poor old ben who was no doubt dead but had been mind you in many ways one of the best they were all to go to the ball as exaggerated characters from melodrama not for the world he gesticulated and protested a line of sweat broke out along the margin of his hair i dont know what youre getting at he shouted what are you suggesting im suggesting among other things that cumberland was murdered youre mad hed locked himself in they had to break down the door theres no window youre crazy dont alleyn said wearily let us have any nonsense about sealed rooms now mr george you knew benjamin vlasnoff pretty well are you going to tell us that when you suggested mr gill should wear a coat with a fur collar a black sombrero black gloves and a red beard it never occurred to you that his appearance might be a shock to miss bourne and to cumberland i wasnt the only one he blustered hj knew and if it had scared him off she wouldnt have been so sorry shed had about enough of him anyway if this is murder the costumes got nothing to do with it that alleyn said getting up is what we hope to find out in barry georges room detectivesergeant bailey a fingerprint expert stood by the gas heater sergeant gibson a police photographer and a uniformed constable were near the door in the center of the room stood barry george looking from one man to another and picking at his lips i dont know why he wants me to watch all this he said im exhausted im emotionally used up whats he doing where is he alleyn was next door in cumberlands dressing room with hj mike and sergeant thompson it was pretty clear now of fumes and the gas fire was burning comfortably sergeant thompson sprawled in the armchair near the heater his head sunk and his eyes shut this is the theory mr bannington alleyn said you and cumberland have made your final exits miss bourne and mr george and miss gay are all on the stage lord michael is standing just outside the entrance to the passage the dressers and stagestaff are watching the play from the side cumberland has locked himself in this room there he is dead drunk and sound asleep the gas fire is burning full pressure earlier in the evening he powdered himself and a thick layer of the powder lies undisturbed on the tap now he tapped on the wall the fire blew out with a sharp explosion this was followed by the hiss of escaping gas alleyn turned the taps off you see he said ive left an excellent print on the powdered surface now come next door next door barry george appealed to him stammering but i didnt know i dont know anything about it i dont know just show mr bannington will you bailey bailey knelt down the leadin was disconnected from the tap on the heater he turned on the tap in the pipe and blew down the tube an air lock you see it works perfectly hj was staring at barry george but i dont know about gas hj hj tell them one moment alleyn removed the towels that had been spread over the dressingshelf revealing a sheet of clean paper on which lay the rubber pushon connection will you take this lens bannington and look at it youll see that its stained a florid red its a very slight stain but its unmistakably greasepaint and just above the stain youll see a wiry hair rather like some sort of packing material but its not that its cr√™pe hair isnt it the lens wavered above the paper let me hold it for you alleyn said he put his hand over hjs shoulder and with a swift movement plucked a tuft from his false moustache and dropped it on the paper identical you see ginger it seems to be stuck to the connection with spirit gum the lens fell hj twisted round faced alleyn for a second and then struck him full in the face he was a small man but it took three of them to hold him in a way sir its handy when they have a smack at you said detectivesergeant thompson half an hour later you can pull them in nice and straightforward without any will you come to the station and make a statement business quite said alleyn nursing his jaw mike said he must have gone to the room after barry george and miss bourne were called thats it he had to be quick the callboy would be round in a minute and he had to be back in his own room but look here what about motive that my good mike is precisely why at halfpast one in the morning were still in this miserable theatre youre getting a view of the duller aspect of homicide want to go home no give me another job very well about ten feet from the promptentrance theres a sort of garbage tin go through it at seventeen minutes to two when the dressing rooms and passage had been combed clean and alleyn had called a spell mike came to him with filthy hands eureka he said i hope they all went into banningtons room alleyn spread out on the dressingtable the fragments of paper that mike had given him theyd been pushed down to the bottom of the tin mike said alleyn moved the fragments about thompson whistled through his teeth bailey and gibson mumbled together there you are alleyn said at last they collected round him the letter that h j bannington had opened at this same table six hours and fortyfive minutes earlier was pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle dear hj having seen the monthly statement of my account i called at my bank this morning and was shown a check that is undoubtedly a forgery your histrionic versatility my dear hj is only equalled by your audacity as a calligraphist but fame has its disadvantages the teller recognized you i propose to take action unsigned said bailey look at the card on the red roses in miss bournes room signed cc its a very distinctive hand alleyn turned to mike do you still want to be a policeman yes lord help you come and talk to me at the office tomorrow thank you sir they went out leaving a constable on duty it was a cold morning mike looked up at the facade of the jupiter he could just make out the shape of the neon sign i can find my way out by anthony gill the summer people shirley jackson shirley hardie jackson was a prolific novelist and shortstory writer but her name is most readily associated with a single story the lottery born in san francisco she grew up in burlingame california and attended university of rochester and syracuse university her first major publication was the short story my life with r h macy published in the new republic in her first novel the road through the wall was published in the same year the lottery appeared in the new yorker to considerable controversy according to jacksons essay biography of a story no one including her agent and the editor who bought it liked the lottery new yorker editor in chief harold ross did not understand it and it was the subject of torrents of disturbed reader mail jackson has been pegged as a specialist in horror and the supernatural because of her famous story but was actually far more versatile her work including childrens books and lighthearted domestic humor in her autobiographies life among the savages and raising demons jacksons celebrated touch for understated horror developed quite early see for example her very short story janice about a college students devastatingly casual description of her suicide attempt according to her husband stanley edgar hymans introduction to the posthumous collection come along with me it was this story written while she was a sophomore at syracuse that led to their first meeting the summer people is a subtle tale troublingly unresolved with a sense of gathering menace assaulting the everyday is it an allegory a horror story a crime story are the allisons dying or is some human agency terrorizing them it makes a detective of the reader but doesnt necessarily verify the readers conclusions the allisons country cottage seven miles from the nearest town was set prettily on a hill from three sides it looked down on soft trees and grass that seldom even at midsummer lay still and dry on the fourth side was the lake which touched against the wooden pier the allisons had to keep repairing and which looked equally well from the allisons front porch their side porch or any spot on the wooden staircase leading from the porch down to the water although the allisons loved their summer cottage looked forward to arriving in the early summer and hated to leave in the fall they had not troubled themselves to put in any improvements regarding the cottage itself and the lake as improvement enough for the life left to them the cottage had no heat no running water except the precarious supply from the backyard pump and no electricity for seventeen summers janet allison had cooked on a kerosene stove heating all their water robert allison had brought buckets full of water daily from the pump and read his paper by kerosene light in the evenings and they had both sanitary city people become stolid and matteroffact about their backhouse in the first two years they had gone through all the standard vaudeville and magazine jokes about backhouses and by now when they no longer had frequent guests to impress they had subsided to a comfortable security which made the backhouse as well as the pump and the kerosene an indefinable asset to their summer life in themselves the allisons were ordinary people mrs allison was fiftyeight years old and mr allison sixty they had seen their children outgrow the summer cottage and go on to families of their own and seashore resorts their friends were either dead or settled in comfortable yearround houses their nieces and nephews vague in the winter they told one another they could stand their new york apartment while waiting for the summer in the summer they told one another that the winter was well worthwhile waiting to get to the country since they were old enough not to be ashamed of regular habits the allisons invariably left their summer cottage the tuesday after labor day and were as invariably sorry when the months of september and early october turned out to be pleasant and almost insufferably barren in the city each year they recognized that there was nothing to bring them back to new york but it was not until this year that they overcame their traditional inertia enough to decide to stay at the cottage after labor day there isnt really anything to take us back to the city mrs allison told her husband seriously as though it were a new idea and he told her as though neither of them had ever considered it we might as well enjoy the country as long as possible consequently with much pleasure and a slight feeling of adventure mrs allison went into their village the day after labor day and told those natives with whom she had dealings with a pretty air of breaking away from tradition that she and her husband had decided to stay at least a month longer at their cottage it isnt as though we had anything to take us back to the city she said to mr babcock her grocer we might as well enjoy the country while we can nobody ever stayed at the lake past labor day before mr babcock said he was putting mrs allisons groceries into a large cardboard carton and he stopped for a minute to look reflectively into a bag of cookies nobody he added but the city mrs allison always spoke of the city to mr babcock as though it were mr babcocks dream to go there its so hot youve really no idea were always sorry when we leave hate to leave mr babcock said one of the most irritating native tricks mrs allison had noticed was that of taking a trivial statement and rephrasing it downward into an even more trite statement id hate to leave myself mr babcock said after deliberation and both he and mrs allison smiled but i never heard of anyone ever staying out at the lake after labor day before well were going to give it a try mrs allison said and mr babcock replied gravely never know till you try physically mrs allison decided as she always did when leaving the grocery after one of her inconclusive conversations with mr babcock physically mr babcock could model for a statue of daniel webster but mentallyit was horrible to think into what old new england yankee stock had degenerated she said as much to mr allison when she got into the car and he said its generations of inbreeding that and the bad land since this was their big trip into town which they made only once every two weeks to buy things they could not have delivered they spent all day at it stopping to have a sandwich in the newspaper and soda shop and leaving packages heaped in the back of the car although mrs allison was able to order groceries delivered regularly she was never able to form any accurate idea of mr babcocks current stock by telephone and her lists of odds and ends that might be procured was always supplemented almost beyond their need by the new and fresh local vegetables mr babcock was selling temporarily or the packaged candy which had just come in this trip mrs allison was tempted too by the set of glass baking dishes that had found themselves completely by chance in the hardware and clothing and general store and which had seemingly been waiting there for no one but mrs allison since the country people with their instinctive distrust of anything that did not look as permanent as trees and rocks and sky had only recently begun to experiment in aluminum baking dishes instead of ironware and had apparently within the memory of local inhabitants discarded stoneware in favor of iron mrs allison had the glass baking dishes carefully wrapped to endure the uncomfortable ride home over the rocky road that led up to the allisons cottage and while mr charley walpole who with his younger brother albert ran the hardwareclothinggeneral store the store itself was called johnsons because it stood on the site of the old johnson cabin burned fifty years before charley walpole was born laboriously unfolded newspapers to wrap around the dishes mrs allison said informally course i could have waited and gotten those dishes in new york but were not going back so soon this year heard you was staying on mr charley walpole said his old fingers fumbled maddeningly with the thin sheets of newspaper carefully trying to isolate only one sheet at a time and he did not look up at mrs allison as he went on dont know about staying on up there to the lake not after labor day well you know mrs allison said quite as though he deserved an explanation it just seemed to us that weve been hurrying back to new york every year and there just wasnt any need for it you know what the citys like in the fall and she smiled confidingly up at mr charley walpole rhythmically he wound string around the package hes giving me a piece long enough to save mrs allison thought and she looked away quickly to avoid giving any sign of impatience i feel sort of like we belong here more she said staying on after everyone else has left to prove this she smiled brightly across the store at a woman with a familiar face who might have been the woman who sold berries to the allisons one year or the woman who occasionally helped in the grocery and was probably mr babcocks aunt well mr charley walpole said he shoved the package a little across the counter to show that it was finished and that for a sale well made a package well wrapped he was willing to accept pay well he said again never been summer people before at the lake after labor day mrs allison gave him a fivedollar bill and he made change methodically giving great weight even to the pennies never after labor day he said and nodded at mrs allison and went soberly along the store to deal with two women who were looking at cotton housedresses as mrs allison passed on her way out she heard one of the women say acutely why is one of them dresses one dollar and thirtynine cents and this one here is only ninetyeight theyre great people mrs allison told her husband as they went together down the sidewalk after meeting at the door of the hardware store theyre so solid and so reasonable and so honest makes you feel good knowing there are still towns like this mr allison said you know in new york mrs allison said i might have paid a few cents less for these dishes but there wouldnt have been anything sort of personal in the transaction staying on to the lake mrs martin in the newspaper and sandwich shop asked the allisons heard you was staying on thought wed take advantage of the lovely weather this year mr allison said mrs martin was a comparative newcomer to the town she had married into the newspaper and sandwich shop from a neighboring farm and had stayed on after her husbands death she served bottled soft drinks and fried egg and onion sandwiches on thick bread which she made on her own stove at the back of the store occasionally when mrs martin served a sandwich it would carry with it the rich fragrance of the stew or the pork chops cooking alongside for mrs martins dinner i dont guess anyones ever stayed out there so long before mrs martin said not after labor day anyway i guess labor day is when they usually leave mr hall the allisons nearest neighbor told them later in front of mr babcocks store where the allisons were getting into their car to go home surprised youre staying on it seemed a shame to go so soon mrs allison said mr hall lived three miles away he supplied the allisons with butter and eggs and occasionally from the top of their hill the allisons could see the lights in his house in the early evening before the halls went to bed they usually leave labor day mr hall said the ride home was long and rough it was beginning to get dark and mr allison had to drive very carefully over the dirt road by the lake mrs allison lay back against the seat pleasantly relaxed after a day of what seemed whirlwind shopping compared with their daytoday existence the new glass baking dishes lurked agreeably in her mind and the half bushel of red eating apples and the package of colored thumbtacks with which she was going to put up new shelf edging in the kitchen good to get home she said softly as they came in sight of their cottage silhouetted above them against the sky glad we decided to stay on mr allison agreed mrs allison spent the next morning lovingly washing her baking dishes although in his innocence charley walpole had neglected to notice the chip in the edge of one she decided wastefully to use some of the red eating apples in a pie for dinner and while the pie was in the oven and mr allison was down getting the mail she sat out on the little lawn the allisons had made at the top of the hill and watched the changing lights on the lake alternating gray and blue as clouds moved quickly across the sun mr allison came back a little out of sorts it always irritated him to walk the mile to the mailbox on the state road and come back with nothing even though he assumed that the walk was good for his health this morning there was nothing but a circular from a new york department store and their new york paper which arrived erratically by mail from one to four days later than it should so that some days the allisons might have three papers and frequently none mrs allison although she shared with her husband the annoyance of not having mail when they so anticipated it pored affectionately over the department store circular and made a mental note to drop in at the store when she finally went back to new york and check on the sale of wool blankets it was hard to find good ones in pretty colors nowadays she debated saving the circular to remind herself but after thinking about getting up and getting into the cottage to put it away safely somewhere she dropped it into the grass beside her chair and lay back her eyes half closed looks like we might have some rain mr allison said squinting at the sky good for the crops mrs allison said laconically and they both laughed the kerosene man came the next morning while mr allison was down getting the mail they were getting low on kerosene and mrs allison greeted the man warmly he sold kerosene and ice and during the summer hauled garbage away for the summer people a garbage man was only necessary for improvident city folk country people had no garbage im glad to see you mrs allison told him we were getting pretty low the kerosene man whose name mrs allison had never learned used a hose attachment to fill the twentygallon tank which supplied light and heat and cooking facilities for the allisons but today instead of swinging down from his truck and unhooking the hose from where it coiled affectionately around the cab of the truck the man stared uncomfortably at mrs allison his truck motor still going thought you folksd be leaving he said were staying on another month mrs allison said brightly the weather was so nice and it seemed like thats what they told me the man said cant give you no oil though what do you mean mrs allison raised her eyebrows were just going to keep on with our regular after labor day the man said i dont get so much oil myself after labor day mrs allison reminded herself as she had frequently to do when in disagreement with her neighbors that city manners were no good with country people you could not expect to overrule a country employee as you could a city worker and mrs allison smiled engagingly as she said but cant you get extra oil at least while we stay you see the man said he tapped his finger exasperatingly against the car wheel as he spoke you see he said slowly i order this oil i order it down from maybe fifty fiftyfive miles away i order back in june how much ill need for the summer then i order againoh about november round about now its starting to get pretty short as though the subject were closed he stopped tapping his finger and tightened his hands on the wheel in preparation for departure but cant you give us some mrs allison said isnt there anyone else dont know as you could get oil anywheres else right now the man said consideringly i cant give you none before mrs allison could speak the truck began to move then it stopped for a minute and he looked at her through the back window of the cab ice he called i could let you have some ice mrs allison shook her head they were not terribly low on ice and she was angry she ran a few steps to catch up with the truck calling will you try to get us some next week dont sees i can the man said after labor day its harder the truck drove away and mrs allison only comforted by the thought that she could probably get kerosene from mr babcock or at worst the halls watched it go with anger next summer she told herself just let him trying coming around next summer there was no mail again only the paper which seemed to be coming doggedly on time and mr allison was openly cross when he returned when mrs allison told him about the kerosene man he was not particularly impressed probably keeping it all for a high price during the winter he commented whats happened to anne and jerry do you think anne and jerry were their son and daughter both married one living in chicago one in the far west their dutiful weekly letters were late so late in fact that mr allisons annoyance at the lack of mail was able to settle on a legitimate grievance ought to realize how we wait for their letters he said thoughtless selfish children ought to know better well dear mrs allison said placatingly anger at anne and jerry would not relieve her emotions toward the kerosene man after a few minutes she said wishing wont bring the mail dear im going to go call mr babcock and tell him to send up some kerosene with my order at least a postcard mr allison said as she left as with most of the cottages inconveniences the allisons no longer noticed the phone particularly but yielded to its eccentricities without conscious complaint it was a wall phone of a type still seen in only few communities in order to get the operator mrs allison had first to turn the sidecrank and ring once usually it took two or three tries to force the operator to answer and mrs allison making any kind of telephone call approached the phone with resignation and a sort of desperate patience she had to crank the phone three times this morning before the operator answered and then it was still longer before mr babcock picked up the receiver at his phone in the corner of the grocery behind the meat table he said store with the rising inflection that seemed to indicate suspicion of anyone who tried to communicate with him by means of this unreliable instrument this is mrs allison mr babcock i thought id give you my order a day early because i wanted to be sure and get some what say mrs allison mrs allison raised her voice a little she saw mr allison out on the lawn turn in his chair and regard her sympathetically i said mr babcock i thought id call in my order early so you could send me mrs allison mr babcock said youll come and pick it up pick it up in her surprise mrs allison let her voice drop back to its normal tone and mr babcock said loudly whats that mrs allison i thought id have you send it out as usual mrs allison said well mrs allison mr babcock said and there was a pause while mrs allison waited staring past the phone over her husbands head out into the sky mrs allison mr babcock went on finally ill tell you my boys been working for me went back to school yesterday and now i got no one to deliver i only got a boy delivering summers you see i thought you always delivered mrs allison said not after labor day mrs allison mr babcock said firmly you never been here after labor day before sos you wouldnt know of course well mrs allison said helplessly far inside her mind she was saying over and over cant use city manners on country folk no use getting mad are you sure she asked finally couldnt you just send out an order today mr babcock matter of fact mr babcock said i guess i couldnt mrs allison it wouldnt hardly pay delivering with no one else out at the lake what about mr hall mrs allison asked suddenly the people who live about three miles away from us out here mr hall could bring it out when he comes hall mr babcock said john hall theyve gone to visit her folks upstate mrs allison but they bring all our butter and eggs mrs allison said appalled left yesterday mr babcock said probably didnt think you folks would stay on up there but i told mr hall mrs allison started to say and then stopped ill send mr allison in after some groceries tomorrow she said you got all you need till then mr babcock said satisfied it was not a question but a confirmation after she hung up mrs allison went slowly out to sit again in her chair next to her husband he wont deliver she said youll have to go in tomorrow weve got just enough kerosene to last till you get back he should have told us sooner mr allison said it was not possible to remain troubled long in the face of the day the country had never seemed more inviting and the lake moved quietly below them among the trees with the almost incredible softness of a summer picture mrs allison sighed deeply in the pleasure of possessing for themselves that sight of the lake with the distant green hills beyond the gentleness of the small wind through the trees the weather continued fair the next morning mr allison duly armed with a list of groceries with kerosene in large letters at the top went down the path to the garage and mrs allison began another pie in her new baking dishes she had mixed the crust and was starting to pare the apples when mr allison came rapidly up the path and flung open the screen door into the kitchen damn car wont start he announced with the endofthetether voice of a man who depends on a car as he depends on his right arm whats wrong with it mrs allison demanded stopping with the paring knife in one hand and an apple in the other it was all right on tuesday well mr allison said between his teeth its not all right on friday can you fix it mrs allison asked no mr allison said i can not got to call someone i guess who mrs allison asked man runs the filling station i guess mr allison moved purposefully toward the phone he fixed it last summer one time a little apprehensive mrs allison went on paring apples absentmindedly while she listened to mr allison with the phone ringing waiting ringing waiting finally giving the number to the operator then waiting again and giving the number again giving the number a third time and then slamming down the receiver no one there he announced as he came into the kitchen hes probably gone out for a minute mrs allison said nervously she was not quite sure what made her so nervous unless it was the probability of her husbands losing his temper completely hes there alone i imagine so if he goes out theres no one to answer the phone that must be it mr allison said with heavy irony he slumped into one of the kitchen chairs and watched mrs allison paring apples after a minute mrs allison said soothingly why dont you go down and get the mail and then call him again mr allison debated and then said guess i might as well he rose heavily and when he got to the kitchen door he turned and said but if theres no mail and leaving an awful silence behind him he went off down the path mrs allison hurried with her pie twice she went to the window to glance at the sky to see if there were clouds coming up the room seemed unexpectedly dark and she herself felt in the state of tension that precedes a thunderstorm but both times when she looked the sky was clear and serene smiling indifferently down on the allisons summer cottage as well as on the rest of the world when mrs allison her pie ready for the oven went a third time to look outside she saw her husband coming up the path he seemed more cheerful and when he saw her he waved eagerly and held a letter in the air from jerry he called as soon as he was close enough for her to hear him at last a letter mrs allison noticed with concern that he was no longer able to get up the gentle slope of the path without breathing heavily but then he was in the doorway holding out the letter i saved it till i got here he said mrs allison looked with an eagerness that surprised her on the familiar handwriting of her son she could not imagine why the letter excited her so except that it was the first they had received in so long it would be a pleasant dutiful letter full of the doings of alice and the children reporting progress with his job commenting on the recent weather in chicago closing with love from all both mr and mrs allison could if they wished recite a pattern letter from either of their children mr allison slit the letter open with great deliberation and then he spread it out on the kitchen table and they leaned down and read it together dear mother and dad it began in jerrys familiar rather childish handwriting am glad this goes to the lake as usual we always thought you came back too soon and ought to stay up there as long as you could alice says that now that youre not as young as you used to be and have no demands on your time fewer friends etc in the city you ought to get what fun you can while you can since you two are both happy up there its a good idea for you to stay uneasily mrs allison glanced sideways at her husband he was reading intently and she reached out and picked up the empty envelope not knowing exactly what she wanted from it it was addressed quite as usual in jerrys handwriting and was postmarked chicago of course its postmarked chicago she thought quickly why would they want to postmark it anywhere else when she looked back down at the letter her husband had turned the page and she read on with him and of course if they get measles etc now they will be better off later alice is well of course me too been playing a lot of bridge lately with some people you dont know named carruthers nice young couple about our age well will close now as i guess it bores you to hear about things so far away tell dad old dickson in our chicago office died he used to ask about dad a lot have a good time up at the lake and dont bother about hurrying back love from all of us jerry funny mr allison commented it doesnt sound like jerry mrs allison said in a small voice he never wrote anything like she stopped like what mr allison demanded never wrote anything like what mrs allison turned the letter over frowning it was impossible to find any sentence any word even that did not sound like jerrys regular letters perhaps it was only that the letter was so late or the unusual number of dirty fingerprints on the envelope i dont know she said impatiently going to try that phone call again mr allison said mrs allison read the letter twice more trying to find a phrase that sounded wrong then mr allison came back and said very quietly phones dead what mrs allison said dropping the letter phones dead mr allison said the rest of the day went quickly after a lunch of crackers and milk the allisons went to sit outside on the lawn but their afternoon was cut short by the gradually increasing storm clouds that came up over the lake to the cottage so that it was as dark as evening by four oclock the storm delayed however as though in loving anticipation of the moment it would break over the summer cottage and there was an occasional flash of lightning but no rain in the evening mr and mrs allison sitting close together inside their cottage turned on the battery radio they had brought with them from new york there were no lamps lighted in the cottage and the only light came from the lightning outside and the small square glow from the dial of the radio the slight framework of the cottage was not strong enough to withstand the city noises the music and the voices from the radio and the allisons could hear them far off echoing across the lake the saxophones in the new york dance band wailing over the water the flat voice of the girl vocalist going inexorably out into the clean country air even the announcer speaking glowingly of the virtues of razor blades was no more than an inhuman voice sounding out from the allisons cottage and echoing back as though the lake and the hills and the trees were returning it unwanted during one pause between commercials mrs allison turned and smiled weakly at her husband i wonder if were supposed to do anything she said no mr allison said consideringly i dont think so just wait mrs allison caught her breath quickly and mr allison said under the trivial melody of the dance band beginning again the car had been tampered with you know even i could see that mrs allison hesitated a minute and then said very softly i suppose the phone wires were cut i imagine so mr allison said after a while the dance music stopped and they listened attentively to a news broadcast the announcers rich voice telling them breathlessly of a marriage in hollywood the latest baseball scores the estimated rise in food prices during the coming week he spoke to them in the summer cottage quite as though they still deserved to hear news of a world that no longer reached them except through the fallible batteries on the radio which were already beginning to fade almost as though they still belonged however tenuously to the rest of the world mrs allison glanced out the window at the smooth surface of the lake the black masses of the trees and the waiting storm and said conversationally i feel better about that letter of jerrys i knew when i saw the light down at the hall place last night mr allison said the wind coming up suddenly over the lake swept around the summer cottage and slapped hard at the windows mr and mrs allison involuntarily moved closer together and with the first sudden crash of thunder mr allison reached out and took his wifes hand and then while the lightning flashed outside and the radio faded and sputtered the two old people huddled together in their summer cottage and waited st patricks day in the morning charlotte armstrong charlotte armstrong is one of a lustrous group of writers who give the lie to the revisionist history claim that american women mystery writers of the fifties and sixties were downtrodden and unappreciated victims of hardboiled masculine dominance the mystery writers of america awarded her an edgar for a dram of poison and her two titles the gift shop and lemon in the basket were bestnovel nominees in the same year at the height of her reputation not even cornell woolrich was more celebrated as a purveyor of pure suspense after a couple of unsuccessful albeit new yorkproduced plays and three relatively conventional detective novels featuring a character named macdougall duff the michiganborn armstrong made a major impact and stirred controversy among fans and critics with the unsuspected howard haycraft traditionalist author of the standard history murder for pleasure admired the novels strengths but insisted it would have been even better had armstrong concealed the identity of the villain in standard whodunnit fashion rather than letting the reader in on the secret the novel was filmed in with a script by armstrong and she followed it with the chocolate cobweb mischief the blackeyed stranger and many more novels through the posthumously published the prot√©g√© armstrong was as effective at shortstory as novel length st patricks day in the morning demonstrates both her creation of reader anxiety and her strong sense of human interdependence and responsibility plus the problems it can cause it also shows her affinity to woolrich in its unusual variant on one of his favorite situations the lady vanishes and to the theater the main character is a playwright and the story is easy to imagine as a play very carefully in a state of fearful pleasure he put all the pieces of paper in order one copy of the manuscript he put into an envelope and addressed it the other copies he put into an empty suitcase then he called an airline and was lucky a seat for new york in the morning morning what morning st patricks day in the morning he had been out of this world but now he stretched breathed blinked and put out feelers for what is known as reality see now he was mitchel brown playwright god willing and he had finished the job of revision he had come home to los angeles to do wowee finished the hour was a quarter after one in the morning and therefore already the seventeenth of march the place was his groundfloor apartment and it was a mess smoky dirty disorderlyoh well first things had come first his back was aching his eyes were burning his head was light he would have to clean up eat sleep bathe shave dress pack but first he slammed a row of airmail stamps on the envelope and went out the street was dark and deserted a few cars sat lumpishly along the curbs the manuscript thumped down into the mailbox safe in the bosom of the postal service now even if he the plane and the other copies perished mitch laughed at himself and turned the corner feeling suddenly let down depressed and forlorn the parakeet bar and grill he noted gratefully was still open he walked the one block and went in the bar ran all the way along one wall and the grill consisting of eight booths ran all the way along the other the narrow room was dim and felt empty mitch groped for a stool hi toby business slow hi mr brown the bartender seemed glad to see him he was a small man with a crest of dark hair a blue chin and a blue tinge to the whites of his eyes this late on a weeknight im never crowded the kitchens gone home eh mitch said the kitchen was not the heart of this establishment thats right mr brown you want any food you better go elsewhere a drink will do me said mitch with a sigh i can go home and scramble yet another egg toby turned to his bottles when he turned back with mitchs usual he said in an anxious whine fact is i got to close up pretty soon and i dont know what to do what do you mean what to do look at her tobys gaze passed over mitchs left shoulder mitch glanced behind him and was startled to see there was a woman sitting in one of the booths or perhaps one could say lying since her fair hatless head was down on the redchecked tablecloth mitch turned again and wagged inquiring eyebrows out like a light said toby in a hoarse whisper listen i dont want to call the cops thing like that not so good for the place but i got a kid sick and my wife is all wore out and i wanted to get home you try black coffee sure i tried tobys shoulders despaired howd she get this way not here said toby quickly dont see how so help me a coupla drinks hit her like that trouble is shes not a bum you can see that so what should i do put her in a taxi said mitch blithely just ship her where she belongs why not shell have something on her for identity i dont want to mess around with her pocketbook toby said fearfully hm well lets see mitch got off the stool his drink had gone down and bounced lightly and he was feeling cheerful and friendly toward all the world furthermore he felt very intelligent and he understood that he had been born to understand everybody toby came too and they lifted the womans torso her face was slack in drunken sleep but even so it was not an ugly face it was not young neither was it old her clothing was expensive no she wasnt a tramp then she opened her eyes and said in a refined voice i beg your pardon she was not exactly conscious still this was encouraging the two men got her to her feet with their support she could stand in fact she could walk mitch ran his left arm through the handle of her expensivelooking handbag the two of them walked her to the door the air maybe said the bartender hopefully right said mitch listen theres a cab stand next to the movie theater by the time we walk her over there toby said shrilly i got to lock up i got to take care of the place go ahead said mitch standing in the sweet night air with the strange woman heavy in his arms ive got her he heard the lock click behind him as he set off on the sidewalk the woman putting one foot ahead of the other willingly enough musing on the peculiar and surprising qualities of reality mitch had guided her halfway along the block before he recognized the fact that the bartender had taken him literally and was not coming along at all oh well mitch was not annoyed on the contrary he felt filled with compassion for all human beings this woman was human and therefore frail he was glad to try to help her to some place of her own the neighborhood business section was deserted they were moving in an empty world when mitch had struggled all the way to the next corner he could see ahead that there were no cabs near the theater at this time of night the theater was dead and dark as he should have known he guessed he hadnt quite been meshed with the gears of ordinary time anyhow he couldnt turn her over to a handy cab driver nor to the police since there were no policemen around either there was nothing but pavement those few lumps of metal left at the curb for the night and no traffic mitch wouldnt have hailed a motorist anyway most motorists were suspicious and afraid so he did the only thing he could he kept walking he guided her automatic steps around the corner and down the street for surely he thought if he kept her walking she would begin to be conscious and he could then ask her what she wanted him to do about her this he felt was the right thing perhaps he could get out his own car but the air was not having the desired effect she began to stumble her weight slumped against him mitch found he was almost carrying her then he discovered that he was standing holding her upright with both arms directly in front of his own building obviously the only thing to do was take her inside where he could investigate her identity and telephone for a taxi the apartment had not tidied itself up during his absence he let her weight go and she sagged down on his sofa he guided her blond head to a pillow there she lay out like a light a perfect stranger to straighten the body and make it look more comfortable he lifted the lower part of the legs one of her shoes beautiful shoes in a fine green leather with a high spike heel and a small brass buckle one of them came off mitch took hold of the other shoe and also removed it full of cosmic thoughts about females and heels he put her shoes on his desk and slipped her handbag off his arm it was the same fine green leather it did feel sneaky to be rifling the property of a strange woman still it had to be done her name on the drivers license was natalie maxwell her address was in santa barbara mitch whistled that knocked over his scheme of sending her home in a cab since her home was a hundred miles away then he found a letter addressed to mrs julius maxwell and mitch whistled again so she was married furthermore she was married to somebody whose name was familiar julius maxwell all that came to mitchs musing memory was an aroma of money she probably wasnt broke then he peered into her wallet and saw a few bills not many so he riffled her checkbook and whistled for the third time well no penniless waif this one mitch ran his hand through his hair and considered his predicament here he was harboring a wealthy matron from santa barbara who had passed out from liquor what was he going to do with her there was nothing in the bag to tell him where she was staying locally the letter was womans chatter from someone in san francisco so what to do well he might phone the police and dump her on them this he could not quite imagine or he could phone the residence of julius maxwell in santa barbara and if her husband were there ask for instructions or if he were not there surely mitch could ask somebody where mrs maxwell was staying in los angeles and dump her there all this went through his mind and was rejected why cause another human being humiliation and trouble he didnt think she was ill just stinko sooner or later the fumes would wear away and she would come to herself meantime she was perfectly safe right where she was heaven knew he had no evil thoughts also he mitchel brown playwright artist apostle of compassion he was no bourgeois to conform cravenly fearing for his reputation if he were to do what is not done was he being what he was to put this human being into a jam with the law or even with her own husband when this human being for some human reason had simply imbibed a little too much alcohol he couldnt do it okay he had been dragooned by his mood and by the perfidious desertion of toby the bartender into acting the samaritan why not be the good samaritan then give her a break this pleased him it felt lucky to him give her a break god knows we all need them he thought piously so mitch scribbled a note dear mrs maxwell use my phone if you like or be my guest as long as you need to be he signed it went into his bedroom got a light blanket and spread it over her she was snoring faintly he studied her face a moment more he put the note on the rug under her shoes where she would be sure to see it then he went into his bedroom closed the door and went to bed mitchel brown woke up on st patricks day early in the morning absolutely ravenous he had forgotten to eat anything now he remembered new york catch plane pack he started for his kitchen and at the bedroom door remembered the lady so he turned and put a robe on before emerging he neednt have bothered she was gone her shoes were gone her bag was gone his note was gone in fact there was no trace of her at all he did not wonder whether he had been dreaming so she had come to and fled hm without even a thank you oh well panic he supposed ah human frailty mitch shrugged but he had things to do and not enough time to do them in he went into a spell of demon housekeeping threw everything perishable out of his refrigerator everything dirty into the laundry bag everything wearable into his suitcase he caught the plane by a whisker once on it he began to suffer he reread his manuscript in his minds eye and squirmed with doubt he tried to nap and could not and then suddenly he couldand then he was in new york and god was willing and his producer was still hot and eager six weeks later mitchel brown playwright got off the plane in los angeles he had a play on broadway the verdict was comme ci comme √ßa time box office word of mouthpersonally he could bear no more he wasnt licked but he knew he would be unless he got home and got to work on something else and that soon he had been out of this world all this time for when one has a play in rehearsal earthquake major catastrophe declaration of war mean nothing nothing whatever he got to his apartment about five am and kicked aside the pile of newspapers he had forgotten to stop the place smelled stale and wasnt really clean but no matter he opened all the windows mixed himself a highball and sat down with the last paper on the heap to catch up with the way the western world had wagged since he had left it international affairs he had glanced over the last week in the east local affairs of course were completely unknown to him the latest murder hmlos angeles papers are always hopeful that a murder is going to turn out to be a big one so any and every murder gets off with a bang this one didnt look promising a mere brawl he judged would die down in a couple of days he skimmed the second page where all the older murders were followed up he had missed two or three some woman knifed by an exhusband some man shot in his own hall runofthemill mitch yawned he would get out his car go somewhere for a decent meal he decided tomorrow back to the salt mines at pm he walked into his favorite restaurant ordered a drink settled to contemplate the menu she came in quietly about ten minutes later and sat down by herself at a table directly across from mitch the first thing he noted with the tail of his eye was her shoes he had seen them before yes and held them held them in his hands his eyes traveled higher and there was mrs julius maxwell natalie was her given name he remembered it was not only mrs julius maxwell in the flesh but mrs julius maxwell in the very same clothing she had worn before the same green suit the same pale blouse and no hat she was a lady well groomed prosperous pretty and poised and now perfectly sober mitch kept his head cocked and his eyes on her waiting for her to feel his stare and respond to it her eyes came to his in a moment but they were cool and empty of recognition well of course he thought how would she know me she never saw me he glanced away feeling amused then glanced back natalie maxwell was ordering she sat back relaxed and her gaze slipped past him again returned briefly to note his interest then went away indicating none on her part mitch could not help feeling that this was not fair he got up and crossed to her how do you do mrs maxwell he said pleasantly i am glad you are feeling better i beg your pardon she said he remembered that he had heard her say this and only this once before im mitchel brown he waited smiling down at her i dont believe she murmured in genteel puzzlement she had a nice straight nose and although she was looking up at him she seemed to be looking down that nose im sure you remember the name mitch said it was the sixteenth of march no it was saint patricks day in the morning actually i dont quite was she stupid or what mitch said with a bit of a sting in the tone did you have much of a hangover im very sorry she said with a little exasperated laugh but i really dont know what you are talking about oh come now natalie said mitch beginning to feel miffed it was my apartment what she said my apartment that you passed out in here in los angeles i am afraid you are making a mistake she said distantly mitch did not think so arent you mrs julius maxwell yes i am from santa barbara why yes i am she was frowning a little then the apartment you woke up in on saint patricks day in the morning was my apartment said mitch huffily and why the amnesia what is this said a male voice mitch swivelled his head and knew at once that here was mr julius maxwell he saw a mediumsized tautmuscled middleaged man with a thatch of saltandpepper hair and fierce black eyes under heavy black brows everything about this man blazoned aggression and possession he reeked of push and power of i and mine mitchel brown playwright artist and apostle of compassion drew his own forces together as if he folded in some wings julius said the blond woman this man knows my name he keeps talking about saint patricks day in the morning oh he does said her husband he says i was in his apartment here in los angeles to mitch brown came a notion that would explain all this obviously natalies husband had never found out where natalie had been that night so natalie had to pretend she didnt know mitch because she knew as he did not that julius maxwell was nearby and would appear but something in the womans manner did not quite fit this theory she didnt seem to be concerned enough she looked straight ahead and her bewilderment was perfunctory still he thought he should be gallant i must have made a mistake he said but the resemblance is remarkable perhaps you have a double maam he thought this was handsome of him and that it gave her a way out a double said julius maxwell nastily who uses my wifes name well of course if the man was going to be intelligent about it that tore it sorry said mitch lightly sit down and tell me about it said maxwell commandingly mrer brown said mitch shortly he was of a mind to turn on his heel and go away but he glanced at natalie she had opened her handbag and found her compact this stuck him as either offensively nonchalant or pathetically trusting or what curiosity rose in mitch and he sat down why i happened into a bar where a lady had had too much to drink he said as if this were nothing unusual i volunteered to put her in a taxi but there was no taxi i wound up leaving her passed out on my sofa in the morning she was gone thats all there is to the story this was on saint patricks day said maxwell intently in the small hours in the morning then the lady was not my wife my wife was with me in santa barbara at our home that night with you said mitch carefully feeling a bit of shock certainly maxwells tone was belligerent mitch was beginning to wonder the woman had powdered her nose and sat looking as if she couldnt care less not simply in the same building mitch inquired as you may have assumed not simply in the same building said julius maxwell and no assumption she was with me speaking to me touching me if you like his black eyes were hostile oh ho thought mitch then you are a liar too now what is all this he did not care for this maxwell at all perhaps i have mistaken her for another lady he said smoothly but isnt it strange that she is wearing exactly the same clothes now that she was wearing on saint patricks day try that one on for size mitch thought smugly julius said ominously do you know who i am i have heard your name said mitch you know that i am an influential man oh yes said mitch pleasantly in fact i can smell the money from here how much do you want to forget that you saw my wife in los angeles that night mitchs brows went up on saint patricks day in the morning added julius sneeringly mitch felt his feathers ruffling his temper flaring why what is it worth he said they locked gazes it was ridiculous mitch felt as if he had strayed into a class b movie then maxwell rose from the table excuse me he lashed mitch with a sharp look which seemed to be saying stay as if mitch were a dog then he strode off mitch alone with the blond woman said to her quickly what do you want me to do or say he was looking at her hand longfingered pinknailed limp on the table it did not clench it did not even move i dont understand she said in a mechanical way okay said mitch disgustedly i came here for dinner and i see no profit in this discussion so please excuse me he got up crossed over to his own table and ordered his meal julius maxwell returned in a few moments and stood looking at mitch with a triumphant light in his eyes mitch waved the wand of reason over the very human activity of his own glands it was necessary for mitchs selfrespect that he dine here as he had planned to do and that he remain unperturbed by these strange people his steak had come when a man walked into the room and up to maxwells table there was an exchange of words julius rose both men came over to mitch julius said this is the fellow lieutenant mitch found that the stranger was slipping into the seat beside him and julius was slipping in beside him on his other hand he rejected a feeling of being trapped whats all this he inquired mildly patting his lips with his napkin names prince said the stranger los angeles police department mr maxwell tells me you are saying something about mrs maxwells being here in town on the night of the sixteenth of march and the morning of the seventeenth mitch sipped from his water glass watchful and wary julius maxwell said this man was trying to blackmail me with a crazy story i was what mitch exploded the police lieutenant or whoever he was had a long lean face slightly crooked at the bottom and he had very tired eyelids he said your story figured to destroy her alibi her alibi for what mitch leaned back oh come off that brown said julius maxwell or whatever your name is you knew my wife from having seen her picture in the newspaper mitchs brain was racing i havent seen the papers for six weeks he said aggressively julius maxwells black eyes were bright with that triumphant shine now that he said flatly is impossible oh is it said mitch rather gently his role of apostle of compassion was fast fading out mitch was now a human clashing with another human and he knew he had to look out for himself he could feel his wings retracting into his spine alibi for what he insisted looking at the policeman intently the policeman sighed you want it from me okay on the sixteenth of last march late in the evening he droned a man named joseph carlisle was shot to death in his own front hall mitch ears pricked up remembered the paragraph he had seen just tonight lived in a canyon hollywood hills the lieutenant continued winding road lonely spot looked like somebody rang his bell he answered they talked in the hall it was his own gun that he kept in a table there whoever shot him closed the front door which locked it and threw the gun in the shrubbery then beat it wasnt seen by anybody and what has this got to do with mrs maxwell mitch asked mrs maxwell used to be married to this carlisle said the policeman we had to check her out she has this alibi i see said mitch mrs maxwell said julius through his teeth was with me in our home in santa barbara that evening and all that night mitch saw he saw that either maxwell was trying to save his wife from the embarrassment of suspicion orthat compassion was a fine thing but it can get a wellmeaning person into trouble and a few drinks might hit a murderess very hard and very fast mitch knew that whatever else maxwell said he was lying in his teeth about this alibi because the woman still sitting across this restaurant was the very same woman whom mitch brown had taken in had given a break but nobody was giving mitch brown any break and why all this nonsense about blackmail mitch with his wings folded tight away said to the lieutenant suppose i tell you my story and he did so coldly briefly afterward maxwell laughed you believe that you believe that he would take a drunken woman home with him and close the door in his breast mitch brown felt the smolder of dislike burst into a flame of hatred no no said maxwell what must have happened was this he spotted my wife here oh hed read the papers dont you believe that he hadnt he knew she had been married to joe carlisle so spur of the moment he tried out his little lie might be some profit in it who knows listen to this when i asked him how much he wanted to keep this story to himself he asked me how much it was worth mitch chewed his lip youve got a bad ear for dialogue he said that is not exactly what i said nor is it the sense of what i said oh oh said maxwell smiling the lieutenant was pursing noncommittal lips mitch spoke to him who else gives mrs maxwell her alibi servants said the lieutenant gloomily servants said mitch brightly its only natural the lieutenant said even more gloomily right said mitch brown you mean it is probable that when a man and his wife are at home together only the servants will see them there but it isnt so probable that a stranger will take in a drunken woman and leave her to heavensimply because he feels like giving a human being a break so this is a study in probability is it the lieutenants mouth moved and mitch said quickly but you want the facts eh okay the only thing for us to do is go and talk to the bartender that seems to be it said the lieutenant promptly right maxwell said right wait for us he rose and went to fetch his wife mitch stood beside the lieutenant fingerprints he murmured the lieutenant shrugged under those weary eyelids mitch judged the eyes were human she has a car was the car out the lieutenant shrugged again who else would shoot this carlisle any enemies who hasnt the lieutenant said we better check with this bartender the four of them went in the lieutenants car the parakeet bar and grill was doing well this evening it looked brighter and more prosperous toby the bartender was there hi mr brown he said long time no see ive been back east tell this man toby what happened around one thirty on the morning of march seventeenth huh said toby the flesh of his cheeks seemed to go flatter his eye went duller suddenly mitch knew what was going to happen you see this man or this lady in here between one two oclock in the morning last march seventeenth said the lieutenant and added im lieutenant prince lapd no sir said toby i know mr brown of course he comes in now and again see lives around here a writer he is but i dont remember i ever seen this lady before what about brown was he in here that night or that morning i dont think so said toby thats the night now that i think back yeah my kid was sick and i shut the place up earlier than usual ask my wife said toby the bartender with the fixed righteous gaze of the liar lieutenant prince turned his long face his sad eyelids on mitch brown mitch brown was grinning oh no he said not the old paris exposition gag he leaned on the bar and emitted silent laughter what are you talking about lieutenant prince said sourly you give me corroboration for this story youre telling who can tell me about it who saw you and this lady that night nobody nobody said mitch genially the streets were empty nobody was around well i wouldnt have believed it the old paris exposition gag the lieutenant made an exasperated sound mitch said gaily dont you remember that one theres this girl and her mother they go to a paris hotel separate rooms girl wakes up in the morning no mother nobody ever saw any mother no mothers name on the register no rooms got the mothers number wait no that wasnt it there was a room but the wallpaper was different julius maxwell said a writeras if that explained everything why dont we all sit down said mitch cheerfully and tell each other stories his suggestion was accepted natalie maxwell slipped into a booth first she was blond expensive protectedand numb is she doped up with tranquilizers or what mitch wondered her husband sat on her right and the policeman sat on her left mitch slid in the other side of the law and faced his adversary mitch browns mood was by no means as jaunty as his words had implied he didnt like the idea of being the victim of the old paris exposition gag but he was not rattled or panicky on the contrary his mind began to reconnoiter the enemy julius maxwell flamboyantly successful mitch savored the flavor of the mans reputation the buccaneer type ruthless and bold julius maxwell with money like a club in his hand going to make a fool out of mitchel brown also there was the little matter of justice or mercy mitch felt his wings begin to rustle again he said to the woman gently would you care for something a highball i dont drink said natalie primly her lashes came down her tongue touched her lips mitch brown ran his tongue over his upper lip very thoughtfully julius maxwells energy was barely contained in this place never mind the refreshments he said get to it this young man whoever he is spotted my wife and knew her from the publicity he knows i am a rich man so he thought hed try a big lie for the sake of the nuisance value he thought id pay something well an opportunist said julius with a nasty smile i can understand i doubt if you understand me said mitch quietly im sure you dont realize how old hat that paris exposition story is what has any paris exposition got to do with it snapped julius now look here lieutenant prince can i prosecute this man you cant prove extortion said the lieutenant gloomily you should have let him take the money with witnesses he couldnt do that said mitch because he knows the thought of money never crossed my mind the lieutenants eyes closed all the way in great weariness they opened again and it was apparent that he believed nothing and nobody yet want to get this straight now you say mr maxwell julius said i say that my wife was at home that evening and all night as the servants also say and as the authorities know so this man is a liar who can say why it is plain that he cant bring anyone or anything to corroborate this yarn he is telling the bartender denies it and if you ask me the most ridiculous thing he says is his claim that he hasnt read the newspapers for six weeks shows you the fantastic kind of mind hes got the lieutenant without comment turned to mitch and you say i say said mitch that i have been in new york city since the seventeenth of march attending rehearsals of my play and its opening night a playwriter said julius a play wright corrected mitch i guess you dont know what that is for one thing it is a person committed to trying to understand human beings oddly enough even you mitch leaned over the table you are the bold buccaneer so ive heard youve pirated money out of the world and now you think money can buy whatever you want suppose i tell your story julius maxwell now had a faint sneering smile but mitch noted that natalie had her eyes open perhaps her ears were open too mitch plunged on your wife drove down here and shot her ex he said brutally natalie did not even wince well now mitchs imagination began to function from long practice i suppose that natalie felt bad enough upset enough maybe even sorry enough to need a drink and to take too many drinks until she forgot her troubles natalie was looking at him but when she woke up in my apartment she ran ran to her car which she must have had ran home ah well what else could she do mitch mused aloud she had done this awful thing somebody would have to help her was natalie holding her breath who would help her mitch said sharply you would maxwell why ill tell you why you are not the type to want any wife of yours and the accent is on yoursto die in a gas chamber for murder shed done something stupid you bawled her out i imagine for the stupidity of it but you told her not to worry she was yours so you would fix it money can buy anything she must do exactly as you say and then she could forget it mitch hesitated did you think she could forget it he murmured nobody moved or spoke so mitch went on well you got to work you bribed the servants bribed toby here and you checked all around and discovered that there was only one other person who could reveal that she really had no alibi that was a playwright oh you checked on me too sure you did you knew very well where i was and what i was doing you found out the day and the hour i was due back in los angeles lieutenant prince snorted sounds nuts he broke in you say hes been bribing everybody why didnt he bribe you mitch turned a glazed eye on him trouble was i hadnt read the papers i didnt know that i knew so how could he bribe me he put me down for an idiot said mitch for what sane person doesnt read the paper for six weeks and then he thought of a way mitch addressed himself to maxwell you had some hireling watching my apartment and you and natalie were ready and waiting and quite nearby mitch sensed the policemans shrug coming and he added quickly otherwise how come the very first day im in town i run into natalie and natalie in exactly the same clothes who says theyre the same said maxwell smoothly except you she came into the restaurant said mitch alone since i had a phone call to make alone mitch persisted ignoring the interruption and why to encourage me to come over and speak to her thats why the same clothes to make sure id recognize her again after she pulls the blank on me maxwell moves in you knowing how deep youve bribed your defenses behind you press me into the position of looking like an opportunist possibly like an extortionist browns a writer you say to yourself which is a nut in your book nobody is going to believe a word he says youll discredit me youll rig a little scene youll call a real policeman for a witness why croaked the lieutenant mitch was startled why what why cook all this up and call me simple mitch said what if i had finally read the papers and recognized her name what if i had come to you what am i then a good citizen isnt that so this way hes made it look as if i came to them making me look like an opportunist and hes the good citizen who called you in air came out of the lieutenant signifying nothing what a wacky scheme mitch said it first damn it it was wacky it wasnt going to sound probable how unrealistic you are he taunted desperately maxwell sat there smugly youve got the imagination all right he said with a wry smile wild one then the policeman surprised them both wait a minute brown youre saying that maxwell knows his wife is the killer that hes acting as accessory after the fact you mean to say that mitch hesitated maxwell said he hasnt thought it out listen he is just spinning a yarn lieutenant he was challenged to do it hes proving that hes clever and that he is for fiction call it a good try mitch saw his way pointed out for him or possibly said maxwell after a moment he was only trying to pick up a goodlooking woman maxwell showed his teeth in a smile mitch understood he was being shown how to save face it was very seductive not only that he was aware that if he went along the power the money the influence here there and everywhere would work to mitchel browns commercial advantage so he said slowly i know that he is a liar i believe that he is an accessory after the fact yes thats what i mean to say julius maxwells face darkened prove it he snapped because if you just tell it i will have legal recourse and i will have your skin i dont sit still to be called a liar mitch looked up and said with an air of pure detached curiosity what ever made you think that i would look give me something said the lieutenant with sudden anger give me something to go on maxwell said contemptuously he cant its all moonshine mitch was scrambling for something that would help him i never thought of a car he murmured but i should have guessed from the shoes she wears that she hadnt walked here i dont suppose she has walked much since she married so much money mitch knew that maxwell was swelling up with rage or simulated rage but he thought that natalie was listening it came to him with conviction that in spite of everything she was a human being so he looked at her and said why did you leave this joe carlisle i wonder what kind of man was he did you quarrel did you hate him how did he still have the power to hurt you that much she looked at him lips parted eyes bright startled her husband was on the point of getting up and hitting someone and mitch knew whom lieutenant prince said sit down maxwell he said to mitch and you hold on to your tongue dont analyze me any characters or emote me any motives shes got an alibi unless you can break it and evidence is what the law requires but what about my motive for lying mitch demanded money thats ridiculous he stopped staring natalie maxwell had opened her bag taken out a lipstick murder prisonshe paints her mouth slander blackmailshe paints her mouth how probable was that give me proof the lieutenant said angrily in a minute mitch said as his heart bounced upward he leaned back let me pursue the theme of money i imagine natalies got whatever money can buy her living is paid for she has charge accounts maxwell said lets go hes rambling now the lieutenant began to push at mitchs thigh nudging him out of the booth know what i can prove mitch said what said the lieutenant that i was working in my apartment all that day and into the night on the sixteenth seventeenth of march those walls are cardboard and i am a nuisance well known in the building so you were working said the policeman what of it i wasnt in santa barbara said mitch cheerfully he reached over and plucked up natalies handbag the green one that matched the shoes now just a minute maxwell growled see if her checkbook is in there said mitch pushing the bag at the lieutenant its a fat one her names printed on it and all that i dont think she has much occasion to write checks it may be the same one the lieutenant had his hands on the bag but he looked unenlightened look at it its evidence mitch said the lieutenants hands moved and maxwell said im not sure you have the right but the policemans weary lids came up only briefly and maxwell was silent the lieutenant took out a checkbook its fat he said starts february twentyfirst what of it mitch brown leaned his head on the red leatherette and kept his eyes high nobody on earthunless natalie remembers which i doubtbut nobody else on earth can know what the balance on her check stubs was on saint patricks day in the morning even her bank couldnt know but what if i know how could i because i looked while she was snoring on my sofa and i had to find out who she was and how i could help her and whether she needed any money the lieutenants hand riffled the stubs well shall i name it for you to the penny mitch was sweating four thousand six hundred and fourteen dollars and sixtyone cents he said slowly and carefully right snapped the lieutenant and his eyes came up wideopen and baleful on julius maxwell but mitch brown was not heeding and felt no triumph natalie he said im sorry i wanted to give you a break i didnt know what the trouble was i wish you could have told me her newly reddened lips were trembling not so i could buy off the consequences mitch said id have called the police but i would have listened natalie put her blond head down on the redchecked tablecloth where it had once rested before i didnt mean to do it she sobbed but he kept at me joe did until i couldnt take any more julius maxwell who had been thinking about evidence said too late shut up the lieutenant went for the phone mitch sat there quiet now the woman was weeping maxwell said in a cold severe way natalie if you he drew away from contamination he was going to pretend ignorance but she cried out you shut up ive told you and told you and you never even tried to understand you said give joe a thousand dollars hed go away you said thats all he wanted you wouldnt even listen to what i was going through and joe talking talking about our baby that was deadstarved joe said because she had no mother my baby she shrieked that you wouldnt have because she wasnt yours now her pinkpainted fingernails clawed at her scalp and the rings on her fingers were tangled in her hair im sorry she wept i never meant to make the gun go off i just wanted to stop him i just couldnt take any more he was killing medriving me crazyand money wouldnt stop him mitchs heart was heavy for her didnt you know what matters he barked at maxwell did you think it was mink diamonds that stuff the child died said julius maxwell of natural causes yes he thought it was mink screamed natalie and oh my godit was i know that now so he said he would fix it but he cant fix what i know and i hope to die then she lay silent as if already dead across the redchecked tablecloth julius maxwells face was losing color as the policeman came back and murmured have to wait but the lieutenant was uneasy say brown he said you can remember a row of six figures for six weeks you a mathematical genius or something you got what they call a photographic memory mitch felt his brain stir he said lightly it stuck in my mind first place it repeats you see that four six one four six one to me thats an awful lot of money to me too the lieutenant said everybody in here heard what she said i guess sure heard her confess and implicate him as the accessory take a look at toby for instance hes had it theres going to be plenty of evidence the lieutenant looked down upon the ruin of the maxwells guess so he said tightly later that night mitch brown was sitting up to a strange bar he said to the strange bartender say you ever know that the seventeenth of march is not saint patricks birthday what dya know the bartender murmured politely nope its the day he died said mitch i write see so i read bits of information like that stick in my mind ive got no memory for figures and yetknow the year saint patrick died it was the year that so said the bartender you take four sixtyone twice and put the decimal in the right place of course thats not very believable mitch said although it really happened on saint patricks day in the morning how come i knew me a person who doesnt always read the newspaper the year saint patrick died well a fellow doesnt want to be made a fool of does he and probable is probable and improbable is improbable but its all weve got to go on sometimes but ill tell you something mitch pounded the bar money couldnt have bought it the bartender said soothingly i guess not mac the purple is everything dorothy salisbury davis dorothy salisbury davis b born in chicago and a graduate of barat college is clearly a person for the long haul her marriage to actor harry davis lasted from until his death in and she continues to contribute to a field of writing she entered more than half a century ago with the novel the judas cat most recently with a new story in the anthology murder among friends davis is by her own account an odd fit in the crimefiction genre she has bemoaned her inability to create a memorable series character though julie hayes of her last few novels makes the grade and she has a distaste for violence and murder one of the anthologies she edited for the mystery writers of america is called crime without murder however her expressed enthusiasm for villains over heroes helps to explain her success in the field among her bestknown books are the regional classic the clay hand the roman catholicthemed a gentle murderer and the bestseller where the dark streets go in introducing her collection tales for a stormy night davis credits her late friend and fellow mystery writer margaret manners with giving her the method for stealing a painting used in the edgarnominated the purple is everything i even remember the spot davis wrote sixth avenue and twentyfourth street a few paces in those days from guffantis restaurant though it is unquestionably a crime story it has its authors moral concerns at its heart and it is of a quality that might as well have been published in the new yorker as ellery queens mystery magazine you are likely to say reading about mary gardner that you knew her or that you once knew someone like her and well you may have for while her kind is not legion it endures and sometimes against great popular odds you will see mary gardner or someone like her at the symphony in the art galleries at the theatre always welldressed if not quite fashionable sometimes alone sometimes in the company of other women all of whom have an aura not of sameness but of mutuality each of them has made well if not a good life for herself at least the best possible life it was in her power to make mary gardner was living at the time in a large east coast city in her late thirties she was a tall lean woman unmarried quietly feminine gentle even a little hesitant in manner but definite in her tastes mary was a designer in a wellknown wallpaper house her salary allowed her to buy good clothes to live alone in a pleasant apartment within walking distance of her work and to go regularly to the theater and the philharmonic as often as she went to the successful plays she attended little theater and the experimental stage she was not among those who believed that a play had to say something she was interested in the submerged values this taste prevailed also in her approach to the visual arts a boon surely in the wallpaper business whose customers for the most part prefer their walls to be seen but not heard in those days mary was in the habit of going during her lunch hour or sometimes when she needed to get away from the drawing board to the institute of modern art which was less than a city block from her office she had fallen in love with a small early monet titled trees near lhavre and when in love mary was a person of searching devotion almost daily she discovered new voices in the woodland scene trees and sky reflected in a shimmering pool with more depths in the sky she felt than in the water the more she thought about this observation the more convinced she became that the gallery had hung the picture upside down she evolved a theory about the signature it was hastily done by the artist she decided long after he had finished the painting and perhaps at a time when the light of day was fading she would have spoken to a museum authority about it if she had known a museum authority mary received permission from the institute to sketch within its halls and often stood before the monet for an hour sketchbook in hand by putting a few strokes on paper she felt herself conspicuously inconspicuous among the transient viewers and the guards she would not for anything have presumed to copy the painting and she was fiercely resentful of the occasional art student who did so deep was mary in her contemplation of claude monets wooded scene that on the morning of the famous museum fire when she first smelled the smoke she thought it came from inside the picture itself she was instantly furious and by an old association she indicted a whole genre of people the careless american tourist in a foreign land she was not so far away from reality however that she did not realize almost at once there was actually a fire in the building voices cried out alarms in the corridors and men suddenly were running guards dragged limp hoses along the floor and dropped them where they lay like great withered snakes over which people leaped as in some tribal rite blue smoke layered the ceiling and then began to fall in angled swatches like theatrical scrims gone awry in the far distance fire sirens wailed mary gardner watched rooted and muted as men and women visitors like herself hastened past bearing framed pictures in their arms and in one case two men carried between them a huge chagall night scene in which the little creatures seemed to be jumping on and off the canvas having an uproarious time in transit a woman took the rouault from the wall beside the monet and hurried with it after the bearers of the chagall still mary hesitated that duty should compel her to touch where conscience had so long forbidden it this conflict increased her confusion another thrust of smoke into the room made the issue plainly the pictures survival if not indeed her own in desperate haste she tried to lift the monet from the wall but it would not yield she strove pulling with her full strength such strength that when the wire broke she was catapulted backward and fell over the viewers bench crashing her head into the painting since the canvas was mounted on board the only misfortune aside from her bruised head which mattered not at all was that the picture had jarred loose from its frame by then mary cared little for the frame she caught up the painting hugged it to her and groped her way to the gallery door she reached the smokebogged corridor at the instant the water pressure brought the hoses violently to life jets of water spurted from every connection mary shielded the picture with her body until she could edge it within the raincoat she had worn against the morning drizzle she hurried along the corridor the last apparently of the volunteer rescuers the guards were sealing off the wing of the building closing the fire prevention door they showed little patience with her protests shunting her down the stairs by the time she reached the lobby the police had cordoned off civilians imperious as well as impervious a policeman escorted her into the crowd and in the crowd having no use of her arms they were still locked around the picture she was shoved and jostled toward the door and there pitilessly jettisoned into the street on the sidewalk she had no hope at all finding anyone in that surging gaping mob on whom she could safely bestow her art treasure people screamed and shouted that they could see the flames mary did not look back she hastened homeward walking proud and fierce thinking that the city was after all a jungle she hugged the picture to her her raincoat its only shield but her life a ready forfeit for its safety it had been in her mind to telephone the institute office at once but in her own apartment the painting propped up against cushions on the sofa she reasoned that until the fire was extinguished she had no hope of talking with anyone there she called her own office and pleaded a sudden illness something she had eaten at lunch though she had not had a bite since breakfast the walls of her apartment were hung with what she called her potpourri costume prints and color lithographs all she had been proud to say limited editions or artists prints she had sometimes thought of buying paintings but plainly she could not afford her own tastes on impulse now she took down an italian lithograph and removed the glass and mat from the wooden frame the monet fit quite well and to her particular delight she could now hang it right side up as though with a will of its own the painting claimed the place on her wall most favored by the light of day there is no way of describing marys pleasure in the company she kept that afternoon she would not have taken her eyes from the picture at all except for the joy that was renewed at each returning reluctantly she turned on the radio at five oclock so that she might learn more of the fire at the institute it had been extensive and destructive an entire wing of the building was gutted she listened with the remote and somewhat smug solicitude that one bestows on other peoples tragedies to the enumeration of the paintings which had been destroyed the mention of trees near lhavre startled her a full moment later she realized the explicit meaning of the announcers words she turned off the radio and sat a long time in the flood of silence then she said aloud tentatively you are a thief mary gardner and after a bit repeated oh yes you are a thief but she did not mind at all nothing so portentous had ever been said about her before even by herself she ate her dinner from a tray before the painting having with it a bottle of french wine many times that night she went from her bed to the livingroom door until she seemed to have slept between so many wakenings at last she did sleep but the first light of morning fell on marys conscience as early as upon the painting after one brief visit to the living room she made her plans with the care of a religious novice well aware of the devils constancy she dressed more severely than was her fashion needing herringbone for backbone the ridiculous phrase kept running through her mind at breakfast in final appraisal of herself in the hall mirror she thought she looked like the headmistress of an english girls school which she supposed satisfactory to the task before her just before she left the apartment she spent one last moment alone with the monet afterward wherever however the institute chose to hang it she might hope to feel that a little part of it was forever hers on the street she bought a newspaper and confirmed the listing of trees near lhavre although that wing of the institute had been destroyed many of its paintings had been carried to safety by way of the secondfloor corridor part of the street in front of the institute was still cordoned off when she reached it congesting the flow of morning traffic the police on duty were no less brusque than those whom mary had encountered the day before she was seized by the impulse to postpone her mission an almost irresistible temptation especially when she was barred from entering the museum unless she could show a pass such as had been issued to all authorized personnel of course im not authorized she exclaimed if i were i shouldnt be out here the policeman directed her to the sergeant in charge he was at the moment disputing with the fire insurance representative as to how much of the street could be used for the salvage operation the business of this street is business the sergeant said and thats my business mary waited until the insurance man stalked into the building he did not need a pass she noticed excuse me officer i have a painting lady he drew the long breath of patience yes maam yesterday during the fire a painting was supposedly destroyed a lovely small monet called was there now the sergeant interrupted lovely small monets really touched him mary was becoming flustered in spite of herself its listed in this mornings paper as having been destroyed but it wasnt i have it at home the policeman looked at her for the first time with a certain compassion on your livingroom wall no doubt he said with deep knowingness yes as a matter of fact he took her gently but firmly by the arm i tell you what you do you go along to police headquarters on fiftyseventh street you know where that is dont you just tell them all about it like a good girl he propelled her into the crowd and there released her then he raised his voice keep moving youll see it all on the television mary had no intention of going to police headquarters where she presumed men concerned with armed robbery mayhem and worse were even less likely to understand the subtlety of her problem she went to her office and throughout the morning tried periodically to reach the museum curators office by telephone on each of her calls either the switchboard was tied up or his line was busy for longer than she could wait finally she hit on the idea of asking for the institutes public relations department and to someone there obviously distracted mary could hear parts of three conversations going on at the same time she explained how during the fire she had saved monets trees near lhavre near where madam the voice asked lhavre mary spelled it by monet she added is that two words or one the voice asked please transfer me to the curators office mary said and ran her fingers up and down the lapel of her herringbone suit mary thought it a wise precaution to meet the institutes representative in the apartment lobby where she first asked to see his credentials he identified himself as the man to whom she had given her name and address on the phone mary signaled for the elevator and thought about his identification robert attlebury iii she had seen his name on the museum roster curator ofshe could not remember he looked every inch the curator standing erect and remote while the elevator bore them slowly upward a curator perhaps but she would not have called him a connoisseur one with his face and disposition would always taste and spit out she thought she could imagine his scorn of things he found distasteful and instinctively she knew herself to be distasteful to him not that it really mattered what he felt about her she was nobody but how must the young unknown artist feel standing with his work before such superciliousness or had he a different mien and manner for people of his own kind in that case she would have given a great deal for the commonest of his courtesies everything seems so extraordinary in retrospect mary said to break the silence of their seemingly endless ascent how fortunate for you he said and mary thought perhaps it was when they reached the door of her apartment she paused before turning the key shouldnt you have brought a guard or someone he looked down on her as from olympus i am someone mary resolved to say nothing more she opened the door and left it open he preceded her and moved across the foyer into the living room and stood before the monet his rude directness oddly comforted her he did after all care about painting she ought not to judge men she thought from her limited experience of them he gazed at the monet for a few moments then he tilted his head ever so slightly from one side to the other marys heart began to beat erratically for months she had wanted to discuss with someone who really knew about such things her theory of what was reflection and what was reality in trees near lhavre but now that her chance was at hand she could not find the words still she had to say something somethingcasual the frame is mine she said but for the pictures protection you may take it i can get it the next time im at the museum surprisingly he laughed it may be the better part at that he said i beg your pardon he actually looked at her your story is ingenious madam but then it was warranted by the occasion i simply do not understand what you are saying mary said i have seen better copies than this one he said its too bad your ingenuity isnt matched by a better imitation mary was too stunned to speak he was about to go butits signed mary blurted out and feebly tried to direct his attention to the name in the upper corner which makes it forgery doesnt it he said almost solicitously his preciseness his imperturbability in the light of the horrendous thing he was saying etched detail into the nightmare thats not my problem mary cried giving voice to words she did not mean saying what amounted to a betrayal of the painting she so loved oh but it is indeed it is and i may say a serious problem if i were to pursue it please do pursue it mary cried again he smiled just a little that is not the institutes way of dealing with these things you do not like monet mary challenged desperately for he had started toward the door thats rather beside the point isnt it you dont know monet you cant not possibly how could i dislike him if i didnt know him let me tell you something about monet he turned back to the picture and trailed a finger over one vivid area in monet the purple is everything the purple mary said youre beginning to see it yourself now arent you his tone verged on the pedagogic mary closed her eyes and said i only know how this painting came to be here i infinitely prefer not to be made your confidant in that matter he said now i have rather more important matters to take care of and again he started toward the door mary hastened to block his escape it doesnt matter what you think of monet or of me or of anything youve got to take that painting back to the museum and be made a laughingstock when the hoax is discovered he set an arm as stiff as a brass rail between them and moved out of the apartment mary followed him to the elevator now quite beside herself i shall go to the newspapers she cried i think you might regret it now i know i understand mary saw the elevator door open you were glad to think the monet had been destroyed in the fire savage he said then the door closed between them in time mary persuaded and it wasnt easy certain experts even an art critic to come and examine her monet it was a more expensive undertaking than she could afford all of them seemed to expect refreshments including expensive liquors her friends fell in with marys hoax as they came to call her story and she was much admired in an everwidening and increasingly esoteric circle for her unwavering account of how she had come into possession of a genuine monet despite the virtue of simplicity a trait since childhood she found herself using words in symbolic combinations the language of the company she now kept and people far wiser than she would say of her how perceptive or what insightand then pour themselves another drink one day her employer the great man himself who prior to her acquisition had not known whether she lived in propriety or in sin arrived at her apartment at cocktail time bringing with him a famous art historian the expert smiled happily over his second scotch while mary told again the story of the fire at the institute and how she had simply walked home with the painting because she could not find anyone to whom to give it while she talked his knowing eyes wandered from her face to the painting to his glass to the painting and back to her face again oh i could believe it he said when she had finished its the sort of mad adventure that actually could happen he set his glass down carefully where she could see that it was empty i suppose you know that there has never been an officially complete catalogue of monets work no she said and refilled his glass its so unfortunately and the sad truth is that quite a number of museums today are hanging paintings under his name that are really unauthenticated and mine mary said lifting a chin she tried vainly to keep from quivering her guest smiled must you know for a time after that mary tried to avoid looking at the monet it was not that she liked it less but that now she somehow liked herself less in its company what had happened she realized was that like the experts she now saw not the painting but herself this was an extraordinary bit of selfdiscovery for one who had never had to deal severely with her own psyche till now so far as mary was concerned the chief function of a mirror had been to determine the angle of a hat but the discovery of the flaw does not in itself effect a cure often it aggravates the condition so with mary she spent less and less time at home and it was to be said for some of her newfound friends that they thought it only fair to reciprocate for having enjoyed the hospitality of so enigmatically clever a hostess how often had she as a girl been counseled by parent and teacher to get out more to see more people well mary was at last getting out more and in the homes of people who had felt free to comment on her home and its possessions she too felt free to comment the more odd her comment the nastier she would once have said of it the more popular she became oh yes mary was seeing more people lots more people in fact her insurance agent who was in the habit of just dropping in to make his quarterly collection had to get up early one saturday morning to make sure he caught her at home it was a clear sharp day and the hour at which the monet was most luminous the man sat staring at it fascinated mary was amused remembering how hurt he always was that his clients failed to hang his company calendar in prominence while she was gone from the room to get her checkbook he got up and touched the surface of the painting ever think of taking out insurance on that picture he asked when she returned do you mind if i ask how much its worth it cost mea great deal mary said and was at once annoyed with both him and herself i tell you what the agent said i have a friend who appraises these objects of art for some of the big galleries you know do you mind if i bring him round and see what he thinks its worth no i dont mind mary said in utter resignation and so the appraiser came and looked carefully at the painting he hedged about putting a value on it he wasnt the last word on these nineteenthcentury impressionists and he wanted to think it over but that afternoon he returned just as mary was about to go out and with him came a bearded gentleman who spoke not once to mary or to the appraiser but chatted constantly with himself while he scrutinized the painting then with a tsk tsk tsk he took the painting from the wall examined the back and rehung it but reversing it top to bottom mary felt the old flutter interrupt her heartbeat but it passed quickly even walking out of her house the bearded gentleman did not speak to her she might have been invisible it was the appraiser who murmured his thanks but not a word of explanation since the expert had not drunk her whiskey mary supposed the amenities were not required of him she was prepared to forget him as she had the others it was easy now to forget them all but when she came home to change between matinee and cocktails another visitor was waiting she noticed him in the lobby and realized seeing the doorman say a word to him just as the elevator door closed off her view that his business was with her the next trip of the elevator brought him to her door ive come about the painting miss gardner he said and offered his card she had opened the door only as far as the latch chain permitted he was representative of the continental assurance company limited she slipped off the latch chain courteous and formal behind his doublebreasted suit he waited for mary to seat herself he sat down neatly opposite her facing the painting for she sat beneath it erect and she hoped formidable lovely he said gazing at the monet then he wrenched his eyes from it but im not an expert he added and gently cleared his throat he was chagrined she thought to have allowed himself even so brief a luxury of the heart but is it authenticated she said it much as she would once have thought but not said fie on you sufficient to my companys requirements he said but dont misunderstand we are not proposing to make any inquiries we are always satisfied in such delicate negotiations just to have the painting back mary did not misunderstand but she certainly did not understand either he took from his inside pocket a piece of paper which he placed on the coffee table and with the tapering fingers of an artist or a banker or a pickpocket he gently maneuvered it to where mary could see that he was proffering a certified check he did not look at her and therefore missed the spasm she felt contorting her mouth the day of the fire she thought but the words never passed her lips she took up the check in her hand may i use your phone miss gardner mary nodded and went into the kitchen where she again looked at the check it was a great deal of money she thought wryly to be offered in compensation for a few months care of a friend she heard her visitors voice as he spoke into the telephone an expert now to judge by his tone a few minutes later she heard the front door close when she went back into the living room both her visitor and the monet were gone some time later mary attended the opening of the new wing of the institute she recognized a number of people she had not known before and whom she supposed she was not likely to know much longer they had hung the monet upside down again mary thought of it after she got home and as though two rights must surely right a possible wrong she turned the check upside down while she burned it over the kitchen sink money to burn margery allingham margery allingham was a writing prodigy whose first novel the swashbuckler blackkerchief dick was published by major american and british firms when she was still a teenager the londonborn author who came from a literary family served an apprenticeship as a prolific writer of formula magazine fiction before becoming one of the key figures of the golden age of detection between the two world wars her first mystery novel the white cottage mystery anticipated a leastsuspectedperson device later used by ellery queen and agatha christie and her second the crime at black dudley introduced the inconspicuous and selfeffacing albert campion one of the most celebrated gentleman detectives of his time and with a hint of royal blood in his veins probably the highest born like that other aristocratic sleuth dorothy l sayerss lord peter wimsey campion gradually developed from a semicomic silly ass caricature to a fully realized character of the celebrated golden age detectivestory writers some like agatha christie and ngaio marsh stuck to the pure whodunnit formula for decades thereafter others like sayers and anthony berkeley left the field for other sorts of writing or retired altogether and a few like the ellery queen team stayed with the basic format but deepened their exploration of character and theme allingham whose understanding of human foibles and keen social observations were always manifest belongs to that third group while mr campion continued to appear through most of her writing career her postwar novels laid less stress on the formal puzzle and in some of them campion was relegated to a secondary role campion received nameinthetitle billing only after his creators death in two novels written by her husband and sometime collaborator philip youngman carter of allinghams early novels death of a ghost and the fashion in shrouds are often cited as highlights of the postwar group the tiger in the smoke with its unflinching examination of pure evil is considered a crime classic it is appropriate that allingham with her insights into the puzzles of human character should be represented by money to burn a noncampion tale which represents that rarest of detective story subtypes the pure whydunnit did you ever see a man set light to money real money using it as a spill to light a cigarette just to show off i have and thats why when you used the word psychologist just now a little fish leaped in my stomach and my throat felt suddenly tight perhaps you think im too squeamish i wonder i was born in this street when i was a girl i went to school just round the corner and later on after id served my apprenticeship in the big dress houses here and in france i took over the lease of this old house and turned it into the smart little gown shop you see now it was when i came back to go into business for myself that i saw the change in louise when we went to school together she was something of a beauty with streaming yellow hair and the cockney childs ferocious knowing grin all the kids used to tease her because she was betterlooking than we were the street was just the same then as it is now adelaide street soho shabby and untidy and yet romantic with every other doorway in its straggling length leading to a restaurant of some sort you can eat in every language of the world here some places are as expensive as the ritz and others are as cheap as louises papas le coq au vin with its one dining room and its single palm in the whitewashed tub outside louise had an infant sister and a father who could hardly speak english but who looked at one with proud foreign eyes from under arched brows i was hardly aware that she had a mother until a day when that gray woman emerged from the cellar under the restaurant to put her foot down and louise instead of coming with me into the enchantment of the workshops had to go down into the kitchens of le coq au vin for a long time we used to exchange birthday cards and then even that contact dropped but somehow i never forgot louise and when i came back to the street i was glad to see the name frosn√© still under the sign of le coq au vin the place looked much brighter than i remembered it and appeared to be doing fair business certainly it no longer suffered so much by comparison with the expensive glass mountain which adelbert kept opposite there is no restaurant bearing that name in this street now nor is there a restaurateur called adelbert but dinersout of a few years ago may remember him if not for his food at least for his conceit and the two rolls of white fat which were his eyelids i went in to see louise as soon as i had a moment to spare it was a shock for i hardly recognized her but she knew me at once and came out from behind the cashiers desk to give me a welcome which was pathetic it was like seeing thin ice cracking all over her face as if by taking her unawares id torn aside a barrier i heard all the news in the first ten minutes both the old people were dead the mother had gone first but the old man had not followed her for some years after and in the meantime louise had carried everything including his vagaries on her shoulders but she did not complain things were a bit easier now violetta the little sister had a young man who was proving his worth by working there for a pittance learning the business it was a success story of a sort but i thought louise had paid pretty dearly for it she was a year younger than i was yet she looked as if life had already burned out over her leaving her hard and polished like a bone in the sun the gold had gone out of her hair and even her thick lashes looked bleached and towcolored there was something else there too something hunted which i did not understand at all i soon fell into the habit of going in to have supper with her once a week and at these little meals she used to talk it was evident that she never opened her lips on any personal matter to anyone else but for some reason she trusted me even so it took me months to find out what was the matter with her when it came out it was obvious le coq au vin had a debt hanging over it in mama frosn√©s time the family had never owed a penny but in the year or so between her death and his own papa frosn√© had somehow contrived not only to borrow the best part of four thousand pounds from adelbert of the glass mountain but to lose every cent of it in half a dozen senile little schemes louise was paying it back in fivehundredpound installments as she first told me about it i happened to glance into her eyes and in them i saw one sort of hell it has always seemed to me that there are people who can stand debt in the same way that some men can stand drink it may undermine their constitutions but it does not make them openly shabby yet to the others debt does something unspeakable the devil was certainly having his moneys worth out of louise i did not argue with her of course it was not my place i sat there registering sympathy until she surprised me by saying suddenly its not so much the work and the worry nor even the skimping that i really hate so much its the awful ceremony when i have to pay him i dread that youre too sensitive i told her once you have the money in the bank you can put a check in an envelope send it to him and then forget about it cant you she glanced at me with an odd expression in her eyes they were almost leadcolored between the bleached lashes you dont know adelbert she said hes a queer bit of work i have to pay him in cash and he likes to make a regular little performance of it he comes here by appointment has a drink and likes to have violetta as a witness by way of audience if i dont show im a bit upset he goes right on talking until i do calls himself a psychologist says he knows everything im thinking thats not what id call him i said i was disgusted i hate that sort of thing louise hesitated i have watched him burn most of the money just for the effect she admitted there in front of me i felt my eyebrows rising up into my hair you cant mean it i exclaimed the mans not right in the head she sighed and i looked at her sharply why hes twenty years older than you are louise i began surely there wasnt ever anything between you you knowanything like that no no there wasnt ellie honestly i believed her she was quite frank about it and obviously as puzzled as i was he did speak to papa once about me when i was a kid asked for me formally you know as they still did round here at that time i never heard what the old man said but he never minced words did he all i can remember is that i was kept downstairs out of sight for a bit and after that mama treated me as if id been up to something but i hadnt even spoken to the man he wasnt a person a young girl would notice was he that was years ago though i suppose adelbert could have remembered it all that time but its not reasonable is it thats the one thing it certainly isnt i told her next time ill be the witness adelbert would enjoy that louise said grimly i dont know that i wont hold you to it you ought to see him we let the subject drop but i couldnt get it out of my mind i could see them both from behind the curtains in my shop window and it seemed that whenever i looked out there was the tightlipped silent woman scraping every farthing and there was the fat man watching her from his doorway across the street a secret satisfaction on his sallow face in the end it got on my nerves and when that happens i have to talk i cant help it there was no one in the street i dared to gossip with but i did mention the tale to a customer she was a woman named mrs marten whom id particularly liked ever since shed come in to inquire after the first dress i ever put in my shop window i made most of her clothes and she had recommended me to one or two ladies in the district where she lived which was up at hampstead nice and far away from soho i was fitting her one day when she happened to say something about men and the things theyll stoop to if their pride has been hurt and before id realized what i was doing id come out with the story louise had told me i didnt mention names of course but i may have conveyed that it was all taking place in this street mrs marten was a nice gentle little soul with a sweet face and she was shocked but how awful she kept saying how perfectly awful to burn the money in front of her after shes worked so hard for it he must be quite insane and dangerous oh well i said hastily its his money by the time he does that and i dont suppose he destroys much of it only enough to upset my friend i was sorry id spoken i hadnt expected mrs marten to be quite so horrified it just shows you how other people live i finished and hoped shed drop the subject she didnt however the idea seemed to fascinate her even more than it had me i couldnt get her to leave it alone and she chattered about it all throughout the fitting then just as she was putting on her hat to leave she suddenly said miss kaye ive just had a thought my brotherinlaw is assistant commissioner at scotland yard he might be able to think of some way of stopping that dreadful man from torturing that poor little woman you told me about shall i mention it to him oh no please dont i exclaimed shed never forgive me theres nothing the police could do to help her i do hope youll forgive me for saying so madam but i do hope you wont do anything of the sort she seemed rather hurt but she gave me her word i had no faith in it naturally once a woman has considered talking about a thing its as good as done i was quite upset for a day or two because the last thing i wanted was to get involved but nothing happened and id just started to breathe easily again when i had to go down to vaughans the big wholesale trimmings house at the back of regents street i was coming out with my parcels when a man came up to me i knew he was a detective he was the type with a very short haircut a brown raincoat and that look of being in a settled job and yet not in anything particular he asked me to come along to his office and i couldnt refuse i realized hed been following me until i was far enough away from adelaide street where no one would have noticed him approach me he took me to his superior who was quite a nice old boy in his way on nobodys side but his own as is the way with the police but i got the impression that he was on the level which is more than some people are he introduced himself as detective inspector cumberland made me sit down and sent out for a cup of tea for me then he asked me about louise i got into a panic because when youre in business in adelaide street youre in business and the last thing you can afford to do is get into trouble with your neighbors i denied everything of course insisting that i hardly knew the woman cumberland wouldnt have that i must say he knew how to handle me he kept me going over and over my own affairs until i was thankful to speak about anything else in the end i gave way because after all nobody was doing anything criminal as far as i could see i told him all i knew letting him draw it out bit by bit and when id finished he laughed at me peering at me with little bright eyes under brows which were as thick as silver fox fur well he said theres nothing so terrible in all that is there no i said sulkily he made me feel like a fool he sighed and leaned back in his chair you run away and forget this little interview he told me but just so that you dont start imagining things let me point out something to you the police are in business too in a way in their own business that is and when an officer in my position gets an inquiry from higher up hes got to investigate it hasnt he he may well think that the crime of destroying currencydefacing the coin of the realm we call it is not very serious compared with some of the things hes got to deal with but all the same if hes asked about it hes got to make some sort of move and send in some sort of report then it can all beerfiled and forgotten cant it yes i agreed very relieved yes i suppose it can they showed me out and that seemed to be the end of it id had my lesson though and i never opened my lips again on the subject to anybody it quite put me off louise and for a time i avoided her i made excuses and didnt go in to eat with her however i could still see her through the window see her sitting at the cashiers desk and i could still see adelbert peering at her from his doorway for a month or two everything went on quietly then i heard that violettas boy had got tired of the restaurant business and had taken a job up north he had given the girl the chance of marrying and going with him and theyd gone almost without saying goodbye i was sorry for louise being left alone that way so i had to go and see her she was taking it very well actually she was pretty lucky for she had got a new waiter almost at once and her number one girl in the kitchen had stood by her and they managed very well louise was very lonely though so i drifted back into the habit of going in there for a meal once a week i paid of course but she used to come and have hers with me i kept her off the subject of adelbert but one day near the midsummers quarter day she referred to him outright and asked me straight if i remembered my promise to be witness on the next payday since violetta was gone shed mentioned me to adelbert and hed seemed pleased well i couldnt get out of it without hurting her feelings and since nothing seemed to turn on it i agreed i dont pretend i wasnt curious it was a love affair without so far as i could see any love at all the time for payment was fixed for half an hour after closing time on midsummers day and when i slipped down the street to the corner the blinds of le coq au vin were closed and the door shut the new waiter was taking a breath of air on the basement steps and he let me in through the kitchens i went up the dark service stairs and found the two of them already sitting there waiting for me the dining room was dark except for a single shaded bulb over the alcove table where they sat and i had a good look at them as i came down the room they made an extraordinary pair i dont know if youve seen one of those fat little chinese gods whom people keep on their mantel shelves to bring them luck they are all supposed to be laughing but some only pretend and the folds of their china faces are stiff and merciless for all the upward lines adelbert reminded me of one of those he always wore a black dinner jacket for work but it was very thin and very loose it came into my mind that when he took it off it must have hung like a gown he was sitting swathed in it looking squat and flabby against the white paneling of the wall louise on the other hand in her black dress and tight woolen cardigan was as spare and hard as a withered branch just for an instant i realized how furious she must make him there was nothing yielding or shrinking about her she wasnt giving any more than she was forced to not an inch i never saw anything so unbending in my life she stood up to him all the time there was a bottle of dubonnet on the table and they each had a small glass when i appeared louise poured one for me the whole performance was very formal although theyd both lived in london all their lives the french blood in both of them was very apparent they each shook hands with me and adelbert kicked the chair out for me if he only made a pretense of rising louise had the big bank envelope in her black bag which she nursed as if it was a pet and as soon as id taken a sip of my drink she produced the envelope and pushed it across the table to the man five hundred she said the receipt is in there already made out perhaps youd sign it please there was not a word out of place you see but you could have cut the atmosphere with a knife she hated him and he was getting his due and nothing else he sat looking at her for a moment with a steady fishy gaze he seemed to be waiting for something just a flicker of regret or resentment i suppose but he got nothing and presently he took the envelope between his sausage fingers and thumbed it open the five crisp green packages fell out on the white tablecloth i looked at them with interest as one does at money it wasnt a fortune of course but to people like myself and louise who have to earn every cent the hard way it was a tidy sum that represented hours of toil and scheming and selfprivation i didnt like the way the mans fingers played over it and the sneaking spark of sympathy id begun to feel for him died abruptly i knew then that if hed had his way and married her when she was little more than a child all those years ago he would have treated her abominably he was a cruel beast it took him that way i glanced at louise and saw that she was unmoved she just sat there with her hands folded waiting for her receipt adelbert began to count the money ive always admired the way tellers in banks handle notes but the way adelbert did it opened my eyes he went through them the way a gambler goes through a pack of cards as if each individual note were alive and part of his hand he loved the stuff you could see it all correct he said at last and put the bundles in his inside pocket then he signed the receipt and handed it to her louise took it and put it in her bag i assumed that was the end of it and wondered what all the fuss was about i raised my glass to louise who acknowledged it and was getting up when adelbert stopped me wait he said we must have a cigarette and perhaps another little glass if louise can afford it he smiled but she didnt she poured him another glass and sat there stolidly waiting for him to drink it he was in no hurry presently he took the money out again and laid a fat hand over it as he passed his cigarette case round i took a cigarette louise didnt there was one of those metal match stands on the table and he bent forward i moved too expecting him to give me a light but he laughed and drew back this gives it a better flavor he said and peeling off one note from the top wad he lit it and offered me the flame i had guessed what was coming so i didnt show my surprise if louise could keep a poker face so could i i watched the banknote burn out and then he took another and lit that having failed to move us he started to talk he spoke quite normally about the restaurant business how hard times were and what a lot of work it meant getting up at dawn to go to the market with the chef and how customers liked to keep one up late at night talking and dawdling as if there was never going to be a tomorrow it was all directed at louise rubbing it in holding her nose down to exactly what he was doing but she remained perfectly impassive her eyes dark like lead her mouth hard when that failed he got more personal he said he remembered us both when we were girls and how work and worry had changed us i was nettled but not too upset for it soon became quite obvious that he did not remember me at all with louise it was different he remembered her every detail and with something added your hair was like gold he said and your eyes were blue as glass and you had a little soft wide mouth which was so gay where is it now eh here he patted the money the old brute all here louise i am a psychologist i see these things and what is it worth to me nothing exactly nothing he was turning me cold i stared at him fascinated and saw him suddenly take up a whole package of money and fluff it out until it looked like a lettuce louise neither blinked nor spoke she sat looking at him as if he was nothing a passerby in the street no one at all id turned my head to glance at her and missed seeing him strike another match so when he lit the crisp leaves it took me completely off guard look out i said involuntarily mind what youre doing he laughed like a wicked child triumphant and delighted what about you louise what do you say she continued to look bored and they sat there facing one another squarely meantime of course the money was blazing the whole thing meant nothing to me perhaps that is why it was my control which snapped anyway i knocked the cash out of his hand with a sudden movement i sent the whole hundred notes flying out of his grasp all over the place they went on the floor the table everywhere the room was alight with blazing banknotes he went after them like a lunatic you wouldnt have thought a man that fat could have moved so fast it was the one that laddered my stocking which gave the game away a spark burned the nylon and as i felt it i looked down and snatched the charred note holding it up to the light we all saw the flaw in it at the same moment the ink had run and there was a great streak through the middle like the veining in a marble slab there was a long silence and the first sound came not from us but from the service door it opened and the new waiter looking quite different now that hed changed his coat for one with a policemans badge on it came down the room followed by inspector cumberland they went up to adelbert and the younger heavier man put a hand on his shoulder cumberland ignored everything but the money he stamped out the smoldering flames and gathered up the remains and the four untouched wads on the table then he smiled briefly got you adelbert with it on you weve been wondering who was passing slush in this street and when it came to our ears that someone was burning cash we thought we ought to look into it i was still only half comprehending and i held out the note wed been staring at theres something wrong with this one i said stupidly he took it from me and grunted theres something wrong with all these my dear miss frosn√©s money is safe in his pocket where you saw him put it these are some of the gangs failures every maker of counterfeit money has them as a rule they never leave the printing room this one in particular is a shocker i wonder he risked it even for burning you didnt like wasting it i suppose adelbert what a careful soul you are how did you find out louise looked from them to me cumberland saved me a policeman too madam he said laughing can be a psychologist a nice place to stay nedra tyre nedra pronounced needra tyre a native of georgia was the author of a halfdozen mystery novels between and and about forty short stories for ellery queens mystery magazine and other publications a specialist in smalltown southern backgrounds she won critical acclaim in

background as a social worker and anticipated the later trend toward regionalism in american mysteries tyre was living in richmond virginia when she told contemporary authors volume ive worked in offices been a social worker library assistant clerk in a book department done copy in an advertising agency and taught sociology ive done everything and it seems to me ive never made even minimum wage life is real and life is earnest but most of all its ridiculous now i am a staff writer in an agency that gives financial assistance to desperately poor children in twentyfive countries for the last four years i have been totally deaf its amazingly interesting to be deaf although its awkward socially politically i am what would be called a liberal and religiously i am a protestant with a small p almost everything defeats me and everything amazes me tyres social work background as well as the world view expressed above informs a nice place to stay with its deep understanding of the psychology of poverty all my life ive wanted a nice place to stay i dont mean anything grand just a small room with the walls freshly painted and a few neat pieces of furniture and a window to catch the sun so that two or three pot plants could grow thats what ive always dreamed of i didnt yearn for love or money or nice clothes though i was a pretty enough girl and pretty clothes would have made me prettier not that i mean to brag things fell on my shoulders when i was fifteen that was when mama took sick and keeping house and looking after papa and my two older brothers and of course nursing mama became my responsibility not long after that papa lost the farm and we moved to town i dont like to think of the house we lived in near the c r railroad tracks though i guess we were lucky to have a roof over our heads it was the worst days of the depression and a lot of people didnt even have a roof even one that leaked plink plonk in a heavy rain there werent enough pots and pans and vegetable bowls to set around to catch all the water mama was the sick one but it was papa who died first living in town didnt suit him by then my brothers had married and mama and i moved into two back rooms that looked onto an alley and everybodys garbage cans and dump heaps my brothers pitched in and gave me enough every month for mamas and my barest expenses even though their wives grumbled and complained i tried to make mama comfortable i catered to her every whim and fancy i loved her all the same i had another reason to keep her alive as long as possible while she breathed i knew i had a place to stay i was terrified of what would happen to me when mama died i had no high school diploma and no experience at outside work and i knew my sistersinlaw wouldnt take me in or let my brothers support me once mama was gone then mama drew her last breath with a smile of thanks on her face for what i had done sure enough norine and thelma my brothers wives put their feet down i was on my own from then on so that scared feeling of wondering where i could lay my head took over in my mind and never left me i had some respite when mr williams a widower twentyfour years older than me asked me to marry him i took my vows seriously i meant to cherish him and i did but that house we lived in those walls couldnt have been dirtier if theyd been smeared with soot and the plumbing was stubborn as a mule my left foot stayed sore from having to kick the pipe underneath the kitchen sink to get the water to run through then mr williams got sick and had to give up his shoe repair shop that he ran all by himself he had a small savings account and a few of those twentyfivedollar government bonds and drew some disability insurance until the policy ran out in something like six months i did everything i could to make him comfortable and keep him cheerful though i did all the laundry i gave him clean sheets and clean pajamas every third day and i think it was by my will power alone that i made a begonia bloom in that dark back room mr williams stayed in i even pestered his two daughters and told them they ought to send their father some getwell cards and they did once or twice every now and then when there were a few pennies extra id buy cards and scrawl signatures nobody could have read and mailed them to mr williams to make him think some of his former customers were remembering him and wishing him well of course when mr williams died his daughters were johnnyonthespot to see that they got their share of the little bit that tumbledown house brought i didnt begrudge them im not one to argue with human nature i hate to think about all those hardships i had after mr williams died the worst of it was finding somewhere to sleep it all boiled down to having a place to stay because somehow you can manage not to starve there are garbage cans to dip into youd be surprised how wasteful some people are and how much good food they throw away or if it was right after the garbage trucks had made their collections and the cans were empty id go into a supermarket and pick say at the cherries pretending i was selecting some to buy i didnt slip their best ones into my mouth id take either those so ripe that they should have been thrown away or those that werent ripe enough and shouldnt have been put out for people to buy i might snitch a withered cabbage leaf or a few pieces of watercress or a few of those small round tomatoes about the size of hickory nuts i never can remember their right name i wouldnt make a pig of myself just eat enough to ease my hunger so i managed as i say you dont have to starve the only work i could get hardly ever paid me anything beyond room and board i wasnt a practical nurse though i knew how to take care of sick folks and the people hiring me would say that since i didnt have the training and qualifications i couldnt expect much all they really wanted was for someone to spend the night with aunt myrtle or cousin kate or mama or daddy no actual duties were demanded of me they said and they really didnt think my help was worth anything except meals and a place to sleep the arrangements were pretty makeshift half the time i wouldnt have a place to keep my things not that i had any clothes to speak of and sometimes id sleep on a cot in the hall outside the patients room or on some sort of contrived bed in the patients room i cherished every one of those sick people just as i had cherished mama and mr williams i didnt want them to die i did everything i knew to let them know i was interested in their welfare first for their sakes and then for mine so i wouldnt have to go out and find another place to stay well now ive made out my case for the defense a term i never thought id have to use personally so now ill make out the case for the prosecution i stole i dont like to say it but i was a thief im not lightfingered i didnt want a thing that belonged to anybody else but there came a time when i felt forced to steal i had to have some things my shoes fell apart i needed some stockings and underclothes and when id ask a son or a daughter or a cousin or a niece for a little money for those necessities they acted as if i was trying to blackmail them they reminded me that i wasnt qualified as a practical nurse that i might even get into trouble with the authorities if they found i was palming myself off as a practical nurse which i wasnt and they knew it anyway they said that their terms were only bed and board so i began to take things small things that had been pushed into the backs of drawers or stored high on shelves in boxes things that hadnt been used or worn for years and probably would never be used again i made my biggest haul at mrs bicks where there was an attic full of trunks stuffed with clothes and doodads from the twenties all the way back to the nineties uniforms ostrich fans spanish shawls beaded bags i sneaked out a few of these at a time and every so often sold them to a place called way out hippie clothiers i tried to work out the exact amount i got for selling something not i know that you can make up for theft but say i got a dollar for a feather boa belonging to mrs bick well then id come back and work at a job that the cleaning woman kept putting off like waxing the hall upstairs or polishing the andirons or getting the linen closet in order all the same i was stealing not everywhere i stayed not even in most places but when i had to i stole i admit it but i didnt steal that silver box i was as innocent as a baby where that box was concerned so when that policeman came toward me grabbing at the box i stepped aside and maybe i even gave him the push that sent him to his death he had no business acting like that when that box was mine whatever mrs crowes niece argued fifty thousand nieces couldnt have made it not mine anyway the policeman was dead and though i hadnt wanted him dead i certainly hadnt wished him well and then i got to thinking well i didnt steal mrs crowes box but i had stolen other things and it was the mills of god grinding exceeding fine as i once heard a preacher say and i was being made to pay for the transgressions that had caught up with me surely i can make a little more sense out of what happened than that though i never was exactly clear in my own mind about everything that happened mrs crowe was the most appreciative person i ever worked for she was bedridden and could barely move i dont think the registered nurse on daytime duty considered it part of her job to massage mrs crowe so at night i would massage her and that pleased and soothed her she thanked me for every small thing i did when i fluffed her pillow when id put a few drops of perfume on her earlobes when id straighten the wrinkled bedcovers i had a little joke id pretend i could tell fortunes and id take mrs crowes hand and tell her she was going to have a wonderful day but she must beware of a handsome blond stranger or some such foolishness that would make her laugh she didnt sleep well and it seemed to give her pleasure to talk to me most of the night about her childhood or her dead husband she kept getting weaker and weaker and two nights before she died she said she wished she could do something for me but that when she became an invalid she had signed over everything to her niece anyway mrs crowe hoped id take her silver box i thanked her it pleased me that she liked me well enough to give me the box i didnt have any real use for it it would have made a nice trinket box but i didnt have any trinkets the box seemed to be mrs crowes fondest possession she kept it on the table beside her and her eyes lighted up every time she looked at it she might have been a little girl first seeing a brandnew baby doll early on a christmas morning so when mrs crowe died and the niece on whom i set eyes for the first time dismissed me i gathered up what little i had and took the box and left i didnt go to mrs crowes funeral the paper said it was private and i wasnt invited anyway i wouldnt have had anything suitable to wear i still had a few dollars left over from those things id sold to the hippie place called way out so i paid a weeks rent for a room that was the worst id ever stayed in it was freezing cold and no heat came up to the third floor where i was in that room with falling plaster and buckling floorboards and darting roaches i sat wearing every stitch i owned with a sleazy blanket and a faded quilt draped around me waiting for the heat to rise when in swept mrs crowes niece in a fur coat and a fur hat and shiny leather boots up to her knees her face was beet red from anger when she started telling me that she had traced me through a private detective and i was to give her back the heirloom i had stolen her statement made me forget the precious little bit i knew of the english language i couldnt say a word and she kept on screaming that if i returned the box immediately no criminal charge would be made against me then i got back my voice and i said that box was mine and that mrs crowe had wanted me to have it and she asked if i had any proof or if there were any witnesses to the gift and i told her that when i was given a present i said thank you that i didnt ask for proof and witnesses and that nothing could make me part with mrs crowes box the niece stood there breathing hard in and out almost counting her breaths like somebody doing an exercise to get control of herself youll see she yelled and then she left the room was colder than ever and my teeth chattered not long afterward i heard heavy steps clumping up the stairway i realized that the niece had carried out her threat and that the police were after me i was panicstricken i chased around the room like a rat with a cat after it then i thought that if the police searched my room and couldnt find the box it might give me time to decide what to do i grabbed the box out of the top dresser drawer and scurried down the back hall i snatched the back door open i think what i intended to do was run down the back steps and hide the box somewhere underneath a bush or maybe in a garbage can those back steps were steep and rose almost straight up for three stories and they were flimsy and covered with ice i started down my right foot slipped the handrail saved me i clung to it with one hand and to the silver box with the other hand and picked and chose my way across the patches of ice when i was midway i heard my name shrieked i looked around to see a big man leaping down the steps after me i never saw such anger on a persons face then he was directly behind me and reached out to snatch the box i swerved to escape his grasp and he cursed me maybe i pushed him im not sure not really anyway he slipped and fell down and down and down and then after all that falling he was absolutely still the bottom step was beneath his head like a pillow and the rest of his body was spreadeagled on the brick walk the almost like a pet that wants to follow its master the silver box jumped from my hand and bounced down the steps to land beside the mans left ear my brain was numb i felt paralyzed then i screamed tenants from that house and the houses next door and across the alley pushed windows open and flung doors open to see what the commotion was about and then some of them began to run toward the back yard the policeman who was the dead mans partner i guess youd call him that ordered them to keep away after a while more police came and they took the dead mans body and drove me to the station where i was locked up from the very beginning i didnt take to that young lawyer they assigned to me there wasnt anything exactly that i could put my finger on i just felt uneasy with him his last name was stanton he had a first name of course but he didnt tell me what it was he said he wanted me to call him bat like all his friends did he was always smiling and reassuring me when there wasnt anything to smile or be reassured about and he ought to have known it all along instead of filling me with false hope all i could think was that i was thankful mama and papa and mr williams were dead and that my shame wouldnt bring shame on them its going to be all right the lawyer kept saying right up to the end and then he claimed to be indignant when i was found guilty of resisting arrest and of manslaughter and theft or robbery there was the biggest hullabaloo as to whether i was guilty of theft or robbery not that i was guilty of either at least in this particular instance but no one would believe me you would have thought it was the lawyer being sentenced instead of me the way he carried on he called it a terrible miscarriage of justice and said we might as well be back in the eighteenth century when they hanged children well that was an exaggeration if ever there was one nobody was being hanged and nobody was a child that policeman had died and i had had a part in it maybe i had pushed him i couldnt be sure in my heart i really hadnt meant him any harm i was just scared but he was dead all the same and as far as stealing went i hadnt stolen the box but i had stolen other things more than once and then it happened it was a miracle all my life id dreamed of a nice room of my own a comfortable place to stay and thats exactly what i got the room was on the small side but it had everything i needed in it even a wash basin with hot and cold running water and the walls were freshly painted and they let me choose whether i wanted a wing chair with a chintz slipcover or a modern danish armchair i even got to decide what color bedspread i preferred the window looked out on a beautiful lawn edged with shrubbery and the matron said id be allowed to go to the greenhouse and select some pot plants to keep in my room the next day i picked out a white gloxinia and some russet chrysanthemums i didnt mind the bars at the windows at all why this day and age some of the finest mansions have barred windows to keep burglars out the meals i simply couldnt believe there was such delicious food in the world the woman who supervised their preparation had embezzled the funds of one of the largest catering companies in the state after working herself up from assistant cook to treasurer the other inmates were very friendly and most of them had led the most interesting lives some of the ladies occasionally used words that you usually see written only on fences or printed on sidewalks before the cement dries but when they were scolded they apologized every now and then somebody would get angry with someone and there would be a little scratching or hair pulling but it never got too bad there was a choir i cant sing but i love music and they gave a concert every tuesday morning at chapel and thursday night was movie night there wasnt any admission charge all you did was go in and sit down anywhere you pleased we all had a special job and i was assigned to the infirmary the doctor and nurse both complimented me the doctor said that i should have gone into professional nursing that i gave confidence to the patients and helped them get well i dont know about that but ive had years of practice with sick people and i like to help anybody who feels bad i was so happy that sometimes i couldnt sleep at night id get up and click on the light and look at the furniture and the walls it was hard to believe i had such a pleasant place to stay id remember supper that night how id gone back to the steam table for a second helping of asparagus with lemon and herb sauce and i compared my plenty with those terrible times when i had slunk into supermarkets and nibbled overripe fruit and raw vegetables to ease my hunger then one day here came that lawyer not even at regular visiting hours bouncing around congratulating me that my appeal had been upheld or whatever the term was and that i was as free as a bird to leave right that minute he told the matron she could send my belongings later and he dragged me out front where tv cameras and newspaper reporters were waiting as soon as the cameras began whirring and the photographers began to aim the lawyer kissed me on the cheek and pinned a flower on me he made a speech saying that a terrible miscarriage of justice had been rectified he had located people who testified that mrs crowe had given me the box she had told the gardener and the cleaning woman they hadnt wanted to testify because they didnt want to get mixed up with the police but the lawyer had persuaded them in the cause of justice and humanity to come forward and make statements the lawyer had also looked into the personnel record of the dead policeman and had learned that he had been judged emotionally unfit for his job and the psychiatrist had warned the chief of police that something awful might happen either to the man himself or to a suspect unless he was relieved of his duties all the time the lawyer was talking into the microphones he had latched onto me like i was a threeyearold that might run away and i just stood and stared then when he had finished his speech about me the reporters told him that like his grandfather and his uncle he was sure to end up as governor but at a much earlier age at that the lawyer gave a big grin in front of the camera and waved goodbye and pushed me into his car i was terrified the nice place id found to stay in wasnt mine any longer my old nightmare was back wondering how i could manage to eat and how much stealing id have to do to live from one day to the next the cameras and reporters had followed us a photographer asked me to turn down the car window beside me and i overheard two men way in the back of the crowd talking my ears are sharp papa always said i could hear thunder three states away above the congratulations and bubbly talk around me i heard one of those men in back say this is a bit too much dont you think our bat is showing himself the champion of the senior citizen now hes already copped the teenyboppers and the under thirties using methods that ought to have disbarred him he should have made the gardener and cleaning woman testify at the beginning and from the first he should have checked into the policemans history there ought never to have been a case at all much less a conviction but bat wouldnt have got any publicity that way he had to do it in his own devious spectacular fashion the other man just kept nodding and saying after every sentence youre damned right then we drove off and i didnt dare look behind me because i was so heartbroken over what i was leaving the lawyer took me to his office he said he hoped i wouldnt mind a little excitement for the next few days he had mapped out some public appearances for me the next morning i was to be on an early television show there was nothing to be worried about he would be right beside me to help me just as he had helped me throughout my trouble all that i had to say on the tv program was that i owed my freedom to him i guess i looked startled or bewildered because he hurried on to say that i hadnt been able to pay him a fee but that now i was able to pay him back not in money but in letting the public know about how he was the champion of the underdog i said i had been told that the court furnished lawyers free of charge to people who couldnt pay and he said that was right but his point was that i could repay him now by telling people all that he had done for me then he said the main thing was to talk over our next appearance on tv he wanted to coach me in what i was going to say but first he would go into his partners office and tell him to take all the incoming calls and handle the rest of his appointments when the door closed after him i thought that he was right i did owe my freedom to him he was to blame for it the smart alec the upstart who asked him to butt in and snatch me out of my pretty room and the work i loved and all that delicious food it was the first time in my life i knew what it meant to despise someone i hated him before when i was convicted of manslaughter there was a lot of talk about malice aforethought and premeditated crime there wouldnt be any argument this time i hadnt wanted any harm to come to that policeman but i did mean harm to come to this lawyer i grabbed up a letter opener from his desk and ran my finger along the blade and felt how sharp it was i waited behind the door and when he walked through i gathered all my strength and stabbed him again and again and again now im back where i want to be in a nice place to stay clever and quick christianna brand many aficionados of pure fairplay detection would echo the great critic anthony boucher in nominating the trio of john dickson carr ellery queen and agatha christie as their big three but there were other writers who if not quite as prolific could equal those three in their devotion to and talent for devious puzzle plotting one of these was the creator of inspector cockrill christianna brand born mary christianna milne of british parents in malaya brand lived in india during her childhood like many writers she held a variety of jobs in her early life including governess model and dancer her experience working as a salesperson in a fashion house inspired her first novel death in high heels brand showed she could construct puzzles with the best of them in novels like green for danger memorably filmed with alistair sim and tour de force by her own account she was equally scrupulous about polishing her style and deploying her clues seeking to bamboozle the reader while observing absolute fair play at various times in her career she departed from pure detection to produce a speculation on the marie celeste mystery the honey harlot childrens books danger unlimited and a threebook series beginning with nurse matilda a factcrime account heaven knows who and pseudonymous mainstream novels but crime fiction remained her main interest a beloved figure at mystery conventions late in her life she is remembered in the field for her personality as much as for her writing in introducing her shortstory collection buffet for unwelcome guests robert e briney recalls her speaking style the topics and anecdotes varied though some of them had to be reprised by popular demand the story of dorothy l sayers and the blood in the stairwell has become a wordofmouth classic but the audience reaction was always the same listeners were delighted by the sharp verbal portraits they listened intently whenever a serious note was introduced they anticipated exactly as much of a storys trend as they were intended to and responded with appreciative chagrin when the punchline turned out to be other than what they had been induced to expect in fact they reacted much as readers of christianna brands fiction have been doing for some forty years in the shortstory form brand specialized less in pure detection than in the twistupontwist doubleortriplecross crime story of which clever and quick is a prime example you had to keep up appearances so the apartment was very showy everything phony right down to the massive brass fender in front of the electric fire but keeping up appearances was one thing and keeping up the payments was another and with the theater as it was these days both of them had been resting for a long long time so the fact was that they really ought to let trudi go trudi was the au pair girl and for different reasons neither one wanted her to go they were having a row about it now standing in front of the fireplace they had a row on an average of once an hour these days nag nag bloody nag colette was driving raymond out of his mind and now this thing about trudi if he secretly somehow made up trudis pay he suggested try offering her a bit less for the work you try offering her a bit less for the pleasure said colette it touched him as ever on the raw are you suggesting raymond that girl thinks of nothing but money and you know it yes he knew it and with the knowledge his heart grew chill if a time came when he could no longer give trudi presents he was mad about her a little sharpeyed shrewfaced mitteleuropean and yet here he was caught crazy for her helpless in the grip of her greedy little claws he raymond gray who all his life had been on stage and off irresistible to women now caught in the toils of a woman himself if i were slipping a bit he said to himself if my profile were going if my hair and my teeth werent so perfect as once they were but he was wearing marvelously well why even that drooling old monster in the opposite apartment she was not a monster though she was a big woman and having once been something of an athlete now found all the fine muscle running to flabby white fat but drooling she was disgusting she thought out of her mind a fat ugly aging widow sitting here drooling over a hasbeen matinee idol not much more than half my age but as he was caught and helpless so was she caught and helpless sitting there like a silly schoolgirl yearning only to pop out to her balcony and see if through his window she could catch a glimpse of him from her room she could not see into his the apartments were not in fact opposite each other but across a corner at the same level but she dared not venture forth the plane trees in the street just below were in full pollination and if she so much as poked out her nose her allergy would blow up sky high and even just passing in the corridor going up and down the elevator he mustnt see her with streaming red eyes and nose she spent a good deal of time in the corridors and the elevator oh raymond she would cry fancy running into you again she had long ago scraped up an acquaintance and it was raymond colette and rosa between them now they were not unwilling her place was rich in champagne cocktails and dry martinis with lots of caviar on little triangles of toast she was loaded colette said so now cant you wangle something out of the old bitch over there shes loaded and if youd so much as kiss her hand shed chop it off and give it to you diamond rings and all her hand was like a frogs back all speckled with the greenybrown patches of aging skin all the same ill tell you something he said if you were out of the way damn nagging soandso that you are shed make me a ruddy millionaire i swear she would yes and where would your precious trudi be then because said colette nastily i dont think dear rosa would put up with very much of that little load of fancy tripe dont you call trudi names he shouted ill call her what she is im entitled to that much surely she had a vile mind a vile mind and a foul mouth to express what was in it it flashed across him in a moment of hazy light redstreaked that once he had loved her never dreaming that behind the fa√ßade lay this creature of venom and dirt never dreaming that one day he would stand here with upraised hand would lunge forward and strike out at her would have it in his mind to silence her forever but his hand did not touch her she stepped back and away from him tripped over the rug on the polished floor before the fireplace fell heavily almost violently throwing herself back and out of his reach a brief shriek arms flailing a sickening scrunch as the base of her skull hit the rounded knob of the heavy brass fender and suddenly stillness he knew she was dead trudi stood in the doorway then moved forward to him slowly she said is all right i saw you did not touch her and she fumbled for the english word was accident she came close beside him staring down but she is dead she said she was dead he had not touched her it had been an accident but she was dead and he was free it took him a little while to accept that trudi was not going to tie up her life with an outofwork hasbeen actor free or not free but darrleeng you know that your money is all gone soon i must anyway leave mrs gray she has told me so and since mrs gray was lying there dead on the floor and could not contradict she improvised a hurried tally of the debts already owing to her and this i must have raymond soon i go home if i have no more a job here to be free to be free to marry her and now to lose her he pleaded dont you love me at all but of course only how can we marry darrleeng if you have no money to live so this money i must have to go home you cant go yet anyway youll have to stand by me about her he had almost forgotten the poor dead thing lying there ungainly at their feet youll have to give evidence for me she shrugged of course was accident but then i go home leaving me here like this trudi i have no wife now no money the little shrug again so endearing to his infatuated heart half comic half rueful the wag of the pretty little head toward the window across the corner as to wife as to money over there plenty both he said quickly then i should be rich so you and i but she said as a few minutes earlier colette had said i dont think mrs rosa fox puts up with nonsense i think she suddenly pulls the moneybags tight did the idea come to him all in a flash as it seemed at the time or was there an interval while he thought while he stood over his wifes dead body and carefully deliberately thought it all through to the end all he knew afterward was that suddenly he had trudi by the arm was talking to her urgently pulling her to kneel down beside as very delicately he scraped from the round brass knob of the fender a fleck of the blood so rapidly congealing there smearing it over the round brass knob of the poker the knob identical in size covering the smears with his own hand and finally he threw the poker back into the fireplace now trudi slip out dont let anyone see you buy something somewhere come back right away and this time let the porter see you he did not look back as he scrambled to his feet at the still sprawled body he had not even that moment to spend on the past the future was now ahead of him only he prayed as he furtively slid out into the corridor let rosa be in and let her be alone she was in and alone she was always in and alone these days flopped in an armchair dreaming like an adolescent girl of her hopeless her helpless love a woman of my age she thought sitting here mooning over another womans husband but shed been quite a gal in her day and widowed a long long time now she said raymond how lovely and at once but whats the matter my dear are you ill rosa he said you must help me and he fell on his knees before her grabbing at her skirt with shuddering hands really with all that talent it was quite extraordinary that he couldnt get more work he threw a hoarse quaver into his voice ive killed her he said she stepped back and away from him killed her colette ive killed her she went on and on she said horrible things about about you rosa she thinks you she always said that you rosa i know youve liked me i love you she said simply but she took a deep deep breath while the future spread out before her as earlier his own had opened out to him his wife was dead and he was free he pretended amazement at her answer amazement and gratitude but he was too clever to claim immediately a return of her feeling he came at last to the point then even more rosa may i dare to ask you what i was going to i am throwing myself on your mercy just praying that out of friendship you will help me and now if you really mean that you and he went with her to the sofa and sat there gripping her hands and poured it all out to her she was being so vile she had well shes dead but colette had a filthy mind rosa shed been going on like this for weeks and suddenly i couldnt stand it any more i saw red ii picked up the poker i didnt mean to harm her honestly i swear it just to frighten her but when i came to myself again and he prayed oh my god please try to understand you did this because she was saying foul things about me youve always been so nice to us rosa it just made me sick her talking like that sneering and jeering and he poured it all out again living through the scene only substituting her name for trudis her big plain face went first white then scarlet then white again she held tightly to his hand what do you want me to do rosa i thought very quickly i do think quickly when im in a spot it seems awful now her lying there dead and me just thinking of myself trying to fight my way out of it but thats what i did and then i knelt down and well there are two brass knobs on the fender exactly like the one on the poker and ii moved her head so that it looked as though shed hit it against one of the fender knobs and then i cleaned all the the blood and stuff off the poker she was a clever woman quick and clever the body might have slowed down the body that once had been so strong and under control but the mind was still clever and quick an accident she said yes but people knew we were always quarreling trudi must have known it of course they could say id pushed her givenher a shove he gave her a sick look that was not too difficult to assume at the least manslaughter he said clever and quick you want me to say that i saw what happened that you didnt hit her my god he said youre marvelous yes you could say you saw it all through the window saw me standing there talking to her say frankly that we seemed to be arguing make it look as though youre not too much on my side just a casual neighbor and then theres a rug there you know it very silky and slippery you skidded on it once yourself remember perfectly possible for her to have taken a backward step slipped and fallen backward and of course that would be all youd know you cant see down to the floor of our room even from your balcony but id have to say i was out on the balcony i cant see your window from in here he had thought that out too your balconys only overlooked by two flats and all those people will have been out i know them no one could say that you werent there all right she said youll do it for me of course but what about that girl that little trollop whatever her name is the au pair he could hardly keep the stiffness from his voice but he controled himself out shopping thank god and thank god also that rosa couldnt in fact have been on the balcony looking in seeing trudi there in the room with him he knew all about the allergy and one glance at her face confirmed it rosa hadnt been out well go back now you must call a doctor quick and say nothing about me just tell your story dont seem even to think of bringing me into it theyll be round here soon enough asking if i saw anything now times passing you really must go he started for the door but suddenly he paused rosa he had assumed a look of shame but over the shame a flush of exultancy rosa its awful to have even thought of it but suddenly its come to me a trial for murder you know how things are in the theatrical business you know how things have been with me lately but if i were suddenly in the news accused of murder standing there at the old bailey headlines in all the papers a cause c√©l√®bre and then the dramatic intervention the witness whod seen it all the lastminute evidence he stood before her half shamefaced half pleading rosa why didnt i give evidence before theyd never even have charged you if id spoken at once well thats the point i must get myself arrested and tried youd have to say you hadnt realized you didnt want to get mixed up in it but then of course the moment you heard i was accused even so you wouldnt get further than the first hearing whatever its called no publicity in that you couldnt just be abroad for a little while out of touch she opened her mouth to say that none of it mattered hed never need to work again but she held her peace he was an actor actors needed to work they had to express themselves leave it all to me ill handle it she said the earlier headlines were not too bad though hardly sensational and then came the long dull period before the trial opened however at last the day himself in the dock very pale very handsome the police in the witness box accused stated a flippedover page in a notebook accused stated oh my god this is awful i must have hit out at her i must have had a blackout she was nag nag nag at me the whole bloody time because i wasnt getting work but i never meant to harm her i swear i did not and the forensic evidence on the head of the poker i found a small smear of blood the smear had been consistent with the blood of the dead woman with having come there at the time of her death tests showed that the accused had handled the poker after the blood came there yes consistent with his having attempted to remove marks of blood with the palm of his hand missing the one small smear the blade of the poker appeared to have been wiped it showed no fingerprints in reply to defense counsel yes it was true that the blade of a poker would not be much handled in the ordinary way and the wiping might well have been simply the previous routine cleaning the doctor testified that the woman had been dead between half an hour and an hour when he saw her trudi in the box for the defense shrewd and cool had arrived back from the shoppings to find mr gray on his knees beside the body had had almost to lift him to his feet yes he might very well have touched the poker with his hand made bloody by his examination of the wound his arms were all over the place as she hauled him up she had tried to get him calm wanted to call a doctor but did not know the number of him and mr gray seemed so dazed she could get no sense from him and anyway what was the hurry said trudi with one of her shrugs anybody could see that madame was dead and so at last to rosa fox she had with extraordinary dedication deliberately shed all aids to such doubtful charms as she possessed stripped off the jewelry dressed herself drably sacrificed the cosmetics which ordinarily to some extent at least disguised the ravages of her age not for one moment could anyone suspect that here stood a woman with whom the prisoner could ever have had the slightest rapport into the agreed routine the casual acquaintance the occasional drink together the question of the police directly after the accident agreed she had previously insisted she had seen nothing she had been unwell under great private tensions wanted only to get abroad to a health spa where she had been ever since she hadnt wished to become involved never dreamed of course that there could possibly be any charge against mr gray knowing as she did with absolute certainly that the thing had been entirely an accident because in fact she had actually seen it happen from my balcony you can look straight into their room i glanced over and saw them standing there they seemed to be having an argument he said something angry she jerked away from him as though he had raised his hand against her mrs fox had he anything in his hand in his hand oh the poker you mean no nothing no poker or anything and anyway he never raised his hand he never raised his hand you can swear to that the judge from the bench said solemnly mr tree she is swearing to that she is swearing to everything she says she is under oath well i could see it all quite clearly and i certainly can swear well i mean i am absolutely sure he never raised his hand at all he said something she stepped back and then she seemed to trip and topple over backwards i thought to myself oh shes skidded on that rug of theirs i know that rug very treacherous it is on the parquet floor i nearly slipped on it once myself well and then i went back into my room and thought no more about it it didnt occur to you that she might have injured herself i thought she might have banged her head or something but of course no more than that as i say id slipped there myself and been none the worse for it and she made a little face and admitted that if the lady had collected a couple of bruises it would have been no more than she deserved i think she nagged him but of course i didnt know them well headlines yes but not much really and often not even on the center pages let alone the front page but there was a big picture of him planned for sunday with an interview celebrating a glass of champagne raised to the neighbor whose testimony had confirmed his innocence not perhaps in the best of taste the picture taken right there in front of the fireplace where his wife had died but it wasnt a bestoftaste newspaper and one settled for what one could get and the reporters withdrew and at last they were alone in his apartment she held out her hands to him well raymond she looked about a hundred years old standing there before him the sagging face devoid of its makeup the ugly dull dress the droopy hairdo the mottled hands without their customary diamond flash she revolted him well rosa you did a beautiful job she did not hear the chill in his voice or did not believe it she said softly and one day soon shall i collect my reward reward he said after all my darling i have perjured myself for you yes so you have havent you he said now the unpowdered skin took on a strange ashen color and her eyes grew frightened and sick raymond what do you mean i mean that you perjured yourself as you say and you know perhaps what happens to perjurers a clever woman quick and clever but still she insisted i dont understand i need money rosa he said money but if we were married he moved aside so that she looked over his shoulder and into the mirror above the fireplace he said you and i married she looked long long at her pitiful reflection she said at last is this blackmail wasnt it blackmail when you thought that by saving me from prison you could force me to marry you yes she said i think perhaps it was and she thought to herself that now she was beaten at her own game if you give me away she said youll have to admit you murdered her in fact i didnt murder her i can say it happened almost exactly as you said in court very well then she said swiftly i can change my story who can prove that i didnt see you murder her i can prove that you didnt see it you couldnt have been out on your balcony the plane trees were pollinating and anyone will confirm to the police what happens if you so much as open a window when the pollens flying about but when they first saw you you showed no traces of any allergic reaction i know because id just seen you myself besides they couldnt touch me ive been put in peril as they say autre fois acquit is the legal name for it once acquitted i cant be tried again for the same crime i could shout from the housetops that id killed her and still be safe and live with that reputation well of course i wouldnt say id been guilty which anyway as i keep telling you i wasnt id still claim it had been an accident but you would be in the soup i see she pondered it long and carefully still staring but unseeingly now at her sad reflection in the glass you thought all this out from the very first didnt you in detail from the very first quite a nice little bit of opportunism he suggested proud of it all that about the publicity the blood deliberately smeared on the poker yes i see you had to give them something you had to get yourself accused and charged you had to be tried and acquitted before it was safe to accuse me two purposes to my perjury first to supply the evidence that would set you free and second to make me vulnerable to blackmail she said almost curiously almost as though she were humbled for him rather than for herself did you never even like me i didnt mind you he said indifferently but as for marrying you i think im a trifle more particular than that and he picked up her handbag helped himself to the thick wad of banknotes there stuffed them loosely into his wallet tucked the wallet away just a very very small beginning my dear he said i wont even ask how much youre demanding youll be back again and again and again of course wont you but by way of a start make it ten thousand he said you can get that much quickly he smiled at her with cruel and ugly triumph and i need it quickly for my honeymoon he said clever and quick clever not even to have to ask the name to have summed it all up in one bright intuitive flash and quick the poker with its round brass knob lay there on the fender she snatched it up and struck trudi burst open the door darted forward from her listening post slowed then came smoothly the rest of the way and knelt beside him for what seemed a long long time they both stared down as only a few short months ago raymond gray himself had looked down at the dead body of his wife it was his turn now rosas fat white arms retained something it seemed of their once splendid muscle longago anatomical training had suggested the most susceptible spot the heavy ball of the poker had smashed to a cobweb of fractures raymonds delicate temple bone trudi moved with a small sick grimace she shifted raymonds head a little way so that the wound lay crushed against the round brass knob of the fender that rug she said getting up to her feet again always so dangerous fancy a second time just the same like the poor wife she grinned with brutal complacence into the heavy white face with its look of dead despair so lucky that this time i was present to see that it all was again just a terrible accident raymonds jacket had fallen open she stooped and with fastidious fingers picked out the wad of notes and stuffed them into her apron pocket just a verry verrry small beginning she quoted and took the poker out of rosas inert hand go back to your flat madame collapse upon your bed i see to everything then i make telephone to the doctor the trudi shrug this time i know the number of him rosa went back to her own apartment she did not however collapse upon her bed police she said holding the telephone receiver in a steady hand she gave raymond grays address youd better get over there quick ive just seen from my balcony the au pair girl going for him with a poker and this time no question of an accident she listened with a satisfied smile to a sharp voice cracking out orders the voice returned to her well i wouldnt know about that i cant see to the floor of the room the girl disappeared from sight for a bit and when she got up she was stuffing money into her apron pocket youll find it i daresay hidden somewhere in her room an affair going on you know even before the poor wife died and now i suppose he was refusing to marry her country lovers nadine gordimer nobel prize winner nadine gordimer b was born in the gold mining region of south africa the daughter of a jeweler receiving her early education at a convent she graduated from university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg like many writers she was solitary as a child out of school from the age of eleven to sixteen because of an apparently imaginary heart ailment her only companions her mother and her adult friends with no contact with other children first published at the age of fifteen she eventually contributed short stories to such major us markets as the new yorker harpers and mademoiselle her first story collection the soft voice of the serpent and other stories appeared in her first novel the lying days in her views on racial equality and her celebration of human variety which eventually led to outspoken opposition to her countrys apartheid policies she credited to her reading rather than any example from her apolitical parents she listed as one of her favorite writers j d salinger another specialist in depicting the societal outsider gordimer wrote critically of the south african regime in both fiction and nonfiction one of her novels burgers daughter was briefly banned in her home country a time magazine reviewer of her second novel a world of strangers as quoted in current biography yearbook wrote that gordimer not only tells the truth about her countrymen but she tells it so well that she has become at once their goad and their best writer surely her conscientious opposition along with that of other south african writers and thinkers was a factor in the eventual end of apartheid generally gordimer is not regarded even tangentially as a writer of crime fiction but country lovers a painfully real story that reflects her concern about her countrys policies while confronting some basic truths about racism certainly qualifies for the category the farm children play together when they are small but once the white children go away to school they soon dont play together any more even in the holidays although most of the black children get some sort of schooling they drop every year further behind the grades passed by the white children the childish vocabulary the childs exploration of the adventurous possibilities of dam koppies mealie lands and veld there comes a time when the white children have surpassed these with the vocabulary of boardingschools and the possibilities of interschool sports matches and the kind of adventures seen at the cinema this usefully coincides with the age of twelve or thirteen so that by the time early adolescence is reached the black children are making along with the bodily changes common to all an easy transition to adult forms of address beginning to call their old playmates missus and baasielittle master the trouble was paulus eysendyck did not seem to realize that thebedi was now simply one of the crowd of farm children down at the kraal recognizable in his sisters old clothes the first christmas holidays after he had gone to boardingschool he brought home for thebedi a painted box he had made in his woodwork class he had to give it to her secretly because he had nothing for the other children at the kraal and she gave him before he went back to school a bracelet she had made of thin brass wire and the greyandwhite beans of the castoroil crop his father cultivated when they used to play together she was the one who had taught paulus how to make clay oxen for their toy spans there was a craze even in the platteland towns like the one where he was at school for boys to wear elephanthair and other bracelets beside their watchstraps his was admired friends asked him to get similar ones for them he said the natives made them on his fathers farm and he would try when he was fifteen six feet tall and tramping round at school dances with the girls from the sister school in the same town when he had learnt how to tease and flirt and fondle quite intimately these girls who were the daughters of prosperous farmers like his father when he had even met one who at a wedding he had attended with his parents on a nearby farm had let him do with her in a locked storeroom what people did when they made love when he was as far from his childhood as all this he still brought home from a shop in town a red plastic belt and gilt hoop earrings for the black girl thebedi she told her father the missus had given these to her as a reward for some work she had done it was true she sometimes was called to help out in the farmhouse she told the girls in the kraal that she had a sweetheart nobody knew about far away away on another farm and they giggled and teased and admired her there was a boy in the kraal called njabulo who said he wished he could have bought her a belt and earrings when the farmers son was home for the holidays she wandered far from the kraal and her companions he went for walks alone they had not arranged this it was an urge each followed independently he knew it was she from a long way off she knew that his dog would not bark at her down at the driedup riverbed where five or six years ago the children had caught a leguaan one great day a creature that combined ideally the size and ferocious aspect of the crocodile with the harmlessness of the lizard they squatted side by side on the earth bank he told her travelers tales about school about the punishments at school particularly exaggerating both their nature and his indifference to them he told her about the town of middleburg which she had never seen she had nothing to tell but she prompted with many questions like any good listener while he talked he twisted and tugged at the roots of white stinkwood and cape willow trees that looped out of the eroded earth around them it had always been a good spot for childrens games down there hidden by the mesh of old anteaten trees held in place by vigorous ones wild asparagus bushing up between the trunks and here and there pricklypear cactus sunkenskinned and bristly like an old mans face keeping alive sapless until the next rainy season she punctured the dry hide of a pricklypear again and again with a sharp stick while she listened she laughed a lot at what he told her sometimes dropping her face on her knees sharing amusement with the cool shady earth beneath her bare feet she put on her pair of shoes white sandals thickly blancoed against the farm dust when he was on the farm but these were taken off and laid aside at the riverbed one summer afternoon when there was water flowing there and it was very hot she waded in as they used to do when they were children her dress bunched modestly and tucked into the legs of her pants the schoolgirls he went swimming with at dams or pools on neighboring farms wore bikinis but the sight of their dazzling bellies and thighs in the sunlight had never made him feel what he felt now when the girl came up the bank and sat beside him the drops of water beading off her dark legs the only points of light in the earthsmelling deep shade they were not afraid of one another they had known one another always he did with her what he had done that time in the storeroom at the wedding and this time it was so lovely so lovely he was surprisedand she was surprised by it too he could see in her dark face that was part of the shade with her big dark eyes shiny as soft water watching him attentively as she had when they used to huddle over their teams of mud oxen as she had when he told her about detention weekends at school they went to the riverbed often through those summer holidays they met just before the light went as it does quite quickly and each returned home with the dark she to her mothers hut he to the farmhouse in time for the evening meal he did not tell her about school or town any more she did not ask questions any longer he told her each time when they would meet again once or twice it was very early in the morning the lowing of the cows being driven to graze came to them where they lay dividing them with unspoken recognition of the sound read in their two pairs of eyes opening so close to each other he was a popular boy at school he was in the second then the first soccer team the head girl of the sister school was said to have a crush on him he didnt particularly like her but there was a pretty blonde who put up her long hair into a kind of doughnut with a black ribbon round it whom he took to see films when the schoolboys and girls had a free saturday afternoon he had been driving tractors and other farm vehicles since he was ten years old and as soon as he was eighteen he got a drivers license and in the holidays this last year of his school life he took neighbors daughters to dances and to the drivein cinema that had just opened twenty kilometers from the farm his sisters were married by then his parents often left him in charge of the farm over the weekend while they visited the young wives and grandchildren when thebedi saw the farmer and his wife drive away on a saturday afternoon the boot of their mercedes filled with freshkilled poultry and vegetables from the garden that it was part of her fathers work to tend she knew that she must come not to the riverbed but up to the house the house was an old one thickwalled dark against the heat the kitchen was its lively thoroughfare with servants food supplies begging cats and dogs pots boiling over washing being damped for ironing and the big deepfreeze the missus had ordered from town bearing a crocheted mat and a vase of plastic irises but the diningroom with the bulginglegged heavy table was shut up in its rich old smell of soup and tomato sauce the sittingroom curtains were drawn and the tv set silent the door of the parents bedroom was locked and the empty rooms where the girls had slept had sheets of plastic spread over the beds it was in one of these that she and the farmers son stayed together whole nights almost she had to get away before the house servants who knew her came in at dawn there was a risk someone would discover her or traces of her presence if he took her to his own bedroom although she had looked into it many times when she was helping out in the house and knew well there the row of silver cups he had won at school when she was eighteen and the farmers son nineteen and working with his father on the farm before entering a veterinary college the young man njabulo asked her father for her njabulos parents met with hers and the money he was to pay in place of the cows it is customary to give a prospective brides parents was settled upon he had no cows to offer he was a laborer on the eysendyck farm like her father a bright youngster old eysendyck had taught him bricklaying and was using him for odd jobs in construction around the place she did not tell the farmers son that her parents had arranged for her to marry she did not tell him either before he left for his first term at the veterinary college that she thought she was going to have a baby two months after her marriage to njabulo she gave birth to a daughter there was no disgrace in that among her people it is customary for a young man to make sure before marriage that the chosen girl is not barren and njabulo had made love to her then but the infant was very light and did not quickly grow darker as most african babies do already at birth there was on its head a quantity of straight fine floss like that which carries the seeds of certain weeds in the veld the unfocused eyes it opened were grey flecked with yellow njabulo was the matt opaque coffeegrounds color that had always been called black the color of thebedis legs on which beaded water looked oystershell blue the same color as thebedis face where the black eyes with their interested gaze and clear whites were so dominant njabulo made no complaint out of his farm laborers earnings he bought from the indian store a cellophanewindowed pack containing a pink plastic bath six napkins a card of safety pins a knitted jacket cap and bootees a dress and a tin of johnsons baby powder for thebedis baby when it was two weeks old paulus eysendyck arrived home from the veterinary college for the holidays he drank a glass of fresh stillwarm milk in the childhood familiarity of his mothers kitchen and heard her discussing with the old houseservant where they could get a reliable substitute to help out now that the girl thebedi had had a baby for the first time since he was a small boy he came right into the kraal it was eleven oclock in the morning the men were at work in the lands he looked about him urgently the women turned away each not wanting to be the one approached to point out where thebedi lived thebedi appeared coming slowly from the hut njabulo had built in white mans style with a tin chimney and a proper window with glass panes set in straight as walls made of unfired bricks would allow she greeted him with hands brought together and a token movement representing the respectful bob with which she was accustomed to acknowledge she was in the presence of his father or mother he lowered his head under the doorway of her home and went in he said i want to see show me she had taken the bundle off her back before she came out into the light to face him she moved between the iron bedstead made up with njabulos checked blankets and the small wooden table where the pink plastic bath stood among food and kitchen pots and picked up the bundle from the snuglyblanketed grocers box where it lay the infant was asleep she revealed the closed pale plump tiny face with a bubble of spit at the corner of the mouth the spidery pink hands stirring she took off the woolen cap and the straight fine hair flew up after it in static electricity showing gilded strands here and there he said nothing she was watching him as she had done when they were little and the gang of children had trodden down a crop in their games or transgressed in some other way for which he as the farmers son the white one among them must intercede with the farmer she disturbed the sleeping face by scratching or tickling gently at a cheek with one finger and slowly the eyes opened saw nothing were still asleep and then awake no longer narrowed looked out at them grey with yellowish flecks his own hazel eyes he struggled for a moment with a grimace of tears anger and selfpity she could not put out her hand to him he said you havent been near the house with it she shook her head never again she shook her head dont take it out stay inside cant you take it away somewhere you must give it to someone she moved to the door with him he said ill see what i will do i dont know and then he said i feel like killing myself her eyes began to glow to thicken with tears for a moment there was the feeling between them that used to come when they were alone down at the riverbed he walked out two days later when his mother and father had left the farm for the day he appeared again the women were away on the lands weeding as they were employed to do as casual labor in summer only the very old remained propped up on the ground outside the huts in the flies and the sun thebedi did not ask him in the child had not been well it had diarrhea he asked where its food was she said the milk comes from me he went into njabulos house where the child lay she did not follow but stayed outside the door and watched without seeing an old crone who had lost her mind talking to herself talking to the fowls who ignored her she thought she heard small grunts from the hut the kind of infant grunt that indicates a full stomach a deep sleep after a time long or short she did not know he came out and walked away with plodding stride his fathers gait out of sight toward his fathers house the baby was not fed during the night and although she kept telling njabulo it was sleeping he saw for himself in the morning that it was dead he comforted her with words and caresses she did not cry but simply sat staring at the door her hands were cold as dead chickens feet to his touch njabulo buried the little baby where farm workers were buried in the place in the veld the farmer had given them some of the mounds had been left to weather away unmarked others were covered with stones and a few had fallen wooden crosses he was going to make a cross but before it was finished the police came and dug up the grave and took away the dead baby someone one of the other laborers their women had reported that the baby was almost white that strong and healthy it had died suddenly after a visit by the farmers son pathological tests on the infant corpse showed intestinal damage not always consistent with death by natural causes thebadi went for the first time to the country town where paulus had been to school to give evidence at the preparatory examination into the charge of murder brought against him she cried hysterically in the witness box saying yes yes the gilt hoop earrings swung in her ears she saw the accused pouring liquid into the babys mouth she said he had threatened to shoot her if she told anyone more than a year went by before in that same town the case was brought to trial she came to court with a newborn baby on her back she wore gilt hoop earrings she was calm she said she had not seen what the white man did in the house paulus eysendyck said he had visited the hut but had not poisoned the child the defense did not contest that there had been a love relationship between the accused and the girl or that intercourse had taken place but submitted there was no proof that the child was the accuseds the judge told the accused there was strong suspicion against him but not enough proof that he had committed the crime the court could not accept the girls evidence because it was clear she had committed perjury either at this trial or at the preparatory examination there was the suggestion in the mind of the court that she might be an accomplice in the crime but again insufficient proof the judge commended the honorable behavior of the husband sitting in court in a brownandyellowquartered golf cap bought for sundays who had not rejected his wife and had even provided clothes for the unfortunate infant out of his slender means the verdict on the accused was not guilty the young white man refused to accept the congratulations of press and public and left the court with his mothers raincoat shielding his face from photographers his father said to the press i will try and carry on as best i can to hold up my head in the district interviewed by the sunday papers who spelled her name in a variety of ways the black girl speaking in her own language was quoted beneath her photograph it was a thing of our childhood we dont see each other any more the irony of hate ruth rendell when lists are made fifty or a hundred years hence of the best writers of our time regardless of genre ruth rendell b despite her careerlong identification with crime and detective fiction may well rank high she was born ruth barbara grasemann in london the daughter of two teachers who both found a creative outlet in painting after leaving school at eighteen she eschewed university for a brief career as a newspaper reporter in essex after marrying fellow reporter donald rendell and producing a son she quit journalism for fulltime motherhood and selfeducation through voracious reading rendells first novel from doon with death introducing her oddcouple police team of reg wexford and mike burden is solidly traditional the trickiness of its plot inviting the inevitable agatha christie comparison rendell would never abandon this devotion to fairplay plotting as her novels increased in psychological and thematic depth her second novel to fear a painted devil is nonseries and throughout her career she has mixed the wexford and burden books immensely popular with readers with often darkhued crime novels that have achieved even greater critical acclaim writing in the scribner writers series volume mystery and suspense writers b j rahn describes these nonseries books as centered in the consciousness of the main character whether villain or victim whose feelings of alienation anxiety fear hatred and anguish are experienced firsthand by the reader rendell who was called ruth by her father and barbara by her mother answers to both and now writes as both having adopted the pseudonym barbara vine with a darkadapted eye according to rahn the vine novels plumb the depths of the human psyche more in the manner of henry james than patricia highsmith or alfred hitchcockthe novels are distinguished by subtle manipulation of the narrative viewpoint and complex patterning which often produce startling ironic surprises along with her prolific bookortwoperyear output rendell has also kept busy as a shortstory writer her first collection the fallen curtain and other stories has been followed by at least six more including piranha to scurfy and other stories the irony of hate revealing who did what in the very first sentence demonstrates rendells psychological insight as well as her ability to surprise the reader imurdered brenda goring for what i suppose is the most unusual of motives she came between me and my wife by that i dont mean to say that there was anything abnormal in their relationship they were merely close friends though merely is hardly the word to use in connection with a relationship which alienates and excludes a onceloved husband i murdered her to get my wife to myself once more but instead i have parted us perhaps for ever and i await with dread with impotent panic with the most awful helplessness i have ever known the coming trial by setting down the facts and the irony the awful irony that runs through them like a sharp glittering thread i may come to see things more clearly i may find some way to convince those inexorable powers that be of how it really was to make defending counsel believe me and not raise his eyebrows and shake his head to ensure at any rate that if laura and i must be separated she will know as she sees me taken from the court to my long imprisonment that the truth is known and justice done alone here with nothing else to do with nothing to wait for but that trial i could write reams about the character the appearance the neuroses of brenda goring i could write the great hate novel of all time in this context though much of it would be irrelevant and i shall be as brief as i can some character in shakespeare says of a woman would i had never seen her and the reply is then you would have left unseen a very wonderful piece of work well would indeed i had never seen brenda as for her being a wonderful piece of work i suppose i would agree with that too once she had had a husband to be rid of her for ever no doubt he paid her enormous alimony and had settled on her a lump sum with which she bought the cottage up the lane from our house on our village she made the impact one would expect of such a newcomer wonderful she was an amazing refreshment to all those retired couples and cautious weekenders with her clothes her long blond hair her sports car her talents and her jetset past for a while that is until she got too much for them to take from the first she fastened on to laura understandable in a way since my wife was the only woman in the locality who was of comparable age who lived there all the time and who had no job but surely or so i thought at first she would never have singled out laura if she had had a wider choice to me my wife is lovely all i could ever want the only woman i have ever really cared for but i know that to others she appears shy colorless a simple and quiet little housewife what then had she to offer to that extrovert that bright bejeweled butterfly she gave me the beginning of the answer herself havent you noticed the way people are starting to shun her darling the goldsmiths didnt ask her to their party last week and mary williamson refuses to have her on the f√™te committee i cant say im surprised i said the way she talks and the things she talks about you mean her love affairs and all that sort of thing but darling shes lived in the sort of society where thats quite normal its natural for her to talk like that its just that shes open and honest shes not living in that sort of society now i said and shell have to adapt if she wants to be accepted did you notice isabel goldsmiths face when brenda told that story about going off for a weekend with some chap shed picked up in a bar i tried to stop her going on about all the men her husband named in his divorce action but i couldnt and then shes always saying when i was living with soandso and that was the time of my affair with whatshisname elderly people find that a bit upsetting you know well were not elderly said laura and i hope we can be a bit more broadminded you do like her dont you i was always very gentle with my wife the daughter of clever domineering parents who belittled her she grew up with an ineradicable sense of her own inferiority she is a born victim an inviter of bullying and therefore i have tried never to bully her never even to cross her so all i said was that brenda was all right and that i was glad since i was out all day that she had found a friend and companion of her own age and if brenda had befriended and companioned her only during the day i daresay i shouldnt have objected i should have got used to the knowledge that laura was listening day in and day out to stories of a world she had never known to hearing illicit sex and duplicity glorified and i should have been safe in the conviction that she was incorruptible but i had to put up with brenda myself in the evenings when i got home from my long commuting there she would be lounging on our sofa in her silk trousers or long skirt and high boots chainsmoking or she would arrive with a bottle of wine just as we had sat down to dinner and involve us in one of those favorite debates of hers on the lines of is marriage a dying institution or are parents necessary and to illustrate some specious point of hers she would come out with some personal experience of the kind that had so upset our elderly friends of course i was not obliged to stay with them ours is quite a big house and i could go off into the dining room or the room laura called my study but all i wanted was what i had once had to be alone in the evenings with my wife and it was even worse when we were summoned to coffee or drinks with brenda there in her lavishly furnished overornate cottage to be shown the latest thing she had made she was always embroidering and weaving and potting and messing about with watercolors and shown too the gifts she had received at some time or another from mark and larry and paul and all the dozens of other men there had been in her life when i refused to go laura would become nervous and depressed then pathetically elated if after a couple of blissful brendaless evenings i suggested for the sake of pleasing her that i supposed we might as well drop in on old brenda what sustained me was the certainty that sooner or later any woman so apparently popular with the opposite sex would find herself a boyfriend and have less or no time for my wife i couldnt understand why this hadnt happened already and i said so to laura she does see her men friends when she goes up to london said my wife she never has any of them down here i said and that evening when brenda was treating us to a highly colored account of some painter she knew called laszlo who was terribly attractive and who adored her i said id like to meet him and why didnt she invite him down for the weekend brenda flashed her long greenpainted fingernails about and gave laura a conspiratorial womantowoman look and what would all the old fuddyduddies have to say about that i wonder surely you can rise above all that sort of thing brenda i said of course i can give them something to talk about im quite well aware its only sour grapes id have laszlo here like a shot only he wouldnt come he hates the country hed be bored stiff apparently richard and jonathan and stephen also hated the country or would be bored or couldnt spare the time it was much better for brenda to go up and see them in town and i noticed that after my probing about laszlo brenda seemed to go to london more often and that the tales of her escapades after these visits became more and more sensational i think i am quite a perceptive man and soon there began to form in my mind an idea so fantastic that for a while i refused to admit it even to myself but i put it to the test instead of just listening to brenda and throwing in the occasional rather sour rejoinder i started asking her questions i took her up on names and dates i thought you said you met mark in america i would say or but surely you didnt have that holiday with richard until after your divorce i tied her up in knots without her realizing it and the idea began to seem not so fantastic after all the final test came at christmas i had noticed that brenda was a very different woman when she was alone with me than when laura was with us if for example laura was out in the kitchen making coffee or as sometimes happened at the weekends brenda dropped in when laura was out she was rather cool and shy with me gone then were the flamboyant gestures and the provocative remarks and brenda would chat about village matters as mundanely as isabel goldsmith not quite the behavior one would expect from a selfstyled messalina alone with a young and reasonably personable man it struck me then that in the days when brenda had been invited to village parties and now when she still met neighbors at our parties she never once attempted a flirtation were all the men too old for her to bother with was a slim handsome man of going on fifty too ancient to be considered fair game for a woman who would never see thirty again of course they were all married but so were her paul and her stephen and if she were to be believed she had had no compunction about taking them away from their wives if she were to be believed that was the crux of it not one of them wanted to spend christmas with her no london lover invited her to a party or offered to take her away she would be with us of course for christmas lunch for the whole of the day and at our boxing day gathering of friends and relatives i had hung a bunch of mistletoe in our hall and on christmas morning i admitted her to the house myself laura being busy in the kitchen merry christmas i said give us a kiss brenda and i took her in my arms under that mistletoe and kissed her on the mouth she stiffened i swear a shudder ran through her she was as awkward as apprehensive as repelled as a sheltered twelveyearold and then i knew married she may have been and it was not hard now to guess the cause of her divorce but she had never had a lover or enjoyed an embrace or even been alone with a man longer than she could help she was frigid a goodlooking vivacious healthy girl she nevertheless had that particular disability she was as cold as a nun but because she couldnt bear the humiliation of admitting it she had created for herself a fantasy life a fantasy past in which she queened it as a fantasy nymphomaniac at first i thought it a huge joke and i couldnt wait to tell laura but i wasnt alone with her till two in the morning and then she was asleep when i came to bed i didnt sleep much my elation dwindled as i realized i hadnt any real proof and that if i told laura what id been up to probing and questioning and testing she would only be bitterly hurt and resentful how could i tell her id kissed her best friend and got an icy response that in her absence id tried flirting with her best friend and been repulsed and then as i thought about it i understood what i really had discovered that brenda hated men that no man would ever come and take her away or marry her and live here with her and absorb all her time for ever she would stay here alone living a stones throw from us in and out of our house daily she and laura growing old together i could have moved house of course i could have taken laura away from her friends from the house and the countryside she loved and what guarantee would i have had that brenda wouldnt have moved too to be near us still for i knew now what brenda saw in my wife a gullible innocent a trusting everlastingly credulous audience whose own inexperience kept her from seeing the holes and discrepancies in those farragos of nonsense and whose pathetic determination to be worldly prevented her from showing distaste as the dawn came and i looked with love and sorrow at laura sleeping beside me i knew what i must do the only thing i could do at the season of peace and goodwill i decided to kill brenda goring for my own and lauras good and peace easier decided than done i was buoyed up and strengthened by knowing that in everyones eyes i would have no motive our neighbors thought us wonderfully charitable and tolerant to put up with brenda at all i resolved to be positively nice to her instead of just negatively easygoing and as the new year came in i took to dropping in on brenda on my way back from the post or the village shop and if i got home from work to find laura alone i asked where brenda was and suggested we should phone her at once and ask her to dinner or for a drink this pleased laura enormously i always felt you didnt really like brenda darling she said and it made me feel rather guilty its marvelous that youre beginning to see how nice she really is what i was actually beginning to see was how i could kill her and get away with it for something happened which seemed to deliver her into my hands on the outskirts of the village in an isolated cottage lived an elderly unmarried woman called peggy daley and during the last week of january the cottage was broken into and peggy stabbed to death with her own kitchen knife the work of some psychopath the police seemed to believe for nothing had been stolen or damaged when it appeared likely that they werent going to find the killer i began thinking of how i could kill brenda in the same way so that the killing could look like the work of the same perpetrator just as i was working this out laura went down with a flu bug she caught from mary williamson brenda of course came in to nurse her cooked my dinner for me and cleaned the house because everyone believed that peggy daleys murderer was still stalking the village i walked brenda home at night even though her cottage was only a few yards up the lane or narrow path that skirted the end of our garden it was pitch dark there as we had all strenuously opposed the installation of street lighting and it brought me an ironical amusement to notice how brenda flinched and recoiled when on these occasions i made her take my arm i always made a point of going into the house with her and putting all the lights on when laura began to get better and all she wanted in the evenings was to sleep i sometimes went earlier to brendas had a nightcap with her and once on leaving i gave her a comradely kiss on the doorstep to show any observing neighbor what friends we were and how much i appreciated all brendas kindness to my sick wife then i got the flu myself at first this seemed to upset my plans for i couldnt afford to delay too long already people were beginning to be less apprehensive about our marauding murderer and were getting back to their old habits of leaving their back doors unlocked but then i saw how i could turn my illness to my advantage on the monday when i had been confined to bed for three days and that ministering angel brenda was fussing about me nearly as much as my own wife was laura remarked that she wouldnt go across to the goldsmiths that evening as she had promised because it seemed wrong to leave me instead if i was better by then she would go on the wednesday her purpose being to help isabel cut out a dress brenda of course might have offered to stay with me instead and i think laura was a little surprised that she didnt i knew the reason and had a little quiet laugh to myself about it it was one thing for brenda to flaunt about regaling us with stories of all the men she had nursed in the past quite another to find herself alone with a not very sick man in that mans bedroom so i had to be sick enough to provide myself with an alibi but not sick enough to keep laura at home on the wednesday morning i was feeling a good deal better dr lawson looked in on his way back from his rounds in the afternoon and pronounced after a thorough examination that i still had phlegm on my chest while he was in the bathroom washing his hands and doing something with his stethoscope i held the thermometer he had stuck in my mouth against the radiator at the back of the bed this worked better than i had hoped worked in fact almost too well the mercury went up to a hundred and three and i played up to it by saying in a feeble voice that i felt dizzy and kept alternating between the sweats and the shivers keep him in bed dr lawson said and give him plenty of warm drinks i doubt if he could get up if he tried i said rather shamefacedly that i had tried and i couldnt and that my legs felt like jelly immediately laura said she wouldnt go out that night and i blessed lawson when he told her not to be silly all i needed was rest and to be allowed to sleep after a good deal of fussing and selfreproach and promises not to be gone more than two hours at the most she finally went off at seven as soon as the car had departed i got up brendas house could be seen from my bedroom window and i saw that she had lights on but no porch light the night was dark moonless and starless i put trousers and a sweater on over my pajamas and made my way downstairs by the time i was halfway down i knew that i neednt have pretended to be ill or bothered with the thermometer ploy i was ill i was shivering and swaying great waves of dizziness kept coming over me and i had to hang on to the banisters for support that wasnt the only thing that had gone wrong i had intended when the deed was done and i was back home again to cut up my coat and gloves with lauras electric scissors and burn the pieces on our living room fire but i couldnt find the scissors and i realized laura must have taken them with her to her dressmaking session worse than that there was no fire alight our central heating was very efficient and we only had an open fire for the pleasure and coziness of it but laura hadnt troubled to light one while i was upstairs ill at that moment i nearly gave up but it was then or never i would never again have such circumstances and such an alibi either kill her now i thought or live in an odious m√©nage √† trois for the rest of my life we kept the raincoats and gloves we used for gardening in a cupboard in the kitchen by the back door laura had left only the hall light on and i didnt think it would be wise to switch on any more in the semidarkness i fumbled about in the cupboard for my raincoat found it and put it on it seemed tight on me my body was so stiff and sweaty but i managed to button it up and then i put on the gloves i took with me one of our kitchen knives and let myself out by the back door it wasnt a frosty night but raw and cold and damp i went down the garden up the lane and into the garden of brendas cottage i had to feel my way round the side of the house for there was no light there at all but the kitchen light was on and the back door unlocked i tapped and let myself in without waiting to be asked brenda in full evening rig glittery sweater gilt necklace long skirt was cooking her solitary supper and then for the first time ever when it didnt matter any more when it was too late i felt pity for her there she was a handsome rich gifted woman with the reputation of a seductress but in reality as destitute of people who really cared for her as poor old peggy daley had been there she was dressed for a party heating up tinned spaghetti in a cottage kitchen at the back of beyond she turned round looking apprehensive but only i think because she was always afraid when we were alone that i would try to make love to her what are you doing out of bed she said and then why are you wearing those clothes i didnt answer her i stabbed her in the chest again and again she made no sound but a little choking moan and she crumpled up on the floor although i had known how it would be had hoped for it the shock was so great and i had already been feeling so swimmy and strange that all i wanted was to throw myself down too and close my eyes and sleep that was impossible i turned off the cooker i checked that there was no blood on my trousers and my shoes though of course there was plenty on the raincoat and then i staggered out switching off the light behind me i dont know how i found my way back it was so dark and by then i was lightheaded and my heart was drumming i just had the presence of mind to strip off the raincoat and the gloves and push them into our garden incinerator in the morning i would have to get up enough strength to burn them before brendas body was found the knife i washed and put back in the drawer laura came back about five minutes after i had got myself to bed she had been gone less than half an hour i turned over and managed to raise myself up to ask her why she was back so soon it seemed to me that she had a strange distraught look about her whats the matter i mumbled were you worried about me no she said no but she didnt come up close to me or put her hand on my forehead it was isabel goldsmith told me something i was upset iits no use talking about it now youre too ill she said in a sharper tone than i had ever heard her use can i get you anything i just want to sleep i said i shall sleep in the spare room good night that was reasonable enough but we had never slept apart before during the whole of our marriage and she could hardly have been afraid of catching the flu having only just got over it herself but i was in no state to worry about that and i fell into the troubled nightmareridden sleep of fever i remember one of those dreams it was of laura finding brendas body herself a not unlikely eventuality however she didnt find it brendas cleaner did i knew what must have happened because i saw the police car arrive from my window an hour or so later laura came in to tell me the news which she had got from jack williamson it must have been the same man who killed peggy she said i felt better already things were going well my poor darling i said you must feel terrible you were such close friends she said nothing she straightened my bedclothes and left the room i knew i should have to get up and burn the contents of the incinerator but i couldnt get up i put my feet out and reached for the floor but it was as if the floor came up to meet me and threw me back again i wasnt overworried the police would think what laura thought what everyone must think that afternoon they came a chief inspector and a sergeant laura brought them up to our bedroom and they talked to us together the chief inspector said he understood we were close friends of the dead woman wanted to know when we had last seen her and what we had been doing on the previous evening then he asked if we had any idea at all as to who had killed her that maniac who murdered the other woman of course said laura i can see you dont read the papers he said usually we did it was my habit to read a morning paper in the office and to bring an evening paper home with me but i had been at home ill it turned out that a man had been arrested on the previous morning for the murder of peggy daley the shock made me flinch and im sure i turned pale but the policemen didnt seem to notice they thanked us for our cooperation apologized for disturbing a sick man and left when they had gone i asked laura what isabel had said to upset her the night before she came up to me and put her arms round me it doesnt matter now she said poor brendas dead and it was a horrible way to die but well i must be very wicked but im not sorry dont look at me like that darling i love you and i know you love me and we must forget her and be as we used to be you know what i mean i didnt but i was glad whatever it was had blown over i had enough on my plate without a coldness between me and my wife even though laura was beside me that night i hardly slept for worrying about the stuff in that incinerator in the morning i put up the best show i could of being much better i dressed and announced in spite of lauras expostulations that i was going into the garden the police were there already searching all our gardens actually digging up brendas they left me alone that day and the next but they came in once and interviewed laura on her own i asked her what they had said but she passed it off quite lightly i supposed she didnt think i was well enough to be told they had been enquiring about my movements and my attitude towards brenda just a lot of routine questions darling she said but i was sure she was afraid for me and a barrier of her fear for me and mine for myself came up between us it seems incredible but that sunday we hardly spoke to each other and when we did brendas name wasnt mentioned in the evening we sat in silence my arm round laura her head on my shoulder waiting waiting the morning brought the police with a search warrant they asked laura to go into the living room and me to wait in the study i knew then that it was only a matter of time they would find the knife and of course they would find brendas blood on it i had been feeling so ill when i cleaned it that now i could no longer remember whether i had scrubbed it or simply rinsed it under the tap after a long while the chief inspector came in alone you told us you were a close friend of miss gorings i was friendly with her i said trying to keep my voice steady she was my wifes friend he took no notice of this you didnt tell us you were on intimate terms with her that you were in point of fact having a sexual relationship with her nothing he could have said would have astounded me more thats absolute rubbish is it we have it on sound authority what authority i said or is that the sort of thing youre not allowed to say i see no harm in telling you he said easily miss goring herself informed two women friends of hers in london of the fact she told one of your neighbors she met at a party in your house you were seen to spend evenings alone with miss goring while your wife was ill and we have a witness who saw you kissing her good night now i knew what it was that isabel goldsmith had told laura which had so distressed her the irony of it the ironywhy hadnt i knowing brendas reputation and knowing brendas fantasies suspected what construction would be put on my assumed friendship with her here was motive the lack of which i had relied on as my last resort men do kill their mistresses from jealousy from frustration from fear of discovery but surely i could turn brendas fantasies to my own use she had dozens of men friends lovers whatever you like to call them any of them could have killed her on the contrary said the chief inspector apart from her exhusband who is in australia we have been able to discover no man in her life but yourself i cried out desperately i didnt kill her i swear i didnt he looked surprised oh we know that for the first time he called me sir we know that sir no one is accusing you of anything we have dr lawsons word for it that you were physically incapable of leaving your bed that night and the raincoat and gloves we found in your incinerator are not your property fumbling in the dark swaying the sleeves of the raincoat too short the shoulders too tightwhy are you wearing those clothes she had asked before i stabbed her i want you to try and keep calm sir he said very gently but i have never been calm since i have confessed again and again i have written statements i have expostulated raved gone over with them every detail of what i did that night i have wept then i said nothing i could only stare at him i came in here to you sir he said simply to confirm a fact of which we were already certain and to ask you if you would care to accompany your wife to the police station where she will be charged with the murder of miss brenda goring sweet baby

her stories have not been collected to date she is a master of the crime short who bears comparison with roald dahl and stanley ellin one of her attributes is the ability to write in a variety of styles including the rural dialect narrative of sweet baby jenny inever had a mother leastways not one that i can remember i must have had one sometime cause as far as i can tell i didnt hatch out from no egg and even chicks get to snuggle up under the hen for a little space before she kicks them out of the nest but i didnt have no hen to snuggle up to or to peck me upside the head if i did something wrong not that i would ever do anything wrong leastways not if i knowed it was wrong there are lots of things that go on that are pure puzzlement to me and i cant tell the right from the wrong of it for instance i recollect when ace thats my biggest big brother and the one who taken care of us all after pop went away i recollect when he used to work driving a beer truck round to all the stores in town and the root cellar used to be full of sixpacks all the time i said to him one day ace how come if you got the cellar full of beer i cant have the cellar full of cokecola i dont like beer guess i was about nine or ten years old at the time and never could get my fill of cokecola well ace he just laughed and said sweet baby jennythats what they all called me even after i was well growed upsweet baby jenny if i drove a cokecola truck you could float away to heaven on an ocean of it now just drink your beer and learn to like it i wasnt ever dumb even though i didnt do so good in school so it didnt take much figuring to catch onto the fact that ace was delivering almost as much beer to the root cellar as he was to big jumbos superette down on main street so it didnt seem fair when i got caught in the fiveanddime with a lipstick in my pocket for him to come barreling down and given me hellfire and damnation in front of that suetfaced manager i just stood there looking at him with pigstickers in my eyes until we got out to the truck and i said to him whats the difference between one teensyweensy lipstick and a cellar full of beer he says to me grinning is that a riddle and i says no i would surely like to know and he says the difference sweet baby jenny is that you got caught now i ask you it was different though when he got caught then he cussed and swore and kicked the porch till it like to fallen off the house all the while the boys from the beer company was hauling that beer up from the root cellar and stowing it back on the truck when they drove away i says to him sweet as molasses ace honey why you carrying on so and he says dammit jenny they taken away my beer i dont give a hoot about the job it was a jackass job anyway but i worked hard for that beer and they didnt ought to taken it away but ace i says hanging onto his hand and swinging it like a jumping rope aint it true you stolen that beer and you got caught and you had to give it back just like i did with that lipstick well he flung me away from him till i fetched up against the old washing machine that was resting in the yard waiting for somebody to fix it and he yelled i aint stolen anything and dont you ever say i did that beer was what they call a fringe benefit only they didnt know they was givin it they dont even pay me enough to keep you in pigtail ribbons and have beer money besides i only taken what i deserve well he was right on one score i didnt have anything you could rightfully call a hair ribbon and i kept my braids tied up with the strings off of deucys old bull durham pouches deucy you maybe guessed is my secondbiggest big brother and a shiftless lazy skunk even though some people think hes handsome and should be a movie star aces name in the family bible is arthur and deucy is written down as dennis then theres earl wesley and pembrook and then theres me jennet maybelle thats the last name on the birth page over on the death side the last name written in is flora janine taggert its written in black spiky letters like the pen was stabbing at the page and the date is just about a month or so after my name was written on the birth page i know thats my mother although no one ever told me and no one ever told me how she died as for pop there aint no page in the bible for people who just up and go away deucy plays guitar and sings and thinks hes conway twitty says hes gonna go to nashville and come back driving a leopardskin cadillac id surely like to see that though i dont guess i ever will that deucys too lazy to get up off the porch swing to fetch himself a drink of water its always sweet baby jenny get me this and get me that only thing hes not too lazy for is to boost himself up to the supper table that dont keep the girls from flocking round bringing him presents and smirking like the pig that et the babys diaper they all hope and pray that theyre gonna be the one to go to nashville with him and ride back in that cadillac and he dont trouble to relieve their minds on the subject you ought to hear that porch swing creak in the dark of night they are just so dumb now earl and wesley they try they aint too goodlooking though they do have the taggert black hair and the taggert nose i remember pop saying he was part cherokee and all his sons showed it but while ace and deucy came out looking like indian chiefs earl is crosseyed and wesley broke his nose falling out of a buckeye tree and lost most of his hair to the scarlet fever so they try they are always going into business together once they went into the egg business and we had the whole place full of chickens running around they said they would sell their eggs cheaper than anyone around and make a fortune and wed all go off to california and live in a big hotel with a swimming pool and waiters bringing hamburgers every time we snapped our fingers well people bought the eggs all right but what earl and wesley kind of forgot about was that chickens eat up a lot of chicken feed and they never could figure out how to get ahead of the bill at the feed store i could have told them how to do it was raise the price of the eggs and make them out to be something special so everyone would feel they had to have taggerts countryfresh eggs no matter what they cost but earl and wesley just shoved me aside and said sweet baby jenny you are just a girl and dont understand bidness now go on out and feed them chickens and gather up them eggs and lets have some of your good old peach cobbler for supper being in bidness sure does make a man hungry well pretty soon the feed store cut off their credit and there wasnt nothing left to feed the chickens so we had to eat as many of them as we could before they all starved to death and that was the end of the egg business earl and wesley being both tenderhearted and brought down by gloom couldnt bring themselves to kill a single chicken i like to wrung my arm off wringing those chicken necks i used to like fried chicken but i dont any more pembrook hes the smart one he dont steal sing or go into business hes off at the state college studying how to be a lawyer hes the only one used to talk to me and i miss him i was always planning to ask him what happened to our mother how she died and why pop ran off like he did but i just never got up the nerve pembrook writes me letters a couple times a month telling what its like up there at the college it sure sounds fine hes always going on at me how i should go back to school and finish up and come to the college and learn how to be somebody well id kind of like that but whod look after the boys reason why i didnt do so good in school was i never had no time for studying what with looking after the boys like i was their mother instead of sweet baby jenny like they call me only pembrook never called me that another thing i always meant to ask pembrook and never did is how come i come out looking like a canary in a cuckoobirds nest pembrook looks more or less just like the other boys though he keeps his black hair real clean and he wears big eyeglasses on top of his sharp taggert nose his eyes are dark brown like theirs and he weathers up nice and tan in the summer sun but in summer my freckles just get more so while the part in between the freckles gets red and my hair which is mudyellow most of the time gets brighter and brighter and kinks up in tight little curls unless i keep it braided up and never mind my eyes theyre not a bit like the boys greenyblue or blueygreen depending on the weather as for my nose it couldnt be less taggert if it was a pump handle small and turnedup and ugly could be i taken after my mother though i dont know that for a fact cause i never set eyes on her nor saw any picture of her pembrook says im pretty but thats just because he likes me pembrook says i look a lot like miss claudia carpenter who is regarded as the prettiest girl in two counties but i never saw her to make the comparison shes the daughter of the towns one and only bank president shes a year or so older than me and she dont stick around much got sent away to school and always taking trips here and there cant be much fun never being home in your own home place pembrook told me our mother used to help out at the carpenter household at parties and such or when their regular maid got sick maybe i could get such a job and put aside a little money just in case i ever decide to do what pembrook says one thing i do remember about pop before he went away he used to tell me stories he used to sit himself down in his big maroon armchair and he would sit me down on his lap and he would say now listen this heres a story about a bad little girl the stories were always different but they were all about a girl named bad penny she was ugly and mean and spiteful and nobody liked her she was always making trouble and in the end she always got punished sometimes she got et up by the pigs and sometimes she got drowned in the creek once she got cut up in little bits by the disc harrow and another time she fell into the granary and suffocated in the wheat but she always came back as mean and nasty as ever and thats why she was called bad penny after the story pop would take me up to my room and put me to bed i liked the stories even though they scared me some i knew pigs didnt eat little girls but i was always pretty careful around the pigpen we dont keep pigs any more but we had a few then and i used to carry the slops out to them well things got so bad after ace robbed the gas station down at the crossroads and got recognized by junior mulligan who just happened to be having his pickup truck filled up with gas at the time and never did like ace since the time they two went hunting together and ace claimed it was his deer and knocked junior into dead mans gully and broken his leg so off junior went to the police and they come and drug ace out of the red rooster cafe where he was treating everyone to beer and hardboiled eggs it was sad and lonesome around the place without ace to stir things up and quiet with deucys guitar in hock and him not able to sing a blessed note through mourning for it earl and wesley tried selling insurance round about but nobody we knew could buy any and the folks we didnt know wouldnt so it was up to me i harked back to my idea of going as a maid like pembrook had told me our mother had done i didnt mind working in someone elses house though deucy said it was undignified and not befitting a taggert far as i could see deucy thought any kind of work was undignified except maybe wearing out the porch swing so one morning i washed my whole body including my hair and cut my toenails so i could put shoes on and got out one of our mothers dresses from the wardrobe in the attic and made ready to go see mrs carpenter the dress fit me right well though it was a little long and looked a bit peculiar with my hightop laceup sneakers but that was all i had so it would have to do i walked into town fanning the skirt of the dress around me and blowing down the front of it from time to time so the sweat would not make stains on the greenandwhite polkadots i got to the carpenter house before the sun got halfway up the sky about the time deucy would be rolling out of bed and yelling his head off for coffee this was one morning hed just have to find his own breakfast i stood for a while with my hand on the iron gate looking up at the house it was a big one shining white like a wedding cake and there must have been about two dozen windows on the front of it alone it set back from the street on what looked like an acre of the greenest grass i ever saw sloping up to a row of prickly bushes that trimmed the porch id seen it before times ace used to take me riding in the beer truck and tell me how all he needed was to rob the bank and then wed be living in this part of town alongside the rich folks but i never really took a good close look cause i thought he was joking now i looked until i got to shaking and wondering if i ought to march right up to the front door or sneak around to the back i stood there so long i felt like my feet had taken root to the pavement and if i could only get loose id run home and stay there forever but then i thought about how there was less than a half a pound of coffee left and just enough flour for one more batch of biscuits and i pulled open that iron gate and set my face toward the big front door it felt like an hour that i was walking up that path with my feet feeling like big old river rafts and my hair jumping out of the braids that id combed and plaited so neat but i got up on the porch and put my finger on the doorbell and heard it dingdonging away inside i waited but the door stayed closed it was a pretty door painted white like the rest of the house and i studied every panel of it and the big brass doorknob and the letter box beside it while i waited i wondered if i should ring the bell again maybe no one was home maybe id come all this way for nothing they probably wouldnt want me to be their maid even if they were home the greenandwhite dress was sagging down around my shinbones and my sneakers were covered with road dust maybe id just go home and wait until i got a better idea i turned away and started down the porch steps and then i heard the door open behind me and a sharp voice like a bluejays said yes i looked back and saw a tall skinny woman staring at me with a frown betwixt her eyes that made me shiver in spite of the heat miz carpenter i said yes im mrs carpenter she said who are you what do you want im very busy my throat got choked and i couldnt swallow so when i said i come to be your maid i thought maybe she couldnt hear me cause i couldnt hear me myself what she said speak up whats this about a maid i come to be it i said if youll have me well sakes alive she said showing all her yellow teeth if you arent the answer to a prayer where did you spring from and who told you to come here well never mind all that come in the house and lets get started you look strong i just hope youre willing yes maam i said and quick as a wink she drug me through the house and into the kitchen and right up to the sink where there was more dishes than id ever seen in my life and all of them dirty just start right in she said the dishwashers right there ill be back in a few minutes now id seen dishwashing machines in the sears roebuck wish book but id never been right up close to one i knew what it was supposed to do i just wasnt too sure what i was supposed to do and i didnt trust anything very much except my own two hands so i started getting those dishes as clean as i could before i put them in the machine just in case we had a misunderstanding they were the prettiest dishes i ever did see even when they was all crusted with driedup gravy mrs carpenter came back in a few minutes carrying a pair of black shoes and a white dress she plopped herself down on a kitchen chair and smiled at me whats your name child jennet maybelle she didnt let me get the taggert part in but went right on talking well ill call you jenny that marcelline quit on me last night right in the middle of a dinner party and i was just about to start calling around when you walked in the door ill pay you five dollars a day plus meals and uniform but you have to pay for anything you break so be careful with those dishes each plate cost twenty dollars i put down the plate i was holding and tried to think what it could be made of it didnt look to be solid gold our plates at home were old and cracked and been around as long as i could remember i didnt know what they cost when one got broke we just threw it down in the creek bed behind the house along with all the other trash mrs carpenter was still talking now you cant be wearing those sneakers around the house so i brought you an old pair of claudias shoes maybe theyll fit and this uniform might be a little big for you youre a skinny little thing but we can cinch it in with a belt i didnt think much of her calling me skinny when she so closely resembled a beanpole herself but i didnt say anything the shoes looked nice with just a little bit of a high heel and shiny black and the uniform dress was starched and clean she stopped talking for a minute and started looking me over real close then havent i seen you somewhere before i could swear your face is familiar where do you come from i pointed in the direction of home and said out clinch valley road i was going to tell her how my mother had once worked as a maid for her but she didnt give me a chance she jumped up left the shoes on the floor and the dress on the chair and shook her head i dont know anyone out that way you can change your clothes in the maids room back there she waved her hand at a door on the other side of the kitchen and when you finish the dishes youll find me upstairs ill show you how to do the bedrooms the day wore on i didnt break any dishes and figured out on my own which button to push to start the machine it sure gave me a start when it began churning and spattering behind its closed door and i prayed it wouldnt go breaking any of those twentydollar plates and blaming it on me mrs carpenter showed me all over that house and told me what i was to do at noon she showed me what to make for lunch we both ate the same thing cold roast beef left over from the night before and some potato salad but she ate hers in the dining room and i ate mine in the kitchen i drank two glasses of icecold milk and could have drunk some more but i didnt want to seem greedy in the afternoon she set me to washing windows it wasnt hard work i worked harder at home and it was a treat to be looking out at the roses in the back and all that green grass in the front while i polished those windows till they looked like they werent there at all along about four oclock she hauled me back to the kitchen and told me what mr carpenter wanted for his dinner hes very partial to fried chicken but nobody seems able to make it to his satisfaction i know i cant and he has the most outrageous sweet tooth i dont eat dessert myself but he wont leave the table without it well i set to work cooking up my specialties id had lots of experience with chicken and my peach cobbler was just about perfect if i say so myself mrs carpenter left the kitchen to take a nap after telling me that mr carpenter expected to sit down to his meal at sharp at sharp i brought in a platter of fried chicken and mr carpenter whipped his napkin into his lap and dug in he didnt even look at me but i looked at him he was a freckly sandy man with goldrimmed glasses and a tight collar he still had all his hair but it was fading out to a kind of pinkish yellowish fuzz his eyes were blue or maybe green it was hard to tell behind his glasses and his nose turned up at the end like a hoe blade id fixed up a mess of greens to go with the chicken and he dug into those too dribbling the pot liquor down his chin and swabbing it away with his fine napkin mrs carpenter pecked at her food and watched to see how he was liking his when i brought in the peach cobbler he leaned back in his chair and sighed thats the best meal ive had in years marcelline this isnt marcelline said mrs carpenter marcelline quit last night this is jenny he looked at me then first through his glasses and then without his glasses and then he polished his glasses on his napkin and put them back on and tried again ah ha he said jenny well very nice and he got up from the table and left the room without even tasting my peach cobbler mrs carpenter was after him like a shot paul paul she hollered what about your dessert it didnt matter to me peach cobbler is best while its hot but its just as good the next day i carried it back out to the kitchen finished cleaning up and got back into my goinghome clothes i did hope that mrs carpenter would pay me my five dollars so i would have something to show to deucy and earl and wesley so i hung around for a bit but it wasnt mrs carpenter who came into the kitchen it was him he stood in the doorway pulling at his ear and looking at me as if he wished me off the face of the earth then he sloped into the kitchen and came right up to me where i was standing with my back against the refrigerator and took my chin in his hand he held my face up so i had to look at him unless i closed my eyes which i did for half a minute but i opened them again because i was beginning to get scared then he put his hand on my shoulder and took the collar of my dress between his fingers and felt of it softly at last he spoke youre a taggert arent you girl yes i am im jennet maybelle taggert i spoke up proudly because id learned in the little bit of time id spent in school that lots of folks thought taggerts was trash and the only way to deal with that was not to be ashamed then he said something i didnt understand am i never to be rid of taggerts will taggerts hound me to my grave you look pretty healthy to me i said adding sir so he wouldnt think i was being pert he didnt say anything to that but took his wallet out of his pocket and opened it up i thought he was going to pay me my five dollars so i got ready to say thank you and good night but he pulled out a photograph and handed it to me who do you think that is he asked me well i looked but i didnt know who it was the photograph was in colour and it showed a girl about my age with yellow curling hair and a big smile she was wearing a real pretty dress all blue and ruffly like she was going to a party or a dance i handed the picture back to him shes real pretty but i dont know who she is shes my daughter claudia i didnt know what else to say so i said again shes real pretty no shes not he said shes a spoiled brat she thinks shes the most beautiful female creature that ever trod the earth but shes useless vain and unlovable and its all my fault i didnt know why he was telling me all this but it was making me fidgety and anyway i had to get home to get supper for the boys theyd be pretty upset that i was so late well i said i guess ill be getting along dont go he grabbed my arm and hauled me over to where there was a mirror hanging on the wall and made me stand in front of it look there he said who do you see well thats just me i tried to pull away from him but he held on tight thats a pretty young woman he said thats what a young woman is supposed to be decent and clean and modest i wish you were my daughter jenny taggert instead of that hellion who wont stay home where she belongs and behaves so no man in his right mind would marry her how would you like that would you like to live here and be my girl well i felt my neck getting hot cause ace had told me that when a man starts paying compliments theres only one thing hes after and id sure heard enough of deucy speaking sugar words to his ladies on the porch swing excuse me mr carpenter i said but i got to be gettin home and would you please pay me my five dollars so i can carry home some supper to those boys i know that was bold but he was making me nervous and it just came out that way he let go of me and pulled out his wallet again is that what clemmies paying you five dollars well its not enough here and here and here the bills came leaping out of his wallet and he stuffed them into my hands when i looked i saw i had three tendollar bills not only that he started hauling out the leftover chicken that i had put away and shoving it into a paper sack take the peach cobbler too he said and anything else youd like take it all now i cant do that what would miz carpenter say ill tell her i ate it for a midnight snack he laughed then but it wasnt a happysounding laugh it sounded like something was breaking inside him thank you sir i said and skedaddled out the back door before he could think up some new craziness that would get me into trouble his voice came after me youll come back tomorrow wont you sure thing i called back but i wasnt so sure i would all the way home i pondered on mr carpenter and his strange ways but i just plain couldnt figure it out all i could think was that having so much money had addled his mind and i thanked god that we was poor and couldnt afford to be crazy i put it all out of my mind though when i reached the dirt road that led up to our place the moon was just clearing the top of the big old lilac bush at the edge of the property and its kindly light smoothened away some of the ugliness you could see in daylight the house looked welcoming with lights shining from its windows and there in the dooryard was pembrooks dinky little car i ran up the porch and busted into the house shouting his name they was all gathered in the kitchen and i could see from their dark taggert faces that i had interrupted an argument but i didnt care i set the carpenter food down on the table and said heres supper boys dig in deucy and earl and wesley did just that not even bothering with plates but snatching up that chicken in their fingers then i sat down and took off my left sneaker and pulled out the money there and there and there i said as i counted the bills out on the table deucys eyes bugged out and earl and wesley shouted whoopee as best they could with their mouths full of drumstick meat pembrook looked miserable whered you get all that jenny he asked i went as a maid i told him where did you go as a maid to miz carpenter and she gave you all that i was about to lie and say she did but i was never very good at lying it makes my nose run no he did youre not to go there any more said pembrook well id just about decided that for myself but i wasnt about to have pembrook much as i dearly love him telling me what not to do i will if i want to i said and when did you get home and how long you staying for forever if i have to to keep you out of trouble thats pretty nice trouble piped up deucy thirty dollars for a days work and all this food you ought to have some pem shut up you idiot i had never seen pembrook so angry taggert blood boils easy but until this minute pembrook had always managed to keep his temper under control he turned back to me his eyes glittering and mean like a chicken hawk about to pounce you are not to go back to the carpenter house not ever again you are to put it right out of your mind and tomorrow i am going to mail that money back and thats the end of it i only said one thing why never mind why well that did it i had worked hard for that money whether it was five dollars or thirty dollars it was mine the first money i had ever earned and pembrook had no right to take it away from me i had done nothing wrong as far as i could see and it wasnt fair for him to punish me i reared back in my chair looked him square in the eye and opened my mouth pembrook taggert in case you hadnt noticed i am no longer sweet baby jenny i am a woman growed and able to make up my own mind about things you cant stand there and give me orders and tell me to never mind why i took it from pop and i took it from ace and i been taking it from these three while youve been off at your college learning your way out of this mess i aint gonna take it no more the hard bitterness faded from his eyes and he took my two hands in his youre right jenny he said there are things you ought to know come out to the porch swing and ill tell you dont make it a long story deucy called after us ardith potters comin over tonight and we got things to discuss but it was a long story that pembrook told me one that went back through the years to the time before i was born all the boys knew it but pop had sworn them on the bible never to tell me it accounted for all the things id wondered about and never had the gumption to ask if i had asked they wouldnt have told me although pembrook said he was mighty tempted from time to time because it was my life and i had a right to know he told me that pop wasnt my true father that mr carpenter was he told me that about a month after i was born our mother had told pop the truth and packed her bag and said she was running off with mr carpenter to have a better life than scratching around on a poor old dirt farm he told me that pop had choked the life out of her right there in the bedroom with me looking on with my blind baby eyes from the cradle beside the bed and then pop had gone to mr carpenter and told him the whole thing and got him to hush it up because the scandal wouldnt have done anybody any good they gave out that our mother had died of childbirth fever the tears were rolling down my face but i managed to ask how could you keep on living here after he did that well said pembrook ace was the oldest and he wasnt but twelve we had nowhere else to go and he was our father what happened then i asked why did pop run off he didnt said pembrook he lies buried under mr carpenters rose garden he went on to tell me how the years went by and pop took up drinking and the farm went even further downhill until it was just a wasteland then one day pop got it into his head that mr carpenter ought to be paying money to take care of his child meaning me he went up to the carpenter house full of liquor and hate and demanded a thousand dollars pembrook and ace tagged along behind and listened outside the window of a room that was full of books and a big desk and a hunting rifle on the wall over the fireplace i seen that room i told him miz carpenter calls it his study pembrook nodded thats where pop got it he said how he and ace heard them arguing in the room and mr carpenter shouted that it was blackmail and he wouldnt stand for it and then there was a lot of scuffling around with pop shouting that he would kill mr carpenter for ruining his life and finally there was a shot just the one shot but it was enough they peeked over the window sill and saw pop lying on the rug bleeding his life out and mr carpenter standing there like a statue with the rifle in his hands they were about to run away home but mr carpenter saw them and made them come into the house and help him carry pop out to the rose garden the three of them dug up the roses and put pop in the ground and planted the roses back on top of him then mr carpenter told them to get on home and keep their mouths shut or hed have the marshal come and chuck us all off the farm and into reform school and they did until this minute i guess said pembrook i guess thats why ace is so wild but thats not the way to fix it up thats why im studying to be a lawyer one of these days ill know how to take care of mr carpenter legally and make it stick so thats why i dont want you going back there jenny youre likely to spoil my plan and i it isnt good for him to be reminded that you exist i need to get him off guard when im ready i wiped my eyes and blew my nose and said thank you pembrook for telling me now i understand and you wont go back im going to bed and i did but i didnt sleep i lay there pondering over the things that pembrook had told me trying to find the right and the wrong of it our mother was maybe wrong for pleasuring herself with mr carpenter but if she hadnt i wouldnt be here pop was wrong for taking life away from our mother but she gave him cause in his eyes mr carpenter was wrong for shooting pop but the taggert blood was up and pop probably attacked him first hardest of all to think about was me being mr carpenters daughter if it was true and he knew it how could he have let me live all these hard years as sweet baby jenny taggert while that other girl that claudia had everything her heart desired and then some just before dawn i decided what to do the boys even pembrook were all sound asleep i got up quiet as a mouse and dressed in our mothers greenandwhite polkadot dress and my hightop sneakers and snuck out to the barn the barn used to be a busy place but it was still and empty that morning no more cows to bellow for me to come and milk them no horses to gaze sadeyed after an apple or a carrot way in the back behind the piles of rotten harness in a dark corner draped over with cobwebs i found what i was looking for it was a can of stuff that pop used to put down to kill the rats that infested the barn and ate their way through the winter fodder there wasnt much left in the can and what there was looked dry and caked maybe it was so old it wouldnt even work any more but i scooped some out with a teaspoon and put it into one of deucys bull durham pouches and set off down the road i kept up a good pace because i wanted to get there before mr carpenter went off to the bank and before the boys woke up and came after me in pembrooks car the morning was fresh and cool and i didnt sweat one bit when i got to the carpenter house the milkman was just driving away i went around to the back picked up the two quarts of milk and knocked at the back door mrs carpenter opened up she looked sleepyeyed but pleased to see me why jenny she said youre here bright and early come in come in yes maam i said i came to make breakfast well thats wonderful mr carpenter is shaving hell be down in a few minutes he likes two fourminute eggs i never can get them right two slices of toast and lots of strong black coffee and now that youre here i think ill go back to bed and get a little more beauty sleep she giggled like a silly girl waved at me and pranced out i put the milk away and started in making the coffee there was an electric coffee pot but my coffee is good because i make it the oldfashioned way i boiled up some water and when it was bubbling away i threw in the ground coffee lots of it to make it nice and strong then i turned the fire down to keep it hot while it brewed and i cracked an egg so i could have an eggshell to throw in to make it clear and i emptied out the stuff that was in the tobacco pouch right into the pot when i heard his footsteps on the stairs i put on another pot to boil up water for his eggs he came into the kitchen smiling and smelling sweet well jenny he said you came back im glad because you and i are going to get along just fine youll be happy here ill see to that i got out a cup and saucer i been hearing things mr carpenter i said things i never dreamed of he frowned what things have you been hearing jenny i poured coffee into the cup i hear that youre my daddy he sank down into a kitchen chair yes he said thats true enough i put the cup and saucer on the counter to let it cool off a bit so it wouldnt be too hot for him to take a nice big swallow i hear that you shot our pop and buried him in your rose garden theyre mighty pretty roses you got out there he held his head in his two hands they swore never to tell you those boys swore pembrook told me because hes afraid ill come to some harm in your house i set the cup and saucer on the table in front of him oh jenny sweet baby jenny i would never harm you if anything id like to make up for all those years i tried to put you out of my mind id like you to come and live here and be my daughter and let me give you all the things you should have had dont call me that im not a baby any more no youre not youre a fine lovely woman just like your mother was god how i loved that woman she was the only wonderful thing that ever happened in my whole life i wanted to take her away with me we were all set to go we could have gone to some other town or to a big city where no one knew us wed have taken you along and wed have been happy instead she died pop killed her because of you you know that too he sighed yes he killed her and i killed him and ive been living out my days in an agony of remorse theres no one i can talk to clemmie doesnt know any of this sometimes i wish i were dead drink your coffee the water for his eggs was boiling gently i rolled the two eggs into the pot and stuck two slices of bread into the toaster he left the table and came to where i was working jenny he put his hands on my shoulders and turned me around to face him what can i do to make it up to you ill do anything in my power and believe me thats a lot you name it its yours i thought a minute would it be right or wrong to take from this man i was having my usual trouble figuring out the difference between the two would it be right or wrong to let him drink the coffee then i said could you put pembrook through law school consider it done and earl and wesley can you find jobs for them theyre good workers only down on their luck tell them to come to the bank and what about deucy would you get him a new guitar and a ticket to nashville he sings real fine not only that i know johnny cash personally well work something out now this ones hard can you get ace out of jail and set him on a straight path the warden is clemmies cousin and i own a ranch in wyoming he can go there and work off his wildness but what about you jenny what can i do for you i shrugged oh i guess ill just live here for a while i can help mrs carpenter and sort of keep an eye on things he hugged me and planted a big kiss on my cheek thats my girl he said thats what i was hoping youd say youll never regret it mmm that coffee smells good he was heading back to the table and his coffee cup but i got there first and swiped it out from under his nose thats coffees cold i said come to think of it the whole batch is bitter i tasted it before you came down ill make some fresh i poured all the coffee down the drain and dished him up his eggs and toast we drank the fresh coffee together and he went off to his bank and thats the way it is now pembrooks way is better and hes studying real hard hell graduate sooner now that he doesnt have to work his way through earl and wesley really like being bank tellers and deucy has his leopardskin cadillac and all the girls he can handle although he says he misses the porch swing ace sent a photograph of himself on a horse wearing a big old cowboy hat he looks funny but he says hes doing fine and me every day while the roses are blooming i cut some and put them in the house mrs carpenter just loves them im waiting someday us taggerts are gonna dig up that rose garden wild mustard marcia muller marcia muller b is one of the most celebrated and versatile writers of crime fiction to debut in the last quarter of the twentieth century born in detroit and educated at the university of michigan she lives in northern california the setting for most of her fiction though it caused barely a ripple at the time of its publication mullers edwin of the iron shoes is now accorded primacy in one of the major trends of recent decades the female privateeye novel all previous efforts in this line demand an asterisk characters like carter browns mavis seidlitz henry kanes maria trent and g g ficklings honey west were male wishfulfillment fantasies not to be taken seriously fran hustons nicole sweet in the rich get it all was an attempt at a more realistic character but was actually the work of a man ron s miller using an androgynous pseudonym and the first of the wave of femalebyfemale private eyes maxine ocallaghans delilah west appeared in print in a short story but not in a novel until sharon mccone did not return for a second case until ask the cards a question the same year her two most famous female pi colleagues sue graftons kinsey millhone and sara paretskys vi warshawski made their debuts but has averaged about a book a year since mccone differs from most earlier private eyes in other ways than gender she is not the traditional loner but part of an organization the all souls legal cooperative and her professional and personal relationships with her colleagues are important to her this leads to mullers other and more subtle distinction she was one of the pioneers of the nowgeneral practice of equipping the series sleuth with a large supporting cast of friends family and coworkers that recur from book to book unfortunately few of the writers who have adopted this practice are able to do it as well as muller does in she married novelist bill pronzini with whom she has collaborated on three novels beginning with double in which mccone shares an investigation with pronzinis nameless detective a shortstory collection many anthologies and the valuable reference volume midnights the aficionados guide to mystery and detective fiction muller has also written series about two amateur detectives museum curator elena oliverez who appeared in the tree of death and two subsequent novels and art security consultant joanna stark the first of whose three appearances was the cavalier in white among mullers honors is a lifetime achievement award from the private eye writers of america appropriately wild mustard one of the earliest sharon mccone short stories comes from the pwas first anthology the eyes have it the first time i saw the old japanese woman i was having brunch at the restaurant above the ruins of san franciscos sutro baths the woman squatted on the slope halfway between its cypresscovered top and the flooded ruins of the old bathhouse she was uprooting vegetation and stuffing it into a green plastic sack i wonder what shes picking i said to my friend greg he glanced out the window raising one darkblond eyebrow his homicide cops eye assessing the scene probably something edible that grows wild she looks poor its a good way to save grocery money indeed the woman did look like the indigent old ladies one sometimes saw in japantown she wore a shapeless jacket and trousers and her feet were clad in sneakers a gray scarf wound around her head have you ever been down there i asked greg motioning at the ruins the onceelegant baths had been destroyed by fire all that remained now were crumbling foundations half submerged in water seagulls swam on its glossy surface and beyond the surf tossed against the rocks no you no ive always meant to but the path is steep and i never have the right shoes when i come here greg smiled teasingly sharon youd let your private eyes instinct be suppressed for lack of hiking boots i shrugged maybe im not really that interested maybe not greg often teased me about my sleuthing instinct but in reality i suspected he was proud of my profession an investigator for all souls cooperative the legal services plan i had dealt with a full range of cases from murder to the mystery of a redwood hot tub that didnt hold water a couple of the murders id solved had been in gregs bailiwick and this had given rise to both rivalry and romance in the months that passed my interest in the old japanese woman was piqued every sunday that we went there and we went there often because the restaurant was a favorite the woman was scouring the slope foraging forwhat one sunday in early spring greg and i sat in our window booth watching the woman climb slowly down the dirt path to complement the season she had changed her gray headscarf for bright yellow the slope swarmed with people enjoying the release from the winter rains on the far barren side where no vegetation had taken hold an abandoned truck leaned at a precarious angle at the bottom of the cliff near the baths people scrambled down inspected the old truck then went to walk on the concrete foundations or disappeared into a nearby cave when the waitress brought our check i said ive watched long enough lets go down there and explore greg grinned reaching in his pocket for change but you dont have the right shoes face it ill never have the right shoes lets go we can ask the old woman what shes picking he stood up im glad you finally decided to investigate her she might be up to something sinister dont be silly he ignored me yeah the private eye side of you has finally won out or is it your indian blood tracking instinct papoose i glared at him deciding that for that comment he deserved to pay the check my oneeighth shoshone ancestry which for some reason had emerged to make me a blackhaired throwback in a family of scotchirish towheads had prompted gregs dubbing me papoose it was a nickname i did not favor we left the restaurant and passed through the chain link fence to the path a strong wind whipped my long hair about my head and i stopped to tie it back the path wound in switchbacks past huge gnarled geranium plants and through a thicket on the other side of it the woman squatted pulling up what looked like weeds when i approached she smiled at me a gold tooth flashing hello i said weve been watching you and wondered what you were picking many good things grow here this month it is the wild mustard she held up a spring i took it sniffing its pungency you should try it she added it is good for you maybe i will i slipped the yellow flower through my buttonhole and turned to greg fat chance he said when do you ever eat anything healthy only when you force me i have to otherwise it would be hershey bars day in and day out so what im not in bad shape it was true even on this steep slope i wasnt winded greg smiled his eyes moving appreciatively over me no youre not we continued down toward the ruins past a sign that advised us caution cliff and sure area extremely dangerous people have been swept from the rocks and drowned i stopped balancing with my hand on gregs arm and removed my shoes better footsore than swept away we approached the abandoned truck following the same impulse that had drawn other climbers its blue paint was rusted and there had been a fire in the engine compartment everything including the seats and steering wheel had been stripped somebody even tried to take the front axle a voice beside me said but the fire had fused the bolts i turned to face a friendly looking sunbrowned youth of about fifteen he wore dirty jeans and a torn tshirt yeah another voice added this boy was about the same age a wispy attempt at a moustache sprouted on his upper lip theres hardly anything left and its only been here a few weeks vandalism greg said thats it the first boy nodded people hang around here and drink late at night they get bored he motioned at a group of unsavorylooking men who were sitting on the edge of the baths with a couple of sixpacks destructions a very popular sport these days greg watched the men for a moment with a professional eye then touched my elbow we skirted the ruins and went toward the cave i stopped at its entrance and listened to the roar of the surf come on greg said i followed him inside feet sinking into coarse sand that quickly became packed mud the cave was really a tunnel about eight feet high through crevices in the wall on the ocean side i saw spray flung high from the rolling waves at the foot of the cliff it would be fatal to be swept down through those jagged rocks greg reached the other end i hurried as fast as my bare feet would permit and stood next to him the precipitous drop to the sea made me clutch at his arm above us rocks towered i guess if you were a good climber you could go up and then back to the road i said maybe but i wouldnt chance it like the sign says right i turned suddenly apprehensive at the mouth of the tunnel two of the disreputable men stood beer cans in hand lets go greg if he noticed the edge to my voice he didnt comment we walked in silence through the tunnel the men vanished when we emerged into the sunlight they were back with the others opening fresh beers the boys we had spoken with earlier were perched on the abandoned truck and they waved at us as we started up the path and so through the spring we continued to go to our favorite restaurant on sundays always waiting for a window booth the old japanese woman exchanged her yellow headscarf for a red one the abandoned truck remained nose down toward the baths provoking much criticism of the park service people walked their dogs on the slope children balanced precariously on the ruins in spite of the warning sign the men lolled about and drank beer the teenaged boys came every week and often were joined by friends at the truck then one sunday the old woman failed to show where is she i asked greg glancing at my watch for the third time maybe shes picked everything there is to pick down there nonsense theres always something to pick weve watched her for almost a year that old couple is down there walking their german shepherd the teenagers are here that young couple we talked to last week is over by the tunnel wheres the old japanese woman she could be sick theres a lot of flu going around hell she might have died she wasnt all that young the words made me lose my appetite for my chocolate cream pie maybe we should check on her greg sighed sharon save your sleuthing for paying clients dont make everything into a mystery greg had often accused me of allowing what he referred to as my womans intuition to rule my logic something i hated even more than references to my tracking instinct i knew it was no such thing i merely gave free rein to the hunches that every good investigator follows it was not a subject i cared to argue at the moment however so i let it drop but the next morning monday i sat in the converted closet that served as my office at all souls still puzzling over the womans absence a file on a particularly boring tenants dispute lay open on the desk in front of me finally i shut it and clattered down the hall of the big brown victorian toward the front door ill be back in a couple of hours i told ted the secretary he nodded his fingers never pausing as he plied his new selectric i gave the typewriter a resentful glance it to my mind was an extravagance and the money it was costing could have been better spent on salaries all souls which charged clients on a slidingfee scale according to their incomes paid so low that several of the attorneys were compensated by living in free rooms on the second floor i lived in a studio apartment in the mission district it seemed to get smaller every day grumbling to myself i went out to my car and headed for the restaurant above the sutro baths the old woman who gathers wild mustard on the cliff i said to the cashier was she here yesterday he paused i think so yesterday was sunday shes always here on sunday i noticed her about eight when we opened up she always comes early and stays until about two but she had been gone at eleven do you know her do you know where she lives he looked curiously at me no i dont i thanked him and went out feeling foolish i stood beside the great highway for a moment then started down the dirt path toward where the wild mustard grew halfway there i met the two teenagers why werent they in school dropouts i guessed they started by avoiding my eyes like kids will do i stopped them hey you were here yesterday right the mustached one nodded did you see the old japanese woman who picks the weeds he frowned dont remember her when did you get here oh late really late there was this party saturday night i dont remember seeing her either the other one said but maybe shed already gone by the time we got here i thanked them and headed down toward the ruins a little farther on in the dense thicket through which the path wound something caught my eye and i came to an abrupt stop a neat pile of green plastic bags lay there and on top of them was a pair of scuffed black shoes obviously she had come here on the bus wearing her street shoes and had only switched to sneakers for her work why would she leave without changing her shoes i hurried through the thicket toward the patch of wild mustard there deep in the weeds its color blending with their foliage was another bag i opened it it was a quarter full of wilting mustard greens she hadnt had much time to forage not much time at all seriously worried now i rushed up to the great highway from the phone booth inside the restaurant i dialled gregs direct line at the sfpd busy i retrieved my dime and called all souls any calls teds typewriter rattled in the background no but hank wants to talk to you hank zahn my boss with a sinking heart i remembered the conference we had had scheduled for half an hour ago he came on the line where the hell are you uh in a phone booth what i mean is why arent you here i can explain i should have known what greg warned me youd be off investigating something greg when did you talk to him fifteen minutes ago he wants you to call its important thanks wait a minute i hung up and dialed greg again he answered sounding rushed without preamble i explained what id found in the wild mustard patch thats why i called you his voice was unusually gentle we got word this morning what word my stomach knotted an identification on a body that washed up near devils slide yesterday evening apparently she went in at low tide or she would have been swept much farther to sea i was silent sharon yes im here you know how it is out there the signs warn against climbing the current is bad but id never in almost a year seen the old japanese woman near the sea she was always up on the slope where her weeds grew when was low tide greg yesterday around eight in the morning around the time the restaurant cashier had noticed her and several hours before the teenagers had arrived and in between what had happened out there i hung up and stood at the top of the slope pondering what should i look for what could i possibly find i didnt know but i felt certain the old woman had not gone into the sea by accident she had scaled those cliffs with the best of them i started down noting the shoes and the bags in the thicket marching resolutely past the wild mustard toward the abandoned truck i walked all around it examining its exterior and interior but it gave me no clues then i started toward the tunnel in the cliff the area so crowded on sundays was sparsely populated now san franciscans were going about their usual business and visitors from the tour buses parked at nearby cliff house were leery of climbing down here the teenagers were the only other people in sight they stood by the mouth of the tunnel watching me something in their postures told me they were afraid i quickened my steps the boys inclined their heads toward one another then they whirled and ran into the mouth of the tunnel i went after them again i had the wrong shoes i kicked them off and ran through the coarse sand the boys were halfway down the tunnel one of them paused frantically surveying a rift in the wall i prayed he wouldnt go that way into the boiling waves below he turned and ran after his companion they disappeared at the end of the tunnel i hit the hardpacked dirt and increased my pace near the end i slowed and approached more cautiously at first i thought the boys had vanished but then i looked down they crouched on a ledge below their faces were scared and young so young i stopped where they could see me and made a calming motion come on back up i said i wont hurt you the mustached one shook his head look theres no place you can go you cant swim in that surf simultaneously they glanced down they looked back at me and both shook their heads i took a step forward whatever happened it couldnt have suddenly i felt the ground crumble my foot slipped and i pitched forward i fell to one knee my arms frantically searching for a support oh god the mustached boy cried not you too he stood up swaying his arms outstretched i kept sliding the boy reached up and caught me by the arm he staggered back toward the edge and we both fell to the hard rocky ground for a moment we both lay there panting when i finally sat up i saw we were inches from the sheer drop to the surf the boy sat up too his scared eyes on me his companion was flattened against the cliff wall its okay i said shakily i thought youd fall just like the old woman the boy beside me said it was an accident wasnt it he nodded we didnt mean for her to fall were you teasing her yeah we always did for fun but this time we went too far we took her purse she chased us through the tunnel to here yes and then she slipped the other boy moved away from the wall honest we didnt mean for it to happen it was just that she was so old she slipped we watched her fall his companion said we couldnt do anything what did you do with the purse threw it in after her there were only two dollars in it two lousy dollars his voice held a note of wonder can you imagine chasing us all the way down here for two bucks i stood up carefully grasping the rock for support okay i said lets get out of here they looked at each other and then down at the surf come on well talk some more i know you didnt mean for her to die and you saved my life they scrambled up keeping their distance from me their faces were pale under their tans their eyes afraid they were so young to them products of the creditcard age fighting to the death for two dollars was inconceivable and the japanese woman had been so old for her eking out a living with the wild mustard two dollars had probably meant the difference between life and death i wondered if theyd ever understand jemima shore at the sunny grave antonia fraser lady antonia fraser b the londonborn daughter of lord longford earned bachelors and masters degrees in history at lady margaret hall oxford and served as editor of the publisher weidenfeld and nicolsons kings and queens of england series before her marriage to hugh fraser in her first books were childrens accounts of king arthur and robin hood followed by dolls and a history of toys beginning with the hugely successful mary queen of scots she became a bestselling author of popular british history and biography books on cromwell james i charles ii and the wives of henry viii followed her broad literary background also includes a translation from the french of christian diors autobiography radio and television plays and the editorship of a number of poetry anthologies her first marriage having been dissolved in she married the playwright harold pinter in she turned to crime fiction with quiet as a nun the first novel about jemima shore one of the first and most successful sleuths to come from the world of broadcast journalism in the final revised edition of his crimefiction history bloody murder julian symons wrote that fraser might reasonably be called a feminist crime writer but she could also be called a cosy one her writing has an evident pleasure in what she is doing that is engaging but her individual distinction is in the construction of particularly clever plots of which cool repentance seems to me the most brilliant detection with a touch of romance in an exotic background show the author and character at their best in jemima shore at the sunny grave this is your graveyard in the sun the tall young man standing in her path was singing the words lightly but clearly it took jemima shore a moment to realize exactly what message he was intoning to the tune of the famous calypso then she stepped back it was a sinister and not particularly welcoming little parody this is my island in the sun where my people have toiled since time begun ever since she had arrived in the caribbean she seemed to have had the tune echoing in her ears how old was it how many years was it since the inimitable harry belafonte had first implanted it in everybodys consciousness no matter whatever its age the calypso was still being sung today with charm vigour and a certain relentlessness on bow island and on the other west indian islands she had visited in the course of her journey it was not the only tune to be heard of course the loud noise of music she had discovered was an inseparable part of caribbean life starting with the airport the heavy irresistible beat of the steel band the honeyed wail of the singers all this was happening somewhere if not everywhere all over the islands late into the night the joyous sound of freedom of dancing of drinking rum punch and for the tourists at any rate the sound of holiday it wasnt the sound of holiday for jemima shore investigator or not officially so that was all to the good jemima being one of those people temperamentally whose best holidays combined some work with a good deal of pleasure she could hardly believe it when megalith television her employers had agreed to a program which took her away from freezing britain to the sunny caribbean in late january this was a reversal of normal practice by which cy fredericks jemimas boss and the effective boss of megalith was generally to be found relaxing in the caribbean in february while jemima herself if she got there at all was liable to be dispatched there in the inconvenient humidity of august and it was a fascinating project to boot this was definitely her lucky year this is my island in the sun but what the young man facing her had actually sung was your graveyard in the sun hers or whose since the man was standing between jemima and the historic grave she had come to visit it was possible that he was being proprietorial as well as aggressive on second thought surely not it was a joke a cheerful joke on a cheerful very sunny day but the young mans expression was it seemed to her more threatening than that jemima gazed back with that special sweet smile so familiar to viewers of british television these same viewers were also aware from past experience that jemima sweet as her smile might be stood no nonsense from anyone at least not on her program on closer inspection the man was not really as young as all that she saw someone of perhaps roughly her own age early thirties he was white although so deeply tanned that she guessed he wasnt a tourist but one of the small loyal european population of bow island a place fiercely proud of its recent independence from a much larger neighbor the strangers height unlike his youth was not an illusion he towered over jemima and she herself was not short he was also handsome or would have been except for an oddly formed rather large nose with a high bridge to it and a pronounced aquiline curve but if the nose marred the regularity of his features the impression left was not unattractive he was wearing whitish cotton shorts like more or less every male on bow island black or white his orange tshirt bore the familiar island logo or crest the outline of a bow in black and a black hand drawing it back beneath the logo was printed one of the enormous variety of local slogans cheerful again designed to make a play upon the islands name this one read this is the end of the sunbow no in that friendly tshirt he was surely not intending to be aggressive in that case the odd thing about the whole encounter was that the stranger still stood absolutely still in jemimas path she could glimpse the large stone archer tomb just behind him which she recognized from the postcards for a smallish place bow island was remarkably rich in historic relics nelson in his time had visited it with his fleet for like its neighbors bow island had found itself engulfed in the napoleonic wars two hundred or so years before that first british then french then british again had invaded and settled the island which had once belonged to caribs and before that arawaks finally into this melting pot africans had been brought forcibly to work the sugar plantations on which its wealth depended all these elements in various degrees had gone to make up the people now known casually among themselves as the bolanders the archer tomb the existence of which had in a sense brought jemima across the atlantic belonged to the period of the second and final british settlement here was buried the most celebrated governor in bow islands history sir valentine archer even its name commemorated his long reign bow island had originally been called by the name of a saint and while it was true the island was vaguely formed in the shape of a bow it was governor archer who had made the change to signify ritually that this particular archer was in command of this particular bow jemima knew that the monument splendidly carved would show sir valentine archer with isabella his wife beside him this double stone bier was capped with a white wood structure reminiscent of a small church done either to give the whole monument additional importance although it must always have dominated the small churchyard by its sheer size or to protect it from the weather jemima had read that there were no archer children inscribed on the tomb contrary to the usual seventeenthcentury practice this was because as a local historian delicately put it governor archer had been as a parent to the entire island or in the words of another purely local calypso across the sea came old sir valentine he came to be your daddy and he came to be mine in short no one monument could comprise the progeny of a man popularly supposed to have sired over a hundred children legitimate and illegitimate the legitimate line was however now on the point of dying out it was to see miss isabella archer officially at least the last of her race that jemima had come to the caribbean she hoped to make a program about the old lady and her home archer plantation house alleged to be untouched in its decoration these fifty years she wanted also to interview her generally about the changes miss archer had seen in her lifetime in this part of the world greg harrison said the man standing in jemimas path suddenly and this is my sister coralie a girl who had been standing unnoticed by jemima in the shade of the arched church porch stepped rather shyly forward she too was extremely brown and her blond hair whitened almost to flax by the sun was pulled back into a ponytail his sister was there a resemblance coralie harrison was wearing a similar orange tshirt but otherwise she was not much like her brother she was quite short for one thing and her features were appealing rather than beautiful and perhaps fortunately she lacked her brothers commanding nose welcome to bow island miss shore she began but her brother interrupted her he put out a hand large muscular and burnt to nut color by the sun i know why youre here and i don t like it said greg harrison stirring up forgotten things why dont you leave miss izzy to die in peace the contrast between his apparently friendly handshake and the hostile if calmly spoken words was disconcerting im jemima shore she said though he obviously knew that am i going to be allowed to inspect the archer tomb or is it to be across your dead body jemima smiled again with sweetness my dead body greg harrison smiled back in his turn the effect however was not particularly warming have you come armed to the teeth then before she could answer he began to hum the famous calypso again jemima imagined the words this is your graveyard in the sun then he added might not be such a bad idea that when you start to dig up things that should be buried jemima decided it was time for action neatly sidestepping greg harrison she marched firmly toward the archer tomb there lay the carved couple she read sacred to the memory of sir valentine archer first governor of this island and his only wife isabella daughter of randal oxford gentleman she was reminded briefly of her favorite philip larkin poem about the arundel monument beginning the earl and countess lie in stone and ending all that remains of us is love but that couple lay a thousand miles away in the cloistered cool of chichester cathedral here the hot tropical sun burnt down on her naked head she found she had taken off her large straw hat as a token of respect and quickly clapped it back on again here too in contrast to the very englishlooking stone church with pointed gothic windows beyond there were palm trees among the graves instead of yews their slender trunks bending like giraffes necks in the breeze she had once romantically laid white roses on the arundel monument it was as the memory of the gesture returned to her that she spied the heap of bright pink and orange hibiscus blossoms lying on the stone before her a shadow fell across it tina puts them there greg harrison had followed her every day she can manage it most days then she tells miss izzy what shes done touching isnt it but he did not make it sound as if he found it especially touching in fact there was so much bitterness even malevolence in his voice that for a moment standing as she was in the sunny graveyard jemima felt quite chilled or is it revolting he added the malevolence now quite naked greg murmured coralie harrison faintly as if in protest tina jemima said thats miss archers miss izzys companion weve corresponded for the moment i cant remember her other name shes known as tina archer these days i think youll find when she wrote to you she probably signed the letter tina harrison harrison looked at jemima sardonically but she had genuinely forgotten the surname of the companion it was after all not a particularly uncommon one they were interrupted by a loud hail from the road jemima saw a young black man at the wheel of one of the convenient roofless minis everyone seemed to drive around bow island he stood up and started to shout something greg cora you coming on to she missed the rest of it something about a boat and a fish coralie harrison looked suddenly radiant and for a moment even greg harrison actually looked properly pleased he waved back hey joseph come and say hello to miss jemima shore of bbc television megalith television jemima interrupted but in vain harrison continued you heard joseph shes making a program about miss izzy the man leapt gracefully out of the car and approached up the palmlined path jemima saw that he too was extremely tall and like the vast majority of the bolanders she had so far met he had the air of being a natural athlete whatever the genetic mix in the past of carib and african and other people that had produced them the bolanders were certainly wonderfullooking he kissed coralie on both cheeks and patted her brother on the back miss shore meet joseph but even before greg harrison had pronounced the surname his mischievous expression had warned jemima what it was likely to be joseph archer undoubtedly one of the ten thousand descendants of the philoprogenitive old gentleman at whose tomb you are so raptly gazing all that remains of us is love indeed thought jemima irreverently as she shook joseph archers hand with all due respect to philip larkin it seemed that a good deal more remained of sir valentine than that oh you find were all called archer round here murmured joseph pleasantly unlike greg harrison he appeared to be genuinely welcoming as for sir valentinehe pronounced it syllable by syllable like the calypsodont pay too much attention to the stories otherwise how come were not all living in that fine old archer plantation house instead of merely my exwife no coralie dont protest i could kill her for what shes doing again jemima felt a chill at the extent of the violence in greg harrisons voice come joseph well see about that fish of yours come on coralie he strode off unsmiling accompanied by joseph who did smile coralie however stopped to ask jemima if there was anything she could do for her her manner was still shy but in her brothers absence a great deal more friendly jemima also had the strong impression that coralie harrison wanted to communicate something to her something she did not necessarily want her brother to hear i could perhaps interpret explain coralie stopped jemima said nothing certain things went on coralie there are so many layers in a place like this just because its small an outsider doesnt always understand and im the outsider of course i am jemima had started to sketch the tomb for future reference something for which she had a minor but useful talent she forbore to observe truthfully if platitudinously that an outsider could also sometimes see local matters rather more clearly than those involved she wanted to know what else coralie had to say would she explain for example gregs quite blatant dislike of his former wife but an impatient cry from her brother now in the car beside joseph meant that coralie for the time being had nothing more to add she fled down the path and jemima was left to ponder with renewed interest on her forthcoming visit to isabella archer of archer plantation house it was a visit which would include she took it a meeting with miss archers companion who like her employer was currently dwelling in comfort there comfort even from a distance later that day the square lowbuilt mansion had a comfortable air more than that it conveyed an impression of gracious and oldfashioned tranquillity as jemima drove her own rented mini up the long avenue of palm trees much taller than those in the churchyard she could fancy she was driving back in time to the days of governor archer his copious banquets parties and balls all served by black slaves at that moment a young woman with coffeecolored skin and short black curly hair appeared on the steps unlike the maids in jemimas hotel who wore a pastiche of bygone servants costume at dinner brightly colored dresses to the ankle whitemuslin aprons and turbans this girl was wearing an uptotheminute scarlet haltertop and cutaway shorts revealing most of her smooth brown legs tina archer for so she introduced herself it did not surprise jemima shore one bit to discover that tina archer formerly harrison was easy to get on with anyone who left the hostile and graceless greg harrison was already ahead in jemimas book but with tina archer chatting away at her side so chic and even trendy in her appearance the revelation of the interior of the house was far more of a shock to her than it would otherwise have been there was nothing nothing at all of the slightest modernity about it dust and cobwebs were not literally there perhaps but they were suggested in its gloom its heavy wooden furniture where were the light cane chairs so suitable to the climate and above all in its desolation archer plantation house reminded her of poor miss havishams timewarp home in great expectations and still worse there was an atmosphere of sadness hanging over the whole interior or perhaps it was mere loneliness a kind of somber sterile grandeur you felt must stretch back centuries all this was in violent contrast to the sunshine still brilliant in the late afternoon the rioting bushes of brightly colored tropical flowers outside none of it had jemima expected information garnered in london had led her to form quite a different picture of archer plantation house something far more like her original impression as she drove down the avenue of palm trees of antique mellow grace just as jemima was adapting to this surprise she discovered the figure of miss archer herself to be equally astonishing that is to say having adjusted rapidly from free and easy tina to the moldering somber house she now had to adjust with equal rapidity all over again for the very first inspection of the old lady known by jemima to be at least eighty quickly banished all thoughts of miss havisham here was no aged abandoned bride forlorn in the decaying weddingdress of fifty years before miss izzy archer was wearing a coolie straw hat apparently tied under her chin with a duster a loose white mans shirt and faded bluejeans cut off at the knee on her feet were a pair of what looked like childs brown sandals from the look of her she had either just taken a shower wearing all this or been swimming she was dripping wet making large pools on the rich carpet and dark polished boards of the formal drawing room all darkred brocade and swagged fringed curtains where she had received jemima it was possible to see this even in the filtered light seeping through the heavy brown shutters which shut out the view of the sea oh dont fuss so tina dear exclaimed miss izzy impatiently although tina had in fact said nothing what do a few drops of water matter stains what stains tina still had not spoken let the government put it right when the time comes although tina archer continued to be silent gazing amiably even cheerfully at her employer nevertheless in some way she stiffened froze in her polite listening attitude instinctively jemima knew that she was in some way upset now dont be silly tina dont take on dear the old lady was now shaking herself free of water like a small but stout dog you know what i mean if you dont who does since half the time i dont know what i mean let alone what i say you can put it all right one day is that better after all youll have plenty of money to do it you can afford a few new covers and carpets so saying miss izzy taking jemima by the hand and attended by the stillsilent tina led the way to the farthest darkred sofa looking remarkably wet from top to toe she sat down firmly in the middle of it it was in this way that jemima first realized that archer plantation house would not necessarily pass to the newly independent government of bow island on its owners death miss izzy if she had her way was intending to leave it all house and fortune to tina among other things this meant that jemima was no longer making a program about a house destined shortly to be a national museum which was very much part of the arrangement that had brought her to the island and had incidentally secured the friendly cooperation of that same new government was all this new how new did the new government know if the will had been signed they must know ive signed the will this morning dear miss archer pronounced triumphantly with an uncanny ability to answer unspoken questions i went swimming to celebrate i always celebrate things with a good swim so much more healthy than rum or champagne although theres still plenty of that in the cellar she paused so there you are arent you dear or there you will be here you will be thompson says therell be trouble of course what can you expect these days everything is trouble since independence not that im against independence far from it but everything new brings new trouble here in addition to all the old troubles so that the troubles get more and more on bow island no troubles ever go away why is that but miss izzy did not stop for an answer no im all for independence and i shall tell you all about that my dearshe turned to jemima and put one damp hand on her sleeveon your program im being a bolander born and bred you know it was true that miss izzy unlike tina for example spoke with the peculiar slightly singsong intonation of the islanders not unattractive to jemimas ears i was born in this very house eightytwo years ago in april went on miss izzy you shall come to my birthday party i was born during a hurricane a good start but my mother died in childbirth they should never have got in that newfangled doctor just because he came from england a total fool he was i remember him well they should have had a good bolander midwife then my mother wouldnt have died and my father would have had sons miss izzy was drifting away into a host of reminiscences and while these were supposed to be what jemima had come to hear her thoughts were actually racing off in quite a different direction trouble what trouble where did greg harrison for example stand in all this greg harrison who wanted miss izzy to be left to die in peace greg harrison who had been married to tina and was no longer tina archer now heiress to a fortune above all why was this forthright old lady intending to leave everything to her companion for one thing jemima did not know how seriously to treat the matter of tinas surname joseph archer had laughed off the whole subject of sir valentines innumerable descendants but perhaps the beautiful tina was in some special way connected to miss izzy she might be the product of some rather more recent union between a rakish archer and a bolander maiden more recent than the seventeenth century that is her attention was wrenched back to miss izzys reminiscing monologue by the mention of the archer tomb youve seen the grave tina has discovered its all a fraud a great big lie lying under the sun yes tina dear you once said that sir valentine archer my great great great an infinite number of greats followed before miss izzy finally pronounced the word grandfather but jemima had to admit that she did seem to be counting he had a great big lie perpetuated on his tombstone what miss izzy means this was the first time tina had spoken since they entered the darkened drawing room she was still standing while jemima and miss izzy sat dont tell me what i mean child rapped out the old lady her tone was imperious rather than indulgent tina might for a moment have been a plantation worker two hundred years earlier rather than an independentminded girl in the late twentieth century its the inscription which is a lie she wasnt his only wife the very inscription should have warned us tina wants to see justice done to poor little lucie anne and so do i independence indeed ive been independent all my life and im certainly not stopping now tell me miss shore youre a clever young woman from television why do you bother to contradict something unless its true all along thats the way you work all the time in television dont you jemima was wondering just how to answer this question diplomatically and without traducing her profession when tina firmly and this time successfully took over from her employer i read history at university in the uk jemima genealogical research is my speciality i was helping miss izzy put her papers in order for the museum or what was to be the museum then the request came for your program and i began to dig a little deeper thats how i found the marriage certificate old sir valentine did marry his young carib mistress known as lucie anne late in life long after his first wife died thats lucie anne who was the mother of his youngest two children he was getting old and for some reason he decided to marry her the church maybe in its way this has always been a godfearing island perhaps lucie anne who was very young and very beautiful put pressure on the old man using the church at any rate these last two children of all the hundreds he sired would have been legitimate and so questioned jemima in her most encouraging manner im descended from lucie anne and sir valentine of course tina returned sweet smile for sweet smile ive traced that too from the church records not too difficult given the strength of the church here not too difficult for an expert at all events oh ive got all sorts of blood like most of us round here including a spanish grandmother and maybe some french blood too but the archer descent is perfectly straightforward and clear tina seemed aware that jemima was gazing at her with respect did she however understand the actual tenor of jemimas thoughts this is a formidable person jemima was reflecting charming yes but formidable and ruthless maybe on occasion jemima was also to be frank wondering just how she was going to present this sudden change of angle in her program on megalith television on the one hand it might now be seen as a romantic ragstoriches story the discovery of the lost heiress on the other hand just supposing tina archer was not so much an heiress as an adventuress in that case what would megalith what did jemima shore make of a bright young woman putting across a load of false history on an innocent old lady in those circumstances jemima could understand how the man by the sunny grave might display his contempt for tina archer i met greg harrison by the archer tomb this morning jemima commented deliberately your exhusband i take it of course hes her exhusband it was miss izzy who chose to answer that nogood gregory harrison has been a nogood since the day he was born and that sister of his drifters not a job between them sailing fishing as if the world owes them a living half sister coralie is his half sister and she works in a hotel boutique tina spoke perfectly equably but once again jemima guessed that she was in some way put out greg is the nogood in that family for all her calm there was a hint of suppressed anger in her reference to her former husband with what bitterness that marriage must have ended nogood the pair of them youre well out of that marriage tina dear exclaimed miss izzy and do sit down child youre standing there like some kind of housekeeper and where is hazel anyway its nearly half past five itll begin to get dark soon we might go down to the terrace to watch the sun sink where is henry he ought to be bringing us some punch the archer plantation punch miss shore wait till you taste it one secret ingredient my father always said miss izzy was happily returning to the past ill get the punch said tina still on her feet didnt you say hazel could have the day off her sister is getting married over at tamarind creek henry has taken her then wheres the boy wheres whatshisname little joseph the old lady was beginning to sound petulant there isnt a boy any longer explained tina patiently just hazel and henry as for joseph well little joseph archer is quite grown up now isnt he of course he is i didnt mean that joseph he came to see me the other day wasnt there another boy called joseph perhaps that was before the war my father had a stable boy ill get the rum punch tina vanished swiftly and gracefully pretty creature murmured miss izzy after her archer blood it always shows they do say the bestlooking bolanders are still called archer but when tina returned the old ladys mood had changed again im cold and damp she declared i might get a chill sitting here and soon im going to be all alone in the house i hate being left alone ever since i was a little girl ive hated being alone everyone knows that tina you have to stay to dinner miss shore you must stay too its so lonely here by the sea what happens if someone breaks in dont frown there are plenty of bad people about thats one thing that hasnt gotten better since independence of course im staying replied tina easily ive arranged it with hazel jemima was wondering guiltily if she too ought to stay but it was the night of her hotels weekly party on the beach barbecue followed by dancing to a steel band jemima who loved to dance in the northern hemisphere was longing to try it here dancing under the stars by the sea sounded idyllic did miss izzy really need extra company her eyes met those of tina archer across the old ladys strawhatted head tina shook her head slightly after a sip of the famous rum punch whatever the secret ingredient it was the strongest she had yet tasted on the island jemima was able to make her escape in any case the punch was having a manifestly relaxing effect on miss izzy herself she became rapidly quite tipsy and jemima wondered how long she would actually stay awake the next time they met must be in the freshness of a morning jemima drove away just as the enormous red sun was rushing down below the horizon the beat of the waves from the shore pursued her archer plantation house was set in a lonely position on its own spit of land at the end of its own long avenue she could hardly blame miss izzy for not wanting to be abandoned there jemima listened to the sound of the waves until the very different noise of the steel band in the next village along the shore took over that transferred her thoughts temporarily from recent events at archer plantation house to the prospect of her evening ahead one way or another for a brief space of time she would stop thinking altogether about miss isabella archer that was because the beach party was at first exactly what jemima had expected relaxed goodnatured and noisy she found her cares gradually floating away as she danced and danced again with a series of partners english american and bolander to the beat of the steel band that rum punch of miss izzys with its secret ingredient must have been lethal because its effects seemed to stay with her for hours she decided she didnt even need the generous profferings of the hotel mixture a good deal weaker than miss izzys beneath its lavish surface scattering of nutmeg others however decided that the hotel punch was exactly what they did need all in all it was already a very good party long before the sliver of the new moon became visible over the nowblack waters of the caribbean jemima temporarily alone tilted back her head as she stood by the lapping waves at the edge of the beach and fixed the moon in her sights you going to wish on that new little moon she turned a tall man at least a head taller than she was was standing beside her on the sand she had not heard him the gentle noise of the waves masking his approach for a moment she didnt recognize joseph archer in his loose flowered shirt and long white trousers so different did he look from the fisherman encountered that noon at the graveside in this way it came about that the second part of the beach party was quite unexpected at least from jemimas point of view i ought to wish i ought to wish to make a good program i suppose that would be a good professional thing to do miss izzy archer and all that miss izzy archer plantation house bow island to say nothing of the archer tomb old sir valentine and all that she decided not to mention tina archer and all that for the time being all that he sighed listen jemima its good this band were saying its about the best on the island these days lets be dancing shall we then you and me can talk about all that in the morning in my office you know it was the distinct authority with which joseph archer spoke quite as much as the mention of his office which intrigued jemima before she lost herself still further in the rhythm of the dance which she had a feeling that with joseph archer to help her she was about to do she must find out just what he meant and for that matter just who he was the second question was easily answered it also provided the answer to the first joseph archer might or might not go fishing from time to time when he was offduty but he was also a member of the newly formed bolander government quite an important one in fact important in the eyes of the world in general and particularly important in the eyes of jemima shore investigator for joseph archer was the minister dealing with tourism his brief extending to such matters as conservation the bolander historic heritage and as he described it to herthe future national archer plantation house museum once again it didnt seem the appropriate moment to mention tina archer and her possible future ownership of the plantation house as joseph himself had said the morning would do for all that in his office in bowtown they danced on for a while and it was as jemima had suspected it would be something to lose herself in perhaps dangerously so the tune to this is my island in the sun was played and jemima never once heard the graveyard words in her imagination then joseph archer most politely and apparently regretfully said he had to leave he had an extremely early appointment and not with a fish either he added with a smile jemima felt a pang which she hoped didnt show but there was plenty of time wasnt there there would be other nights and other parties other nights on the beach as the moon waxed to full in the two weeks she had before she must return to england jemimas personal party stopped but the rest of the celebration went on late into the night spilling onto the sands even into the sea long after the sliver of the moon had vanished jemima sleeping fitfully and visited by dreams in which joseph archer tina and miss izzy executed some kind of elaborate dance not at all like the kind of island jumpup she had recently been enjoying heard the noise in the distance far away on archer plantations lonely peninsula the peace was broken not by a steel band but by the rough sound of the waves bashing against the rocks at its farthest point a stranger might have been surprised to see that the lights were still on in the great drawing room the shutters having been drawn back once the sun was gone but nobody born on bow island a fisherman out to sea for example would have found it at all odd everyone knew that miss izzy archer was frightened of the dark and liked to go to bed with all her lights blazing especially when hazel had gone to her sisters wedding and henry had taken her there another fact of island life which most bolanders would have known in her room overlooking the sea tossing in the big fourposter bed in which she had been born over eighty years ago miss izzy like jemima shore slept fitfully after a while she got out of bed and went to one of the long windows jemima would have found her nightclothes like her swimming costume bizarre for miss izzy wasnt wearing the kind of formal victorian nightdress which might have gone with the house rather she was using up as she quaintly put it her fathers ancient burgundysilk pajamas purchased many aeons ago in jermyn street and as the last sir john archer baronet had been several feet taller than his plump little daughter the long trouser legs trailed on the floor behind her miss izzy continued to stare out of the window her gaze followed the direction of the terrace which led in a series of parterres once grandly planted now overgrown down to the rocks and the sea although the waters themselves were mostly blackness the caribbean night was not entirely dark besides the light from the drawingroom windows streamed out onto the nearest terrace miss izzy rubbed her eyes then she turned back into the bedroom where the celebrated oil painting of sir valentine hung over the mantelpiece dominated the room rather confusedly she must have drunk far too much of that punch she decided that her ancestor was trying to encourage her to be valiant in the face of danger for the first time in her life she little isabella archer spoilt and petted izzy his last legitimate descendant no not his last legitimate descendant but the habits of a lifetime were difficult to break was being spurred on to something courageous by the hawklike gaze of the fierce old autocrat but im so old thought miss izzy then but not too old once you let people know youre not after all a coward she looked out of the window once more the effects of the punch were wearing off now she was quite certain of what she was seeing something dark darkly clad darkskinned what did it matter someone dark had come out of the sea and was now proceeding silently in the direction of the house i must be brave thought miss izzy she said aloud then hell be proud of me his brave girl whose brave girl no not sir valentines daddys brave girl her thoughts began to float away again into the past i wonder if daddy will take me on a swim with him to celebrate miss izzy started to go downstairs she had just reached the door of the drawing room and was standing looking into the decaying redvelvet interior still brightly illuminated at the moment when the blackclad intruder stepped into the room through the open window even before the intruder began to move softly toward her darkgloved hands outstretched miss izzy archer knew without doubt in her rapidly beating old heart that archer plantation the house in which she had been born was also the house in which she was about to die miss izzy archer is dead some person went and killed her last night a robber maybe it was joseph archer who broke the news to jemima the next morning he spoke across the broad desk of his formal office in bowtown his voice was hollow and distant only the bolander singsong to connect him with jemimas handsome dancing partner of the night before in his shortsleeved but officiallooking white shirt and dark trousers he looked once again completely different from the cheerful ragged fisherman jemima had first encountered this was indeed the rising young bolander politician she was seeing a member of the newly formed government of bow island even the tragic fact of the death the murder as it seemed of an old lady seemed to strike no chord of emotion in him then jemima looked again and saw what looked suspiciously like tears in joseph archers eyes i just heard myself you know the chief of police sandy marlow is my cousin he didnt attempt to brush away the tears if that was what they were but the words were presumably meant as an explanation of what of shock grief shock he must surely have experienced but grief jemima decided at this point that she could at least inquire delicately about his precise relationship to miss izzy it came back to her that he had visited the old lady the week previously if miss izzys rather vague words concerning little joseph were to be trusted she was thinking not so much of a possible blood relationship as some other kind of connection after all joseph archer himself had dismissed the former idea in the graveyard his words about sir valentine and his numerous progeny came back to her dont pay too much attention to the stories otherwise how come were not all living in that fine old archer plantation house at which greg harrison had commented with such fury instead of merely my exwife the exchange made more sense to her now of course that she knew of the position of tina harrison now tina archer in miss izzys will the will tina would now inherit and she would inherit in the light of a will signed the very morning of the day of miss izzys death clearly joseph had been correct when he dismissed the claim of the many bolanders called archer to be descended in any meaningful fashion from sir valentine there was already a considerable difference between tina the allegedly sole legitimate descendant other than miss izzy and the rest of the bolander archers in the future with tina come into her inheritance the gap would widen even more it was extremely hot in josephs office it was not so much that bow island was an unsophisticated place as that the persistent breeze made airconditioning generally unnecessary the north american tourists who were beginning to request airconditioning in the hotels reflected jemima would only succeed in ruining the most perfect kind of natural ventilation but a government office in bowtown was rather different a huge fan in the ceiling made the papers on josephs desk stir uneasily jemima felt a ribbon of sweat trickle down beneath her long loose white tshirt which she had belted as a dress to provide some kind of formal attire to call on a bolander minister in working hours by this time jemimas disbelieving numbness on the subject of miss izzys murder was wearing off she was struck by the frightful poignancy of that last encounter in the decaying grandeur of archer plantation house worse still the old ladys pathetic fear of loneliness was beginning to haunt her miss izzy had been so passionate in her determination not to be abandoned ever since i was a little girl ive hated being alone everyone knows that its so lonely here by the sea what happens if someone breaks in well someone had broken in or so it was presumed joseph archers words a robber maybe and this robber maybe had killed the old lady in the process jemima began hesitantly im so sorry joseph what a ghastly tragedy you knew her well i suppose everyone round here must have known her all the days of my life since i was a little boy my mama was one of her maids just a little thing herself and then she died shes in that churchyard you know in a corner miss izzy was very good to me when my mama died oh yes she was kind now youd think that independence our independence would be hard for an old lady like her but miss izzy she just liked it very much englands no good to me any more joseph she said im a bolander just like the rest of you you saw her last week i believe miss izzy told me that herself joseph gazed at jemima steadily the emotion had vanished i went to talk with her yes she had some foolish idea of changing her mind about things just a fancy you know but thats over may she rest in peace little old miss izzy well have our national museum now thats for sure and well remember her with it itll make a good museum for our history didnt they tell you in london jemima there was pride in his voice as he concluded miss izzy left everything in her will to the people of bow island jemima swallowed hard was it true or rather was it still true had miss izzy really signed a new will yesterday she had been quite circumspect on the subject mentioning someone called thompson her lawyer no doubt who thought there would be trouble as a result joseph she said tina archer was up at archer plantation house yesterday afternoon too oh that girl the trouble she made tried to make tina and her stories and her fine education and her history and shes so pretty josephs tone was momentarily violent but he finished more calmly the police are waiting at the hospital shes not speaking yet shes not even conscious then even more calmly shes not so pretty now i hear that robber beat her you see it was hotter than ever in the bowtown office and even the papers on the desk were hardly stirring in the waft of the fan jemima saw josephs face swimming before her she absolutely must not faint she never fainted she concentrated desperately on what joseph archer was telling her the picture he was recreating of the night of the murder the shock of learning that tina archer had also been present in the house when miss izzy was killed was irrational she realized that hadnt tina promised the old lady she would stay with her joseph was telling her that miss izzys body had been found in the drawing room by the cook hazel returning from her sisters wedding at first light it was a grisly touch that because miss izzy was wearing redsilk pajamas her daddys and all the furnishings of the drawing room were darkred as well poor hazel had not at first realized the extent of her mistresss injuries not only was there blood everywhere there was water too pools of it whatever whoever had killed miss izzy had come out of the sea wearing rubber shoes or flippers and probably gloves as well a moment later hazel was in no doubt about what had hit miss izzy the club still stained with blood had been left lying on the floor of the front hall she herself deposited by henry had originally entered by the kitchen door the club although not of bolander manufacture belonged to the house it was a relic african probably of sir john archers travels in other parts of the former british empire and hung heavy and shorthandled on the drawingroom wall possibly sir john had in mind to wield it against unlawful intruders but to miss izzy it had been simply one more family memento she never touched it now it had killed her no prints anywhere joseph said so far and tina asked jemima with dry lips the idea of the pools of water stagnant on the floor of the drawing room mingled with miss izzys blood reminded her only too vividly of the old lady when last seen soaking wet in her bizarre swimming costume defiantly sitting down on her own sofa the robber ransacked the house even the cellar the champagne cases miss izzy boasted about must have been too heavy though he drank some rum the police dont know yet what he took silver snuffboxes maybe there were plenty of those about joseph sighed then he went upstairs and found tina in one of the bedrooms he didnt hit her with the same weapon lucky for her as hed have killed her just like he killed miss izzy he left that downstairs and picked up something a good deal lighter probably didnt reckon on seeing her or anyone there at all cept for miss izzy that is tina must have surprised him maybe she woke up robbers well all i can say is that robbers here dont generally go and kill people unless theyre frightened without warning joseph slumped down in front of her and put his head in his hands he murmured something like when we find who did it to miss izzy it wasnt until the next day that tina archer was able to speak i even haltingly to the police like most of the rest of the bow island population jemima shore was informed of the fact almost immediately claudette manageress of her hotel a sympathetic if loquacious character just happened to have a niece who was a nurse but that was the way information always spread about the island no need for newspapers or radio this private telegraph was far more efficient jemima had spent the intervening twentyfour hours swimming rather aimlessly sunbathing and making little tours of the island in her mini she was wondering at what point she should inform megalith television of the brutal way in which her projected program had been terminated and make arrangements to return to london after a bit the investigative instinct that inveterate curiosity which would not be stilled came to the fore she found she was speculating all the time about miss izzys death a robber a robber who had also tried to kill tina archer or a robber who had merely been surprised by her presence in the house what connection if any had all this with miss izzys will the will again but that was one thing jemima didnt have to speculate about for very long for claudette the manageress also just happened to be married to the brother of hazel miss izzys cook in this way jemima was apprised along with the rest of bow island no doubt that miss izzy had indeed signed a new will down in bowtown on the morning of her death that eddie thompson the solicitor had begged her not to do it that miss izzy had done it that miss izzy had still looked after hazel all right as she had promised and henry who had worked for her even longer and that some jewelry would go to a cousin in england seeing as miss izzys mothers jewels were in an english bank anyway since long back but for the rest well there would be no national bolander museum now that was for sure everything else that fine old archer plantation house miss izzys fortune reputedly enormous but who knew for sure would go to tina archer if she recovered of course but the latest cautious bulletin from claudette via the niecewhowasanurse confirmed by a few other loquacious people on the island was that tina archer was recovering the police had already been able to interview her in a few days she would be able to leave the hospital and she was determined to attend miss izzys funeral which would be held naturally enough in that little englishlooking church with its incongruous tropical vegetation overlooking the sunny grave for miss izzy had long ago made clear her own determination to be buried in the archer tomb along with governor sir valentine and his only wife isabella as the last of the archers but she still had to get permission since its a national monument and of course the government couldnt do enough for her so they gave it then ironic isnt it the speaker making absolutely no attempt to conceal her disgust was coralie harrison and now we learn that she wasnt the last of the archers not officially and we shall have the socalled miss tina archer as chief mourner and while the bolander government desperately looks for ways to get round the will and grab the house for their precious museum nobody quite had the bad taste to go ahead and say no no burial in the archer tomb for naughty old miss izzy since she hasnt after all left the people of bow island a penny it should be an interesting occasion jemima murmured she was sitting with coralie harrison under the conical thatched roof of the hotels beach bar this was where she first danced then sat out with joseph archer on the night of the new moon the night miss izzy had been killed now the sea sparkled under the sun as though there were crystals scattered on its surface today there were no waves at all and the happy waterskiers crossed and recrossed the wide bay with its palmfringed shore enormous brown pelicans perched on some stakes which indicated where rocks lay every now and then one would take off like an unwieldy airplane and fly slowly and inquisitively over the heads of the swimmers it was a tranquil even an idyllic scene but somewhere in the distant peninsula lay archer plantation house not only shuttered but now she imagined also sealed by the police coralie had sauntered up to the bar from the beach she traversed the few yards with seeming casualness all bolanders frequently exercised their right to promenade along the sands unchecked as in most caribbean islands no one owned any portion of the beach in bow island even outside the most stately mansion like archer plantation house except the people jemima however was in no doubt that this was a planned visit she had not forgotten that first meeting and coralies tentative approach to her interrupted by gregs peremptory cry it was the day after the inquest on miss izzys death her body had been released by the police and the funeral would soon follow jemima admitted to herself that she was interested enough in the whole archer family and its various branches to want to attend it quite apart from the tenderness she felt for the old lady herself based on that brief meeting to megalith television in a telex from bowtown she had spoken merely of tying up a few loose ends resulting from the cancellation of her program there had been an open verdict at the inquest tina archers evidence in a sworn statement had not really contributed much that wasnt known or suspected already she had been asleep upstairs in one of the many fairly derelict bedrooms kept ostensibly ready for guests the bedroom chosen for her by miss izzy had not faced onto the sea the chintz curtains in this back room bearing some dated rosy pattern from a remote era werent quite so bleached and tattered since they had been protected from the sun and salt miss izzy had gone to bed in good spirits reassured by the fact that tina archer was going to spend the night she had drunk several more rum punches and had offered to have henry fetch some of her fathers celebrated champagne from the cellar as a matter of fact miss izzy often made this offer after a few draughts of punch but tina reminded her that henry was away and the subject was dropped in her statement tina said she had no clue as to what might have awakened the old lady and induced her to descend the stairs it was right out of character in her own opinion isabella archer was a lady of independent mind but notoriously frightened of the dark hence tinas presence at the house in the first place as to her own recollection of the attack tina had so far managed to dredge very few of the details from her memory the blow to the back of the head had temporarily or permanently expunged all the immediate circumstances from her consciousness she had a vague idea that there had been a bright light but even that was rather confused and might be part of the blow she had suffered basically she could remember nothing between going to bed in the tattered rosepatterned fourposter and waking up in hospital coralies lip trembled she bowed her head and sipped at her long drink through a straw she and jemima were drinking some exotic mixture of fruit juice alcoholfree invented by matthew the barman there was a wonderful soft breeze coming in from the sea and coralie was dressed in a loose flowered cotton dress but she looked hot and angry tina schemed for everything all her life and now shes got it thats what i wanted to warn you about that morning in the churchyard dont trust tina archer i wanted to say now its too late shes got it all when she was married to greg i tried to like her jemima honestly i did little tina so cute and so clever but always trouble joseph archer feels rather the same way about her i gather jemima said was it her imagination or did coralies face soften slightly at the sound of josephs name does he im glad he fancied her too once upon a time she is quite pretty their eyes met well not all that pretty but if you like the type jemima and coralie both laughed the fact was that coralie harrison was quite appealing if you liked her type but tina archer was ravishing by any standards greg absolutely loathes her now of course coralie continued firmly especially since he heard the news about the will when we met you that morning up at the church hed just been told hence well im sorry but he was very rude wasnt he more hostile than rude but jemima had begun to work out the timing you mean your brother knew about the will before miss izzy was killed she exclaimed oh yes someone from eddie thompsons office told greg daisy marlow maybe he takes her out of course we all knew it was on the cards except we hoped joseph had argued miss izzy out of it and he would have argued her out of it given time that museum is everything to joseph your brother and miss izzy that wasnt an easy relationship i gather jemima thought she was using her gentlest and most persuasive interviewers voice but coralie countered with something like defiance you sound like the police why have they well of course they have coralie answered the question before jemima had completed it everyone knows that greg absolutely hated miss izzy blamed her for breaking up his marriage for taking little tina and giving her ideas wasnt it rather the other way around tina delving into the family records for the museum and then my program you said she was a schemer oh i know she was a schemer but did greg he did not not then he was besotted with her at the time so he had to blame the old lady they had a frightful row very publicly he went round to the house one night went in by the sea shouted at her hazel and henry heard so then everyone knew that was when tina told him she was going to get a divorce and throw in her lot with miss izzy for the future im afraid my brother is rather an extreme person his temper is certainly extreme he made threats but the police dont think jemima stopped it was clear what she meant coralie swung her legs off the bar stool jemima handed her the huge straw bag with the archer logo on it and she slung it over her shoulder in proper bolander fashion how pretty jemima commented politely i sell them at the hotel on the north point for a living the remark sounded pointed no coralie went on rapidly before jemima could say anything more on that subject of course the police dont think as you put it greg might have assaulted tina but greg kill miss izzy when he knew perfectly well that by so doing he was handing his exwife a fortune no way not even the bolander police would believe that that night jemima shore found joseph archer again on the beach under the stars but the moon had waxed since their first encounter now it was beginning to cast a silver pathway on the waters of the night nor was this meeting unplanned as that first one had been joseph had sent her a message that he would be free and they had agreed to meet down by the bar what do you say ill take you on a night drive round our island jemima no lets be proper bolanders and walk along the sands jemima wanted to be alone with him not driving past the rows of lighted tourist hotels listening to the eternal beat of the steel bands she felt reckless enough not to care how joseph himself would interpret this change of plan they walked for some time along the edge of the sea in silence except for the gentle lap of the waves after a while jemima took off her sandals and splashed through the warm receding waters and a little while after that joseph took her hand and led her back onto the sand the waves grew conspicuously rougher as they rounded the point of the first wide bay they stood for a moment together joseph and jemima he with his arm companionably round her waist jemima even without that new moon im going to wish then joseph stiffened he dropped the encircling arm grabbed her shoulder and swung her around jesus oh sweet jesus do you see that the force of his gesture made jemima wince for a moment she was distracted by the flickering moonlit swathe on the dark surface of the water there were multitudinous white silver horses out beyond the land where high waves were breaking over an outcrop of rocks she thought joseph was pointing out to sea then she saw the lights the archer house she cried i thought it was shut up it seemed that all the lights of the house were streaming out across the promontory on which it lay such was the illumination that you might have supposed some great ball was in progress a thousand candles lit as in the days of governor archer more somberly jemima realized that was how the plantation house must have looked on the night of miss izzys death tina archer and others had borne witness to the old ladys insistence on never leaving her house in darkness the night her murderer had come in from the sea this is how the house must have looked to him come on said joseph the moment of lightness or loving perhaps had utterly vanished he sounded both grim and determined to the police no to the house i need to know whats happening there as they half ran along the sands joseph said this house should have been ours ours the people of bow island his restlessness on the subject of the museum struck jemima anew since her conversation with coralie harrison what would a man or a woman for that matter do for an inheritance and there was more than one kind of inheritance wasnt a national heritage as important to some people as a personal inheritance to others joseph archer was above all a patriotic bolander and he had not known of the change of will on the morning after miss izzys death she herself had evidence of that might a man like joseph archer a man who had already risen in his own world by sheer determination decide to take the law into his own hands in order to secure the museum for his people while there was still time but to kill the old lady who had befriended him as a boy batter her to death as he strode along so tall in the moonlight joseph was suddenly a complete and thus menacing enigma to jemima they had reached the promontory had scrambled up the rocks and had got as far as the first terrace when all the lights in the house went out it was as though a switch had been thrown only the cold eerie glow of the moon over the sea behind them remained to illuminate the bushes now wildly overgrown and the sagging balustrades but joseph strode on helping jemima up the flights of stone steps some of them deeply cracked and uneven in the darkness jemima could just see that the windows of the drawing room were still open there had to be someone in there behind the ragged redbrocade curtains which had been stained by miss izzys blood joseph holding jemimas hand pulled her through the center window there was a short cry like a suppressed scream and then a low sound as if someone was laughing at them there in the dark an instant later all the lights were snapped on at once tina was standing at the door her hand at the switch she wore a white bandage on her head like a turban and she wasnt laughing she was sobbing oh its you joseph and jemima shore for the first time jemima was aware of the singsong bolander note in tinas voice i was so frightened are you all right tina asked jemima hastily to cover the fact that she had been quite severely frightened herself the atmosphere of angry tension between the two other people in the room so different in looks yet both of them as it happened called archer was almost palpable she felt she was in honor bound to try to relieve it are you all alone the police said i could come tina ignored the question they have finished with everything here and besides her terrified sobs had vanished there was something deliberately provocative about her as she moved toward them why ever not to neither of them did she need to elaborate the words since its all mine hung in the air joseph spoke for the first time since they had entered the room i want to look at the house he said harshly joseph archer you get out of here back where you came from back to your office and thats not a great fine house then she addressed jemima placatingly in something more like her usual sweet manner im sorry but you see weve not been friends since way back and besides you gave me such a shock joseph swung on his heel ill see you at the funeral miss archer he managed to make the words sound extraordinarily threatening that night it seemed to jemima shore that she hardly slept although the threads of broken half remembered dreams disturbed her and indicated that she must actually have fallen into some kind of doze in the hour before dawn the light was still gray when she looked out of her shutters the tops of the tall palms were bending there was quite a wind back on her bed jemima tried to recall just what she had been dreaming there had been some pattern to it she knew there had she wished rather angrily that light would suddenly break through into her sleepy mind as the sun was shortly due to break through the eastern fringe of palms on the hotel estate no gentle slowdeveloping rosyfingered dawn for the caribbean one brilliant low ray was a herald of what was to come and then almost immediately hot relentless sunshine for the rest of the day she needed that kind of instant clarity herself hostility that was part of it all the nature of hostility the hostility for example between joseph and tina archer the night before so virulent and public with herself as the public that it might almost have been managed for effect then the management of things tina archer always managing always a schemer as coralie harrison had said and joseph archer too that brought her to the other couple in this odd fourpointed drama the harrisons brother and sister or rather half brother and sister a point made by tina to correct miss izzy more hostility greg who had once loved tina and now loathed her joseph who had once also perhaps loved tina coralie who had once perhaps very much perhaps this one loved joseph and certainly loathed tina cute and clever little tina the archer tomb the carved figures of sir valentine and his wife the inscription jemima was beginning to float back into sleep as the four figures all bolanders all sharing some kind of common past began to dance to a calypso whose wording too was confused this is your graveyard in the sun where my people have toiled since time begun an extraordinarily loud noise on the corrugated metal roof above her head recalled her trembling to her senses the racket had been quite immense almost as if there had been an explosion or at least a missile fired at the chalet the thought of a missile made her realize that it had in fact been a missile it must have been a coconut which had fallen in such a startling fashion on the corrugated roof guests were officially warned by the hotel against sitting too close under the palm trees whose innocuouslooking fronds could suddenly dispense their heavily lethal nuts coconuts can cause injury ran the printed notice that kind of blow on my head would certainly have caused injury thought jemima if not death injury if not death and the archer tomb my only wife at that moment straight on cue the sun struck low through the bending fronds to the east and onto her shutters and jemima realized not only why it had been done but how it had been done who of them all had been responsible for consigning miss izzy archer to the graveyard in the sun the scene by the archer tomb a few hours later had that same strange mixture of english tradition and bolander exoticism which had intrigued jemima on her first visit only this time she had a deeper sadder purpose than sheer tourism traditional english hymns were sung at the service but outside a steel band was playing at miss izzys request as one who had been born on the island she had asked for a proper bolander funeral the bolanders attending in large numbers were by and large dressed with that extreme formality dark suits white shirts ties dark dresses dark straw hats even white gloves which jemima had observed in churchgoers of a sunday and in the bolander children all of them neatly uniformed on their way to school no bow island tshirts were to be seen although many of the highly colored intricate and lavish wreaths were in the bow shape of the islands logo the size of the crowd was undoubtedly a genuine mark of respect whatever the disappointments of the will to their government to the bolanders miss izzy archer had been part of their heritage tina archer wore a black scarf wound round her head which almost totally concealed her bandage joseph archer standing far apart from her and not looking in her direction looked both elegant and formal in his office clothes a respectable member of the government the harrisons stood together coralie with her head bowed gregs defiant aspect head lifted proudly was clearly intended to give the lie to any suggestions that he had not been on the best of terms with the woman whose body was now being lowered into the family tomb as the coffin so small and thus so touching vanished from view there was a sigh from the mourners they began to sing again a hymn but with the steel band gently echoing the tune in the background jemima moved discreetly in the crowd and stood by the side of the tall man youll never be able to trust her she said in a low voice shes managed you before shell manage you again itll be someone else who will be doing the dirty work next time on you youll never be able to trust her will you once a murderess always a murderess you may wish one day youd finished her off the tall man looked down at her then he looked across at tina archer with one quick savagely doubting look tina archer harrison his only wife why you for a moment jemima thought greg harrison would actually strike her down there at the graveside as he had struck down old miss izzy and if only on pretense struck down tina herself greg darling it was coralie harrisons pathetic protesting murmur what are you saying to him she demanded of jemima in a voice as low as jemimas own but the explanations for coralie and the rest of bow island of the conspiracy of tina archer and greg harrison were only just beginning the rest was up to the police who with their patient work of investigation would first amplify then press finally concluding the case and in the course of the investigations the conspirators would fall apart this time for real to the police fell the unpleasant duty of disentangling the new lies of tina archer who now swore that her memory had just returned that it had been greg who had half killed her that night that she had had absolutely nothing to do with it and greg harrison denounced tina in return this time with genuine ferocity it was her plan her plan all along she managed everything i should never have listened to her before she left bow island jemima went to say goodbye to joseph archer in his bowtown office there were many casualties of the archer tragedy beyond miss izzy herself poor coralie was one she had been convinced that her brother for all his notorious temper would never batter down miss izzy to benefit his exwife like the rest of bow island she was unaware of the deep plot by which greg and tina would publicly display their hostility advertise their divorce and all along plan to kill miss izzy once the new will was signed greg ostentatiously hating his exwife would not be suspected and tina suffering such obvious injuries could only arouse sympathy another small casualty much less important was the romance which just might have developed between joseph archer and jemima shore now in his steamingly hot office with its perpetually moving fan they talked of quite other things than the new moon and new wishes you must be happy youll get your museum said jemima but thats not at all the way i wanted it to happen he replied then joseph added but you know jemima there has been justice done and in her heart of hearts miss izzy did really want us to have this national museum id have talked her round to good sense again if she had lived thats why they acted when they did they didnt dare wait given miss izzys respect for you suggested jemima she stopped but her curiosity got the better of her there was one thing she had to know before she left the archer tomb and all that tina being descended from sir valentines lawful second marriage is that true yes its true maybe but its not important to most of us here you know something jemima i too am descended from that wellknown second marriage maybe and a few others maybe lucie anne had two children dont forget and bolanders have large families it was important to tina archer not to me thats not what i want thats all past miss izzy was the last of the archers so far as im concerned let her lie in her tomb what do you want for yourself or for bow island if you prefer joseph smiled and there was a glimmer there of the handsome fisherman who had welcomed her to bow island the cheerful dancing partner come back to bow island one day jemima make another program about us our history and all that and ill tell you then i might just do that said jemima shore the case of the pietro andromache sara paretsky sara paretsky b was born in ames iowa and educated at the university of kansas lawrence and the university of chicago where she attained a phd in history after working as a business writer and directmail marketing manager for an insurance company she turned to fiction writing with indemnity only which introduced chicago private detective v i warshawski one of two renowned female pis to debut in the watershed year of as fictional sleuths go warshawski is a specialist paretsky writes in st james guide to crime mystery writers th edition like lew archer before her she looks beyond the surface to the far side of the dollar the side where power and money corrupt people into making criminal decisions to preserve their positions all of her cases explore some aspect of whitecollar crime where senior executives preserve position or bolster their companies without regard for the ordinary people who work for them these guidelines provide scope for plenty of variety of background from medicine to politics to religion to law enforcement along with producing her own fiction paretsky has done much to advance the cause of women crime writers generally editing anthologies of their work and founding the highly successful sisters in crime paretskys name is invariably bracketed with that of sue grafton who also introduced her female private eye kinsey millhone in the two writers are about equally capable though v i warshawski is a bit harderedged and certainly more overtly political in her point of view than millhone one result of the continual comparison paretsky admits in a recent interview in crime time magazine is that she is no longer able to read grafton whom she previously enjoyed for fear of being unconsciously influenced like many of the female private eyes v i warshawski has an extended family of friends that recur from book to book two of them lotty herschel and max loewenthal appear in the case of the pietro andromache a story that has achieved the status of a modern classic judging by the number of times it has been anthologized i you only agreed to hire him because of his art collection of that im sure lotty herschel bent down to adjust her stockings and dont waggle your eyebrows like that it makes you look like an adolescent groucho marx max loewenthal obediently smoothed his eyebrows but said its your legs lotty they remind me of my youth you know going into the underground to wait out the air raids looking at the ladies as they came down the escalators the updraft always made their skirts billow youre making this up max i was in those underground stations too and as i remember the ladies were always bundled in coats and children max moved from the doorway to put an arm around lotty thats what keeps us together lottchen i am a romantic and you are severely logical and you know we didnt hire caudwell because of his collection although i admit i am eager to see it the board wants beth israel to develop a transplant program its the only way were going to become competitive dont deliver your publicity lecture to me lotty snapped her thick brows contracted to a solid black line across her forehead as far as i am concerned he is a cretin with the hands of a caliban and the personality of attila lottys intense commitment to medicine left no room for the mundane consideration of money but as the hospitals executive director max was on the spot with the trustees to see that beth israel ran at a profit or at least at a smaller loss than theyd achieved in recent years theyd brought caudwell in part to attract more paying patients and to help screen out some of the indigent who made up percent of beth israels patient load max wondered how long the hospital could afford to support personalities as divergent as lotty and caudwell with their radically differing approaches to medicine he dropped his arm and smiled quizzically at her why do you hate him so much lotty i am the person who has to justify the patients i admit to this this troglodyte do you realize he tried to keep mrs mendes from the operating room when he learned she had aids he wasnt even being asked to sully his hands with her blood and he didnt want me performing surgery on her lotty drew back from max and pointed an accusing finger at him you may tell the board that if he keeps questioning my judgment they will find themselves looking for a new perinatologist i am serious about this you listen this afternoon max you hear whether or not he calls me our little baby doctor i am fiftyeight years old i am a fellow of the royal college of surgeons besides having enough credentials in this country to support a whole hospital and to him i am a little baby doctor max sat on the daybed and pulled lotty down next to him no no lottchen dont fight listen to me why havent you told me any of this before dont be an idiot max you are the director of the hospital i cannot use our special relationship to deal with problems i have with the staff i said my piece when caudwell came for his final interview a number of the other physicians were not happy with his attitude if you remember we asked the board to bring him in as a cardiac surgeon first and promote him to chief of staff after a year if everyone was satisfied with his performance we talked about doing it that way max admitted but he wouldnt take the appointment except as chief of staff that was the only way we could offer him the kind of money he could get at one of the university hospitals or humana and lotty even if you dont like his personality you must agree that he is a firstclass surgeon i agree to nothing red lights danced in her black eyes if he patronizes me a fellow physician how do you imagine he treats his patients you cannot practice medicine if now its my turn to ask to be spared a lecture max interrupted gently but if you feel so strongly about him maybe you shouldnt go to his party this afternoon and admit that he can beat me never very well then max got up and placed a heavily brocaded wool shawl over lottys shoulders but you must promise me to behave this is a social function we are going to remember not a gladiator contest caudwell is trying to repay some hospitality this afternoon not to belittle you i dont need lessons in conduct from you herschels were attending the emperors of austria while the loewenthals were operating vegetable stalls on the ring lotty said haughtily max laughed and kissed her hand then remember these regal herschels and act like them eure hoheit ii caudwell had bought an apartment sight unseen when he moved to chicago a divorced man whose children are in college only has to consult with his own taste in these matters he asked the beth israel board to recommend a realtor sent his requirements to them twenties construction near lake michigan good security modern plumbing and dropped seven hundred and fifty thousand for an eightroom condo facing the lake at scott street since beth israel paid handsomely for the privilege of retaining dr charlotte herschel as their perinatologist nothing required her to live in a fiveroom walkup on the fringes of uptown so it was a bit unfair of her to mutter parvenu to max when they walked into the lobby max relinquished lotty gratefully when they got off the elevator being her lover was like trying to be companion to a bengal tiger you never knew when shed take a lethal swipe at you still if caudwell were insulting her and her judgment maybe he needed to talk to the surgeon explain how important lotty was for the reputation of beth israel caudwells two children were making the obligatory christmas visit they were a boy and a girl deborah and steve within a year of the same age both tall both blond and poised with a hearty sophistication born of a childhood spent on expensive ski slopes max wasnt very big and as one took his coat and the other performed brisk introductions he felt himself shrinking losing in selfassurance he accepted a glass of special cuv√©e from one of them was it the boy or the girl he wondered in confusion and fled into the melee he landed next to one of beth israels trustees a woman in her sixties wearing a gray textured minidress whose black stripes were constructed of feathers she commented brightly on caudwells art collection but max sensed an undercurrent of hostility wealthy trustees dont like the idea that they cant outbuy the staff while he was frowning and nodding at appropriate intervals it dawned on max that caudwell did know how much the hospital needed lotty heart surgeons do not have the worlds smallest egos when you ask them to name the worlds three leading practitioners they never can remember the names of the other two lotty was at the top of her field and she too was used to having things her way since her confrontational style was reminiscent more of the battle of the bulge than the imperial court of vienna he didnt blame caudwell for trying to force her out of the hospital max moved away from martha gildersleeve to admire some of the paintings and figurines shed been discussing a collector himself of chinese porcelains max raised his eyebrows and mouthed a soundless whistle at the pieces on display a small watteau and a charles demuth watercolor were worth as much as beth israel paid caudwell in a year no wonder mrs gildersleeve had been so annoyed impressive isnt it max turned to see arthur gioia looming over him max was shorter than most of the beth israel staff shorter than everyone but lotty but gioia a tall muscular immunologist loomed over everyone he had gone to the university of arkansas on a football scholarship and had even spent a season playing tackle for houston before starting medical school it had been twenty years since he last lifted weights but his neck still looked like a redwood stump gioia had led the opposition to caudwells appointment max had suspected at the time that it was due more to a medicine mans not wanting a surgeon as his nominal boss than from any other cause but after lottys outburst he wasnt so sure he was debating whether to ask the doctor how he felt about caudwell now that hed worked with him for six months when their host surged over to him and shook his hand sorry i didnt see you when you came in loewenthal you like the watteau its one of my favorite pieces although a collector shouldnt play favorites any more than a father should eh sweetheart the last remark was addressed to the daughter deborah who had come up behind caudwell and slipped an arm around him caudwell looked more like a victorian seadog than a surgeon he had a round red face under a shock of yellowwhite hair a hearty santa claus laugh and a bluff direct manner despite lottys vituperations he was immensely popular with his patients in the short time hed been at the hospital referrals to cardiac surgery had increased percent his daughter squeezed his shoulder playfully i know you dont play favorites with us dad but youre lying to mr loewenthal about your collection come on you know you are she turned to max he has a piece hes so proud of he doesnt like to show it to people he doesnt want them to see hes got vulnerable spots but its christmas dad relax let people see how you feel for a change max looked curiously at the surgeon but caudwell seemed pleased with his daughters familiarity the son came up and added his own jocular cajoling this really is dads pride and joy he stole it from uncle griffen when grandfather died and kept mother from getting her mitts on it when they split up caudwell did bark out a mild reproof at that youll be giving my colleagues the wrong impression of me steve i didnt steal it from grif told him he could have the rest of the estate if hed leave me the watteau and the pietro of course he couldve bought ten estates with what those two would fetch steve muttered to his sister over maxs head deborah relinquished her fathers arm to lean over max and whisper back mom too max moved away from the alarming pair to say to caudwell a pietro you mean pietro dalessandro you have a model or an actual sculpture caudwell gave his staccato admirals laugh the real mccoy loewenthal the real mccoy an alabaster an alabaster max raised his eyebrows surely not i thought pietro worked only in bronze and marble yes yes chuckled caudwell rubbing his hands together everyone thinks so but there were a few alabasters in private collections ive had this one authenticated by experts come take a look at it itll knock your breath away you come too gioia he barked at the immunologist youre italian youll like to see what your ancestors were up to a pietro alabaster lottys clipped tones made max start he hadnt noticed her joining the little group i would very much like to see this piece then come along dr herschel come along caudwell led them to a small hallway exchanging genial greetings with his guests as he passed pointing out a john william hill miniature they might not have seen picking up a few other people who for various reasons wanted to see his prize by the way gioia i was in new york last week you know met an old friend of yours from arkansas paul nierman nierman gioia seemed to be at a loss im afraid i dont remember him well he remembered you pretty well sent you all kinds of messages youll have to stop by my office on monday and get the full strength caudwell opened a door on the right side of the hall and let them into his study it was an octagonal room carved out of the corner of the building windows on two sides looked out on lake michigan caudwell drew salmon drapes as he talked about the room why hed chosen it for his study even though the view kept his mind from his work lotty ignored him and walked over to a small pedestal which stood alone against the paneling on one of the far walls max followed her and gazed respectfully at the statue he had seldom seen so fine a piece outside a museum about a foot high it depicted a woman in classical draperies hovering in anguish over the dead body of a soldier lying at her feet the grief in her beautiful face was so poignant that it reminded you of every sorrow you had ever faced who is it meant to be max asked curiously andromache lotty said in a strangled voice andromache mourning hector max stared at lotty astonished equally by her emotion and her knowledge of the figure lotty was totally uninterested in sculpture caudwell couldnt restrain the smug smile of a collector with a true coup beautiful isnt it how do you know the subject i should know it lottys voice was husky with emotion my grandmother had such a pietro an alabaster given her greatgrandfather by the emperor joseph the second himself for his help in consolidating imperial ties with poland she swept the statue from its stand ignoring a gasp from max and turned it over you can see the traces of the imperial stamp here still and the chip on hectors foot which made the hapsburg wish to give the statue away to begin with how came you to have this piece where did you find it the small group that had joined caudwell stood silent by the entrance shocked at lottys outburst gioia looked more horrified than any of them but he found lotty overwhelming at the best of times an elephant confronted by a hostile mouse i think youre allowing your emotions to carry you away doctor caudwell kept his tone light making lotty seem more gauche by contrast i inherited this piece from my father who bought it legitimately in europe perhaps from your grandmother was it but i suspect you are confused about something you may have seen in a museum as a child deborah gave a highpitched laugh and called loudly to her brother dad may have stolen it from uncle grif but it looks like grandfather snatched it to begin with anyway be quiet deborah caudwell barked sternly his daughter paid no attention to him she laughed again and joined her brother to look at the imperial seal on the bottom of the statue lotty brushed them aside i am confused about the seal of joseph the second she hissed at caudwell or about this chip on hectors foot you can see the line where some philistine filled in the missing piece some person who thought his touch would add value to pietros work was that you doctor or your father lotty max was at her side gently prizing the statue from her shaking hands to restore it to its pedestal lotty this is not the place or the manner to discuss such things angry tears sparkled in her black eyes are you doubting my word max shook his head im not doubting you but im also not supporting you im asking you not to talk about this matter in this way at this gathering but max either this man or his father is a thief caudwell strolled up to lotty and pinched her chin youre working too hard dr herschel you have too many things on your mind these days i think the board would like to see you take a leave of absence for a few weeks go someplace warm get yourself relaxed when youre this tense youre no good to your patients what do you say loewenthal max didnt say any of the things he wanted to that lotty was insufferable and caudwell intolerable he believed lotty believed that the piece had been her grandmothers she knew too much about it for one thing and for another a lot of artworks belonging to european jews were now in museums or private collections around the world it was only the most godawful coincidence that the pietro had ended up with caudwells father but how dare she raise the matter in the way most likely to alienate everyone present he couldnt possibly support her in such a situation and at the same time caudwells pinching her chin in that condescending way made him wish he were not chained to a courtesy that would have kept him from knocking the surgeon out even if hed been ten years younger and ten inches taller i dont think this is the place or the time to discuss such matters he reiterated as calmly as he could why dont we all cool down and get back together on monday eh lotty gasped involuntarily then swept from the room without a backward glance max refused to follow her he was too angry with her to want to see her again that afternoon when he got ready to leave the party an hour or so later after a long conversation with caudwell that taxed his sophisticated urbanity to the utmost he heard with relief that lotty was long gone the tale of her outburst had of course spread through the gathering at something faster than the speed of sound he wasnt up to defending her to martha gildersleeve who demanded an explanation of him in the elevator going down he went home for a solitary evening in his house in evanston normally such time brought him pleasure listening to music in his study lying on the couch with his shoes off reading history letting the sounds of the lake wash over him tonight though he could get no relief fury with lotty merged into images of horror the memories of his own disintegrated family his search through europe for his mother he had never found anyone who was quite certain what became of her although several people told him definitely of his fathers suicide and stamped over these wisps in his brain was the disturbing picture of caudwells children their blond heads leaning backward at identical angles as they gleefully chanted grandpa was a thief grandpa was a thief while caudwell edged his visitors out of the study by morning he would somehow have to reconstruct himself enough to face lotty to respond to the inevitable flood of calls from outraged trustees hed have to figure out a way of soothing caudwells vanity bruised more by his childrens behavior than anything lotty had said and find a way to keep both important doctors at beth israel max rubbed his gray hair every week this job brought him less joy and more pain maybe it was time to step down to let the board bring in a young mba who would turn beth israels finances around lotty would resign then and it would be an end to the tension between her and caudwell max fell asleep on the couch he awoke around five muttering by morning by morning his joints were stiff from cold his eyes sticky with tears hed shed unknowingly in his sleep but in the morning things changed when max got to his office he found the place buzzing not with news of lottys outburst but word that caudwell had missed his early morning surgery work came almost completely to a halt at noon when his children phoned to say theyd found the surgeon strangled in his own study and the pietro andromache missing and on tuesday the police arrested dr charlotte herschel for lewis caudwells murder iii lotty would not speak to anyone she was out on two hundred fifty thousand dollars bail the money raised by max but she had gone directly to her apartment on sheffield after two nights in county jail without stopping to thank him she would not talk to reporters she remained silent during all conversations with the police and she emphatically refused to speak to the private investigator who had been her close friend for many years max too stayed behind an impregnable shield of silence while lotty went on indefinite leave turning her practice over to a series of colleagues max continued to go to the hospital every day but he too would not speak to reporters he wouldnt even say no comment he talked to the police only after they threatened to lock him up as a material witness and then every word had to be pried from him as if his mouth were stone and speech excalibur for three days v i warshawski left messages which he refused to return on friday when no word came from the detective when no reporter popped up from a nearby urinal in the mens room to try to trick him into speaking when no more calls came from the states attorney max felt a measure of relaxation as he drove home as soon as the trial was over he would resign retire to london if he could only keep going until then everything would be not all right but bearable he used the remote release for the garage door and eased his car into the small space as he got out he realized bitterly hed been too optimistic in thinking hed be left in peace he hadnt seen the woman sitting on the stoop leading from the garage to the kitchen when he drove in only as she uncoiled herself at his approach im glad youre home i was beginning to freeze out here how did you get into the garage victoria the detective grinned in a way he usually found engaging now it seemed merely predatory trade secret max i know you dont want to see me but i need to talk to you he unlocked the door into the kitchen why not just let yourself into the house if you were cold if your scruples permit you into the garage why not into the house she bit her lip in momentary discomfort but said lightly i couldnt manage my picklocks with my fingers this cold the detective followed him into the house another tall monster five foot eight athletic light on her feet behind him maybe american mothers put growth hormones or steroids in their childrens cornflakes hed have to ask lotty his mind winced at the thought ive talked to the police of course the light alto continued behind him steadily oblivious to his studied rudeness as he poured himself a cognac took his shoes off found his waiting slippers and padded down the hall to the front door for his mail i understand why they arrested lotty caudwell had been doped with a whole bunch of xanax and then strangled while he was sleeping it off and of course she was back at the building sunday night she wont say why but one of the tenants idd her as the woman who showed up around ten at the service entrance when he was walking his dog she wont say if she talked to caudwell if he let her in if he was still alive max tried to ignore her clear voice when that proved impossible he tried to read a journal which had come in the mail and those kids theyre marvelous arent they like something out of the fabulous furry freak brothers they wont talk to me but they gave a long interview to murray ryerson over at the star after caudwells guests left they went to a flick at the chestnut street station had a pizza afterwards then took themselves dancing on division street so they strolled in around two in the morning confirmed by the doorman saw the light on in the old mans study but they were feeling no pain and he kind of overreacted their term if they were buzzed so they didnt stop in to say goodnight it was only when they got up around noon and went in that they found him v i had followed max from the front hallway to the door of his study as she spoke he stood there irresolutely not wanting his private place desecrated with her insistent airhammer speech and finally went on down the hall to a littleused living room he sat stiffly on one of the brocade armchairs and looked at her remotely when she perched on the edge of its companion the weak piece in the police story is the statue vi continued she eyed the persian rug doubtfully and unzipped her boots sticking them on the bricks in front of the fireplace everyone who was at the party agrees that lotty was beside herself by now the story has spread so far that people who werent even in the apartment when she looked at the statue swear they heard her threaten to kill him but if thats the case what happened to the statue max gave a slight shrug to indicate total lack of interest in the topic vi plowed on doggedly now some people think she might have given it to a friend or a relation to keep for her until her name is cleared at the trial and these people think it would be either her uncle stefan here in chicago her brother hugo in montreal or you so the mounties searched hugos place and are keeping an eye on his mail and the chicago cops are doing the same for stefan and i presume someone got a warrant and went through here right max said nothing but he felt his heart beating faster police in his house searching his things but wouldnt they have to get his permission to enter or would they victoria would know but he couldnt bring himself to ask she waited for a few minutes but when he still wouldnt speak she plunged on he could see it was becoming an effort for her to talk but he wouldnt help her but i dont agree with those people because i know that lotty is innocent and thats why im here not like a bird of prey as you think using your misery for carrion but to get you to help me lotty wont speak to me and if shes that miserable i wont force her to but surely max you wont sit idly by and let her be railroaded for something she never did max looked away from her he was surprised to find himself holding the brandy snifter and set it carefully on a table beside him max her voice was shot with astonishment i dont believe this you actually think she killed caudwell max flushed a little but shed finally stung him into a response and you are god who sees all and knows she didnt i see more than you do vi snapped i havent known lotty as long as you have but i know when shes telling the truth so you are god max bowed in heavy irony you see beyond the facts to the innermost souls of men and women he expected another outburst from the young woman but she gazed at him steadily without speaking it was a look sympathetic enough that max felt embarrassed by his sarcasm and burst out with what was on his mind what else am i to think she hasnt said anything but theres no doubt that she returned to his apartment sunday night it was vis turn for sarcasm with a little vial of xanax that she somehow induced him to swallow and then strangled him for good measure come on max you know lotty honesty follows her around like a cloud if shed killed caudwell shed say something like yes i bashed the little vermins brains in instead shes not speaking at all suddenly the detectives eyes widened with incredulity of course she thinks you killed caudwell youre doing the only thing you can to protect her standing mute and shes doing the same thing what an admirable pair of archaic knights no max said sharply its not possible how could she think such a thing she carried on so wildly that it was embarrassing to be near her i didnt want to see her or talk to her thats why ive felt so terrible if only i hadnt been so obstinate if only id called her sunday night how could she think i would kill someone on her behalf when i was so angry with her why else isnt she saying anything to anyone warshawski demanded shame maybe max offered you didnt see her on sunday i did that is why i think she killed him not because some man let her into the building his brown eyes screwed shut at the memory i have seen lotty in the grip of anger many times more than is pleasant to remember really but never never have i seen her in this kind of uncontrolled rage you could not talk to her it was impossible the detective didnt respond to that instead she said tell me about the statue i heard a couple of garbled versions from people who were at the party but i havent found anyone yet who was in the study when caudwell showed it to you was it really her grandmothers do you think and how did caudwell come to have it if it was max nodded mournfully oh yes it was really her familys im convinced of that she could not have known in advance about the details the flaw in the foot the imperial seal on the bottom as to how caudwell got it i did a little looking into that myself yesterday his father was with the army of occupation in germany after the war a surgeon attached to pattons staff men in such positions had endless opportunities to acquire artworks after the war vi shook her head questioningly you must know something of this victoria well maybe not you know the nazis helped themselves liberally to artwork belonging to jews everywhere they occupied europe and not just to jews they plundered eastern europe on a grand scale the best guess is that they stole sixteen million pieces statues paintings altarpieces tapestries rare books the list is beyond reckoning really the detective gave a little gasp sixteen million youre joking not a joke victoria i wish it were so but it is not the us army of occupation took charge of as many works of art as they found in the occupied territories in theory they were to find the rightful owners and try to restore them but in practice few pieces were ever traced and many of them ended up on the black market you only had to say that suchandsuch a piece was worth less than five thousand dollars and you were allowed to buy it for an officer on pattons staff the opportunities for fabulous acquisitions would have been endless caudwell said he had the statue authenticated but of course he never bothered to establish its provenance anyway how could he max finished bitterly lottys family had a deed of gift from the emperor but that would have disappeared long since with the dispersal of their possessions and you really think lotty would have killed a man just to get this statue back she couldnt have expected to keep it not if shed killed someone to get it i mean you are so practical victoria you are too analytical sometimes to understand why people do what they do that was not just a statue true it is a priceless artwork but you know lotty you know she places no value on such possessions no it meant her family to her her past her history everything that the war destroyed forever for her you must not imagine that because she never discusses such matters that they do not weigh on her vi flushed at maxs accusation you should be glad im analytical it convinces me that lotty is innocent and whether you believe it or not im going to prove it max lifted his shoulders slightly in a manner wholly european we each support lotty according to our lights i saw that she met her bail and i will see that she gets expert counsel i am not convinced that she needs you making her innermost secrets public vis gray eyes turned dark with a sudden flash of temper youre dead wrong about lotty im sure the memory of the war is a pain that can never be cured but lotty lives in the present she works in hope for the future the past does not obsess and consume her as perhaps it does you max said nothing his wide mouth turned in on itself in a narrow line the detective laid a contrite hand on his arm im sorry max that was below the belt he forced the ghost of a smile to his mouth perhaps its true perhaps its why i love these ancient things so much i wish i could believe you about lotty ask me what you want to know if you promise to leave as soon as ive answered and not to bother me again ill answer your questions iv max put in a dutiful appearance at the michigan avenue presbyterian church monday afternoon for lewis caudwells funeral the surgeons former wife came flanked by her children and her husbands brother griffen even after three decades in america max found himself puzzled sometimes by the natives behavior since she and caudwell were divorced why had his exwife draped herself in black she was even wearing a veiled hat reminiscent of queen victoria the children behaved in a moderately subdued fashion but the girl was wearing a white dress shot with black lightning forks which looked as though it belonged at a disco or a resort maybe it was her only dress or her only dress with black in it max thought trying hard to look charitably at the blond amazon after all she had been suddenly and horribly orphaned even though she was a stranger both in the city and the church deborah had hired one of the church parlors and managed to find someone to cater coffee and light snacks max joined the rest of the congregation there after the service he felt absurd as he offered condolences to the divorced widow did she really miss the dead man so much she accepted his conventional words with graceful melancholy and leaned slightly against her son and daughter they hovered near her with what struck max as a stagey solicitude seen next to her daughter mrs caudwell looked so frail and undernourished that she seemed like a ghost or maybe it was just that her children had a hearty vitality that even a funeral couldnt quench caudwells brother griffen stayed as close to the widow as the children would permit the man was totally unlike the hearty seadog surgeon max thought if hed met the brothers standing side by side he would never have guessed their relationship he was tall like his niece and nephew but without their robustness caudwell had had a thick mop of yellowwhite hair griffens domed head was covered by thin wisps of gray he seemed weak and nervous and lacked caudwells outgoing bonhomie no wonder the surgeon had found it easy to decide the disposition of their fathers estate in his favor max wondered what griffen had gotten in return mrs caudwells vague disoriented conversation indicated that she was heavily sedated that too seemed strange a man she hadnt lived with for four years and she was so upset at his death that she could only manage the funeral on drugs or maybe it was the shame of coming as the divorced woman not a true widow but then why come at all to his annoyance max found himself wishing he could ask victoria about it she would have some cynical explanation caudwells death meant the end of the widows alimony and she knew she wasnt remembered in the will or she was having an affair with griffen and was afraid she would betray herself without tranquilizers although it was hard to imagine the uncertain griffen as the object of a strong passion since he had told victoria he didnt want to see her again when she left on friday it was ridiculous of him to wonder what she was doing whether she was really uncovering evidence that would clear lotty ever since she had gone he had felt a little flicker of hope in the bottom of his stomach he kept trying to drown it but it wouldnt quite go away lotty of course had not come to the funeral but most of the rest of the beth israel staff was there along with the trustees arthur gioia his giant body filling the small parlor to the bursting point tried finding a tactful balance between honesty and courtesy with the bereaved family he made heavy going of it a sableclad martha gildersleeve appeared under gioias elbow rather like a furry football he might have tucked away she made bright unseemly remarks to the bereaved family about the disposal of caudwells artworks of course the famous statue is gone now what a pity you could have endowed a chair in his honor with the proceeds from that piece alone she gave a high meaningless laugh max sneaked a glance at his watch wondering how long he had to stay before leaving would be rude his sixth sense the perfect courtesy that governed his movements had deserted him leaving him subject to the gaucheries of ordinary mortals he never peeked at his watch at functions and at any prior funeral he would have deftly pried martha gildersleeve from her victim instead he stood helplessly by while she tortured mrs caudwell and other bystanders alike he glanced at his watch again only two minutes had passed since his last look no wonder people kept their eyes on their watches at dull meetings they couldnt believe the clock could move so slowly he inched stealthily toward the door exchanging empty remarks with the staff members and trustees he passed nothing negative was said about lotty to his face but the comments cut off at his approach added to his misery he was almost at the exit when two newcomers appeared most of the group looked at them with indifferent curiosity but max suddenly felt an absurd stir of elation victoria looking sane and modern in a navy suit stood in the doorway eyebrows raised scanning the room at her elbow was a police sergeant max had met with her a few times the man was in charge of caudwells death too it was that unpleasant association that kept the name momentarily from his mind vi finally spotted max near the door and gave him a discreet sign he went to her at once i think we may have the goods she murmured can you get everyone to go we just want the family mrs gildersleeve and gioia you may have the goods the police sergeant growled im here unofficially and reluctantly but youre here warshawski grinned and max wondered how he ever could have found the look predatory his own spirits rose enormously at her smile you know in your heart of hearts that arresting lotty was just plain dumb and now im going to make you look real smart in public too max felt his suave sophistication return with the rush of elation that an ailing diva must have when she finds her voice again a touch here a word there and the guests disappeared like the hosts of sennacherib meanwhile he solicitously escorted first martha gildersleeve then mrs caudwell to adjacent armchairs got the brother to fetch coffee for mrs gildersleeve the daughter and son to look after the widow with gioia he could be a bit more ruthless telling him to wait because the police had something important to ask him when the last guest had melted away the immunologist stood nervously at the window rattling his change over and over in his pockets the jingling suddenly was the only sound in the room gioia reddened and clasped his hands behind his back victoria came into the room beaming like a governess with a delightful treat in store for her charges she introduced herself to the caudwells you know sergeant mcgonnigal im sure after this last week im a private investigator since i dont have any legal standing youre not required to answer any questions i have so im not going to ask you any questions im just going to treat you to a travelogue i wish i had slides but youll have to imagine the visuals while the audio track moves along a private investigator steves mouth formed an exagger ated o his eyes widened in amazement just like bogie he was speaking as usual to his sister she gave her highpitched laugh and said well win first prize in the how i spent my winter vacation contests our daddy was murdered zowie then his most valuable possession was snatched powie but hed already stolen it from the jewish doctor who killed him yowie and then a pi to wrap it all up yowie zowie powie deborah please mrs caudwell sighed i know youre excited sweetie but not right now okay your children keep you young dont they maam victoria said how can you ever feel old when your kids stay seven all their lives oo ow she bites debbie watch out she bites steve cried mcgonnigal made an involuntary movement as though restraining himself from smacking the younger man ms warshawski is right you are under no obligation to answer any of her questions but youre bright people all of you you know i wouldnt be here if the police didnt take her ideas very seriously so lets have a little quiet and listen to what shes got on her mind victoria seated herself in an armchair near mrs caudwells mcgonnigal moved to the door and leaned against the jamb deborah and steve whispered and poked each other until one or both of them shrieked they then made their faces prim and sat with their hands folded on their laps looking like brighteyed choirboys griffen hovered near mrs caudwell you know you dont have to say anything vivian in fact i think you should return to your hotel and lie down the stress of the funeral then these strangers mrs caudwells lips curled bravely below the bottom of her veil its all right grif if i managed to survive everything else one more thing isnt going to do me in great victoria accepted a cup of coffee from max let me just sketch events for you as i saw them last week like everyone else in chicago i read about dr caudwells murder and saw it on television since i know a number of people attached to beth israel i may have paid more attention to it than the average viewer but i didnt get personally involved until dr herschels arrest on tuesday she swallowed some coffee and set the cup on the table next to her with a small snap i have known dr herschel for close to twenty years it is inconceivable that she would commit such a murder as those who know her well should have realized at once i dont fault the police but others should have known better she is hottempered im not saying killing is beyond her i dont think its beyond any of us she might have taken the statue and smashed dr caudwells head in in the heat of rage but it beggars belief to think she went home brooded over her injustices packed a dose of prescription tranquilizer and headed back to the gold coast with murder in mind max felt his cheeks turn hot at her words he started to interject a protest but bit it back dr herschel refused to make a statement all week but this afternoon when i got back from my travels she finally agreed to talk to me sergeant mcgonnigal was with me she doesnt deny that she returned to dr caudwells apartment at ten that he night she went back to apologize for her outburst and to try to plead with him to return the statue he didnt answer when the doorman called up and on impulse she went around to the back of the building got in through the service entrance and waited for some time outside the apartment door when he neither answered the doorbell nor returned home himself she finally went away around eleven oclock the children of course were having a night on the town she says gioia interjected agreed vi smiled i make no bones about being a partisan i accept her version the more so because the only reason she didnt give it a week ago was that she herself was protecting an old friend she thought perhaps this friend had bestirred himself on her behalf and killed caudwell to avenge deadly insults against her it was only when i persuaded her that these suspicions were as unmerited as well as accusations against herself that she agreed to talk max bit his lip and busied himself with getting more coffee for the three women victoria waited for him to finish before continuing when i finally got a detailed account of what took place at caudwells party i heard about three people with an axe to grind one always has to ask what axe and how big a grindstone thats what ive spent the weekend finding out you might as well know that ive been to little rock and to havelock north carolina gioia began jingling the coins in his pockets again mrs caudwell said softly grif i am feeling a little faint perhaps home you go mom steve cried out with alacrity in a few minutes mrs caudwell the sergeant said from the doorway get her feet up warshawski for a moment max was afraid that steve or deborah was going to attack victoria but mcgonnigal moved over to the widows chair and the children sat down again little drops of sweat dotted griffens balding head gioias face had a greenish sheen foliage on top of his redwood neck the thing that leapt out at me victoria continued calmly as though there had been no interruption was caudwells remark to dr gioia the doctor was clearly upset but people were so focused on lotty and the statue that they didnt pay any attention to that so i went to little rock arkansas on saturday and found the paul nierman whose name caudwell had mentioned to gioia nierman lived in the same fraternity with gioia when they were undergraduates together twentyfive years ago and he took dr gioias anatomy and physiology exams his junior year when gioia was in danger of academic probation so he could stay on the football team well that seemed unpleasant perhaps disgraceful but theres no question that gioia did all his own work in medical school passed his boards and so on so i didnt think the board would demand a resignation for this youthful indiscretion the question was whether gioia thought they would and if he would have killed to prevent caudwell making it public she paused and the immunologist blurted out no no but caudwell caudwell knew id opposed his appointment he and i our approaches to medicine were very opposite and as soon as he said niermans name to me i knew hed found out and that hed torment me with it forever ii went back to his place sunday night to have it out with him i was more determined than dr herschel and got into his unit through the kitchen entrance he hadnt locked that i went to his study but he was already dead i couldnt believe it it absolutely terrified me i could see hed been strangled and well its no secret that im strong enough to have done it i wasnt thinking straight i just got clean away from there i think ive been running ever since you mcgonnigal shouted how come we havent heard about this before because you insisted on focusing on dr herschel vi said nastily i knew hed been there because the doorman told me he would have told you if youd asked this is terrible mrs gildersleeve interjected i am going to talk to the board tomorrow and demand the resignations of dr gioia and dr herschel do victoria agreed cordially tell them the reason you got to stay for this was because murray ryerson at the heraldstar was doing a little checking for me here in chicago he found out that part of the reason you were so jealous of caudwells collection is that youre living terribly in debt i wont humiliate you in public by telling people what your money has gone to but youve had to sell your husbands art collection and you have a third mortgage on your house a valuable statue with no documented history would have taken care of everything martha gildersleeve shrank inside her sable you dont know anything about this well murray talked to pablo and eduardoyes i wont say anything else so anyway murray checked whether either gioia or mrs gildersleeve had the statue they didnt so youve been in my house mrs gildersleeve shrieked vi shook her head not me murray ryerson she looked apologetically at the sergeant i knew youd never get a warrant for me since youd made an arrest and youd never have got it in time anyway she looked at her coffee cup saw it was empty and put it down again max took it from the table and filled it for her a third time his fingertips were itching with nervous irritation some of the coffee landed on his trouser leg i talked to murray saturday night from little rock when he came up empty here i headed for north carolina to havelock where griffen and lewis caudwell grew up and where mrs caudwell still lives and i saw the house where griffen lives and talked to the doctor who treats mrs caudwell and you really are a pooper snooper arent you steve said pooper snooper pooper snooper deborah chanted dont get enough thrills of your own so you have to live on other peoples shit yeah the neighbors talked to me about you two victoria looked at them with contemptuous indulgence youve been a twoperson wolfpack terrifying most of the people around you since you were three but the folks in havelock admired how you always stuck up for your mother you thought your father got her addicted to tranquilizers and then left her high and dry so you brought her newest version with you and were all set you just needed to decide when to give it to him dr herschels outburst over the statue played right into your hands you figured your father had stolen it from your uncle to begin with why not send it back to him and let dr herschel take the rap it wasnt like that steve said red spots burning in his cheeks what was it like son mcgonnigal had moved next to him dont talk to them theyre tricking you deborah shrieked the pooper snooper and her gopher gooper she mommy used to love us before daddy made her take all this shit then she went away we just wanted him to see what it was like we started putting xanax in his coffee and stuff we wanted to see if hed fuck up during surgery let his life get ruined but then he was sleeping there in the study after his stupidass party and we thought wed just let him sleep through his morning surgery sleep forever you know it was so easy we used his own harvard necktie i was so fucking sick of hearing early to bed early to rise from him and we sent the statue to uncle grif i suppose the pooper snooper found it there he can sell it and mother can be all right again grandpa stole it from jews and daddy stole it from grif so we thought it worked out perfectly if we stole it from daddy deborah cried she leaned her blond head next to her brothers and shrieked with laughter v max watched the line of lottys legs change as she stood on tiptoe to reach a brandy snifter short muscular from years of racing at top speed from one point to the next maybe they werent as svelte as the long legs of modern american girls but he preferred them he waited until her feet were securely planted before making his announcement the board is bringing in justin hardwick for a final interview for chief of staff max she whirled the bengal fire sparkling in her eyes i know this hardwick and he is another like caudwell looking for costcutting and no poverty patients i wont have it weve got you and gioia and a dozen others bringing in so many nonpaying patients that were not going to survive another five years at the present rate i figure its a balancing act we need someone who can see that the hospital survives so that you and art can practice medicine the way you want to and when he knows what happened to his predecessor hell be very careful not to stir up our resident tigress max she was hurt and astonished at the same time oh youre joking i see its not very funny to me you know my dear weve got to learn to laugh about it its the only way well ever be able to forgive ourselves for our terrible misjudgments he stepped over to put an arm around her now where is this remarkable surprise you promised to show me she shot him a look of pure mischief lotty on a dare as he first remembered meeting her at eighteen his hold on her tightened and he followed her to her bedroom in a glass case in the corner complete with a humiditycontrol system stood the pietro andromache max looked at the beautiful anguished face i understand your sorrows she seemed to say to him i understand your grief for your mother your family your history but its all right to let go of them to live in the present and hope for the future its not a betrayal tears pricked his eyelids but he demanded how did you get this i was told the police had it under lock and key until lawyers decided on the disposition of caudwells estate victoria lotty said shortly i told her the problem and she got it for me on the condition that i not ask how she did it and max you know damned well that it was not caudwells to dispose of it was lottys of course it was max wondered briefly how joseph the second had come by it to begin with for that matter what had lottys greatgreatgrandfather done to earn it from the emperor max looked into lottys tiger eyes and kept such reflections to himself instead he inspected hectors foot where the filler had been carefully scraped away to reveal the old chip afraid all the time nancy pickard nancy pickard b was born in kansas city missouri and graduated from the missouri school of journalism working for a time as a reporter and editor before turning to freelance writing her series about jenny cain foundation director in a small massachusetts town began with the paperback original generous death graduating to hardcovers with the third book no body noted from the beginning for their humor the cain books gradually became darker in tone and theme in an interview with robert j randisi speaking of murder volume ii pickard explained why using susan wittig alberts term the megabook mystery seriesa new phenomenonwhich denotes a series of novels which are essentially one long book each novel in the series is rather like a chapter in the megabook unlike the series of writers like agatha christie and john d macdonald in which sleuths like miss marple and travis mcgee remained essentially the same from book to book in a megabook series you cant count on each succeeding book being much like the lastits more like real life ifany amateur sleuth is ever like real life because the protagonist goes through some real changesas we and they mature things do come to assume a more substantial feeling a weightiness which can sometimes carry a feeling of greater darkness in several books beginning with the ingredient chile con carne murders pickard has adopted the character of eugenia potter introduced in three novels by the late virginia rich pickards continuation of the series the first based on richs notes and the later ones on original stories brought a sense of pace craft and complexity missing from some cooking mysteries and others in the domestic cozy category asked by randisi if she is a cozy writer pickard has fun with the concept i dont know what i am whats between cozy and uncomfortable if mystery writers were chairs i wouldnt quite be a chintz rocking chair but i wouldnt be a hard metal folding chair either a nice swivel office chair perhaps some novelists who also write short stories produce the same sort of narrative only shorter others use the short form to experiment with theme mood and subject matter pickard is in the latter category as shown in her collection storm warnings and in the edgarnominated story afraid all the time ribbon a darkness over me mel brown known variously as pell mell and animel sang the line from the song over and over behind his windshield as he flew from missouri into kansas on his old black harleydavidson motorcycle already he loved kansas because the highway that stretched ahead of him was like a long flat dark ribbon unfurled just for him ribbon a darkness over me he flew full throttle into the lateafternoon glare feeling as if he were soaring gloriously drunk and blind on a skyway to the sun the clouds in the far distance looked as if theyd rain on him that night but he didnt worry about it hed heard there were plenty of empty farm and ranch houses in kansas where a man could break in to spend the night hed heard it was like having your choice of free motels kansas was ribbon a darkness over me three hundred miles to the southwest jane baum suddenly stopped what she was doing the fear had hit her again it was always like that striking out of nowhere like a fist against her heart she dropped her clothes basket from rigid fingers and stood as if paralyzed between the two clotheslines in her yard there was a wet sheet to her right another to her left for once the wind had died down so the sheets hung as still and silent as walls she felt enclosed in a narrow white sterile room of cloth and she never wanted to leave it outside of it was danger on either side of the sheets lay the endless prairie where she felt like a tiny mouse exposed to every hawk in the sky it took all of her willpower not to scream she hugged her own shoulders to comfort herself it didnt help within a few moments she was crying and then shaking with a palsy of terror she hadnt known shed be so afraid eight months ago before she had moved to this small farm shed inherited shed had romantic notions about it even about such simple things as hanging clothes on a line it would feel so good she had imagined they would smell so sweet instead everything had seemed strange and threatening to her from the start and it was getting worse now she didnt even feel protected by the house she was beginning to feel as if it were fear instead of electricity that lighted her lamps filled her tub lined her cupboards and covered her bed fear that she breathed instead of air she hated the prairie and everything on it the city had never frightened her not like this she knew the city she understood it she knew how to avoid its dangers and its troubles in the city there were buildings everywhere and now she knew why it was to blot out the true and terrible openness of the earth on which all of the inhabitants were so horribly exposed to danger the wind picked up again it snapped the wet sheets against her body janie bolted from her shelter like a mouse with a hawk circling overhead she ran as if she were being chased she ran out of her yard and then down the highway racing frantically breathlessly for the only other shelter she knew when she reached cissy johnsons house she pulled open the side door and flung herself inside without knocking cissy im afraid all the time i know janie cissy johnson stood at her kitchen sink peeling potatoes for supper while she listened to jane baums familiar litany of fear by now cissy knew it by heart janie was afraid of being alone in the house she had inherited from her aunt the dark the crack of every twig in the night the storm cellar the horses that might step on her the cows that might trample her the chickens that might peck her the cats that might bite her and have rabies the coyotes that might attack her the truckers who drove by her house especially the flirtatious ones who blasted their horns when they saw her in the yard tornadoes blizzards electrical storms having to drive so far just to get simple groceries and supplies at first cissy had been sympathetic offering daily doses of coffee and friendship but it was getting harder all the time to remain patient with somebody who just burst in without knocking and who complained all the time about imaginary problems and who youve lived here all your life jane said as if the woman at the sink had not previously been alert to that fact she sat in a kitchen chair huddled into herself like a child being punished her voice was low as if she were talking more to herself than to cissy youre used to it thats why it doesnt scare you um cissy murmured as if agreeing but out of her neighbors sight she dug viciously at the eye of a potato she rooted it out leaving behind a white moist open wound in the vegetable and flicked the dead black skin into the sink where the water running from the faucet washed it down the garbage disposal she thought how shed like to pour janies fears down the sink and similarly grind them up and flush them away she held the potato to her nose and sniffed inhaling the crisp raw smell then as if having gained strength from that private moment she glanced back over her shoulder at her visitor cissy was ashamed of the fact that the mere sight of jane baum now repelled her it was a crime really how shed let herself go she wished jane would comb her hair pull her shoulders back paint a little coloring onto her pale face and wear something else besides that ugly denim jumper that came nearly to her heels cissys husband bob called janie cissys pup and he called that jumper the pup tent he was right cissy thought the woman did look like an insecure spotty adolescent and not at all like a grown woman of thirtyfiveplus years and darn it janie did follow cissy around like a neurotic nuisance of a puppy is bob coming back tonight jane asked now shes even invading my mind cissy thought she whacked resentfully at the potato peeling off more meat than skin tomorrow her shoulders tensed then can i sleep over here tonight no cissy surprised herself with the shortness of her reply she could practically feel janie radiating hurt and so she tried to make up for it by softening her tone im sorry janie but ive got too much book work to do and its hard to concentrate with people in the house ive even told the girls they can take their sleeping bags to the barn tonight to give me some peace the girls were her daughters tessie thirteen and mandy eleven they want to spend the night out there cause weve got that new little blind calf were nursing his mother wont have anything to do with him poor little thing tessie has named him flopper because he tries to stand up but he just flops back down so the girls are bottlefeeding him and they want to sleep near oh it was heavy with reproach cissy stepped away from the sink to turn her oven on to her own internal temperature was rising too god forbid she should talk about her life god forbid they should ever talk about anything but janie and all the damned things she was scared of she could write a book about it how jane baum made a big mistake by leaving kansas city and how everything about the country just scared her to death arent you afraid of anything cissy the implied admiration came with a bit of a whine to it any thing like a curve on a fastball yes cissy drew out the word reluctantly you are what cissy turned around at the sink and laughed selfconsciously its so sillyim even afraid to mention it tell me ill feel better if i know youre afraid of things too there cissy thought even my fears come down to how they affect you all right she sighed well im afraid of something happening to bobby a wreck on the highway or something or to one of the girls or my folks things like that i mean like leukemia or a heart attack or something i cant control im always afraid there wont be enough money and we might have to sell this place were so happy here i guess im afraid that might change she paused dismayed by the sudden realization that she had not been as happy since jane baum moved in down the road for a moment she stared accusingly at her neighbor i guess thats what im afraid of then cissy added deliberately but i dont think about it all the time i think about mine all the time jane whispered i know i hate it here you could move back janie stared reproachfully you know i cant afford that cissy closed her eyes momentarily the idea of having to listen to this for who knew how many years i love coming over here janie said wistfully as if reading cissys mind again it always makes me feel so much better this is the only place i feel safe anymore i just hate going home to the big old house all by myself i will not invite you to supper cissy thought janie sighed cissy gazed out the big square window behind janie it was october her favorite month when the grass turned as red as the curly hair on a herefords back and the sky turned a steel gray like the highway that ran between their houses it was as if the whole world blended into itself the grass into the cattle the roads into the sky and she into all of it there was an electricity in the air as if something more important than winter were about to happen as if all the world were one and about to burst apart into something brandnew cissy loved the prairie and it hurt her feelings a little that janie didnt how could anyone live in the middle of so much beauty she puzzled and be frightened of it well never get a better chance tess ticked off the rationale for the adventure by holding up the fingers of her right hand one at a time an inch from her sisters scared face dads gone were in the barn momll be asleep its a new moon she ran out of fingers on that hand and lifted her left thumb and the dogs know us theyll find out mandy wailed wholl find out mom and daddy will they wont whos gonna tell em the gasstation owner you think we left a trail of toilet paper hes going to follow from his station to here and hes gonna call the sheriff and say lock up those johnson girls boys they stole my toilet paper yes together they turned to gaze one of them with pride and cunning the other with pride and trepidation at the small hill of hay that was piled for no apparent reason in the shadows of a far corner of the barn underneath that pile lay their collection of six rolls of toilet paper a new one filched from their own linen closet and five partly used ones stolen one trip at a time and hidden in their school jackets from the ladies bathroom at the gas station in town tesss plan was for the two of them to tp their neighbors house that night after dark tess had lovely visions of how it would look all ghostly and spooky with streamers of white hanging down from the tree limbs and waving eerily in the breeze they do it all the time in kansas city jerk tess proclaimed and ill bet they dont make any big deal crybaby deal out of it she wanted to be the first one in her class to do it and she wasnt about to let her little sister chicken out on her this plan would tess was sure make her famous in at least a fourcounty area no grownup would ever figure out who had done it but all the kids would know even if she had to tell them momll kill us nobodyll know its gonna rain its not gonna rain we shouldnt leave flopper now they looked together at the baby bull calf in one of the stalls it stared blindly in the direction of their voices tried to rise but was too frail to do it dont be a dope we leave him all the time mandy sighed tess who recognized the sound of surrender when she heard it smiled magnanimously at her sister you can throw the first roll she offered in a truck stop in emporia mel brown slopped up his supper gravy with the last third of a cloverleaf roll he had a table by a window as he ate he stared with pleasure at his bike outside if he moved his head just so the rays from the setting sun flashed off the handle bars he thought about how the leather seat and grips would feel soft and warm and supple the way a woman in leather felt when he got back on at the thought he got a warm feeling in his crotch too and he smiled god he loved living like this when he was hungry he ate when he was tired he slept when he was horny he found a woman when he was thirsty he stopped at a bar right now mel felt like not paying the entire for this lousy chickenfried steak dinner and coffee he pulled four dollar bills out of his wallet and a couple of quarters out of his right front pocket and set it all out on the table with the money sticking out from under the check mel got up and walked past the waitress its on the table he told her no cherry pie she asked him it sounded like a proposition so he grinned as he said nah if you werent so ugly he thought i just might stay for dessert come again she said you wish he thought if they called him back hed say he couldnt read her handwriting her fault no wonder she didnt get a tip smiling he lifted a toothpick off the cashiers counter and used it to salute the man behind the cash register thanks the man said you bet outside mel stood in the parking lot and stretched shoving his arms high in the air letting anybody who was watching get a good look at him nothin to hide eat your heart out baby then he strolled over to his bike and kicked the stand up with his heel he poked around his mouth with the toothpick spat out a sliver of meat then flipped the toothpick onto the ground he climbed back on his bike letting out a breath of satisfaction when his butt hit the warm leather seat mel accelerated slowly savoring the surge of power building between his legs jane baum was in bed by that night exhausted once again by her own fear lying there in her late aunts double bed she obsessed on the mistake she had made in moving to this dreadful empty place in the middle of nowhere she had expected to feel nervous for a while as any other city dweller might who moved to the country but she hadnt counted on being actually phobic about it of being possessed by a fear so strong that it seemed to inhabit every cell of her body until at night every night she felt she could die from it she hadnt known how could she have known she would be one of those people who is terrified by the vastness of the prairie she had visited the farm only a few times as a child and from those visits she had remembered only warm and fuzzy things like caterpillars and chicks she had only dimly remembered how antlike a human being feels on the prairie her aunts house had been broken into twice during the period between her aunts death and her own occupancy that fact cemented her fantasies in a foundation of terrifying reality when cissy said its your imagination janie retorted but it happened twice before twice she wasnt making it up there were strange brutal men thats how she imagined them they were never caught by the police who broke in and took whatever they wanted cans in the cupboard the radio in the kitchen it could happen again janie thought obsessively as she lay in the bed it could happen over and over to me to me to me on the prairie the darkness seemed absolute to her there were millions of stars but no streetlights coyotes howled or cattle bawled occasionally the big nightriding semis whirred by out front their tire and engine sounds seemed to come out of nowhere build to an intolerable whine and then disappear in an uncanny way she pictured the drivers as big rough intense men hopped up on amphetamines she worried that one night she would hear truck tires turning into her gravel drive that an engine would switch off that a truck door would quietly open and then close that careful footsteps would slur across her gravel her fear had grown so huge so bad that she was even frightened of it it was like a monstrous balloon that inflated every time she breathed every night the fear got worse the balloon got bigger it nearly filled the bedroom now the upstairs bedroom where she lay was hot because she had the windows pulled down and latched and the curtains drawn she could have cooled it with a fan on the dressing table but she was afraid the fans noise might cover the sound of whatever might break into the first floor and climb the stairs to attack her she lay with a sheet and a blanket pulled up over her arms and shoulders to just under her chin she was sweating as if her fearfrozen body were melting but it felt warm and almost comfortable to her she always wore pajamas and thin wool socks to bed because she felt safer when she was completely dressed she especially felt more secure in pajama pants which no dirty hand could shove up onto her belly as it could a nightgown lying in bed like a quadriplegic unmoving eyes open janie reviewed her precautions every door was locked every window was permanently shut and locked so that she didnt have to check them every night all the curtains were drawn the porch lights were off and her car was locked in the barn so no trucker would think she was home lately she had taken to sleeping with her aunts loaded pistol on the pillow beside her head cissy crawled into bed just before midnight tired from hours of accounting she had been out to the barn to check on her giggling girls and the blind calf she had talked to her husband when he called from oklahoma city now she was thinking about how she would try to start easing janie baum out of their lives im sorry janie but im awfully busy today i dont think you ought to come over oh but there would be that meek martyred little voice just like a baby mouse needing somebody to mother it how would she deny that need she was already feeling guilty about refusing janies request to sleep over well i will i just will do it thats all if i could say no to the fha girls when they were selling fruitcakes i can start saying no more often to janie baum anyway shes never going to get over her fears if i indulge them bob had said as much when shed complained to him longdistance cissy youre not helping her hed said youre just letting her get worse and then hed said something new that had disturbed her anyway i dont like the girls being around her so much shes getting too weird cissy she thought of her daughters of fearless tess and dear little mandy and of how safe and nice it was for children in the country besides bob had said shes got to do more of her own chores we need tess and mandy to help out around our place more we cant be having them always running off to mow her grass and plant her flowers and feed her cows and water her horse and get her eggs just because shes scared to stick her silly hand under a damned hen counting the chores put cissy to sleep tess mandy hissed desperately wait the older girl slowed to give mandy time to catch up to her and then to touch tess for reassurance they paused for a moment to catch their breath and to crouch in the shadow of jane baums porch tess carried three rolls of toilet paper in a makeshift pouch shed formed in the belly of her black sweatshirt we gotta wear black remember and mandy was similarly equipped tess decided that now was the right moment to drop her bomb ive been thinking she whispered mandy was struck cold to her heart by that familiar and dreaded phrase she moaned quietly what it might rain i told you so i think we better do it inside inside shh itll scare her to death itll be great nobody elsell ever have the guts to do anything as neat as this well do the kitchen and if we have time maybe the dining room ohhh noooo she thinks shes got all the doors and windows locked but she doesnt tess giggled she had it all figured out that when jane baum came downstairs in the morning shed take one look scream faint and then when she woke up call everybody in town the fact that jane might also call the sheriff had occurred to her but since tess didnt have any faith in the ability of adults to figure out anything important she wasnt worried about getting caught when i took in her eggs i unlocked the downstairs bathroom window come on thisll be great the ribbon of darkness ahead of mel brown was no longer straight it was now bunched into long steep hills he hadnt expected hills nobody had told him there was any part of kansas that wasnt flat so he wasnt making as good time and the couldnt run fullbore but then he wasnt in a hurry except for the hell of it and this was more interesting more dangerous and he liked the thrill of that he started edging closer to the centerline every time he roared up a hill playing a game of highway roulette in which he was the winner as long as whatever coming from the other direction had its headlights on when that got boring he turned his own headlights off now he roared past cars and trucks like a dark demon mel laughed every time thinking how surprised they must be and how frightened theyd think crazy fool i could have hit him he supposed he wasnt afraid of anything except maybe going back to prison and he didnt think theyd send him down on a speeding ticket besides if kansas was like most states it was long on roads and short on highway patrolmen roaring downhill was even more fun because of the way his stomach dropped out he felt like a kid yelling fuuuuck all the way down the other side what a goddamned roller coaster of a state this was turning out to be the rain still looked miles away mel felt as if he could ride all night except that his eyes were gritty the first sign that hed better start looking for a likely place to spend the night he wasnt one to sleep under the stars not if he could find a ceiling tess directed her sister to stack the rolls of toilet paper underneath the bathroom window on the first floor of jane baums house the six rolls all white stacked three in a row two high gave tess the little bit of height and leverage she needed to push up the glass with her palms she stuck her fingers under the bottom edge and laboriously attempted to raise the window it was stiff in its coats of paint damn she exclaimed and let her arms slump beneath her feet the toilet paper was getting squashed she tried again and this time she showed her strength from lifting calves and tossing hay with a crack of paint and a thump of wood on wood the window slid all the way up shhh mandy held her fists in front of her face and knocked her knuckles against each other in excitement and agitation her ears picked up the sound of a roaring engine on the highway and she was immediately sure it was the sheriff coming to arrest her and tess she tugged frantically at the calf of her sisters right leg tess jerked her leg out of mandys grasp and disappeared through the open window the crack of the window and the thunder of the approaching motorcycle confused themselves in janes sleeping consciousness so that when she awoke from dreams full of anxiety her eyes flying open the rest of her body frozen she imagined in a confused hallucinatory kind of way that somebody was both coming to get her and already there in the house jane then did as she had trained herself to do she had practiced over and over every night so that her actions would be instinctive she turned her face to the pistol on the other pillow and placed her thumb on the trigger her fear of rape of torture of kidnapping of agony of death was a balloon and she floated horribly in the center of it there were thumps and other sounds downstairs and they joined her in the balloon there was an engine roaring and then suddenly it was silent and a slurring of wheels in her gravel drive and these sounds joined her in her balloon when she couldnt bear it any longer she popped the balloon by shooting herself in the forehead in the driveway mel brown heard the gun go off he slung his leg back onto his motorcycle and roared back out onto the highway so the place had looked empty so hed been wrong so hed find someplace else but holy shit get the fuck outta here inside the house in the bathroom tess also heard the shot and being a ranch child recognized it instantly for what it was although she wasnt exactly sure where it had come from cussing and sobbing she clambered over the sink and back out the window falling onto her head and shoulders on the rolls of toilet paper its the sheriff mandy was hysterical hes shooting at us tess grabbed her little sister by a wrist and pulled her away from the house they were both crying and stumbling they ran in the drainage ditch all the way home and flung themselves into the barn mandy ran to lie beside the little blind bull calf she lay her head on floppers side when he didnt respond she jerked to her feet she glared at her sister hes dead shut up cissy johnson had awakened too although she hadnt known why something some noise had stirred her and now she sat up in bed breathing hard frightened for no good reason she could fathom if bob had been home shed have sent him out to the barn to check on the girls but why the girls were all right they must be this was just the result of a bad dream but she didnt remember having any such dream cissy got out of bed and ran to the window no it wasnt a storm the rain hadnt come a motorcycle thats what shed heard thats what had awakened her quickly with nervous fingers cissy put on a robe and tennis shoes darn you janie baum she thought your fears are contagious thats what they are the thought popped into her head if you dont have fears they cant come true cissy raced out to the barn the young shall see visions and the old dream dreams kristine kathryn rusch there

alfred hitchcocks mystery magazine nell rubs a hand on her knickers and grips the bat tightly her topknot is coming loose she can see strands of hair hanging in front of the wire frames of her glasses whats the matter foureyes you nervous she concentrates on the ball pete holds in his right hand instead of the boys scattered across the dusty back lot any minute now hell pitch and if she thinks about the ball instead of the names shell hit it you hold that bat like a girl tj says from first base nell keeps staring at the ball she can see the stitches running along its face the dirty surface disappearing into petes fist thats because i am a girl she says it doesnt matter if tj hears her all that matters is that she spoke pitch already chucky yells from the grassy sideline pete spits and nell grimaces she hates it when he spits with a sharp snap of the wrist he releases the ball it curves toward her she jumps out of its way and swings at the same time the ball hits the skinny part of the bat close to her fingers and bounces forward ruuun chucky screams she drops the bat and takes off the air caught in her throat shes not good at running someone always tags her before she gets to base but the sweaterwrapped rock that is first base is getting closer and still she cant hear anyone running behind her she leaps the last few inches and lands in the middle of the rock leaving a large footprint in the wool a few seconds later the ball slams into tjs palm you didnt have to move tj says the ball was gonna hit you anyway pete always does that so that i cant swing nell tugs on her ripped highbuttoned blouse he knows i hit better than any of you guys so he cheats and besides the last time he did that i was bruised for a week papa wasnt gonna let me play anymore tj shrugs his attention already on the next batter nell she looks up edmund is standing behind third base his threepiece suit is dusty and he looks tired jeez she says under her breath what tj asks nothing she says i gotta go why the games not over i know she pushes a strand of hair out of her face but i gotta go anyway she walks across the field in front of the pitchers mound pete spits and barely misses her shoe she stops and slowly looks up at him in a conscious imitation of her fathers most frightening look whatcha think youre doing he asks leaving her glasses have slid to the edge of her nose but she doesnt push them back touching them would remind him that she cant see very well cant youre on first chucky can take my place cant neither hes gotta bat soon she glances at chucky hes too far away to hear anything i cant do anything about it pete i gotta go pete tugs his cap over his eyes and squints at her then you cant play with us no more it was dumb to let a girl play in the first place it is not dumb and youve gone home in the middle of a game before she hates pete someday shell show him that a girl can be just as good as a boy even at baseball nell edmund sounds weary lets go hes not your pa pete says how come you gotta go with him hes my sisters boyfriend she pushes her glasses up with her knuckle and trudges the rest of the way across the yard when she reaches edmund he takes her arm and they start walking why do you play with them he asks softly baseball isnt a game for young ladies he always asks her that and once he yelled at her for wearing the knickers that karl had given her i dont like playing dollies with louisa i dont suppose id like that much either he says when they get far enough away from the field he stops and turns her to him there are deep shadows under his eyes and his face looks pinched im not going to take you all the way home i just came because i promised i would youre not gonna see bess he shakes his head then reaches into his pocket and pulls out the slender ring that cost him three months wages the diamond glitters in the sunlight karls back he says nell traced the nameplate karl krupp she hadnt imagined it the name didnt disappear under her touch like so many other things did her fingers with their swollen knuckles and fragile bones looked defenseless beside that name slowly she let her hand fall back onto the cold metal rim of her walker he would be how old now when she had been ten he had been twentyfive a fifteenyear difference that would now make himninetyfive she glanced at the door to his room it hadnt been open since he arrived and that frustrated her she wanted to see how badly age had changed him she supposed it hadnt changed him much since he was in household the other residents were reasonably intelligent and ambulatory except for sophronia but the nurses had removed her as soon as her senility became evident nells own memory lapses and growing tendency to daydream worried her she wasnt sure how much provocation the nurses needed before they moved her to a more restrictive household nell lifted her walker and moved away from the door she didnt want karl to catch her snooping her name was different and she certainly didnt look like the scrawny tomboy he had known but she didnt want him to know that she was watching him until she knew exactly what she was going to do karl slouches indolently in the settee his long legs stretch out before him and cross at the ankles his left arm is draped across the armrest and his finely chiseled head rests against the upholstered back he should not be comfortable but he clearly is bess sits in the armchair across from him leaning forward wisps of hair frame her flushed face her eyes sparkle and her hands looking naked without edmunds ring nervously toy with her best skirt nell lets the door swing shut karl doesnt turn at the click but instead says in his deep rich baritone is that my nell she freezes not expecting the well of emotion that voice raises in her she imagines herself running to him and burying her face in his neck then pulling back and slapping him with all her strength nelly its karl bess cant quite keep the happiness from her voice i know she says flicking dried mud off her thumb she is covered with sweat her glasses are dirty and her topknot is coming loose she probably doesnt even look like a little girl nelly she hates the nickname almost as much as she hates besss tone im gonna go wash up go around front so you dont get mud on the floor nell suppresses a sigh and turns around to let herself out just then her father opens the door bringing with him the scents of tobacco and hair tonic he ignores his youngest daughters appearance and starts to go into the parlor who owns the fancy modelt is it yours edm he stops just inside the parlor and nell takes a step forward so that she can see everything karl rises quickly and extends his hand bess is biting her lower lip and papa has flushed a deep scarlet i told you he says in his lowest angriest voice never to cross my threshold again mr richter things have changed i dont care if youve become the richest man in the world you are not welcome here papas voice grows even softer now get out sir please get out or must i escort you with one swift graceful movement karl sweeps his hat off the table and places it jauntily on his head he nods at bess steps around papa and musses nells hair as he goes out the door papa doesnt move until he hears the automobile crank up then he says tightly to bess you know hes not allowed to be here but hes different hes got a new job in milwaukee and hes got prospects papa fine let him find another girl nell leans back against the door they have forgotten that shes there papa bess rises out of the armchair in her highbuttoned shoes she is almost as tall as her father things are better he promised oh did he promise he would never hit you again or did he just talk about money bess whirls away and looks out the window papa thats not fair no its not fair papa pulls his watch from his pocket opens it and then closes it without looking at the face but i dont want him back after he hit you i heard nelly crying herself to sleep every single night nells face grows warm she thought no one knew papa stuffs his watch back into his pocket and adjusts his waistcoat now i would like some dinner nell slips out the front door and heads around the house to the pump her body is shaking she remembers besss swollen and bruised face but she also remembers the fun they had laughing on the front porch with karl her tears those nights hadnt been just for bess they had also been for those summer afternoons filled with laughter lemonade and karl mussing her hair even though it was difficult nell liked to walk she felt that each slow step added a minute to her life without her walker she would have to use a wheelchair and the wheelchair was a sign of weakness lifting the walker and then taking a step gave her the same sure feel that she used to have after hitting a home run the way karl had taught her to sometimes she spent the entire day walking up and down the hallways she got to go outside on those rare occasions when her family visited they took her out so that they could avoid talking each household was painted a different color the walls in household were robins egg blue and covered with artwork done by the residents shortly after karl arrived a painting of a multicolored spiral had gone up beside his door nell found her gaze drawn to the painting she pushed her glasses up so that she could study it the spiral had rungs like a ladder at the bottom instead of a signature was a notation that tugged at a memory she couldnt reach deoxyribose nucleic acid she read the phrase twice then saw with a start that karls door was open strains of a chopin etude slipped into the hallway intrigued she leaned closer the residents were encouraged to fill their rooms with their personal effects most rooms had a television set a stuffed armchair covered with a quilt and a cross on prominent display but karls room was lined with bookcases and the bookcases were full karl stood near the door holding a book in his hand its the pretty woman from across the hall his voice hadnt changed it was still rich and full and it still sent shivers down her back his black hair had become silver and his skin was covered with delicately etched lines age hadnt bent him he extended his hand his movements were as graceful as ever would you care to come and visit for a moment nell found herself staring at his hand the last time she had seen it it had been covered with blood no thank you she said im taking my walk surely you have just a moment he inclined his head toward her waiting for her to give him her name eleanor she said eleanor he took a step back so that she could pass him she hesitated then smiled a little bit at herself realizing that this was the man who had given her a taste for charm a moment she turned her walker and started toward him feeling awkward for the first time in years he watched her shuffling movements arthritis she shook her head i broke both hips pinchhitting for some little leaguers in the doctors said id never walk again did you win she looked up at him startled to find herself only a foot away im walking arent i he chuckled no no the game oh she pushed the walker through the doorway bookcases made the entrance narrow his room smelled like ink and old books we lost by three runs its a shame he said quietly you should always win your last game she stopped near the window he had a view of the back parking lot who says it was my last game she turned and looked at his room then it was filled with books a desk covered with papers stood in the center of the floor and a stereo like the one her granddaughter was so proud of took up a shelf of one of the bookcases the bed in the far corner was neatly made and covered with a manufactured spread would you like to sit he pulled a chair back for her nell shook her head tea then he reached behind him and plugged in a coffee machine cups canisters and vials filled with liquid rested beside the machine what are you doing here nells question slipped out he turned sharply to look at her nell felt herself blush i mean you dont look as if you need to be here he smiled and the lines cascaded into wrinkles my grandnephew runs this place he figures im getting too old to live alone but there are other places to stay if youre in good health you dont seem to need medical care i dont yet he hooked his thumb in his front pockets and leaned against the door frame nell wondered if hed stop her if she tried to leave im helping him with some research nell glanced again at the desk some of the papers lying there were covered with the same spiral that was near the door were trying to find a way to slow down the aging process he said youve heard of leonard hayflick no hayflick is a biologist who found that cells have a clearly defined life span he figured that the life span was determined by the number of cell divisions instead of chronological age but some cells deteriorate before they reach their maximum divisions and that some believe causes aging follow me nell realized she had been staring at him blankly sorry let me put it simply he said everyone can live to a certain maximum age but not everyone reaches that age because of physical deterioration what were trying to do is prevent that physical deterioration so that people can live out their entire lives what is this maximum age nell asked karl shrugged we dont know but some people have claimed that they were well over a hundred and i just read about a woman recently whose baptismal records prove she is a hundred and twenty why are you telling me you asked nelly nells entire body went cold she gripped her walker tightly and tried to think of a way she could get out of the room he took a step toward her and she cringed im sorry he said softly i should have let you know right away that i knew who you were my family stayed in wisconsin nell they let me know what was going on in your life i knew you were here well before i came what are you going to do her voice trembled he took another cautious step toward her well first nelly id like to explain about bess no she said and her fear was as real as it had been that sunlit july morning when he had clamped his bloody hand against her mouth if you dont let me out of here im going to scream nelly i mean it karl im going to scream he opened his hands wide youre free to go nell if i wanted to hurt you i could have done it a long time ago she pushed the walker before her like a shield her hands were slipping on the metal as she passed karl she didnt look at him the walls seemed narrower and the distance to her room much too short when she got inside she closed the door wishing that it would lock but she knew that part of her fear was irrational there wasnt much a ninetyfiveyearold man could do to her here not in this home filled with bright lights and young nurses all she had to do was scream and someone would come to her they didnt ignore screams in household nell tugs at her knickers no matter how tightly she ties them they always stay uncomfortably loose about the waist she has been reluctant to slide into a base like chucky tells her to because shes afraid that if she does her knickers will come off she takes the path that goes through kirschmans apple orchard mr kirschman hates it when the kids take the shortcut through his orchard but they do anyway as she turns the corner to the center of the orchard someone clamps a hand over her mouth and drags her back against the tree the hand is tight and slippery it smells like iron nelly promise not to scream if i let you go the voice is karls she nods slowly he releases her what were you trying to do he raises a grimy finger to his lips his dark hair stands out in sharp relief to his pale skin i dont want you to go any farther okay i want you to go back and get your father right away promise nell nods again shes staring at his stained white shirt and she realizes that it is covered with blood she wipes at her mouth and her hand comes away bloody nell she turns and starts to run not realizing until shes rounded the corner that shes disobeyed karl there lying across the orchard path is her sister besss hair is strewn about her and her blouse is covered with blood nell itll be okay just nell screams karl is standing behind her she pushes him out of her way and runs down the orchard path toward home this time running seems easy although the air still catches in her throat she cant hear karl behind her and as she nears the house she knows shes safe karl wont hurt her karl would never hurt her the only one karl hurts is bess and that is besss fault because she doesnt listen to papa and now its too late its all too late because nell has left her there bleeding and helpless with karl the man who hurts her the man whose hands are covered with blood did i ever tell you that my sister was murdered anna smoothed her already neat skirt and sighed yes mother her tone said a thousand times mother do i have to hear it again nell clutched her hands in her lap trying to decide if she should continue anna would never believe her even though she was fiftyfive anna rarely thought about anything more serious than clothing and makeup and of course she had never known her aunt bess i saw the man who killed her anna suddenly became stiff and her eyes focused on something beyond nells shoulder nells heart was pounding her oldest elizabeth would have listened but bess had been dead for six years i think i told you this once nell said but the man who killed her his name was karl also killed her fiance edmund and they never caught him and it used to frighten me thinking that someday hed come back for me that was a long time ago mother annas voice had an edge to it i know nells fingers had grown cold but i wouldnt be telling you now if it werent important anna looked at her mother full in the face a deep piercing look why is it important now because hes here nell whispered the words sounded too melodramatic but she couldnt take them back hes across the hall anna took a deep breath mother even if he were here theres nothing he could do he probably doesnt even remember you he remembers nell said i talked to him even so anna reached out and took nells hand her palm was warm and moist hes an elderly man he probably wont live long if we called the police and they verified what you said he probably wouldnt even make it to trial i mean who else knows about the murder besides you my father knew and anyone living no tears were building in nells eyes she blinked rapidly then it would be your word against his and frankly mother i dont think its worth it i mean what can you gain now hell die soon and then you wont have to worry no a tear traced its way down nells cheek and stopped on her lips she licked it away quickly hoping anna didnt see he wont die soon anna frowned why not hes working on an experiment to prolong his life oh for gods sake mother anna pulled her hand away how many other people have you told this piece of nonsense to i havent a nurse knocked on the door and walked in she set a tray next to nells armchair i have your medication nell nell reached over and took the dixie cup the liquid inside was brown this doesnt look like my medication she looked up in time to see anna shaking her head at the nurse just drink it nell the nurse said in her fakely sweet voice and itll be all right nell took a sniff of the cup the contents smelled bitter i really dont want it mother anna snapped then in a confidential tone to the nurse she said mother is having a bad day the past few days have been difficult the nurse said she hasnt gone to meals and she wont leave her room at all is that true mother nell swirled the liquid in her cup sediment floated around the bottom suddenly she realized that it didnt matter no one would care if karl poisoned her she put the cup to her lips and drank before she could change her mind the liquid bit at her tongue like homemade whiskey she coughed once and then set the cup down i dont see why you want to know she said anna pursed her lips mother really nell rubbed her tongue against the roof of her mouth but she couldnt make the taste go away she grabbed the side of her chair and got to her feet her hips cracked slightly when she stood the nurse handed her the walker where are you going nell nell didnt reply she moved the walker toward the sink and got herself a drink of water im afraid my mother may not be well anna said softly she was just telling me that the man across the hall murdered her sister and shes afraid that hes after her mr krupp i wouldnt think so hes been bedridden since he came here maybe you should say something anna stopped speaking as nell turned around nell made her way back to the armchair the nurse took her arm as she sat down nell i understand the man across the hall frightens you nell looked up at the nurses round face trying to remember her name without glancing at the name tag no whatever gave you that idea your daughter was saying that he made you nervous the name tag said dana lpn i havent even seen him and hes very quiet why would that make me nervous the nurse smiled and picked up the tray i was just checking nell anna waited until the nurse left before speaking why did you lie to her mother i dont know why you come visit me nell said anna slid her chair back and stood up i dont know either sometimes but im sure ill be back she picked up her coat and slung it around her shoulder and mother its better for you to socialize you know than to stay locked up in your room talking to other people will give you something to think about so that your mind wont wander she walked out nell waited until she could no longer hear the click of annas high heels on the tile floor my mind doesnt wander she murmured but the nurse had said that karl was bedridden and he had looked so healthy to her nell sighed and then frowned what would he be doing in household if he couldnt get out of bed nell picks up the bat and takes a practice swing her dress sways with her but she wont wear the knickers karl gave her bess has been dead for a week and nell is lonely what are you doing here chucky asks they are alone the other boys havent arrived yet wanna play she says he frowns in a dress where are your knickers threw them out she hits the bat against the dirt like shes seen pete do you cant run in a dress i can try her anger is sharp and quick she hasnt been able to control her moods since bess died im sorry chucky ducks his head and looks away its okay im sorry she says again and looks at the playing field the grass has been ruined near the bases sometimes she thinks baseball is the only dream she has left now with bess dead and karl gone even that seems impossible ill just go home no chucky says i mean you can play she smiles a little and shakes her head not in a dress you were right wait he touches her arm and then runs to his house letting the porch door slam behind him she goes to home base and swings the bat again pretending that she has hit a home run it is a good feeling to send the ball whistling across the creek she loves nothing more if only she were a little boy she could play baseball forever karl once told her that she could turn into a boy when she kissed her elbow she tried for weeks before she realized that kissing her own elbow was impossible she will never be a boy but she will be good at baseball chucky comes back he thrusts some cloth into her hand here he says she unfolds it hes given her a pair of frayed and poorly mended knickers chucky they dont fit me no more maybe theyll fit you but isnt your brother supposed to get them nah he says but doesnt meet her eyes i dont want to take them if itll get you in trouble it wont he studies her sees that shes unconvinced look youre the best hitter on the team i dont want to lose you she smiles a real smile this time one that she feels thanks chucky nell resumed her walks again making sure that she took them around medication time karls door remained closed for days but she finally caught him in the hallway switching dixie cups on the trays youre switching my medication she said she stood straight leaning on her walker knowing that he couldnt touch her in the halls yes i am he replied she swallowed heavily she hadnt expected him to admit it why i guess i kinda feel like i owe you nell for killing bess he set the cup down on the tray marked with her room number his hand was trembling i didnt kill bess he said quietly i killed edmund youre lying he shook his head i was going to meet bess that morning in the orchard we were going to run away together edmund got there first and he killed her so i went and i killed him nell could feel the power of that morning the sunlight against her skin his bloody fingers across her lips why didnt you tell somebody i still committed a murder nelly thats why he had told her to get her father thats why he had never come back to kill her too why she shook her head in an attempt to clear it why did you come back here wisconsin is my home nell he was leaning on the cart for support i wanted to die at home but your experiment he smiled ive outlived most of my siblings for a good twenty years and the formula wasnt quite right for me at first weve changed it so yours is better from the start mine nelly he bowed his head slightly and ran his fingers through his thick silver hair the gesture made her think of the old karl the one who had taught her how to laugh and how to hit home runs what did you think that i was poisoning you she nodded im not im trying the drug on you i know i should have asked but you didnt trust me and it was just easier to do it this way why me she asked lots of reasons the cart slid forward slightly and he had to catch himself to keep from falling i dont know many people who still play baseball when theyre seventy years old or learn to walk again when the doctors say they cant youre strong nelly the power of your mind is amazing but what if i dont want to live any longer you do or you wouldnt be out here trying to catch me i have caught you the hallway was empty usually it was full of people walking back and forth i know karl said what are you going to do call a nurse tell them to arrest me theres no statute of limitations on murder you know nell studied him for a moment he was thin and his skin was pale he was ninetyfive how much longer could he live i dont want any more of your medication she said he stood motionlessly waiting for her to say something else she moved her walker forward on the other side of the cart and i dont want to talk anymore she didnt let herself look back as she slowly made her way down the hall imagine if she could walk without a walker without pain imagine if she could live longer than her father who had died when he was ninetyeight she wasnt ready to give up living yet some days she felt as if she had only just started when she reached her own door she stopped and looked back at karls once she had believed in karl and his miracles she did no longer the world has reduced itself to the ball clutched in petes hand throw it straight chucky yells pete spits nell barely notices she watches that ball knowing that when he throws it she will hit it with all her strength time seems to slow down as the ball whizzes toward her she knows how the ball will fly where it will end up and she swings the bat down to meet it there is a satisfying crack as they hit and time speeds up again holy cow chucky cries but nell ignores him as she drops the bat out of the corner of her eye she sees the ball sail over the creek she runs as fast as she can her right foot hits first base and she keeps going flying like the ball it disappears into the weeds behind the creek as her left foot hits second her glasses bounce off her nose between second and third and she is navigating according to color her lungs are burning as her left foot hits the rock that is third base go nelly go she runs toward the blurred shapes behind home there is a stitch in her side and her entire body aches but she keeps moving she leaps on home base and her team cheers but she cant stop she has run too hard to stop right away and she crashes into chucky who hugs her great he says that was great she stands there savoring the moment karl would have been proud of her but karl would never know she wipes the sweat off her forehead and says i lost my glasses as chucky trudges out to retrieve them she realizes she can get no higher than this her tiny girls body for all its batting accuracy will prevent her from going on but she doesnt care if she cant play on a real team she will hit home runs until she is a hundred long after these boys are dead that was great nelly chucky says as he hands her her glasses really great she checks the lenses which havent cracked and then bends the frame back into shape not bad for a girl she says with a glance at tj then she goes over to the grass and sits at the end of the line hoping that shell get another chance at bat the sound of running feet woke nell up she had heard that sound before someone had died or was dying and they wanted to get him out before the other residents knew she grabbed her glasses and got out of bed carefully making her way to the door they were gathered in front of karls room two men wheeled a stretcher out the body was strapped in and the face was covered quickly they pushed him out of sight she crossed the empty hallway the tile beneath her feet felt cold and gritty they had left karls door open and she stopped just outside it catching the smell of death under the scent of ink and books nell one of the nurses started down the hall toward her is he dead she asked mr krupp im afraid so im sorry if it disturbed you no not really nell said she drew her nightgown closely about her chest she was getting cold he probably shouldnt have been in this household the nurse said he was much too sick but his family wanted him to have a private room nell wondered how the nurse expected her to believe that one glance inside karls room made it obvious that he hadnt been bedridden nell surveyed the room once more the desk top was bare and the vials were gone but otherwise it looked the same the nurse finally reached her side nell recognized her as the roundfaced one who usually gave her her medicine dana lpn how did you get out here dana lpn asked walked nell said dana lpn shot her a perplexed look well lets get you back to bed shall we she put her arm around nells waist and helped her back to the room the support wasnt necessary until they reached the door when nell saw her walker in its usual place beside the bed her knees buckled nell nell straightened herself and pushed out of the nurses grasp she made her way to the side of the bed and lightly touched her walker im fine she said she climbed into the bed and lay there until she heard the nurses footsteps echo down the hall then she got up and walked slowly around her room youre strong nelly he had said the power of your mind is amazing she walked to the door and stared at karls empty room across the hall the drawing was still there its spirals twisting like a malformed ladder beneath the stunned joy that she was feeling frustration beat at her stomach she would never know if it was her own determination or karls bitter medicine that made her legs work again just as she would never know if he had actually killed her sister or if he had been lying she wanted to believe that it was the power of her own mind but her minds healing took time she had started to walk within days of receiving the medication nell went back to the bed and sat down wondering what anna would say when she learned that her mother could walk again then nell decided that it didnt matter what mattered was that her feet which had run bases chased two children and carried her through decades of living worked again once she had vowed to hit home runs until she was a hundred and maybe just maybe she would a predatory woman sharyn mccrumb sharyn mccrumb b who

predatory woman as my own meditation on what might happen if s moors murderer myra hindley were released from prison in britain although myra never killed anyone she was the girlfriend and accomplice of childkiller ian brady she has now served more time in prison for her crime than any actual murderer in british history she looks a proper murderess doesnt she said ernie sleaford tapping the photo of a bleached blonde his face bore that derisive grin he reserved for the puir doggies his term for unattractive women with a selfconscious part of her own more professionally lightened hair jackie duncan nodded because she was twentyseven and petite she had never been the object of ernies derision when he shouted at her it was for more professional reasons a missed photo opportunity or a bit of careless reporting she picked up the unappealing photograph she looks quite tough one wonders that children would have trusted her in the first place what did they know poor lambs we never had a woman like our erma before had we jackie studied the picture wondering if the face were truly evil or if their knowledge of its possessor had colored the likeness whether or not it was a cruel face it was certainly a plain one erma bradley had dumpling features with gooseberry eyes and that look of sullen defensiveness that plain women often have in anticipation of slights to come ernie had marked the photo page one it was not the sort of female face that usually appeared in the pages of stellar a tabloid known for its daily photo of princess diana and for its bosomy beauties on page three a beefy woman with a thatch of badly bleached hair had to earn her way into the tabloids which erma bradley certainly had convicted of four child murders in she was serving a life sentence in holloway prison in north london gone but not forgotten because she was britains only female serial killer the tabloids kept her memory green with frequent stories about her all accompanied by that menacing photo of the scowling justarrested erma most of the recent articles about her didnt even attempt to be plausible erma bradley hitlers illegitimate daughter childrens ghosts seen outside ermas cell and the october favorite is erma bradley a vampire that last one was perhaps the most apt because it acknowledged the fact that the public hardly thought of her as a real person anymore she was just another addition to the pantheon of monsters taking her place alongside frankenstein dracula and another overrated criminal guy fawkes thinking up new excuses to use the old erma picture was ernie sleafords speciality ermas face was always good for a sales boost jackie duncan had never done an erma story jackie had been four years old at the time of the infamous trial and later with the crimes solved and the killers locked away the case had never particularly interested her i thought it was her boyfriend sean hardie who actually did the killing she said frowning to remember details of the case stellars editor sneered at her question hardie i never thought he had a patch on erma for toughness look at him now hes completely mental in a prison hospital making no more sense than a vegetable marrow thats how you ought to be with the lives of four kids on your conscience but not our erma got her university degree by telly didnt she learned to talk posh in the cage and now a bunch of bloody dogooders have got her out jackie who had almost tuned out this tirade as she contemplated her new shade of nail varnish stared at him with renewed interest i hadnt heard that sleaford are you sure it isnt another of your fairy tales she grinned erma bradley bride of prince edward that was my favorite ernie had the grace to blush at the reminder of his last erma headline but he remained solemn struth jackie i had it on the quiet from a screw in holloway shes getting out next week go on it would have been on every news show in britain by now banner headlines in the guardian questions asked in the house the prison officials are keeping it dark they dont want erma to be pestered by the likes of us upon her release she wants to be let alone he smirked i had to pay dear for this bit of information i can tell you jackie smiled poor mean ernie where do i come into it then cant you guess i think so you want ermas own story no matter what well we can write that ourselves in any case i have paul working on that already what i really need is a new picture jackie the old cow hasnt let herself be photographed in twenty years wants her privacy does our erma i think stellars readers would like to take a butchers at what erma bradley looks like today dont you so they dont hire her as the nanny jackie let him finish laughing before she turned the conversation round to money the cell was beginning to look the way it had when she first arrived newly swept and curtainless it was a tenbysixfoot rectangle containing a bed a cupboard a table and a chair a wooden wash basin a plastic bowl and jug and a bucket gone were the posters and the photos of home her books were stowed away in a marks spencers shopping bag ruthie whose small sharp features earned her the nickname minx was sitting on the edge of the bed watching her pack taking the lot are you she asked cheerfully the thin dark woman stared at the array of items on the table i suppose not she said scowling she held up a tin of green tooth powder here dyou want this then the minx shrugged and reached for it why not after all youre getting out and ive a few years to go will you write to me when youre on the outside you know that isnt permitted the younger woman giggled as if that ever stopped you she reached for another of the items on the bed how about your christmas soap you can get more on the outside you know she handed it over i shant want freesia soap ever again taking your posters love anyone would think youd be sick of them by now i am ive promised them to senga she set the rolledup posters on the bed beside ruthie and picked up a small framed photograph do you want this then minx the little blondes eyes widened at the sight of the grainy snapshot of a scowling man christ its sean isnt it put it away ill be glad when youve taken that out of here erma bradley smiled and tucked the photograph in among her clothes i shall keep this jackie duncan seldom wore her best silk suit when she conducted interviews but this time she felt that it would help to look both glamorous and prosperous her blond hair shingled into a stylish bob revealed shellshaped earrings of real gold and her calf leather handbag and shoes were an expensive matched set it wasnt at all the way a working stellar reporter usually dressed but it lent jackie an air of authority and professionalism that she needed in order to profit from this interview she looked around the shabby conference room wondering if erma bradley had ever been there and if so where she had sat in preparation for the new assignment jackie had read everything she could find on the bradley case the melodramatic book by the bbc journalist the measured prose of the prosecuting attorney and a host of articles from more reliable newspapers than stellar she had begun to be interested in erma bradley and her deadly lover sean hardie the couple who slays together stays together the analyses of the case had made much of the evidence and horror at the thought of child murder but they had been at a loss to provide motive and they had been reticent about details of the killings themselves there was a book in that and it would earn a fortune for whoever could get the material to write it jackie intended to find out more than she had uncovered but first she had to find erma bradley her sloane ranger outfit had charmed the old cats in the prison office into letting her in to pursue the story in the first place the story they thought she was after jackie glanced at herself in the mirror very useful for impressing old sahibs this posh outfit besides she thought why not give the prison birds a bit of a fashion show the six inmates dressed in shapeless outfits of polyester sprawled in their chairs and stared at her with no apparent interest one of them was reading a barbara cartland novel hello girls said jackie in her best nursinghome voice she was used to jollying up old ladies for feature stories and she decided that this couldnt be much different did they tell you what im here for more blank stares until a heavyset redhead asked you ever do it with a woman jackie ignored her im here to do a story about what its like in prison heres your chance to complain if there are things you want changed grudgingly then they began to talk about the food and the illogical unbending rules that governed every part of their lives the tension eased as they talked and she could tell that they were becoming more willing to confide in her jackie scribbled a few cursory notes to keep them talking finally one of them said that she missed her children jackies cue as if on impulse she put down her notepad children she said breathlessly that reminds me wasnt erma bradley a prisoner here they glanced at each other so said the dulleyed woman with unwashed hair a ferrety blonde who seemed more taken by jackies glamour than the older ones answered eagerly i knew her we were best friends to say the least minx said the frowsy embezzler from croydon jackie didnt have to feign interest anymore really she said to the one called minx id be terrified what was she like they all began to talk about erma now a bit reserved said one she never knew who she could trust because of her rep you know a lot of us here have kids of our own so there was feeling against her in the kitchen they used to spit in her food before they took it to her and sometimes new girls would go at her to prove they were tough that must have taken nerve cried jackie ive seen her pictures oh she didnt look like that anymore said minx shed let her hair go back to its natural dark color and she was much smaller not bad really she must have lost fifty pounds since the trial days do you have a snapshot of her asked jackie still doing her best impression of breathless and impressed the redhead laid a meaty hand on minxs shoulder just a minute what are you really here for jackie took a deep breath i need to find erma bradley can you help me ill pay you a few minutes later jackie was saying a simpering goodbye to the warden telling her that shed have to come back in a few days for a followup she had until then to come up with a way to smuggle in two bottles of glenlivet the price on erma bradleys head ernie would probably make her pay for the liquor out of her own pocket it would serve him right if she got a good book deal out of it on the side the flat could have used a coat of paint and some better quality furniture but that could wait she was used to shabbiness what she liked best about it was its high ceiling and the big casement window overlooking the moors from that window you could see nothing but hills and heather and sky no roads no houses no people after twentyfour years in the beehive of a womens prison the solitude was blissful she spent hours each day just staring out that window knowing that she could walk on the moors whenever she liked without guards or passes or physical restraints erma bradley tried to remember if she had ever been alone before she had lived in a tiny flat with her mother until she finished o levels and then when shed taken the secretarial job at hadlands there had been sean she had gone into prison at the age of twentythree an end to even the right to privacy she could remember no time when she could have had solitude to get to know her own likes and dislikes she had gone from mums shadow to seans she kept his picture and her mothers not out of love but as a reminder of the prison she had endured before holloway now she was learning that she liked plants and the music of sibelius she liked things to be clean too she wondered if she could paint the flat by herself it would never look clean until she covered those dingy green walls she reminded herself that she could have had a house if if she had given up some of that solitude sell your story to a book publisher sell the film rights to this movie company keith her longsuffering solicitor dutifully passed along all the offers for her consideration the world seemed willing to throw money at her but all she wanted was for it to go away the dowdy but slender miss emily kay newborn at fortyseven would manage on her own with tinned food and secondhand furniture while the pack of journalists went baying after erma bradley who didnt exist anymore she wanted solitude she never thought about those terrible months with sean the things they did together for twentyfour years she had not let herself remember any of it jackie duncan looked up at the gracefully ornamented stone building carved into apartments for workingclass people the builders in that gentler age had worked leaf designs into the stonework framing the windows and they had set gargoyles at a corner of each roof jackie made a mental note of this useful detail yet another monster has been added to the building in the worn but genteel hallway jackie checked the names on mailboxes to make sure that her information was correct there it was e kay she hurried up the stairs with only a moments thought to the change in herself these past few weeks when ernie first gave her the assignment she might have been fearful of confronting a murderess or she might have gone upstairs with the camera poised to take the shot just as erma bradley opened her door and then she would have fled but now she was as anxious to meet the woman as she could be to interview a famous film star more so because this celebrity was hers alone she had not even told ernie that she had found erma this was her show not stellars without another thought about what she would say jackie knocked at the lair of the beast after a few moments the door opened partway and a small darkhaired woman peered nervously out at her the woman was thin and dressed in a simple green jumper and skirt she was no longer the brassy blonde of the sixties but the eyes were the same the face was still erma bradleys jackie was brisk may i come in miss kay you wouldnt want me to pound on your door calling out your real name would you the woman fell back and let her enter i suppose it wouldnt help to tell you that youre mistaken no trace remained of her midlands accent she spoke in quiet cultured tones not a hope i swotted for weeks to find you dear couldnt you just leave me alone jackie sat down on the threadbare brown sofa and smiled up at her hostess i suppose i could arrange it i could for instance not tell the bbc the tabloids and the rest of the world what you look like and where you are the woman looked down at her ringless hands i havent any money she said oh but youre worth a packet all the same arent you in all the years youve been locked up you never said anything except i didnt do it which is rubbish because the world knows you did you taped the doyle boys killing on a bloody tape recorder the woman hung her head for a moment turning away what do you want she said at last sitting in the chair by the sofa jackie duncan touched the other womans arm i want you to tell me about it no i cant ive forgotten no you havent nobody could and thats the book the world wants to read not this mealymouthed rubbish the others have written about you i want you to tell me every single detail all the way through thats the book i want to write she took a deep breath and forced a smile and in exchange ill keep your identity and whereabouts a secret the way ursula bloom did when she interviewed crippens mistress in the fifties erma bradley shrugged i dont read crime stories she said the light had faded from the big window facing the moors on the scarred pine table a tape recorder was running and in the deepening shadows erma bradleys voice rose and fell with weary resignation punctuated by jackies eager questions i dont know she said again come on think about it have a biscuit while you think sean didnt have sex with the allen girl but did he make love to you afterwards do you think he got an erection while he was doing the strangling a pause i didnt look but you made love after he killed her yes on the same bed but later a few hours later after we had taken away the body it was seans bedroom you see its where we always slept did you picture the childs ghost watching you do it i was twentytwo he said he used to get me drunk and i oh come on erma theres no bloody jury here just tell me if it turned you on to watch sean throttling kids when he did it were both of you naked or just him please i please all right erma i can have the bbc here in time for the wakeup news just him an hour later do stop snivelling erma you lived through it once didnt you whats the harm in talking about it they cant try you again now come on dear answer the question yes the little boy brian doyle he was quite brave really kept saying he had to take care of his mum because she was divorced now and asking us to let him go he was only eight and quite small he even offered to fight us if wed untie him when sean was getting the masking tape out of the cupboard i went up to him and i whispered to him to let the boy go but he there you go again erma now ive got to shut the machine off again while you get hold of yourself she was alone now at last the reporter woman was gone just before eleven she had scooped up her notes and her tape recorder and the photos of the dead children she had brought from the photo archives and shed gone away promising to return in a few days to put the finishing touches on the interview the dates and places and forensic details she could get from the other sources shed said the reporter had gone and the room was empty but miss emily kay wasnt alone anymore now erma bradley had got in as well she knew though that no other journalists would come this one jackie would keep her secret well enough but only to ensure the exclusivity of her own book other than that miss emily kay would be allowed to enjoy her freedom in the shabby little room overlooking the moors but it wasnt a pleasant retreat any longer now that she wasnt alone erma had brought the ghosts back with her somehow the events of twentyfive years ago had become more real when she told them than when she lived them it had been so confused back then sean drank a lot and he liked her to keep him company in that and it happened so quickly the first time and then there was no turning back but she never let herself think about it it was seans doing she would tell herself and then part of her mind would close right down and she would turn her attention to something else at the trial she had thought about the hatred that she could almost touch flaring at her from nearly everyone in the courtroom she couldnt think then for if she broke down they would win they never put her on the stand she answered no questions except to say when a microphone was thrust in her face i didnt do it and then later in prison there were adjustments to make and bad times with the other inmates to be faced she didnt need a lot of sentiment dragging her down as well i didnt do it came to have a truth for her it meant i am no longer the somebody who did that i am small and thin and wellspoken the ugly ungainly monster is gone but now she had testified her own voice had conjured up the images of sarah allen calling out for her mother and of brian doyle offering to sell his bike to ransom himself for his mums sake the hatchetfaced blonde who had told them to shut up who had held them downshe was here and she was going to live here too with the sounds of weeping and the screams and every tread on the stair would be sean bringing home another little lad for a wee visit i didnt do it she whispered and it had come to have another meaning i didnt do it stop sean hardie from hurting them go to the police apologize to the parents during the years in prison kill myself from the shame of it i didnt do it she whispered again but i should have ernie sleaford was more deferential to her now when he heard about the new book and the size of her advance he realized that she was a player and he had begun to treat her with a new deference he had even offered her a rise in case she was thinking of quitting but she wasnt going to quit she quite enjoyed her work besides it was so amusing now to see him stand up for her when she came into his grubby little office well need a picture for the front page love he said in his most civil tones would you mind if denny took your picture or is there one youd rather use jackie shrugged let him take one i just had my hair done so i make the front page as well oh yes were devoting the whole page to erma bradleys suicide and we want a sidebar of your piece i was the last to see the monster alive it will make a nice contrast your picture beside puddingfaced erma i thought she looked all right for fortyseven didnt the picture i got turn out all right ernie looked shocked were not using that one jackie we want to remember her the way she was a vicious ugly beastie in contrast to a pure young thing like yourself sort of a moral statement like jack be quick barbara paul barbara paul b was born in maysville kentucky and educated at bowling green state

treatments direct and indirect go back at least as far as marie belloc lowndess the lodger pauls approach to the mystery in the anthology solved is among the most original as well as being notable for a highly appropriate feminist slant september st judes vicarage whitechapel he took two this time and within the same hour inspector abberline told us the first victim was found this morning less than an hour after midnight in a small court off berner street the second woman was killed in mitre square fortyfive minutes later he did his hideous deed and escaped undetected as he always does inspector abberline believes he was interrupted in berner street because he did notdo to that woman what hed done to his other victims my husband threw the inspector a warning look not wanting me exposed to such distressing matters more than necessary but the second woman was severely mutilated inspector abberline concluded offering no details he finished in mitre square what hed begun in berner street my husband and i knew nothing of the double murder not having left the vicarage all day when no one appeared for morning services edward was angry customarily we can count on a sunday congregation of a dozen or so we should have suspected something was amiss do you know who the women were inspector i asked one of them he said his mitre square victim was named catherine eddowes we have yet to establish the identity of the berner street victim inspector abberline looked exhausted i poured him another cup of tea he undoubtedly would have preferred something stronger but edward permitted no spirits in the house not even sherry i waited until the inspector had taken a sip before i put my next question to him did he cut out catherine eddowess womb the way he did annie chapmans edward looked shocked that i should know about that but the police investigator was beyond shock yes mrs wickham he did but this time he did not take it away with him it was one of the many concerns that baffled and horrified me about the series of grisly murders haunting london annie chapmans disemboweled body had been found in hanbury street three weeks earlier all the entrails had been piled above her shoulder except the womb why had he stolen her womb and the intestines heaped over the left shoulder as before edward cleared his throat this eddowes womanshe was a prostitute inspector abberline said she was and i have no doubt that the berner street victim will prove to have been on the game as well thats the only common ground among his victims they were all prostitutes evil combating evil edward said with a shake of his head when will it end inspector abberline put down his cup the end alas is not yet in sight we are still conducting doortodoor searches and the populace is beginning to panic we have our hands full dispersing the mobs mobs edward asked has there been trouble i regret to say there has everyone is so desperate to find someone to blame the inspector allowed the unfinished sentence to linger a moment earlier today a constable was chasing a petty thief through the streets and someone who saw them called out its the ripper several men joined in the chase and then others as the word spread that it was the ripper the constable was pursuing that mob was thirsting for blood nothing less than a lynching would have satisfied them the thief and the constable ended up barricading themselves in a building together until help could arrive edward shook his head sadly the world has gone mad its why i have come to you vicar inspector abberline said you can help calm them down you could speak to them persuade them to compose themselves your presence in the streets will offer a measure of reassurance of course edward said quickly shall we leave now ill get my coat the inspector turned to me mrs wickham thank you for the tea now we must be going i saw both men to the door the inspector did not know he had interrupted a disagreement between my husband and me one that was recurring with increasing frequency of late but i had no wish to revive the dispute when edward returned the shadow of these two new murders lay like a shroud over all other concerns i retired to my sewing closet where i tried to calm my spirit through prayer one could not think dispassionately of this unknown man wandering the streets of londons east end a man who hated women so profoundly that he cut away those parts of the bodies that proclaimed his victims to be female i tried to pray for him lost soul that he is god forgive me i could not october st judes vicarage early the next morning the fog lay so thick about the vicarage that the street gaslights were still on they performed their usual efficient function of lighting the tops of the poles looking down from our bedroom window i could not see the street below following our morning reading from the scriptures edward called my attention to an additional passage since you are aware of what the ripper does to his victims beatrice it will be to your benefit to hear this attend let the breast be torn open and the heart and vitals be taken from hence and thrown over the shoulder a moment of nausea overtook me the same way annie chapman and the others were killed exactly edward said with a hint of triumph in his voice those are solomons words ordering the execution of three murderers i wonder if anyone has pointed this passage out to inspector abberline it could be of assistance in ascertaining the rationale behind these murders perhaps revealing something of the killers mental disposition he continued in this speculative vein for a while longer i was folding linen as i listened when he paused for breath i asked edward about his chambray shirt ive not seen it these two weeks eh it will turn up im certain you have put it away somewhere i was equally certain i had not then with some trepidation i reintroduced the subject of our disagreement the night before edward would you be willing to reconsider your position concerning charitable donations if parishioners cant turn to their church for help allow me to interrupt you my dear he said i am convinced that suffering cannot be reduced by indiscriminately passing out money but only through the realistic appraisal of each mans problems so long as the lower classes depend upon charity to see them through hard times they will never learn thrift and the most propitious manner of spending what money they have edwards realistic appraisal of individual problems always ended the same way with little lectures on how to economize but surely in cases of extreme hardship i said a small donation would not be detrimental to their future wellbeing ah but how are we to determine who are those in true need they will tell any lie to get their hands on a few coins which they promptly spend on hard drink and then they threaten us when those coins are not forthcoming this is the legacy my predecessor at st judes has left us this expectancy that the church owes them charity that was true the vicarage had been stoned more than once when edward had turned petitioners away but the children edward surely we can help the children they are not to blame for their parents wastrel ways edward sat down next to me and took my hand you have a soft heart and a generous nature beatrice and i venerate those qualities in you your natural instinct for charity is one of your most admirable traits he smiled sadly nevertheless how will these poor desperate creatures ever learn to care for their own children if we do it for them and there is this has it not occurred to you that god may be testing us how simple it would be to hand out a few coins and convince ourselves we have done our christian duty no beatrice god is asking more of us than that we must hold firm in our resolve i acquiesced seeing no chance of prevailing against such unshakable certitude that gods will was dictating our course of action furthermore edward wickham was my husband and i owed him obedience even when my heart was troubled and filled with uncertainty it was his decision to make not mine do not expect me until tea time edward said as he rose and went to fetch his greatcoat mr lusk has asked me to attend a meeting of the whitechapel vigilance committee and i then have my regular calls to make best you not go out today my dear at least until inspector abberline has these riots under control edwards duties were keeping him away from the vicarage more and more he sometimes would return in the early hours of the morning melancholy and exhausted from trying to help a man find night work or from locating shelter for a homeless widow and her children at times he seemed not to remember where hed been i was concerned for his health and his spirit the fog was beginning to lift by the time he departed but i still could not see very far except in my minds eye if one were to proceed down commercial street and then follow aldgate to leadenhall and cornhill on to the point where six roads meet at a statue of the duke of wellington one would find onself in front of the imposing royal exchange its rich interior murals and turkish floor paving a proper setting for the transactions undertaken there across threadneedle street the bank of england with its windowless lower stories and the rocklike stock exchange both raise their impressive fa√ßades then one could turn to the opposite direction and behold several other banking establishments clustered around mansion house the lord mayors residence it still dumbfounds me to realize that the wealth of the nation is concentrated there in so small an areaall within walking distance of the worst slums in the nation do wealthy bankers ever spare a thought for the appalling poverty of whitechapel and spitalfields the people living within the boundaries of st judes parish are crowded like animals into a labyrinth of courts and alleys none of which intersect major streets the crumbling hazardous buildings fronting the courts house complete families in each room sometimes numbering as many as a dozen people in such circumstances incest is commonand some say inevitable the buildings reek from the liquid sewage accumulated in the basements while the courts themselves stink of garbage that attracts vermin dogs and other scavengers often one standing pipe in the courtyard serves as the sole source of water for all the inhabitants of three or four buildings an outdoor pipe that freezes with unremitting regularity during the winter once edward and i were called out in the middle of the night to succor a woman suffering from scarlet fever we found her in a foulsmelling single room with three children and four pigs her husband a cabman had committed suicide the month before and it wasnt until we were leaving that we discovered one of the children had been lying there dead for thirteen days the common lodging houses are even worse filthy and infested and reservoirs of disease in such doss houses a bed can be rented for fourpence for the night strangers often sharing a bed because neither has the full price alone there is no such thing as privacy since the beds are lined up in crowded rows in the manner of dormitories beds are rented indiscriminately to men and women alike consequently many of the doss houses are in truth brothels and even those that are not have no compunction about renting a bed to a prostitute when she brings a paying customer with her inspector abberline once told us the police estimate there are twelve hundred prostitutes in whitechapel alone fertile hunting grounds for the man who pleasures himself with the butchering of ladies of the night ever since the ripper began stalking the east end edward has been campaigning for more police to patrol the back alleys and for better street lighting the problem is that whitechapel is so poor it cannot afford the rates to pay for these needed improvements if there is to be help it must come from outside therefore i have undertaken a campaign of my own every day i write to philanthropists charitable establishments government officials i petition every personage of authority and good will with whose name i am conversant pleading the cause of the children of whitechapel especially those ragged dirty street arabs who sleep wherever they can eat whatever they can scavenge or steal and perform every unspeakable act demanded of them in exchange for a coin they can call their own october golden lane mortuary city of london today i did something i have never done before i wilfully disobeyed my husband edward had forbidden me to attend the inquest of catherine eddowes saying i should not expose myself to such unsavory disclosures as were bound to be made also he said it was unseemly for the vicars wife to venture abroad unaccompanied a dictum that impresses me as more appropriately belonging to another time and place i waited until edward left the vicarage and then hurried on my way my path took me past one of the larger slaughterhouses in the area with my handkerchief covering my mouth and nose to keep out the stench i had to cross the road to avoid the blood and urine flooding the pavement once i had left whitechapel however the way was unencumbered outside the golden lane mortuary i was pleased to encounter inspector abberline he was surprised to see me there and immediately offered himself as my protector is the reverend mr wickham not with you he has business in shoreditch i answered truthfully not adding that edward found inquests distasteful and would not have attended in any event this crowd could turn ugly mrs wickham inspector abberline said let me see if i can obtain us two chairs near the door that he did with the result that i had to stretch in a most unladylike manner to see over other peoples heads inspector i said have you learned the identity of the other woman who was killed the same night as catherine eddowes yes it was elizabeth stride long liz they called her about fortyfive years of age and homely as sin if youll pardon my speaking ill of the dead they were all unattractive all the rippers victims one thing is certain he didnt choose them for their beauty elizabeth stride was a prostitute that she was mrs wickham im sorry to say she had nine children somewhere and a husband until he could tolerate her drunkenness no longer and turned her out a woman with a nice big family like that and a husband who supported them what reasons could she have had to turn to drink i could think of nine or ten what about catherine eddowes did she have children too inspector abberline rubbed the side of his nose well she had a daughter that much we know we havent located her yet though the inquest was ready to begin the small room was crowded with observers standing along the walls and even outside in the passageway the presiding coroner called the first witness the police constable who found catherine eddowess body the remarkable point to emerge from the constables testimony was that his patrol took him through mitre square where hed found the body every fourteen or fifteen minutes the ripper had only fifteen minutes to inflict so much damage how swift he was how sure of what he was doing it came out during the inquest that the eddowes woman had been strangled before her killer had cut her throat thus explaining why she had not cried out in response to my whispered question inspector abberline said yes the other victims had also been strangled first when the physicians present at the postmortem testified they were agreed that the killer had sound anatomical knowledge but they were not in accord as to the extent of his actual skill in removing the organs their reports of what had been done to the body were disturbing i grew slightly faint during the description of how the flaps of the abdomen had been peeled back to expose the intestines inspector abberlines sworn statement was succinct and free of speculation he testified as to the course of action pursued by the police following the discovery of the body there were other witnesses people who had encountered catherine eddowes on the night she was killed at one time she had been seen speaking to a middleaged man wearing a black coat of good quality which was now slightly shabby it was the same description that had emerged during the investigation of one of the rippers earlier murders but at the end of it all we were no nearer to knowing the rippers identity than ever the verdict was willful murder by some person unknown i refused inspector abberlines offer to have one of his assistants escort me home that makes six women hes killed now this ripper i said you need all of your men for your investigation the inspector rubbed the side of his nose a mannerism i was coming to recognize indicated uncertainty as a matter of fact mrs wickham i am of the opinion that only four were killed by the same man you are thinking of the woman murdered near st judes church and the one on osborn street he shook his head not the rippers work im convinced of it what makes you think so inspector because while those two women did have their throats cut they werent cut in the same manner as the later victims there is viciousness in the way the ripper slashes his victims throatshe is lefthanded we know and he slashes twice once each way the cuts are deep brutalhe almost took annie chapmans head off no polly nichols was his first victim then chapman and now this double murder elizabeth stride and catherine eddowes those four are all the work of the same man i shuddered did the four women know one another not that we can determine inspector abberline replied evidently they had nothing in common except the fact that they were all four prostitutes more questions occurred to me but i had detained the inspector long enough i bade him farewell and started back to st judes a long walk from golden lane the daylight was beginning to fail but i had no money for a hansom cab i pulled my shawl tight about my shoulders and hurried my step not wishing to be caught out of doors after dark it was my husbands opinion that since the ripper killed only prostitutes respectable married women had nothing to fear it was my opinion that my husband put altogether too much faith in the rippers ability to tell the difference i was almost home when a most unhappy incident ensued a distraught woman approached me on middlesex street carrying what looked like a bundle of rags which she thrust into my arms inside the rags was a dead baby i cried out and almost dropped the cold little body all he needed were a bit o milk the mother said tears running down her cheeks oh i am so sorry i gasped helplessly the poor woman looked halfstarved herself they said it was no use asending to the church she sobbed for you didnt never give nothing though you spoke kind i was so ashamed i had to lower my head even then i didnt have tuppence in my pocket to give her i slipped off my shawl and wrapped it around the tiny corpse bury him in this she mumbled something as she took the bundle from me and staggered away she would prepare to bury her child in the shawl but at the last moment she would snatch back the shawls warmth for herself she would cry over her dead baby as she did it but she would do it i prayed that she would do it october st judes vicarage this morning i paid an outofwork bricklayer fourpence to clean out our fireplaces in the big fireplace in the kitchen he made a surprising discovery sootblackened buttons from my husbands missing chambray shirt turned up when later i asked edward why he had burned his best shirt he looked at me in utter astonishment and demanded to know why i had burned it yet we two are the only ones living at the vicarage october spitalfields market the chemist regretfully informed me that the price of arsenic had risen so of necessity i purchased less than the usual quantity hoping edward would find the diminished volume sufficient keeping the vicarage free of rats was costly when first we took up residence at st judes we believed the rats were coming from the warehouses farther along commercial street but then we came to understand that every structure in whitechapel was plagued with vermin as fast as one killed them others appeared to take their place a newspaper posted outside an alehouse caught my eye i had made it a point to read every word published about the ripper the only new thing was that all efforts to locate the family of catherine eddowes the rippers last victim had failed a frontpage editorial demanded the resignation of the commissioner of police and various other men in authority three weeks had passed since the ripper had taken two victims on the same night and the police still had no helpful clues and no idea of who the ripper was or when he would strike next that he would strike again no one doubted that the police could protect the women of whitechapel no one believed in the next street i came upon a posted bill requesting anyone with information concerning the identity of the murderer to step forward and convey that information to the police the request saddened me the police could not have formulated a clearer admission of failure october st judes vicarage edward is ill when he had not appeared at the vicarage by tea time yesterday i began to worry i spent an anxious evening awaiting his return it was well after midnight before i heard his key in the lock he looked like a stranger his eyes were glistening and his clothes in disarray his usual proud bearing had degenerated into a stoop his shoulders hunched as if he were cold the moment he caught sight of me he began berating me for failing to purchase the arsenic he needed to kill the rats it was only when i led him to the pantry where he himself had spread the noxious powder around the rat holes did his reprimands cease his skin was hot and dry and with difficulty i persuaded him into bed but sleep would not come i sat by the bed and watched him thrashing among the covers throwing off the cool cloth i had placed on his forehead edward kept waving his hands as if trying to fend someone off what nightmares was he seeing behind those closed lids in his delirium he began to cry out at first the words were not clear but then i understood my husband to be saying whores whores all whores when by two in the morning his fever had not broken i knew i had to seek help i wrapped my cloak about me and set forth not permitting myself to dwell on what could be hiding in the shadows i do not like admitting it but i was terrified nothing less than edwards illness could have driven me into the streets of whitechapel at night but i reached my destination with nothing untoward happening i roused dr phelps from a sound sleep and rode back to the vicarage with him in his carriage when dr phelps bent over the bed edwards eyes flew open he seized the doctors upper arm in a grip that made the man wince they must be stopped my husband whispered hoarsely theymust be stopped we will stop them dr phelps replied gently and eased edwards hand away edwards eyes closed and his body resumed its thrashing the doctors examination was brief the fever is making him hallucinate he told me sleep is the best cure followed by a period of bed rest he took a small vial from his bag and asked me to bring a glass of water he tapped a few drops of liquid into the water which he then poured into edwards mouth as i held his head what did you give him i asked laudanum to make him sleep i will leave the vial with you dr phelps rubbed his right arm where edward had gripped him strange i do not recall mr wickham as being lefthanded he is ambidextrous this feverwill he recover the next few hours will tell give him more laudanum only if he awakes in this same disturbed condition and then only one drop in a glass of water i will be back later to see how he is when dr phelps had gone i replaced the cool cloth on edwards forehead and resumed my seat by the bed edward did seem calmer now the wild thrashing at an end and only the occasional twitching of the hands betraying his inner turmoil by dawn he was in a deep sleep and seemed less feverish my spirit was too disturbed to permit me to sleep i decided to busy myself with household chores edwards black greatcoat was in need of a good brushing so that came first it was then that i discovered the rustcolored stains on the cuffs they did not look fresh but i could not be certain removing them was a delicate matter the coat had seen better days and the cloth would not withstand vigorous handling but eventually i got the worst of the stains out and hung the coat in the armoire then i knelt by the bedroom window and prayed i asked god to vanquish the dark suspicions that had begun to cloud my mind whitechapel had changed edward since he had accepted the appointment to st judes he had become more distant more aloof he had always been a reserved man speaking rarely of himself and never of his past i knew nothing of his childhood only that he had been born in london he had always discouraged my inquiring about the years before we met if my parents had still been living when edward first began to pay court they would never have permitted me to entertain a man with no background no family and no connections but by then i had passed what was generally agreed to be a marriageable age and i was enchanted by the appearance out of nowhere of a gentleman of compatible spirit who desired me to spend my life with him all i knew of edward was that he was a little older than most new curates were suggesting that he had started in some other profession or had at least studied for one before joining the clergy our twelve years together had been peaceful ones and i had never regretted my choice but try as he might to disguise the fact edwards perspective had grown harsher during our tenure in whitechapel sadly he held no respect for the people whose needs he was here to minister to i once heard him say to a fellow vicar the lower classes render no useful service they create no wealth more often they destroy it they degrade whatever they touch and as individuals are most probably incapable of improvement thrift and good management mean nothing to them i resist terming them hopeless but perhaps that is what they are the edward wickham i married would never have spoken so beatrice i glanced toward the bed edward was awake and watching me i rose from my knees and went to his side how do you feel edward weak as if ive lost a lot of blood he looked confused am i ill i explained about the fever dr phelps says you need a great deal of rest dr phelps he was here edward remembered nothing of the doctors visit nor did he remember where hed been the night before or even coming home this is frightening he said shakily his speech was slurred an effect of the laudanum hours of my life missing and no memory of them we will worry about that later right now you must try to sleep some more sleepyes i sat and held his hand until he drifted off again when he awoke a second time a few hours later i brought him a bowl of broth which he consumed with reawakening appetite my husband was clearly on the mend he was considering getting out of bed when dr phelps stopped by the doctor was pleased with edwards progress spend the rest of the day resting he said and then tomorrow you may be allowed up you must be careful not to overtax yourself or the fever may recur edward put up a show of protesting but i think he was secretly relieved that nothing was required of him except that he lie in bed all day i escorted the doctor to the door make sure he eats he said to me he needs to rebuild his strength i said id see to it then i hesitated i could not go on without knowing dr phelps did anything happen last night i beg your pardon he didnt know what i meant did the ripper strike again dr phelps smiled i am happy to say he did not perhaps weve seen an end of these dreadful killings hmm my relief was so great it was all i could do not to burst into tears when the doctor had gone i again fell to my knees and prayed this time asking god to forgive me for entertaining such treacherous thoughts about my own husband november leman street police station whitechapel it was with a light heart that i left the vicarage this bright crisp tuesday morning my husband was recovered from his recent indisposition and busy with his daily duties i had received two encouraging replies to my petitions for charitable assistance for whitechapels children and london had survived the entire month of october without another ripper killing i was on my way to post two letters my responses to the philanthropists who seemed inclined to listen to my plea in my letters i had pointed out that over half the children born in whitechapel die before they reach the age of five the ones that do not die are mentally and physically underdeveloped many of them that are taken into pauper schools are adjudged abnormally dull if not actual mental defectives children frequently arrive at school crying from hunger and then collapse at their benches in winter they are too cold to think about learning their letters or doing their sums the schools themselves are shamefully mismanaged and the children sometimes mistreated there are school directors who pocket most of the budget and hire out the children to sweatshop owners as cheap labor what i proposed was the establishment of a boarding school for the children of whitechapel a place where the young would be provided with hygienic living conditions wholesome food to eat and warm clothing to wear all before they ever set foot in a classroom then when their physical needs had been attended to they would be given proper educational and moral instruction the school was to be administered by an honest and conscientious director who could be depended upon never to exploit the downtrodden all this would cost a great deal of money my letters went into the post accompanied by a silent prayer i was then in leman street not far from the police station i stopped in and asked if inspector abberline was there he was he greeted me warmly and offered me a chair after inquiring after my husbands health he sat back and looked at me expectantly now that i was there i felt a tinge of embarrassment it is presumptuous of me i know i said but may i make a suggestion concerning the ripper i mean youve undoubtedly thought of every possible approach but i didnt finish my sentence because he was laughing forgive me mrs wickham he said still smiling i would like to show you something he went into another room and returned shortly carrying a large box filled with papers these are letters he explained from concerned citizens like yourself each one offers a plan for capturing the ripper and we have two more boxes just like this one i flushed and rose to leave then ill not impose please mrs wickham take your seat we read every letter that comes to us and give serious consideration to every suggestion made i show you the box only to convince you we welcome suggestions i resumed my seat not fully convinced but nevertheless encouraged by the inspectors courtesy very well i tried to gather my thoughts the rippers first victim you are convinced was polly nichols correct bucks row the last day of august the illustrated times said that she was fortytwo years old and separated from her husband to whom she had borne five children the cause of their separation was her propensity for strong drink mr nichols made his wife an allowance according to the times until he learned of her prostitution at which time he discontinued all pecuniary assistance is this account essentially correct yes it is the rippers next victim was annie chapman about forty who was murdered early in september the night of the eighth inspector abberline said although her body wasnt found until six the next morning she was killed on hanbury street less than half a mile from the bucks row site of polly nicholss murder i nodded annie chapman also ended on the streets because of drunkenness she learned her husband had died only when her allowance stopped when she tried to find her two children she discovered they had been separated and sent to different schools one of them abroad inspector abberline raised an eyebrow how did you ascertain that mrs wickham one of our parishioners knew her i said next came the double murder of elizabeth stride and catherine eddowes during the small hours of the thirtieth of september berner street and mitre square a fifteenminute walk from each other the stride woman was swedish by birth and claimed to be a widow but i have heard that may not be true she was a notorious inebriate according to one of the constables patrolling fairclough street and she may simply have been ashamed to admit her husband would not allow her near the children the nine children is this also correct the inspector was looking bemused it is of catherine eddowes i know very little but the times said she had spent the night before her death locked up in the cloak lane police station because shed been found lying drunk in the street somewhere in aldgate and you yourself told me she had a daughter did she also have a husband inspector he nodded slowly a man named conway weve been unable to trace him the same pattern in each case youve said on more than one occasion that the four victims had only their prostitution in common but in truth inspector they had a great deal in common they were all in their forties they were all lacking in beauty they had all been married they all lost their homes through a weakness for the bottle i took a breath and they were all mothers inspector abberline looked at me quizzically they were all mothers who abandoned their children he considered it you think the ripper had been abandoned is it not possible or perhaps he too had a wife he turned out because of drunkenness i dont know where he fits into the pattern but consider the nature of the murders makes it quite clear that these women are not just killed the way the unfortunate victim of a highwayman is killed the women are being punished i was uncomfortable speaking of such matters but speak i must the manner of their deaths one might say is a grotesque version of the way they earned their livings the inspector was also uncomfortable they were not raped mrs wickham but of course they were inspector i said softly they were raped with a knife i had embarrassed him we should not be speaking of this he said further chagrined at seeming to rebuke the vicars wife these are not matters that concern you all i ask is that you consider what i have said oh i can promise you that he answered wryly and i believed him i do have some encouraging news he continued desirous of changing the subject we have been given more men to patrol the streets more than have even before been concentrated in one section of london the next time the ripper strikes well be ready for him then you think he will strike again i fear so hes not done yet it was the same opinion that was held by everyone else but it was more ominous coming from the mouth of a police investigator i thanked inspector abberline for his time and left the one thing that had long troubled me about the investigation of the ripper murders was the refusal of the investigators to acknowledge that there was anything carnal about these violent acts the killings were the work of a madman the police and the newspapers agreedas if that explained everything but unless inspector abberline and the rest of those in authority could see the fierce hatred of women that drove the ripper i despaired of his ever being caught november millers court spitalfields at three in the morning i was still fully dressed awaiting edwards return to the vicarage it had been hours since id made my last excuse to myself for his absence his duties frequently kept him out late but never this late i was trying to decide whether i should go to dr phelps for help when a frantic knocking started at the door it was a young market porter named macklin who occasionally attended services at st judes and he was in a frantic state its the missus he gasped er time is come and the midwifes too drunk to stand up will you come i said i would let me get a few things i was distracted wanting to send him away but this was the macklins first child and i couldnt turn down his plea for help we hurried off in the direction of spitalfields the couple had recently rented a room in a slum building facing on millers court i knew the area slightly edward and i had once been called to a doss house there to minister to a dying man that was the first time id ever been inside one of the common lodging houses it was a big place over three hundred beds and every one of them rented for the night millers court was right across the street from the doss house as we went into the courtyard a girl of about twelve unfolded herself from the doorway where she had been huddled and tugged at my skirt fourpence for a doss lady get out of ere macklin yelled go on just a moment i stopped him i asked the girl if she had no home to go to mam turned me out the girl answered sullenly says dont come back til light i understood frequently the women here put their children out on the street while they rented their room for immoral purposes i have no money i told the girl but you may come inside not in my room she dont macklin shouted she can be of help mr macklin i said firmly he gave in ungraciously the girl who said her name was rose howe followed us inside straightaway i started to sneeze the air was filled with particles of fur someone in the building worked at plucking hair from dogs rabbits and perhaps even rats for sale to a furrier there were other odors as well the building held at least one fish that had not been caught yesterday i could smell paste from drying match boxes most likely it was all rather overpowering macklin led us up a flight of stairs from which the banisters had been removed for firewood no doubt vermininfested wallpaper was hanging in strips above our heads macklin opened a door upon a small room where his wife lay in labor mrs macklin was still a girl herself only a few years older than rose howe she was lying on a straw mattress undoubtedly infested with fleas on a brokendown bedstead a few boxes were stacked against one wall the only other piece of furniture was a plank laid across two stacks of bricks i sent macklin down to fill a bucket from the water pipe in the courtyard and then i put rose howe to washing some rags i found in a corner it was a long labor rose curled up on the floor and went to sleep macklin wandered out for a few pints day had broken before the baby came macklin was back sobriety returning with each cry of pain from his young wife since it was daylight rose howe could have returned to her own room but instead stayed and helped she stood like a rock letting mrs macklin grip her thin wrists during the final bearingdown the baby was undersized but as i cleared out her mouth and nose she voiced a howl that announced her arrival to the world in no uncertain terms i watched a smile light the faces of both girls as rose cleaned the baby and placed her in her mothers arms then rose held the cord as i tied it off with thread in two places and cut it through with my sewing scissors macklin was a true loving husband dont you worry none love he said to his wife next unll be a boy i told rose howe id finish cleaning up and for her to go home then i told macklin to bring his daughter to st judes for christening when at last i was ready to leave the morning sun was high in the sky to my surprise the small courtyard was crowded with people one of whom was a police constable i tried to work my way through to the street but no one would yield a passage for me im not certain they even knew i was there they were all trying to peer through the broken window of a groundfloor room constable i called out what has happened here he knew me he blocked the window with his body and said you dont want to look in there mrs wickham a fist of ice closed around my heart the constables facial expression already told me but i had to ask nonetheless i swallowed and said is it the ripper he nodded slowly it appears so maam ive sent for inspector abberline you there stand back then to me again hes not never killed indoors afore this is new for him i was having trouble catching my breath that meanshe didnt have to be quick this time that means he could take as much time as he liked the constable was clenching and unclenching his jaw yesm he took his time oh dear god who is she do you know the rentcollector found her here thomas whats her name again a small frightenedlooking man spoke up marymary kelly three months behind in er rent she was i thought she was hidin from me the constable scowled so you broke the window to try to get in ere now that winders been broke these past six weeks i pulled out the bit o rag shed stuffed in the hole so i could reach through and push back the curtain just like you done guvnor when you wanted to see in the rentcollector had more to say but his words were drowned out by the growing noise of the crowd which by now had so multiplied in its numbers that it overflowed from millers court into a passageway leading to the street a few women were sobbing one of them close to screaming inspector abberline arrived with two other men all three of them looking grim the inspector immediately tried the door and found it locked break out the rest of the window he ordered the rest of you stand back mrs wickham what are you doing here break in the window i say one of his men broke out the rest of the glass and crawled over the sill we heard a brief muffled cry and then the door was opened from the inside inspector abberline and his other man pushed into the roomand the latter abruptly rushed back out again retching the constable hastened to his aid and without stepping to think about it i stepped into the room what was left of mary kelly was lying on a cot next to a small table her throat had been cut so savagely that her head was nearly severed her left shoulder had been chopped through so that her arm remained attached to the body only by a flap of skin her face had been slashed and disfigured and her nose had been hacked awayand carefully laid on the small table beside the cot her breasts had been sliced off and placed on the same table the skin had been peeled from her forehead her thighs had also been stripped of their skin the legs themselves had been spread in an indecent posture and then slashed to the bone and mary kellys abdomen had been ripped open and between her feet lay one of her internal organspossibly the liver on the table lay a piece of the victims brown plaid woolen petticoat halfwrapped around still another organ the missing skin had been carefully mounded on the table next to the other body parts as if the ripper were rebuilding his victim but this time the killer had not piled the intestines above his victims shoulder as hed done before this time he had taken them away with him then as a final embellishment he had pushed mary kellys right hand into her rippedopen stomach have you punished her enough jack dont you want to hurt her some more i felt a hand grip my arm and steer me firmly outside you shouldnt be in here mrs wickham inspector abberline said he left me leaning against the wall of the building as he went back inside a hand touched my shoulder and thomas the rentcollector said theres a place to sit over ere he led me to an upended wooden crate where i sank down gratefully i sat with my head bent over my knees for some time before i could collect myself enough to utter a prayer for mary kellys soul inspector abberlines men were asking questions of everyone in the crowd when one of them approached me i explained id never known mary kelly and was here only because of the birth of the macklin baby in the same building the inspector himself came over and commanded me to go home i was not inclined to dispute the order it appears this latest victim does not fit your pattern the inspector said as i was leaving mary kelly was a prostitute but she was still in her early twenties and from what weve learned so far she had no husband and no children so the last victim had been neither middleaged nor married nor a mother it was impossible to tell whether poor mary kelly had been homely or not but the ripper had clearly chosen a woman this time who was markedly different from his earlier victims deviating from his customary pattern i wondered what it meant had some change taken place in his warped evil mind had he progressed one step deeper into madness i thought about that on the way home from millers court i thought about that and about edward november st judes vicarage it was almost noon by the time i reached the vicarage edward was there fast asleep normally he never slept during the day but the small vial of laudanum dr phelps had left was on the bedside table edward had drugged himself into a state of oblivion i picked up his clothes from the floor where hed dropped them and went over every piece carefully not a drop of blood anywhere but the butchering of mary kelly had taken place indoors the butcher could simply have removed his clothing before beginning his work next i checked all the fireplaces but none of them had been used to burn anything it could be happenstance i told myself i didnt know how long edward had been blacking out it was probably not as singular as it seemed that one of his spells should coincide with a ripper slaying thats what i told myself the night had exhausted me i had no appetite but a cup of fresh tea would be welcome i was on my way to the kitchen when a knock at the door stopped me it was the constable id spoken to at millers court he handed me an envelope inspector abberline said to give you this he touched his cap and was gone i went to stand by the window where the light was better inside the envelope was a hastily scrawled note my dear mrs wickham further information has come to light that makes it appear that your theory of a pattern in the ripper murders may not be erroneous after all although mary kelly currently had no husband she had at one time been married at the age of sixteen she wed a collier who died less than a year later during her widowhood she found a series of men to support her for brief periods until she ended on the streets and she was given to strong drink as the other four victims were but the most cogent revelation is the fact that mary kelly was pregnant that would explain why she was so much younger than the rippers earlier victims he was stopping her before she could abandon her children yrs frederick abberline so last night the ripper had taken two lives instead of one assuring that a fertile young woman would never bear children to suffer the risk of being forsaken it was not in the rippers nature to consider that his victims had themselves been abandoned in their time of need polly nichols annie chapman elizabeth stride and catherine eddowes had all taken to drink for reasons no one would ever know and had subsequently been turned out of their homes and now there was mary kelly widowed while little more than a child and with no livelihood undoubtedly she lacked the education and resources to support herself honorably polly annie elizabeth catherine and marythey had all led immoral and degraded lives every one of them but in not even one instance had it been a matter of choice i put inspector abberlines note in a drawer in the writing table and returned to the kitchen id need to start a fire to make the tea the wood box had recently been filled necessitating my moving the larger pieces to get at the twigs underneath something else was underneath as well i pulled out a long strip of brown plaid wool cloth with brown stains on it brown plaid wool mary kellys petticoat mary kellys blood the room began to whirl there it was no more making of excuses no more denying the truth i was married to the ripper for twelve years edward had kept the odious secret of his abnormal inner being hiding behind a mask of gentility and even godliness he had kept his secret well but no more the masquerade was ended i sank to my knees and prayed for guidance more than anything in the world i wanted to send for inspector abberline and have him take away the monster who was sleeping upstairs but if the laudanuminduced sleep had the same effect this time as when he was ill edward would awake as his familiar rational self if i could speak to him make him understand what hed done give him the opportunity to surrender voluntarily to the police surely that would be the most charitable act i could perform under these hideous circumstances if edward were to have any chance at all for redemption he must beg both god and man for forgiveness with shaking hands i tucked the strip of cloth away in my pocket and forced myself to concentrate on the routine of making tea the big kettle was already out but when i went to fill it with water it felt heavy i lifted the lid and found myself looking at a pile of human intestines i did not faintmost probably because i was past all feeling by then i tried to think the piece of cloth edward could have used to wipe off the knife then he would have put the cloth in the wood box with the intention of burning it later but why wait and the viscera in the tea kettlewas i meant to find that was this edwards way of asking for help and where was the knife systematically i began to look for it but after nearly two hours intensive search i found nothing he could have disposed of the knife on his way home he could have hidden it in the church he could have it under his pillow i went into the front parlor and forced myself to sit down i was frightened i didnt want to stay under the same roof with him i didnt want to fight for his soul did he even have a soul any more the edward wickham i had lain beside every night for twelve years was a counterfeit person one whose carefully fabricated personality and demeanor had been devised to control and constrain the demon imprisoned inside the deception had worked well until we came to whitechapel when the constraints began to weaken and the demon escaped what had caused the change was it the place itself the constant presence of prostitutes in the streets it was beyond my comprehension the stresses of the past twentyfour hours eventually proved too much for me my head fell forward and i slept edwards hand on my shoulder awoke me i started and gazed at him with apprehension but his face showed only gentle concern is something wrong beatrice why are you sleeping in the afternoon i pressed my fingertips against my eyes i did not sleep last night the macklin baby was born early this morning ah both mother and child doing well i trust i hope you impressed upon young macklin the importance of an early christening but beatrice the next time you are called out i would be most grateful if you could find a way to send me word when you had not returned by midnight i began to grow worried that was the first falsehood edward had ever told me that i could recognize as such it was i who had been waiting for him at midnight his face was so open so seemingly free of guiledid he honestly have no memory of the night before or was he simply exceptionally skilled in the art of deception i stood up and began to pace edward we must talk about last nightabout what you did last night his eyebrow shot up i i couldnt look at him i found her intestines in the tea kettle mary kellys intestines intestines i could hear the distaste in his voice what is this beatrice and who is mary kelly shes the woman you killed last night i cried surely you knew her name i turned to confront himand saw a look of such loathing on his face that i took a step back oh i gasped involuntarily please dont edward jack the look disappeared immediately he knew he knew what he was doing i killed someone last night you say he asked his rational manner quickly restored and then i put her intestinesin the tea kettle why dont you show me beatrice distrustful of his suggestion i nevertheless led the way to the kitchen as id half expected the tea kettle was empty and spotlessly clean with a heavy heart i pulled the piece of brown plaid cloth out of my pocket but here is something you neglected to destroy he scowled a dirty rag oh edward stop professing you know nothing of this it is a strip from mary kellys petticoat as you well realize edward you must go to the police confess all make your peace with god no one else can stop your nocturnal expeditions you must stop yourself go to inspector abberline he held out one hand give me the rag he said expressionlessly think of your soul edward this is your one chance for salvation you must confess the rag beatrice i cannot edward do you not understand you are accursed your own actions have damned you you must go down on your knees and beg for forgiveness edward lowered his hand you are ill my dear this delusion of yours that i am the ripper that is the crux of your accusation is it not this distraction is most unbefitting the wife of the vicar of st judes i cannot tolerate the thought that before long you may be found raving in the street we will pray together we will ask god to send you selfcontrol i thought i understood what that meant very wellif you will not turn yourself over to the police there is only one alternate course of action open to you you must kill yourself beatrice he was shocked suicide is a sin his reaction was so absurd that i had to choke down a hysterical laugh but it made me understand that further pleading would be fruitless he was hopelessly insane i would never be able to reach him edward was shaking his head i am most disturbed beatrice this dementia of yours is more profound than i realized i must tell you i am unsure of my capacity to care for you while you are subject to delusions perhaps an institution is the rightful solution i was stunned you would put me in an asylum he sighed where else will we find physicians qualified to treat dementia but if you cannot control these delusions of yours i see no other recourse you must pray beatrice you must pray for the ability to discipline your thoughts he could have me locked away he could have me locked away and then continue unimpeded with his ghastly killings never having to worry about a wife who noticed too much it was a moment before i could speak i will do as you say edward i will pray excellent i will pray with you but first the rag please slowly reluctantly i handed him the strip of mary kellys petticoat edward took a fireplace match and struck it and the evidence linking him to murder dissolved into thin black smoke that spiralled up the chimney then we prayed we asked god to give me the mental and spiritual willpower i lacked following that act of hypocrisy edward suggested that i prepare our tea i put the big tea kettle aside and used my smaller one talk during tea was about several church duties edward still needed to perform i spoke only when spoken to and was careful to give no offense i did everything i could to assure my husband that i deferred to his authority shortly before six edward announced he was expected at a meeting of the whitechapel vigilance committee i waited until he was out of sight and went first to the cupboard for a table knife and then to the writing table for a sheet of foolscap then i stepped into the pantry and began to scrape up as much of the arsenic from the rat holes as i could february whitechapel charitable institute for indigent children inspector abberline sat in my office nodding approval at everything hed seen its difficult to believe he said that these are the same thin and dirty children who only months ago used to sleep in doorways and under wooden crates you have worked wonders mrs wickham the board of trustees could not have found a better director are the children learning to read and write can they learn some can i answered others are slower the youngest are the quickest it seems i have great hopes for them i wonder if they understand how fortunate they are what a pity the reverend mr wickham didnt live to see this he would have been so pleased with what youve accomplished yes would he have edward always believed the poor should care for their own the inspector was still thinking of my late husband i had an aunt who succumbed to gastric fever he said dreadful way to die dreadful he suddenly realized i might not care to be reminded of the painful method of edwards passing i do beg your pardon that was thoughtless of me i told him not to be concerned i am reconciled to his death now as much as i can ever be my life is here now in the school and it is a most rewarding way to spend my days he smiled i can see you are in your element then he sobered i came not only to see your school but also to tell you something he leaned forward in his chair the file on the ripper is officially closed its been more than two years since his last murder for whatever reason he stopped he did stop that particular reign of terror is over the case is closed my heart lifted keeping up my end of the conversation i asked why do you think he stopped inspector he rubbed the side of his nose he stopped either because hes dead or because hes locked up somewhere in an asylum or perhaps in prison for some other crime forgive my bluntness mrs wickham but i earnestly hope it is the former inmates have been known to escape from asylums and prisons i understand do you think the file will ever be reopened not for one hundred years once a murder case is marked closed the files are sealed and the date is written on the outside when they can be made public it will be a full century before anyone looks at those papers again it couldnt be more official than that the case was indeed closed a centurywhy so long a time well the hundredyear rule was put into effect to guarantee the anonymity of all those making confidential statements to the police during the course of the investigation its best that way now no one will be prying into our reports on the ripper until the year it is over thank heaven for that amen inspector abberline chatted a little longer and then took his leave i strolled through the halls of my school a former church building adapted to its present needs i stopped in one of the classrooms some of the children were paying attention to the teacher others were daydreaming a few were drawing pictures just like children everywhere not all the children who pass through here will be helped some will go on to better themselves but others will slide back into the life of the streets i can save none of them i must not add arrogance to my other offenses by assuming the role of deliverer god does not entrust the work of salvation to one such as i but i am permitted to offer the children a chance to give them the opportunity to lift themselves above the life of squalor and crime that is all they have ever known i do most earnestly thank god for granting me this privilege periodically i return to millers court i go there not because it is the site of edwards final murder but because it is where i last saw rose howe the young girl who helped me deliver the macklin baby there is a place for rose in my school i have not found her yet but i will keep searching my life belongs to the children of whitechapel now my prayers are for them those prayers are the only ones of mine ever likely to be answered when i do pray for myself it is always and only to ask for an easier place in hell ghost station carolyn wheat carolyn wheat b was a new york legal aid attorney for twentythree years and later an administrative law judge when she introduced brooklyn lawyer cass jameson in dead mens thoughts the torrent of lawyer novelists male and female that would be unleashed by the success of scott turow and john grisham had not yet begun that first novel was well received receiving an edgar nomination but wheat proved the opposite of prolific the second jameson novel appearing three years later the third not for another eleven when she stepped up production with books like mean streak and troubled waters a novel that looked back on radical s activism much more briefly but just as effectively as turows laws of our fathers it became obvious that wheat ranks near the top not just among lawyer novelists but contemporary crime writers generally after leaving the practice of law she became a valued teacher of writing including a stint as writer in residence at the university of central oklahoma wheats short stories collected in tales out of school display a variety nearly as remarkable as their uniform excellence some of them have the expected legal background including the chilling juryroom tale cruel and unusual and a rare sherlock holmes courtroom story the adventure of the angels trumpet but many of them do not ghost station about a new york transit cop she credits to her experience working for the nypd if theres one thing i cant stand its a woman drunk the words burned my memory the way irish whiskey used to burn my throat only there was no pleasant haze of alcohol to follow just bitter heartburn pain it was my first night back on the job back to being sergeant maureen gallagher instead of the patient wasnt it hard enough being a transit cop hurtling beneath the streets of manhattan on a subway train that should have been in the transit museum wasnt it enough that after four weeks of detox i felt empty instead of clean and sober did i have to have some rookies casually cruel words ricocheting in my brain like a wildcard bullet why couldnt i remember the good stuff why couldnt i think about oharas beefy handshake greenspans glad to see ya mo ianuzzos smiling welcome why did i have to run the tape in my head of manny delgado asking captain lomax for a different partner hey i got nothing against a lady sarge cap hed said dont get me wrong its just that if theres one thing i cant stand et cetera lomax had done what any standup captain would kicked delgados ass and told him the assignment stood what he hadnt known was that id heard the words and couldnt erase them from my mind even without delgado the night hadnt gotten off to a great start swinging in at midnight for a twelvetoeight id been greeted with the news that i was on graffiti patrol the dirtiest most mindnumbing assignment in the whole transit police duty roster i was a sergeant damn it on my way to a gold shield and i wasnt going to earn it dodging rats in tunnels or going after twelveyearolds armed with spray paint especially when the rest of the cop world both under and aboveground was working overtime on the torch murders of homeless people thered been four human bonfires in the past six weeks and the cops were determined there wouldnt be a fifth was lomax punishing me or was this assignment his subtle way of easing my entry back into the world either way i resented it i wanted to be a real cop again back with sal minucci my old partner he was assigned to the big one in the thick of the action where both of us belonged i should have been with him i was anticrime for gods sake i should have been assigned or should i did i really want to spend my work nights prowling new yorks underground skid row trying to get information from men and women too zonked out to take care of legs gone gangrenous whose lives stretched from one bottle of cool breeze to another hell yes if it would bring me one step closer to that gold shield id interview all the devils in hell on my day off if theres one thing i cant stand its a woman drunk what did lomax think that mingling with winos would topple me off the wagon that id ask for a hit from some guys short dog and pass out in the bleecker street station was that why hed kept me off the big one and had me walking a rookie through routine graffiti patrol was i getting paranoid or was lack of alcohol rotting my brain manny and i had gone to our respective locker rooms to suit up plain clothes and i do mean plain long johns first damp winter had a way of seeping down into the tunnels and into your very blood then a pair of denims the goodwill would have turned down thick wool socks fishermans duck boots a black turtleneck and a photographers vest with lots of pockets a black knit hat pulled tight over my red hair then the gear flashlight more important than a gun on this assignment handcuffs ticket book radio gun knife a slapper on oversize blackjack hidden in the rear pouch of the vest they were against regulations id get at least a command discipline if caught with it but experience told me id rather have it than a gun going against a pack of kids id forgotten how heavy the stuff was i felt like a telephone lineman i looked like a cat burglar delgado and i met at the door it was obvious hed never done vandal duty before his tan chinos were immaculate and his hiking boots didnt look waterproof his red plaid flannel shirt was neither warm enough nor the right dark color with his latin good looks he would have been stunning in an l l bean catalog but after ten minutes in a subway tunnel hed pass for a chimney sweep where are we going he asked his tone a shade short of sullen and there was no respectful sergeant at the end of the question either this boy needed a lesson in manners i took a malicious delight in describing our destination the black hole of calcutta i replied cheerfully explaining that i meant the unused lower platform of the city hall station downtown the oldest darkest dankest spot in all manhattan if there were any subway alligators they definitely lurked in the black hole the expression on probationary transit police officer manuel delgados face was all i could have hoped for i almost but not quite took pity on the kid when i added and after that well try one or two of the ghost stations ghost stations now he looked really worried what are those this kid wasnt just a rookie he was a suburbanite every new yorker knew about ghost stations abandoned platforms where trains no longer stopped they were still lit though and showed up in the windows of passing trains like ghost towns on the prairie they were ideal canvases for the aspiring artists of the underground city i explained on the subway heading downtown the car which rattled under the city streets like a tin lizzie was nearly riderless at am a typical monday late hour the passengers were one orthodox jewish man falling asleep over his hebrew bible two black women both reading thick paperback romances the obligatory pair of teenagers making out in the last seat and an old chinese woman i didnt want to look at delgado more than once id seen a fleeting smirk on his face when i glanced his way it wasnt enough for insubordination the best policy was to ignore it i let the rhythm of the subway car lull me into a litany of the aa slogans i was trying to work into my life easy does it keep it simple sweetheart one day at a time i saw them in my mind the way they appeared on the walls at meetings illuminated like old celtic manuscripts this night i had to take one hour at a time maybe even one minute at a time my legs felt wobbly i was a sailor too long from the sea id lost my subway legs i felt white and thin as though id had several major organs removed then the drunk got on one of the black women got off the other one looked up at the station sign and went back to her book and the drunk got on if theres one thing i cant stand its a woman drunk one day at a time easy does it i stiffened the last thing i wanted was to react in front of delgado but i couldnt help it the sight of an obviously intoxicated man stumbling into our subway car brought the knowing smirk back to his face there was one at every aa meeting no matter how nice the neighborhood how welldressed most people attending the meeting were there was always a drunk a real drunk still reeling still reeking of cheap booze my sponsor margie said they were there for a reason to let us middleclass recoveryoriented types remember that there but for the grace of god i cringed whenever i saw them especially if the object lesson for the day was a woman hey kid the drunk called out to delgado in a voice as inappropriately loud as a deaf mans how old are you the doors closed and the car lurched forward the drunk all but fell into his seat old enough many replied flashing the polite smile a wellbroughtup kid saves for his maiden aunt the undertone wasnt so pretty little sidelong glances at me that said see how nice i am to this old fart see what a good boy i am i like drunks sergeant gallagher to avoid my partners face i concentrated on the subway ads as though they contained all the wisdom of the big book heres to birth defects proclaimed a pregnant woman about to down a glass of beer two monks looked to heaven thanking god in spanish for the fine quality of their brandy werent there any signs on this damn train that didnt involve booze finally an ad i could smile at the moon in black space on it someone had scrawled alice kramden was here my smile faded as i remembered sal minuccis raised fist his jackie gleason growl one of these days gallagher youre goin to the moon to the moon it wasnt just the murder case i missed it was sal the easy partnership of the man whod put up with my hangovers my depressions my wild nights out with the boys yknow how old i am the drunk shouted almost falling over in his seat he righted himself fiftyfour in september he announced an expectant look on his face after a quick smirk in my direction manny gave the guy what he wanted you dont look it he said no trace of irony appeared on his spanish altar boys face it was as though hed never said the words that were eating into me like batteryacid aa coffee the sudden jab of anger that stabbed through me took me by surprise especially since it wasnt directed at delgado no you dont look it i thought you look more like seventy white wisps of hair over a bright pink scalp the face more than pink a slab of raw calves liver road maps of broken blood vessels on his nose and cheeks thin white arms and matchstick legs under toobig trousers when he lifted his hand ropy with bulging blue veins it fluttered like a pennant in the breeze like uncle pauls hands i turned away sharply i couldnt look at the old guy anymore the constant visual digs delgado kept throwing in my direction were nothing compared to the pain of looking at a man dying before my eyes i didnt want to see blue eyes in that neardead face as blue as the lakes of killarney uncle paul used to say in his mockirish brogue i focused on the teenagers making out in the rear of the car a couple of spanish kids wearing identical pink tshirts and black leather jackets if i stared at them long enough would they stop groping and kissing or would an audience spur their passion uncle paul after daddy left us he was my special friend and i was his best girl i squeezed my eyes shut but the memories came anyway the red bike uncle paul gave me for my tenth birthday the first really big new thing bought just for me that id ever had the best part was showing it off to cousin tommy for once i didnt need his handmedowns or aunt bridgets clucking over me for being poor god bless the child whos got her own i opened my eyes just as the lex passed through the ghost station at worth street closed off to the public for maybe fifteen years it seemed a mirage dimly seen through the dirty windows of the subway car bright color on the white tile walls told me graffiti bombers had been there a good place to check but not until after city hall i owed manny delgado a trip to the black hole uh sergeant i turned a patronizing smile played on delgados lips hed apparently been trying to get my attention sorry i said feigning a yawn just a little tired yeah sure his look remarked were coming to brooklyn bridge shouldnt we get off the train right leave uncle paul where he belongs at the brooklyn bridge stop we climbed up the steps to the upper platform showed our id to the woman token clerk and told her we were going into the tunnel toward city hall then we went back downstairs heading for the south end of the downtown platform as we were about to go past the gate marked no unauthorized personnel beyond this point i looked back at the lighted platform which made a crescentshaped curve behind us almost in a mirror image the old drunk was about to pass the forbidden gate and descend into the tunnel heading uptown he stepped carefully holding on to the white bathroomtile walls edging himself around the waisthigh gate he lowered himself down the stone steps the exact replica of the ones manny and i were about to descend then disappeared into the blackness i couldnt let him go there were too many dangers in the subway dangers beyond the torch killer everyone was on the hunt for how many frozen bodies had i stumbled over on the catwalks between tunnels how many huddled victims had been hit by trains as they lay in sodden sleep and yet i had to be careful my friend kathy denzer had gone after a bum sleeping on the catwalk only to have the man stab her in the arm for trying to save his life i couldnt let him go turning to delgado i said lets save city hall for later i saw some graffiti at worth street on the way here lets check that out first he shrugged at least he was being spared the black hole his expression said entering the tunnels blackness leaving behind the brightly lit world of sleepy riders a tiny rush of adrenaline like msg after a chinese dinner coursed through my bloodstream part of it was pure reversion to childhoods fears hansel and gretel snow white lost in dark woods with enemies all around in this case rats their scuffling sent shivers up my spine as we balanced our way along the catwalk above the tracks the other part was elation this was my job i was good at it i could put aside my fears and step boldly down into murky depths where few new yorkers ever went our flashlights shone dim as fireflies i surveyed the gloomy underground world id spent my professional life in my imagination often took over in the tunnels they became caves of doom or an evil wood out of lord of the rings the square columns holding up the tunnel roof were leafless trees the constant trickle of foul water between the tracks a poisonous stream from which no one drank and lived jones beach uncle pauls huge hand cradling my foot then lifting me high in the air and flinging me backward laughing with delight into the cool water droplets clinging to his red beard and uncle paul shaking them off into the sunlight like a wet irish setter me and mo were the only true gallaghers the only redheads i got straight as in english nobodys grammar was safe from me except uncle pauls i thought all men smelled like him whiskey and tobacco as manny and i plodded along the fourblock tunnel between the live station and the dead one we exchanged no words the acrid stench of an old track fire filled my nostrils the way memories flooded my mind trying to push uncle paul away i bent all my concentration on stepping carefully around the foulsmelling water the burned debris i didnt want to identify i suspected delgados silence was due to fear he wouldnt want a shaking voice to betray his tension i knew how he felt the first nighttime tunnel trek was a landmark in a young transit cops life when the downtown express thundered past we ducked into the coffinsized alcoves set aside for transit workers my heart pounded as the wind wake of the train pulled at my clothes the fear of falling forward landing under those relentless steel wheels never left me no matter how many times i stood in the well i always thought of anna karenina once in a while in my drinking days id wondered how it would feel to edge forward to let the trains undertow pull me toward death i could never do it id seen too much blood on the tracks light at the end of the tunnel the worth street station sent rays of hope into the spidery blackness my step quickened delgados pace matched mine soon we were almost running toward the light like cavemen coming from the hunt to sit by the fire of safety we were almost at the edge of the platform when i motioned delgado to stop my hunger to bathe in the light was as great as his but our post was in the shadows watching a moment of panic id lost the drunk had he fallen on the tracks the electrified third rail roasting him like a pig at a barbecue not possible wed have heard and smelled i had to admit the graffiti painting wasnt a mindless scrawl it was a picture full of color and life humanlike figures in bright primary shades grass green royal blue orange sun yellow and carnation pink colors unknown in the blackandgray tunnels stood in a line waiting to go through a subway turnstile sexless they were cookiecutter replicas of one another the only difference among them the color inside the black edges a rhythmic clicking sound made delgado jump what the hell relax manny i whispered its the ball bearing in the spraypaint can the vandals are here as soon as the paint hits the tiles we jump out and bust them four rowdy teenagers ranging in color from light brown to ebony laughed raucously and punched one another with a theatrical style that said we bad we real bad they bounded up the steps from the other side of the platform and surveyed their artwork playful as puppies pointing out choice bits they had added to their mural it should have been simple two armed cops with the advantage of surprise against four kids armed with dayglo spray paint two things kept it from being simple the drunk wherever the hell he was and the fact that one of the kids said hey bro when cool and jojo gettin here a very black kid with a nylon stocking on his head answered jojo be comin with pinto cool say he might be bringin slasher and tp great instead of two against four it sounded like all the graffiti artists in new york city were planning a convention in the worth street ghost station sarge delgados voice was urgent weve gotta i know i whispered back get on the radio and call for backup then i remembered worth street was a dead spot lead in the ceiling above our heads turned our radios into worthless toys stop i said wearily as manny pulled the antenna up on his handheld radio it wont work youll have to go back to brooklyn bridge alert booth robert twotwentyone have them call operations just ask for backup dont make it a tenthirteen a meant officer in trouble and i didnt want to be the sergeant who cried wolf try the radio along the way i went on you never know when it will come to life im not sure where the lead ends watching delgado trudge back along the catwalk i felt lonely helpless and stupid no one knew wed gone to worth street instead of the black hole and that was my fault hey one of the kids called pointing to a pile of old clothes in the corner of the platform what this dude be doin in our crib dude what dude then the old clothes began to rise it was the drunk from the train he was huddled into a fetal ball hoping not to be noticed by the graffiti gang nylon stocking boogied over to the old drunk sticking a finger in his ribs what you be doin here ol man huh answer me a fat kid with a flat top walked over sat down next to the drunk reached into the old mans jacket pocket and pulled out a halfempty pint bottle a lighterskinned thinner boy slapped the drunk around first lifting him by the scruff of the neck then laughing as he flopped back to the floor the old guy tried to rise only to be kicked in the ribs by nylon stocking the old guy was bleeding at the mouth fat boy held the pint of booze aloft teasing the drunk the way you tease a dog with a bone the worst part was that the drunk was reaching for it hands flapping wildly begging hed have barked if theyd asked him to i was shaking my stomach starting to heave god where was manny where was my backup i had to stop the kids before their friends got there but i felt too sick to move if theres one thing i cant stand its a woman drunk it was as though every taunt every kick was aimed at me not just at the old man i reached into my belt for my gun then opened my vests back pouch and pulled out the slapper ready to charge i stopped cold when nylon stocking said yo yall want to do him like we done the others fat boys face lit up yeah he agreed feel like a cold night we needs a little fire you right bro the lightskinned kid chimed in i got the kerosene done took it from my momma heater what he deserve man the fourth member of the gang said his voice a low growl comin into our crib pissin on the art smellin up the place this here our turf dig he prodded the old man in the chest ii didnt mean nothing the old man whimpered i just wanted a place to sleep uncle paul sleeping on our couch when he was too drunk for aunt rose to put up with him he was never too drunk for mom to take him in never too drunk to give me one of his sweet irish smiles and call me his best girl the lightskinned kid opened the bottle ironically it looked as if it once contained whiskey and sprinkled the old man the way my mother sprinkled clothes before ironing them nylon stocking pulled out a book of matches by the time delgado came back with or without backup thered be one more bonfire if i didnt do something fast surprise was my only hope four of them young and strong one of me out of shape and shaky i shot out a light i cracked the bulb on the first shot target shooting was my best asset as a cop and i used it to give the kids the impression they were surrounded the kids jumped away from the drunk moving in all directions shit one said who shootin i shot out the second and last bulb in the dark i had the advantage they wouldnt know at least at first that only one cop was coming after them lets book another cried aint worth stayin here to get shot i ran up the steps onto the platform lit only by the moonlike rays from the other side of the tracks yelling stop police i waded into the kids swinging my illegal slapper thump into the ribs of the kid holding the kerosene bottle he dropped it clutching his chest and howling i felt the breath whoosh out of him heard the snap of rib cracking i wheeled and slapped nylon stocking across the knee earning another satisfying howl my breath came in gasps curses pouring out of me blood pounded in my temples a thumping noise that sounded louder than the express train the advantage of surprise was over the other two kids jumped me one riding my back the other going for my stomach with hard little fists all i could see was a maddened teenage tornado circling me with blows my arm felt light as i thrust my gun deep into the kids stomach he doubled groaning it was like chugging beer at a cop racket every hit every satisfying whack of blackjack against flesh made me hungry for the next i whirled and socked the kids kept coming and i kept knocking them down like bowling pins the adrenaline rush was stupendous filling me with elation i was a real cop again there was life after detox at last they stopped panting i stood among the fallen exhausted my hair had escaped from my knit hat and hung in matted tangles over a face redhot as a griddle i pulled out my cuffs and chained the kids together wrist to wrist wishing i had enough sets to do each individually together even cuffed they could overpower me especially since they were beginning to realize i was alone i felt weak spent as though id just made love i sat down on the platform panting my gun pointed at nylon stocking you have the right to remain silent i began as i finished the last miranda warning on the last kid i heard the cavalry coming over the hill manny delgado with four reinforcements as the new officers took the collars i motioned manny aside taking him to where the drunk lay sprawled in the corner still shaking and whimpering do you smell anything i asked manny wrinkled his nose i looked down at the drunk a trickle of water seeped from underneath him his crotch was soaked uncle paul weaving his way home singing offkey stopping to take a piss under the lamppost nothing unusual in that except that this time julie ann mackinnon my eighthgrade rival watched from across the street my cheeks burned as i recalled how shed told the other kids what shed seen her hand cupped over her giggling mouth not that i said my tone sharp my face reddening the kerosene these kids are the torch killers they were going to roast this guy thats why i had to take them on alone delgados face registered the scepticism id seen lurking in his eyes all night could he trust me hed been suitably impressed at my chain gang of prisoners but now i was talking about solving the crime that had every cop in the city on overtime look just go back to brooklyn bridge and radioi was going to say captain lomax when i thought bettersal minucci in anticrime hell want to have the guys coat analyzed and make sure somebody takes good care of that bottle i pointed to the nowempty whiskey bottle the lightskinned boy had poured kerosene from isnt that his manny indicated the drunk no his is a short dog i said then turned away as i realized the term was not widely known in nondrunk circles just go kid i prayed get the hell out of here before he turned following the backup officers with their chain gang and send for emergency medical for this guy i added ill stay here till they come i looked down at the drunk his eyes were blue a watery nocolor blue with all the life washed out of them uncle pauls eyes uncle paul blurryfaced and maudlin too blitzed to care that id come home from school with a medal for the best english composition id put my masterpiece by his chair so he could read it after dinner he spilled whiskey on it the blueblack ink ran like tears and blotted out my carefully chosen words uncle paul old sick and dying just like this one living by that time more on the street than at home though there were people who would take him in his eyes more red than blue his big frame wasted i felt a sob rising like death squeezing my lungs i heaved grabbing for air my face was wet with tears i didnt recall shedding i hate you uncle paul ill never be like you never i walked over to the drunk still sprawled on the platform i was a sleepwalker my arm lifted itself i jabbed the butt of my gun into old thin ribs feeling it bump against bone it would be a baseballsize bruise first a raw redpurple then blueviolet finally a sickly yellowgray i lifted my foot just high enough to land with a thud near the kidneys the old drunk grunted his mouth falling open a drizzle of saliva fell to the ground he put shaking hands to his face and squeezed his eyes shut i lifted my foot again i wanted to kick and kick and kick uncle paul a frozen lump of meat found by some transit cop on the aboveground platform at st street the yankee stadium stop where he took me when the yanks played home games wed eat at the yankee tavern me wolfing down a corned beef on rye and cream soda uncle paul putting away draft beer after draft beer before he died uncle paul had taken all the coins out of his pocket stacking them in neat little piles beside him quarters dimes nickels pennies an inventory of his worldly goods i took a deep shuddering breath looked down at the sad old man id brutalized a hot rush of shame washed over me i knelt down gently moving the frail bluewhite hands away from the neartransparent face the fear i saw in the liquid blue eyes sent a piercing ray of selfhatred through me if theres anything i cant stand its a woman drunk me too manny i cant stand women drunks either the old mans lips trembled tears filled his eyes and rolled down his thin cheeks he shook his head from side to side as though trying to wake himself from a bad dream why he asked his voice a ravens croak because i loved you so much the words werent in my head anymore they were slipping out into the silent empty world of the ghost station as though uncle paul werent buried in calvary cemetery but could hear me with the ears of this old man who looked too damn much like him because i wanted to be just like you and i am my voice broke im just like you uncle paul im a drunk i put my head on my knee and sobbed like a child all the shame of my drinking days welled up in my chest the stupid things id said and done the times id had to be taken home and put to bed the times id thrown up in the street outside the bar if theres one thing i cant stand oh god i wish i were dead the bony hand on mine felt like a talon i started then looked into the old mans watery eyes i sat in the ghost station and saw in this stranger the ghost that had been my dying uncle why should you wish a thing like that the old man asked his voice was clear no boozeblurred slurring no groping for words burned out of the brain by alcohol youre a young girl youve got your whole life ahead of you my whole life to be continued one day at a time one night at a time when i got back to the district changed out of my work clothes showered would there be a meeting waiting for me damn right in the city that never sleeps aa never sleeps either i reached out to the old man my fingers brushed his silver stubble im sorry uncle paul i said im sorry new moon and rattlesnakes wendy hornsby wendy hornsby b was born in los angeles and educated at ucla and california state university long beach since she has been a professor of history at long beach city college her first novel no harm featured history teacher kate teague who figured in one more case before she was succeeded by the betterknown documentary filmmaker maggie macgowen in telling lies and several subsequent books though both series characters are technically amateur detectives their law enforcement connections put hornsbys books into the police procedural category asked to identify influences hornsby pays obeisance to the california hardboiled triumvirate of dashiell hammett raymond chandler and ross macdonald but identifies as her real role model the wife of macdonald margaret millar outside the mystery genre she noted in deadly women as a kid i read my way through dickens a huge influence on a budding hardboiled writer and mark twain who is the master of characterization and ambrose bierce because he was so wicked in recent times the distinctions between tough and cozy masculine and feminine approaches to crime fiction have become less pronounced and in most cases less important than they used to be hornsbys new moon and rattlesnakes is a noirish story that would have been right at home in the great s digest manhunt a periodical to which few women writers contributed lise caught a ride at a truck stop near riverside in a big rig headed for phoenix the driver was a paunchy lonely old geek whose comeon line was a fatherly routine she helped him play his line because it got her inside the airconditioned cab of his truck and headed east way ahead of her schedule sweet young thing like you shouldnt be thumbing rides he said helping lise with her seat belt desert can be awful damn dangerous in the summertime i know the desert besides she put her hand over his hairy paw im not so young and theres nothing sweet about me he laughed but he looked at her more closely looked at the heavy purse she carried with her too after that long look he dropped the fatherly routine she was glad because she didnt have a lot of time to waste on preliminaries the tired old jokes he told her got steadily gamier as he drove east out interstate cheap new housing tracts and pink stucco malls gave way to a landscape of razorsharp yucca and shimmering heat and all the way lise laughed at his stupid jokes only to let him know she was hanging in with him up the steep grade through beaumont and banning and cabazon she laughed on cue watching him go through his gears deciding whether she could drive the truck without him or not twice to speed things along she told him jokes that made his bald head blush flame red before the palm springs turnoff he suggested they stop at an indian bingo palace for cold drinks and a couple of games somehow while she was distracted watching how the place operated his hand kept finding its way into the back of her spandex tank top the feel of him so close his suggestive leers the smell of him the smoky smell of the place made her clammy all over but she kept up a good front didnt retch when her stomach churned she had practice for five years she had kept up a good front and survived because of it come ten oclock she encouraged herself there would be a whole new order of things after bingo it was an hour of frontseat wrestling straight down the highway to a motel all rooms cable tv and a phone in every room he told her what he wanted she asked him to take a shower first in riverside hed said his name was jack but the name on the louisiana drivers license she found in his wallet said henry lebeau he was in the shower singing when she made this discovery lise practiced writing the name a couple of times on motel stationery while she placed a call on the room phone mrs henry lebeau lise lebeaushe wrote it until the call was answered im out lise said youre lying not me she said penalty for lyings too high i left my best man at the house with you he would have called me if he could maybe your best man isnt as good as you thought he was maybe im better waiting for more response from the other end she wrote lebeaus name a few more times wrote it until it felt natural to her hand finally she got more than heavy breathing from the phone where are you lise im a long way into somewhere else dont bother to go looking because this time you wont find me of course i will she hung up jackhenry turned off the shower before he was out of the bathroom fresh and clean and looking for love lise was out of the motel and down the road with his wallet in her bag the heat outside was like a frontal assault after the cool dim room hundred and ten degrees zero percent humidity according to a sign afternoon sun slanted directly into lises eyes and the air smelled like truck fuel and hot pavement but it was better than the twoday sweat that had filled the bigrig cab and had followed them into the motel she needed a dozen hot breaths to get his stench out of her the motel wasnt in a place nothing but a graded spot at the end of a freeway offramp halfway between la and phoenix a couple of service stations and a minimart a hundred miles of scrubby cactus and sharp rocks for neighbors shielding her eyes lise quickwalked toward the freeway looking for possibilities even before she crossed the road to the texaco station the meeting she needed to attend would be held in palm springs and she had to find a way to get there she knew for a dead certainly she didnt want to get into another truck and she couldnt stay in the open heat blazed down from the sky bounced up off the pavement and caught her both ways lise began to panic fifteen minutes maybe twenty under the sun and she knew she would be fried but it wasnt the heat that made her run for the shelter of the covered service station after being confined for so long she was sometimes frightened by open space the texaco and its minimart were busy with a transient olio show cranky families in vans chubby truckers city smoothies in desert vacation togs and too much shiny jewelry everyone in a hurry to fill up scrape the bugs off the windshield and get back on the road with the airconditioning buffering them from the relentless heat as she walked past the pumps waiting for opportunity to present itself an old whitehaired guy in a big new cadillac slid past her pulled up next to the minimart he was a very cleanlooking man the sort she thought who doesnt like to get hot and mussed like her father when he got out of his car to go into the minimart the cream puff left his engine running and his air conditioner blowing to keep the cars interior cool lise saw the man inside the store spinning a rack of road maps as she got into his car and drove away when she hit the onramp backtracking west she saw mr henry lebeau half dressed and sweating like a comeback wrestler standing out in front of the motel looking upset peering around like hed lost something goodbye mr lebeau lise smiled at his tiny figure as it receded in her rearview mirror thanks for the ride then she looked all around half expecting to spot a tail to find a fleet of long shiny black cars deployed to find her surround her take her back home escape couldnt be this easy but the only shine she saw came from mirages like silver puddles splashed across the freeway she relaxed some settled against the leather upholstery aimed the air vents on her face and changed the caddys radio station from a hundred violins to chopin her transformation from truckstop dolly to mall matron took less than five minutes she wiped off the heavy makeup she had acquired in riverside covered the skimpy tank top with a blouse from her bag rolled down the cuffs of her denim shorts to cover three more inches of her muscular thighs traded the handtooled boots for graceful leather sandals and tied her windblown hair into a neat ponytail at the back of her neck when she checked her face in the mirror she saw any lady in a checkout line looking back at her lise took the bob hope drive offramp sighed happily as the scorched and barren virgin desert gave way to deepgreen golf courses piles of chichi condos palm trees fountains and posh restaurants whose parking lots were garnished with jags caddies and benzes she pulled into one of those lots and with the motor running took some time to really look over what she had to work with american express card signed h g lebeau mastercard signed henry lebeau four hundred in cash the wallet also had some gas company cards two old condoms a picture of an ugly wife and a slip of paper with a fourdigit number bless his heart she thought smiling henry had given her a pin number contributed to her range of possibilities lise committed the four digits to memory put the credit cards and cash into her pocket then got out into the blasting heat to stuff the wallet into a trash can before she drove on to the palm desert mall like a good scout lise left the caddy in the mall parking lot just as she had found it motor running doors unlocked keys inside without a backward glance she headed straight for i magnin wardrobe essentials and a beautiful leatherandbrocade suitcase to carry it consumed little more than an hour she signed for purchases alternately as mrs henry lebeau or h g lebeau as she alternated the credit cards she felt safe doing it in magnins no one ever dared ask for id time was a problem and so was cash enough to carry through the next few days until she could safely use other resources as soon as henry got himself pulled together she knew he would report his cards lost she also knew he wouldnt have the balls to confess the circumstances under which the cards got away from him so she wasnt worried about the police but once the cards were reported they would be useless how much longer would it take him she wondered from a teller machine she pulled the twohundreddollar cash advance limit off the mastercard then used the card a last time to place another call youre worried she said into the receiver you have that meeting tonight and i have distracted you you have a problem because if im not around to sign the final papers everything falls apart now youre caught in a bind you cant stand up the congressman and you cant let me get away and you sure as hell cant be in two places at once what are you going to do this is insane the old fury was in his voice this time where are you dont leave the house dont even think about it ill know if you do ill see the lie in your eyes ill smell it on every lying word that comes out of your mouth it was easy the words just came like playing back an old familiar tape the words did sound funny to her though coming out of her own mouth she wondered how he came up with such garbage and more to the point how he had persuaded her over the years that death could be any worse than living under his dirty thumb the true joy of talking to him over the telephone was having the power to turn him off she hung up took a deep breath blew out the sound of him in the soft soil of a planter next to the phone bank she dug a little grave for the credit card and covered it over after a late lunch accompanied by half a bottle of very cold champagne lise had her hair done darkened back to its original color and cut very short the beauty parlor receptionist was accommodating added a hundred dollars to the american express bill and gave lise the difference in cash lise had been moderately surprised when the card flew through clearance but risked using it one last time from a gourmet boutique she picked up some essentials of another kind a few bottles of good wine a basket of fruit a variety of expensive little snacks on her way out of the store she jettisoned the american express into a bin of green jelly beans every transaction fed her confidence assured her she had the courage to go through with the plan that would set her free forever by the time she had finished her chores her accumulation of bags was almost more than she could carry and she was exhausted but she felt better than she had for a very long time when she headed for the mall exit on the far side from where she had left mr cleans cadillac lise was not at all sure what would happen next she still had presentiments of doom she still looked over her shoulder and at reflections of the crowd in every window she passed logic said she was safe conditioning kept her wary kept her moving hijacking a car with its motor running had worked so well once she decided to try it again she had any number of prospects to choose from the malls indoor iceskating rink bizarrely the rink overlooked a giant cactus garden and the movie theater complex next to it meant parents waiting at the curb for kids among that row of cars lise counted three with motors running airconditioning purring and no drivers in sight lise considered her choices a volvo station wagon a small beemer and a tealblue jag she ran through eeny meeny though she had targeted the jag right off the jag was the first car in the row bags in the backseat lise in the drivers seat and pulling away from the curb before she had the door all the way shut after a stop on a side street to pack her new things into the suitcase she drove straight to the palm springs airport she left the jag in a passenger loading zone and bags in hand rushed into the terminal like a tourist late for a flight she stopped at the first phone youve checked havent you she said when he picked up you sent your goons to look in on me you know im out were so close i know everything youve done i can hear your thoughts running through my head youre thinking the deal is dead without me and im in another time zone you wont get away from me i think youre angry if i dont correct you when you have bad thoughts youll ruin everything stop it she looked at her nails kept her voice flat youre everything to me id kill you before i let you go please lise his voice had a catch almost like a sob when she hung up she left the terminal by a different door came out at the cab stand where a single cab waited the driver looked like a cousin of the indians at the bingo palace and because of the nature of the meeting scheduled that night she hesitated in the end she handed the cabbie her suitcase and gave him the address of a hotel in downtown palm springs an address she had memorized a long time ago pretty dead over there the driver said fingering the leather grips of her bag hard to get around without a car when youre so far out i can steer you to nicer places closer in good rates off season too no thank you she said he talked the entire way he asked more questions than she answered and made her feel uneasy why should a stranger need to know so much could the driver possibly be a plant sent to bring her back was the conversation normal chitchat that last question bothered her she had been cut off for so long would she know normal if she met it headon when the driver dropped her at a funky old place on the block behind the main street through palm springs she was still wary she waited until he was gone before she picked up her bag and walked inside off season the hotel felt empty the manager was old enough to be her mother a desert woman with skin like a lizard and tiny black eyes i need a room for two nights lise told her the manager handed her a registration card put it on a credit card or cash in advance lise paid cash for the two nights and gave the woman a fiftydollar deposit for the use of the telephone its quiet here the manager said handing over a key too hot this time of year for most people quiet is what im counting on lise said im not expecting any calls but if someone asks for me id appreciate it if you never heard of me when the manager smiled her black eyes nearly disappeared among the folds of dry skin man trouble honey is there another kind from my experience its always either a man or money and from the look of you the manager said glancing at the suitcase and the gourmet shops handled bag id put my nickel on the former dont worry honey i didnt get a good look at you and i already forgot your name the name lise wrote on the registration card was the name on a bottle of chardonnay in her bag rutherford hill the hotel was built like an old adobe ranch house with thick walls and rounded corners mexican tile on the floors dark openbeamed ceilings lises room was a bit threadbare but it was larger cleaner nicer than she had expected for the price the air conditioner worked and there was a kitchenette with a little groaning refrigerator for her wine for the first time in five years she had her own key and used it to lock the door from the inside from her tiny balcony lise could see both the pool in the patio below and the rocky base of mount san jacinto a quarter mile away already the sun had slipped behind the crest of the mountain leaving the hotel in blue shade finally lise was able to smell the real desert dry sage and blooming oleander air without exhaust fumes a gentle breeze blew in off the mountain lise left the window open and lay down on the bed to rest for just a moment when she opened her eyes again floating on the cusp between sleep and wakefulness the room was washed in soft lavender light hot but fragrant with the flowers on the patio below she could hear a fountain somewhere now and then voices at a distance for the first time in a long time she didnt go straight to the door and listen for breathing on the other side lise slipped into the new swimsuit a little snug in the rear she hadnt taken time to try it on before she bought it she needed the ice pick she found on the sink to free the ice in the trays so she could fill the paper ice bucket she liked the heavy feel of the tool while she opened a bottle of wine and cut some fruit and cheese she made a call sunset will be exactly eight thirtytwo no moon tonight rattlesnakes love a moonless night you better stay indoors or you might get bitten what is your game your game im a quick learner remember when you said that i think i have all your moves down lets see how they play youre a rookie lise you wont make it in the big leagues and every game i play baby is the big one hed had some time to get over the initial surprise and anger so he was back on the offensive he scared her but because he couldnt touch her her resolve held firm as she listened to him youll be back lise youll take a few hard ones to the head and realize how cold and cruel that world out there is youll beg me to take you in and watch over you again you can be mad at me all you want but it isnt my fault youre such a princess you cant find your way across the street alone blame your asshole father for spoiling you if it wasnt for me if it wasnt for you my father would be alive she said cutting off his windup i have the proof with me the moment of silence told her she had hit home she hung up lise swam in the small pool until she felt clean again until the heat and the sweat and the layer of fine sand had all been washed away until the warm chlorinated water had bleached away the fevered touch of henry lebeau some of her new hair color was bleached away too it left a shadow on the towel when she got out and dried off lise poured a bathroom tumbler full of strawcolored wine and stretched out on a chaise beside the pool there was still some blue in the sky when the manager came out to switch on the pool lights sure was a hot one the manager nursed a drink of her own course till october theyre pretty much all hot ones let me know when youre finished with the pool sun heats it up so much that every night i let out some of the water and replace it with cold otherwise ill have parboiled guests on my hands how many guests are in the hotel lise asked just you honey the manager drained her glass one guest is one more than i had all last week lise offered her the tray of cheese can you sit down for a minute have a little happy hour with the registered guests i dont mind the manager pulled up a chaise next to lise and let lise fill her empty glass with chardonnay i have to say off season it does get lonely now and then we used to close up from memorial day to labor day the whole town did were more yearround now hell theres talk well have gambling soon and become the new vegas vegas is noisy vegas is full of crooks the manager nibbled some cheese i wouldnt mind having my rooms booked up again but the high rollers would stay in the big new hotels and id get their hookers and pushers who needs that lise sipped from her glass and stayed quiet the manager sighed as she looked up into the darkening sky was a time when this place hopped with hollywood people and their carryingson liberace and a bunch of them had places just up the road here you know we used to get the overflow and were they ever a wild crowd i miss them that set has moved on east fancier places like palm desert i still get an oldtimer now and then but most of my guests are canadian snowbirds they start showing up around thanksgiving spend the winter nice bunch but awful tame she winked at lise tame but easier to deal with than vegas hookers im sure lise said with a thoughtful tilt to her head the manager looked again and more closely at lise im pretty far off the beaten track howd you ever find my place i passed the hotel when i was up here visiting it seemed so lise refilled their glasses it seemed peaceful lise could feel the managers shiny black eyes on her you okay honey lise held up the empty bottle im getting there that kind of medicine is only going to last so long its none of my business but you want to talk about it im sure youve heard it all before longsuffering wife skips out on asshole husband ive not only heard it ive lived it twice the manager put her weathered hand on lises bare knee and smiled sweetly youre going to be fine just give it some time the wine fatigue the sweet concern on the old womans face all combining lise felt the cracks inside open up and let in some light the last time anyone had shown her genuine concern had been five years ago when her father was still alive there was a fiveyear accumulation of moss on her fathers marble headstone lise began to cry softly the manager pulled a packet of tissues out of her pocket atta girl let the river flow lise laughed then does he know where you are lise shook her head not yet not yet given time hell find me he always does no matter how far i run he can find me hes a powerful man with powerful friends what are you going to do lise shrugged though she knew very well the answer was in the bag upstairs in the closet well dont you worry honey no one knows about this old place and i already told you i dont remember what you look like and i dont recall your name the manager picked up the empty bottle and looked at the rutherford hill label sly humour folding the corners of her creased face though come to think of it the name does have a familiar ring the sun set at exactly lise showered and changed into long khakis and a palepeach shirt both in tones of the desert floor she took her bag out of the closet and held it on her lap while she waited for the last reflected light of the day to fade the big story on the local tv news was what the manager had been talking about the growing controversy over the proposal to build a vegasstyle casino on tahquitz indian tribal land at the southern city limits of palm springs a congressional delegation had come to town to investigate as the videotaped congressmen wearing sober gray and big smiles paraded across the barren hillside site lise felt chilled her husband wearing his own big smile was among the entourage she knew why he was in town and who he would be meeting with but she hadnt expected to see him before she pulled the bag closer against her and checked the clock beside the bed if the clock was correct he had nearly run out of time when lise walked downstairs she could see the flickering light of a television behind the front desk could hear the manager moving around and further coverage of the big story spieling across the empty lobby quietly lise went out through the patio the bag hanging heavily from her shoulder maybe rattlesnakes do like a moonless night she thought but they hate people and slither away pretty fast lise walked along a sandy path that paralleled the road feeling the stored heat in the earth soak through her sneakers palms rustled overhead like the rattle of a snake and set her on edge lise slipped on a pair of surgical gloves and being excruciatingly careful not to disturb the beautiful fiveyearold set of prints on the barrel took the out of her bag pumped a round into the chamber in case of emergency and walked on the house where the meeting would take place had belonged to her father before her marriage she used to drive out on weekends and school vacations to visit him after her marriage after her fathers funeral her husband had taken the place over to use when he had deals to make in the desert now and then when he couldnt make other arrangements for her lise had come along it had been during a recent weekend when she was banished to the bedroom during a business meeting that lise had figured out a way to get free of him forever the house sat in a shallow box canyon at the end of the same street the hotel was on her father had built the house in the spanish style a long string of rooms that all opened onto a central patio like the hotel it had thick walls to keep out the worst of the heat and like the hotel like a fort it was very quiet all the lights were on lise knew that for a meeting this delicate there would be no entourage inside the house there would be only three people the nonenglishspeaking housekeeper lises husband and the congressman she knew the routine well the congressman was as much a part of her husbands inheritance from her father as lise and the house were outside there was a guard on the front door and one on the back patio standing away from the windows so that his presence wouldnt offend the congressman both of the guards were big and ugly snakes of another kind and more intimidating than they were smart by circling wide lise got past the man in front made it to the edge of the patio before she was seen it wasnt the hired muscle who spotted her first luther her fathers old rottweiler guard dog ambled across the patio to greet lise she pushed his head aside to keep him from muzzling her crotch made him settle for a head scratch the guard rollmeyer hand on his holstered gun butt hit her with the beam of his flashlight smiled when he recognized who she was part of his job was forestalling interruptions so he walked over to her without calling out lise hadnt been sure about what would happen when she got to this point couldnt know who the guard would be or how he would react to her how much he might know she had gone over several possibilities and decided to let the guard lead the way into this wilderness didnt know you was here maam rollmeyer kept his voice low standing close beside her on the soft sand theyre going to be a while yet you want me to take you around front let you in that way the house is so hot ill wait out here until theyre finished she had her hand inside her bag trading the automatic for something more appropriate to the situation been a long time rollmeyer talk to me howve you been cant complain hand in the bag she wrapped her fingers around the wooden handle of the hotel ice pick dont you have a hug for an old friend rollmeyer whose job was to follow orders and whose inclination was to cop any feel he could seemed confused for just a moment then he opened his big arms and took a step toward her she used the forward thrust of his body to help drive the ice pick up into his chest holding on to the handle she could feel his heart beating around the slender blade pump pump pump before he realized something had happened to him by then it was too late she stepped back withdrawing the blade met his dumb gaze for another threecount watched the dark trickle spill from the tiny hole in his shirt before he fell face down his eyes were still open sugared with grains of white sand when she left him luther stayed close to her his bulk providing a shield while she lay on her belly beside the pool and rinsed away rollmeyers blood from her glove and from the ice pick with the dog she ducked back into the shelter of the oleander hedge to watch the meeting proceed inside creatures of habit her husband and the congressman were holding to schedule by the time lise arrived they had eaten dinner in the elegant dining room and the housekeeper had cleared the table leaving the two men alone with coffee and brandy genteel preliminaries over lises husband went to the silver closet and brought out a large briefcase which he set on the table he opened the case and smiling like santa turned it to show the contents to the congressman showed them to lise also in the reflection in the mirror over the antique sideboard money in bank wrappers threequarters of a million dollars of it the going price for a crucial vote on the federal level the vote in question of course having to do with permits for vegasstyle casinos on tribal land there was a toast with brandy snifters handshakes then goodbyes once business had been taken care of she knew her husband would leave immediately and the congressman would stay over for his special treat lise dropped low behind the hedge when her husband smiling still crossed the patio and headed for the garage she had the in firing position in case he came looking for rollmeyer but he didnt he went straight to the garage started his rolls as soon as he was out of sight lise moved quickly her husband would back down the drive to the road and signal the call girl who was waiting there in her own car the call girl who always came as part of the congressmans package lise knew she had to be finished within the time it would take for the whore to drive into the vacant slot in the garage freshen her makeup spray on new perfume plump her cleavage and walk up to the house with luther lumbering at her side lise crept into the dining room through the patio door just as her husbands lights cleared the corner of the house the congressman had already closed his case of booty and set it on the floor was just finishing his brandy when she stepped onto the deep carpet lise dear he said surprised but not displeased to see her he rose and held out his arms toward her i had not expected the pleasure of your company lise said nothing as she walked up within a few feet of him her toe was touching the case full of money when she raised the took aim the way her father had taught her and fired a round into the congressmans chest followed it as her father had taught her with a shot into the center of his forehead luther startled by the noise began to bark the housekeeper in the kitchen made ah ah noises and dropped something on the floor lise tucked the gun under the congressmans chest picked up the case of money and left behind the hedge again lise waited for the call girl to walk in and help the housekeeper make her discovery the timing was good both women faced each other from their respective doorways shocked pale within seconds of the shooting through the quiet moonless night lise walked back to the hotel along the same sandy path she stowed the case behind a planter near the pool and continued onward a block to place a call rollmeyer would be a complication but the police could explain him any way they wanted to lise dialled theres been a shooting she said she gave the address identified the congressman as the victim and her husband as the shooter then she went to another phone further down the street and made a similar call to the press and to the local tv station when she heard the first siren heading up the road to the house she was mailing an unsigned note to the detective who had investigated her fathers death five years ago a note that explained exactly why her husband and the congressman were meeting in the desert in the middle of the summer and what her husbands motives might be for murder for two murders and why the bullets taken from the congressman should be compared with the two taken from her father and where the assets were hidden chapter and verse a fitting eulogy for a man who would never again see much open sky whose every movement would be monitored in a place where punishment came swiftly where he would never ever have a key to his own door or the right to make the game plans trapped for the rest of his life when the note was out of her hand she finally took off the surgical gloves lise raised her face to catch a breeze that was full of sweet clean desert air looked up at the extravagance of stars in the moonless sky and yawned it was over agenda efficiently covered meeting adjourned on her way back to the hotel lise stopped at an allnight drugstore and bought an ice cream bar with some of henry lebeaus money she ate it as she walked the manager was standing in front of the hotel watching the police and the paramedics speed past when lise strolled up big fuss lise stood on the sidewalk with the manager and finished her ice cream you told me it was dead around here this time of year its dead all right the manager laughed her dry lizard laugh lot of old folks out here bet you one just keeled over lise watched with her until the coroners van passed them then she took the manager by the arm and walked inside with her lise saw the light of excitement still dancing in the managers dark eyes lise herself was too keyed up to think about sleep so she said i have another bottle of wine in my room lets say we have a little nightcap talk about crooks and the good old days death of a snowbird j a jance judith ann jance b was born in watertown south dakota and educated at the university of arizona and bryn mawr she now lives in bellevue washington before taking up writing she worked as a high school teacher indian school librarian and insurance salesperson her fathers profession in an interview with rylla goldberg speaking of murder volume ii she credits her family background with her ability to promote her mystery novels effectively i started in sales early homemade jewelry girl scout cookies newspaper subscriptions and alloccasion greeting cards in our family selling was everybodys business with my mother dishing out the leads about new people in town over the breakfast table once my first book was published i took up where my mother left off jances two series feature seattle police detective j p beaumont beginning with until proven guilty and arizona sheriff joanna brady beginning with desert heat she has also written nonfiction for children on such topics as parental kidnapping sexual molestation and family alcoholism she remarked to contemporary authors volume new revision series writing has provided a means of rewriting my own history both in terms of the childrens books and the murder thrillers the childrens books confront difficult issuesthe murder thrillers are escapist fare with no redeeming social value that last statement though presumably facetious invites a response how could a story as entertaining and as unpredictable and as sensitive in its depiction of senior citizens as death of a snowbird lack redeeming social value agnes barkley did the dishes she always did the dishes after breakfast after lunch after dinner for fortysix years she had done them maybe always was a slight exaggeration certainly there must have been a time or two when she had goofed off when she had just rinsed them and stacked them in the sink to await the next meal but mostly she kept the sink clear and the dishes dried and put away where they belonged it was her job part of her job back home in westmont illinois the single kitchen window was so high overhead that agnes couldnt see out at all here in oscars rv the sink was situated directly in front of an eyelevel window agnes could stand there with her hands plunged deep in warm sudsy dishwater and enjoy the view while doing her chores she occasionally caught sight of hawks circling in a limitless blue sky in the evening she reveled in the flaming sunsets with their spectacular orange glows that seemed to set the whole world on fire even after years of coming back time and again she wasnt quite used to it every time agnes looked out a january window she couldnt help being amazed there before her instead of chicagos gray leaden cloud cover and bonechilling cold she found another world the wideopen brown desert landscape topped by a vast expanse of sunny blue sky agnes couldnt get over the clean clear air she delighted in the crisp hardedged shadows left on the ground by the desert sun and she loved the colors when some of her neighbors back home had wondered how she could stand to live in such a barren ugly place three months out of the year agnes had tried in vain to explain the lovely contrast of newly leafed mesquite against a red rockbound earth her friends had looked at her sympathetically smiled shaken their heads and said she was crazy and in truth she was crazy about the desert agnes loved the stark wild plants that persisted in growing despite a perpetual lack of moisture the spiny leggy ocotillos and the sturdy lowgrowing mesquite the majestic saguaro the cholla with its glowing halo of dangerous thorns she loved catching glimpses of desert wildlife coyotes and jackrabbits and kangaroo rats she even loved the desert floor itself the smooth sands and rocky shales the expanses of rugged reds and soothing roundrocked grays all of which over the great visible distances would fade to uniform blue at first she had been dreadfully homesick for westmont but now all that had changed agnes barkleys love affair with the desert was such that had she been in charge their snowbird routine would have been completely reversed they would have spent nine to ten months out of the year in arizona and only two or so back home in illinois no one could have been more surprised by this turn of events than agnes barkley herself when oscar had first talked about retiring from the post office and becoming a snowbird about buying an rv and wintering in arizona agnes had been dead set against it she had thought she would hate the godforsaken place and she had done her best to change oscars mind as if anyone could do that in the end she had given in gracefully as she had in every other aspect of her married existence agnes put the best face on it she could muster and went along for the ride just as oscar must have known she would after fortysix years of marriage there werent that many surprises left in the past she would have grudgingly tolerated whatever it was oscar wanted and more or less pretended to like it but when it came to arizona no pretense was necessary agnes adored the place once they got out of mesa that is oscar couldnt stand mesa either he said there were too many old people there what do you think you are agnes had been tempted to ask him although she never did because the truth of the matter was agnes agreed with him and for much the same reason it bothered her to see all those senior citizens more or less locked up in the same place year after year the park itself was nice enough with a pool and all the appropriate amenities still it made agnes feel claustrophobic somehow especially when for two years running their motor home was parked next to that of a divorced codger who snored so loudly that the racket came right through the walls into the barkleys own bedroom even with the rvs air conditioner cranked up and running full blast so they set out to find someplace else to park their rv someplace a little off the beaten track as oscar said thats how they had ended up in tombstone the town too tough to die outside the town too tough to die was more like it the trailer park thats what they called it the ok trailer park overnighters welcome was several miles out of town the individual lots had been carved out of the desert by terracing up the northern flank of a steep hillside whoever had designed the place had done a good job of it each site was far enough below its neighbor that every rv or trailer had its own unobstructed view of the hillside on the opposite side of a rocky draw the western horizon boasted the huachuca mountains to the east were the wheststones and beyond those the chiricahuas the views of those distant purple mountain majesties were what agnes barkley liked most about the ok trailer park the views and the distances and the clear clean air and the idea that she didnt have to go to sleep listening to anyone snoring anyone other than oscar that is she was used to him yoohoo aggie anybody home gretchen dixon tapped on the doorframe she didnt bother to wait for agnes to answer before shoving open the door and popping her head inside ready for a little company agnes took one last careful swipe at the countertop before wringing out the dishrag and putting it away under the sink what are you up to gretchen at seventynine gretchen dixon was given to chartreuse tank tops and dayglo bermuda shorts a color combination that showed off her tanned hide to best advantage she wore her hair in a lank pageboy that hadnt changed other than color for forty years it was one of fates great injustices that someone like gretchen who had spent years soaking ultraviolet rays into her leathery skin should be walking around bareheaded and apparently healthy while dr forsythe aggies physician back home in westmont after burning off a spot of skin cancer had forbidden aggie to venture outside at all without wearing sunblock and a hat agnes barkley and gretchen dixon were friends but there were several things about gretchen that annoyed hell out of agnes the main one at this moment was the fact that despite the midday sun gretchen was bareheaded agnes loathed hats gretchen lounged against the cupboard door and shook a cigarette out of a pack she always kept handy in some pocket or other so wheres that worthless husband of yours she asked not that gretchen was really all that interested in knowing oscars whereabouts she didnt like oscar much and the feeling was mutual rather than being worried about their mutual antipathy agnes found it oddly comforting in fact it was probably a very good idea to have friends your husband didnt exactly approve of years earlier there had been one or two of aggies friends that oscar had been crazy about too much so in fact with almost disastrous results for all concerned tramping around looking for arrowheads as per usual aggie said out along the san pedro i think he and jim rathbone went off together right after lunch theyll be back in time for supper that figures gretchen said disdainfully rolling her eyes and blowing a plume of smoke high in the air as she slipped into the bench by the table aggie she said do you realize youre the only woman around here who still cooks three square meals a day breakfast lunch and dinner why not agnes objected i like to cook gretchen shook her head you dont understand aggie it gives all the rest of us a bad name you maybe ought to let oscar know that hes not the only one whos retired it wouldnt kill the man to take you into town once in a while he could buy you a nice dinner at the wagon wheel or at one of those newer places over on allen street oscar doesnt like to eat anybody elses cooking but mine aggie said gretchen was not impressed he likes your cooking because hes cheap oscars so tight his farts squeak agnes barkley laughed out loud gretchen dixon was the most outrageous friend she had ever had agnes liked to listen to gretchen just to hear what words would pop out of her mouth next even so agnes couldnt let gretchens attack on oscar go unchallenged after all he was her husband you shouldnt be so hard on him she chided youd like him if you ever spent any time with him how can i spend time with the man gretchen returned sarcastically whenever im around him all he does is grouse about how it isnt ladylike for women to smoke oscar was raised a southern baptist agnes countered oscar barkley was raised under a rock agnes changed the subject would you like some lemonade a cup of coffee aggie barkley im not your husband i didnt come over here to have you wait on me hand and foot the way you do him i came to ask you a question the senior citizens in town have chartered a bus to go up to phoenix to the heard museum day after tomorrow me and dolly ann parker and lola carlson are going to go we were wondering if youd like to come along you mean oscar and me no i mean you silly aggie barkley by her own little lonesome its an overnight well be staying someplace inexpensive especially if we all four bunk in a single room so you see there wouldnt be any place for oscar to sleep besides itll be fun just us girls think about it itll be like an oldfashioned slumber party remember those agnes was already shaking her head oscar would never let me go never in a million years let gretchen yelped as though the very word wounded her do you mean to tell me that at your age you have to ask that man for permission to be away from home overnight not really its just that say youll go then the bus is filling up fast and dolly ann needs to call in our reservation by five this afternoon where did you say its going gretchen grinned triumphantly and ground out her cigarette in the ashtray agnes had unobtrusively slipped in front of her the heard museum in phoenix its supposed to be full of all kinds of indian stuff artifacts and baskets and all like that im not that wild about indians myself i can take them or leave them but the trip should be fun agnes thought about it for a minute she didnt want gretchen to think she was a complete stickinthemud if its only overnight i suppose i could go thats my girl gretchen said ill go right home and call dolly ann she stood up and started briskly toward the door then paused and turned back to agnes by the way have you ever played strip poker me agnes barkley croaked strip poker never hold your breath honey because youre going to learn the trick is to start out wearing plenty of clothes to begin with so if you lose some it doesnt matter with that gretchen dixon was out the door her flipflops slapping noisily on the loose gravel as she headed down the hill toward her own mobile parked two doors away agnes sat at the table stunned they would be playing strip poker what on earth had she let herself in for agnes wasnt so sure she had said yes outright but she certainly had implied that she would go she could have jumped up right then swung the door open and called out to gretchen that shed changed her mind but she didnt instead she just sat there like a lump until she heard gretchens screen door slam shut behind her in the silence that followed agnes wondered what oscar would say it wasnt as though she had never left him alone for years she had spent one weekend in may three whole days at a womens bible study retreat held each year at the ymca camp at lake zurich north of buffalo grove and always before she left she had cooked and frozen and labeled enough food to last two weeks rather than three days all oscar and the girls ever had to do was thaw it out and heat it up well a bible study retreat at a ymca camp and four old ladies sitting around playing strip poker in a cheap hotel room werent exactly the same thing but oscar didnt need to know about the poker part of it actually the idea of agnes going off someplace with gretchen dixon and her pals might be enough to set oscar off all by itself and what if it did agnes barkley asked herself with a sudden jolt of selfdetermination sauce for the goose and sauce for the gander right after all she never balked at the idea of him going off and spending hours on end wandering all over the desert with jimmy rathbone that windy old crony of his did she so if oscar barkley didnt like the idea of her going to phoenix with gretchen he could just as well lump it that was what agnes thought at two oclock in the afternoon but by evening she had softened up some not that shed changed her mind she was still determined to go but shed figured out a way to ease it past oscar as always her first line of attack was food she made his favorite dinner italian meat loaf with baked potatoes and frozen frenchcut green beans a tossed salad with her own homemade thousand island dressing and a lemon meringue pie for dessert agnes never failed to be amazed by the amount of food she could coax out of that little galleysized kitchen with its tiny oven and stove all it took was a little talent for both cooking and timing dinner was ready at six but oscar wasnt home he still wasnt there at six thirty or seven oclock either finally at seven fifteen with the meat loaf tough and dry in the cooling oven and with the baked potatoes shrivelled to death in their wrinkled crusty skins agnes heard oscars honda crunch to a stop outside the rv by then agnes had pushed the plates and silverware aside and was playing a game of solitaire on the kitchennook table when oscar stepped in through the door agnes didnt even glance up at him sorry im so late aggie he said pausing long enough to hang his jacket and john deere cap in the closet i guess we just got a little carried away with what we were doing i just guess you did she returned coolly with an apprehensive glance in her direction oscar hurried to the kitchen sink rolled up his sleeves and began washing his hands it smells good he said it probably was once she replied i expect itll be a little past itsprime by the time i get it on the table sorry he muttered again deliberately one line of cards at a time she folded the solitaire hand away and then moved the dishes and silverware back to their respective places sit down and get out of the way she ordered there isnt enough room for both of us to be milling around between the stove and the table while im trying to put food on the table obediently oscar sank into the bench while agnes shifted the lukewarm food from the stove to the table he struggled his way out of the nylon fanny pack he customarily wore on his walking jaunts agnes wasnt paying that much attention to what he was doing but when she finished putting the last serving bowl on the table and went to sit down she found a small earthen pot sitting next to her plate agnes had seen mexican ollas for sale at various curio shops on their travels through the southwest this one was shaped the same way most ollas were with a rounded base and a small narrownecked lip but most of those commercial pots were generally unmarked and made of a smooth reddishbrown clay this was much smaller than any of the ones she had ever seen for sale it was gray almost black with a few faintly etched white markings dimly visible whats that she asked sitting down at her place and leaning over so she could get a better view of the pot aggie honey oscar said i believe you are looking at a winning lottery ticket agnes barkley sat up and stared across the tiny tabletop at her husband it wasnt like oscar to make jokes working in the post office all those years had pretty well wrung all the humor out of the manbut when she saw his face agnes was startled oscar was actually beaming he reminded her of the grinning young man who had been waiting beside the altar for her fortysix years earlier it doesnt look like any lottery ticket ive ever seen agnes answered with a disdainful sniff have some meat loaf and pass it before it gets any colder agnes he said not moving a finger toward the platter you dont understand i think this is very important very valuable i found it today down along the san pedro just south of saint david theres a place where one of last winters floods must have caused a cavein this pot was just lying there in the sand sticking up in the air and waiting for someone like me to come along and pick it up agnes regarded the pot with a little more respect you think its old then very and it could be worth a lot of money tons of money well maybe not tons oscar barkley never allowed himself to indulge in unnecessary exaggeration but enough to make our lives a whole lot easier its just a little chunk of clay why would it be worth money because its all in one piece dummy he replied with certainty agnes was so inured to oscars customary arrogance that she didnt even notice it much less let it bother her if you read archaeology or discovery or national geographic once in a while he continued or if you even bothered to look at the pictures youd see that stuff like this is usually found smashed into a million pieces people have to spend months and years fitting them all back together agnes reached out to pick up the pot she had planned on examining it more closely but as soon as she touched it she inexplicably changed her mind and pushed it aside it still doesnt look like all that much to me she said now if youre not going to bother with the meat loaf would you please go ahead and pass it the grin disappeared from oscars face he passed the platter without another word agnes saw at once that she had hurt his feelings usually just a glimpse of that wounded look on his face would have been enough to melt her heart and cause her to make up with him but tonight for some reason she still felt too hurt herself agnes was in no mood for making apologies by the way she said a few minutes later as she slathered margarine on a stonecold potato gretchen and dolly ann invited me to come up to phoenix with them on a senior citizen bus tour the day after tomorrow i told them id go oh for how long oscar asked just overnight why do you have a problem with that no no problem at all he said it so easily it slipped out so smoothly that for a moment agnes almost missed it you mean you dont mind if i go then oscar focused on her vaguely as though his mind was preoccupied with something far away oh no he said not at all you go right ahead and have a good time just one thing though agnes gave him a sharp look whats that dont mention a word about this pot to anyone not gretchen not dolly ann this is yours and jimmys little secret i suppose agnes asked oscar shook his head jimmy was a good half mile down the river when i found it he said i brushed it off and put it straight in my pack he doesnt even know i found it and im not going to tell him either after all im the one who found it if it turns out to be worth something theres no sense in splitting it with someone who wasnt any help at all in finding it do you think agnes thought about that for a moment no she said finally i dont suppose there is the meat loaf tasted like old shoe leather the potatoes were worse when chewed the green beans snapped tastelessly against their teeth like so many boiled rubber bands oscar and agnes picked at their food with little interest no appetite and even less conversation finally agnes stood up and began clearing away the dishes how about some lemon pie she offered conciliatory at last at least thats supposed to be served cold they went to bed right after the ten oclock news ended on tv oscar fell asleep instantly planted firmly in the middle of the bed and snoring up a storm while agnes clung to her side of the mattress and held a pillow over her ear to help shut out some of the noise eventually she fell asleep as well it was close to morning when the dream awakened her agnes was standing on a small knoll watching a young child play in the dirt the child apparently a little girl wasnt one of agnes barkleys own children both of her girls were fairskinned blondes this child was brownskinned with a mane of thick black hair and white shiny teeth the child was bathed in warm sunlight laughing and smiling she spun around and around kicking up dirt from around her looking for all the world like a childsized dust devil dancing across the desert floor suddenly for no clear reason the scene darkened as though a huge cloud had passed in front of the sun somehow sensing danger agnes called out to the child come here quick the little girl looked up at her and frowned but she didnt seem to understand the warning agnes was trying to give and she didnt move agnes heard the sound then heard the incredible roar and rush of water and knew that a flash flood was bearing down on them from somewhere upstream come here she cried again more urgently this time now the child looked up at agnes once more and then she glanced off to her side her eyes widened in terror at the sight of a solid wall of murky brown water twelve to fourteen feet high churning toward her the little girl scrambled to her feet and started away darting toward agnes and safety but then when she was almost out of harms way she stopped turned and went back she was bending over to retrieve something from the dirt something small and round and black when the water hit agnes watched in helpless horror while the water crashed over her within seconds the child was swept from view agnes awakened drenched in sweat just as she had years before when she was going through the change of life long after her heart quit pounding the vivid alltooreal dream stayed with her was that where the pot had come from she wondered had the pots owner some small indian child no one in westmont ever used the term native american been swept to her death before her mothers horrified eyes and if it was true if what agnes had seen in the dream had really happened it must have been a long time ago how was it possible that it could be passed on to her to a rocksolid lutheran lady from illinois one not given to visions or wild flights of imagination agnes crawled out of bed without disturbing the sleeping oscar she fumbled on her glasses then slipped into her robe and went to the bathroom when she emerged she stopped by the kitchen table where the pot sitting by itself was bathed in a shaft of silver moonlight it seemed to glow and shimmer in that strange pearlescent light but rather than being frightened of it agnes found herself drawn to it without thinking she sat down at the table pulled the pot toward her and let her fingers explore its smooth cool surface how did you go about forming such a pot agnes wondered where did you find the clay how was it fired what was it used for there were no answers to those questions but agnes felt oddly comforted simply by asking them a few minutes later she slipped back into bed and slept soundly until well after her usual time to get up and make coffee two nights later at the hotel in phoenix agnes barkley was down to nothing but her bra and panties when gretchen dixons irritated voice brought her back to herself well gretchen demanded do you want a card or not aggie either get in the game or get out agnes put down her cards im out she said im not very good at this i cant concentrate we should have played hearts instead lola offered strip hearts isnt all the same thing as strip poker gretchen snapped how many cards two lola answered agnes got up and pulled on her nightgown and robe she had followed gretchens advice and started the game wearing as many clothes as she could manage it hadnt helped although she was usually a quick study at games she was hopeless when it came to the intricacies of poker and now with the room aswirl in a thick cloud of cigarette smoke she was happy to be out of the game agnes opened the sliding door and slipped out onto the tiny balcony although the temperature hovered in the low forties it wasnt that cold not compared to chicago in january in fact it seemed downright balmy she looked out at the sparse traffic waiting for the light on grand avenue and heard the low constant rumble of trucks on the black canyon freeway behind her the roar reminded her once more of the noise the water had made as it crashed down around the little girl and overwhelmed her although she wasnt cold agnes shivered and went back inside she propped three pillows behind her then sat on the bed with a book positioned in front of her face the other women may have thought she was reading but she wasnt agnes barkley was thinking about flash floods remembering the real one she and oscar had seen last winter january had been one of the wettest ones on record the fillin manager at the trailer park commuted from benson he had told them one afternoon that a flood crest was expected over by saint david shortly and that if they hurried it would probably be worth seeing they had been standing just off the bridge at saint david when the wall of water came rumbling toward them pushing ahead of it a jumbled collection of tires and rusty car fenders and even an old refrigerator which bobbed along in the torrent as effortlessly as if it were nothing more than a bottle cork floating in a bathtub agnes barkleys dream from the other night that still too vivid dream might very well have been nothing more than a holdover from that but she was now convinced it was more than that especially after what shed learned that day at the heard museum just as gretchen dixon had told her the museum had been loaded with what agnes now knew enough to call native american artifacts baskets pottery beadwork their group had been led through the tour by a fasttalking docent who had little time or patience for dawdlers or questions afterward while the others milled in the gift shop or lined up for refreshments agnes made her way back to one display in particular where she had seen a single pot that very closely resembled the one she had last seen sitting on the kitchen table of the rv the display was a mixture of tohono oothham artifacts some of the basketry was little more than fragments and just as oscar had mentioned the pots all showed signs of having been broken and subsequently glued back together what drew agnes to this display was not only the pot but also the typed legend on a nearby wall which explained how upon the death of the potmaker her pots were always destroyed lest her spirit remain trapped forever in that which she had made oscars pot was whole but surely the person who had crafted it was long since dead could the potmakers spirit somehow still be captured inside that little lump of blackened clay had the mother made that tiny pot as some kind of plaything for her child was that what had made it so precious to the little girl did that explain why she had bolted back into the path of certain death in a vain attempt to save it and had the mothers restless spirit somehow managed to create a vision in order to convey the horror of that terrible event to agnes as she stood staring at the lit display in the museum thats how agnes came to see what had happened to her she hadnt dreamed a dream so much as she had seen a vision and now two days later with the book positioned in front of her face and with the threehanded poker game continuing across the room agnes tried to sort out what it all meant and what she was supposed to do about it the poker game ended acrimoniously when lola and dolly ann both with next to nothing on accused the fully dressed gretchen of cheating the other three women were still arguing about that when they came to bed not wanting to be drawn into the quarrel agnes closed her eyes and feigned sleep long after the others were finally quiet agnes lay awake puzzling about her responsibility to a woman she had never seen but through whose eyes she had witnessed that ancient and yet all too recent drowning the child swept away in the rolling brown water was not agnes barkleys own child yet the indian childs death grieved agnes as much as if she had been one of her own it was growing light by the time agnes reached a decision and was finally able to fall asleep the tour bus seemed to take forever to get them back to tombstone oscar came to town to meet the bus and pick agnes up he greeted her with an exultant grin on his face and with an armload of library books sliding this way and that in the back seat of the honda i took a quick trip up to tucson while you were gone he explained they made an exception and let me borrow these books from the university library wait until i show you i dont want to see agnes replied you dont why not i pored over them half the night and again this morning until my eyes were about to fall out of my head that pot of ours really is worth a fortune youre going to have to take it back agnes said quietly take it back oscar echoed in dismay whats the matter with you have you gone nuts or something all we have to do is sell the pot and well be on easy street from here on out that pot is not for sale agnes asserted youre going to have to take it right back where you found it and break it shaking his head oscar clamped his jaw shut slammed the car in gear and didnt say another word until they were home at the trailer park and had dragged both the books and agnes barkleys luggage inside what in the hell has gotten into you oscar demanded at last his voice tight with barely suppressed anger agnes realized she owed the man some kind of explanation theres a womans spirit caught inside that pot she began we have to let her out the only way to do that is to break the pot otherwise she stays trapped in there forever thats the craziest bunch of hocuspocus nonsense i ever heard whered you come up with something like that it sounds like something that fruitcake gretchen dixon would come up with you didnt tell her about this did you no i read about it in a display at the museum but i think i already knew it even before i saw it there you already knew it oscar sneered whats that supposed to mean are you trying to tell me that the spirit whos supposedly trapped in my pot is telling you i have to break it thats right and put it back where you found it like hell i will oscar growled he stomped outside and stayed there making some pretense of checking fluids under the hood of the honda oscar may have temporarily abandoned the field of battle but agnes knew the fight was far from over she sat down and waited it was two oclock in the afternoon time to start some arrangements about dinner but she didnt make a move toward either the stove or the refrigerator for fortysix years things had been fine between them every time a compromise had been required agnes had made it cheerfully and without complaint that was the way it had always been and it was the way oscar expected it to be now but this time this one time agnes barkley was prepared to stand firm this one time she wasnt going to bend oscar came back inside half an hour later look he said his manner amiable and apologetic im sorry i flew off the handle you didnt know the whole story because i didnt have a chance to tell you while i was up in tucson i made some preliminary inquiries about the pot anonymously of course hypothetically i ended up talking to a guy who runs a trading post up near oracle hes a dealer and he says he could get us a ton of money youll never guess how much how much one hundred thou free and clear thats what comes to us after the dealers cut and thats at a bare minimum he says that if the collectors all end up in a bidding war the price could go a whole lot higher than that do you have any idea what we could do with that kind of money i dont care how much money it is agnes replied stubbornly it isnt worth it weve got to let her out oscar shes been trapped in there for hundreds of years trapped oscar demanded ill tell you about trapped trapped is having to go to work every day for thirty years rain or shine hoping some goddamned dog doesnt take a chunk out of your leg trapped is hoping like hell you wont slip and fall on someones icy porch and break your damned neck trapped is always working and scrimping and hoping to put enough money together so that someday we wont have to worry about outliving our money and now just when its almost within my grasp you he broke off in midsentence they were sitting across from each other in the tiny kitchen nook agnes met and held oscars eyes her gaze serene and unwavering he could see that nothing he said was having the slightest effect suddenly it was all too much how could agnes betray him like that oscar lunged to his feet his face contorted with outraged fury so help me aggie he raised his hand as if to strike her for one fearful moment agnes waited for the blow to fall it didnt instead oscars eyes bulged the unfinished threat died in his throat the only sound that escaped his distorted lips was a strangled sob slowly like a giant oldgrowth tree falling victim to a loggers saw oscar barkley began to tip over stiff and still like a cigar store indian he tottered toward the wall and then bounced against the cupboard only then did the sudden terrible rigidity desert his body his bones seemed to turn to jelly disjointed and limp he slid down the face of the cupboard like a lifeless raggedy andy doll only when he landed on the floor was there any sound at all and that was nothing but a muted thump like someone dropping a waisthigh bag of flour agnes watched him fall and did nothing later when the investigators asked her about the tenminute interval between the time oscars broken watch stopped and the time the call came in to the emergency communications center she was unable to explain them not that ten minutes one way or another would have made that much difference oscar barkleys one and only coronary episode was instantly fatal oh he had been warned to cut down on fat to lower his cholesterol but oscar had never been one to take a doctors advice very seriously the day after the memorial service gretchen dixon popped her head in the door of the rv just as agnes clad in jeans a flannel shirt and a straw hat was tying the strings on her tennis shoes how are you doing gretchen asked im fine agnes answered mechanically really i am you look like youre going someplace agnes nodded toward the metal box of ashes the mortician had given her im going out to scatter the ashes she said oscar always said he wanted to be left along the banks of the san pedro would you like me to go along gretchen asked no thank you ill be fine is someone else going with you then the girls maybe they caught a plane back home early this morning dont tell me that rascal jimmy rathbone is already making a move on you im going by myself agnes answered firmly i dont want any company oh gretchen said sorry when agnes barkley drove the honda away from the rv a few minutes later it looked as though she was all alone in the car but strangely enough she didnt feel alone and although oscar hadnt told agnes exactly where along the riverbank he had found the pot it was easy for agnes to find her way there almost as though someone were guiding each and every footstep as soon as she reached the crumbled wall of riverbank agnes barkley fell to her knees it was quiet there with what was left of the river barely trickling along in its sandy bed some thirty paces behind her the only sound was the faint drone of a davismonthan air force base jet flying far overhead part of agnes heard the sound and recognized it for what it was an airplane another part of her jumped like a startled hare when what she thought was a bee turned out to be something totally beyond her understanding and comprehension when agnes had arrived home with oscars ashes she had immediately placed the pot inside the metal container now with fumbling fingers she drew it out for one long moment she held it lovingly to her breast then with tears coursing down her face she smashed the pot to pieces smashed it to smithereens on the metal container that held oscar barkleys barely cooled ashes now agnes snatched up the container holding it in front of her she let the contents cascade out as she spun around and around imitating someone else who once had danced exactly the same way in this very place sometime long long ago at last losing her balance agnes barkley fell to the ground gasping and out of breath minutes later she realized as if for the first time that oscar was gone really gone and there amid his scattered ashes and the broken potsherds she wept real tears not only because oscar was dead but also because she had done nothing to help him because she had sat there helplessly and watched him die as surely as that mysterious other woman had watched the surging water overwhelm her child at last agnes seemed to come to herself when she stopped crying she was surprised to find that she felt much better relieved somehow maybe it was just as well oscar was dead she thought he would not have liked being married to both of them to agnes and to the ghost of that other woman to the mother of that poor drowned child this is the only way it could possibly work agnes said to herself she picked up a tiny piece of black pottery held it between her fingers and let it catch the full blazing light of the warm afternoon sun this was the only way all three of them could be free the river mouth lia matera from the time of wilkie collins a large number of crime fiction writers have been drawn from the ranks of lawyers but the past twenty years have seen a veritable flood of attorneys hoping to escape the billablehour rat race and emulate the success of john grisham and scott turow for a time legal fiction and indeed the practice of law itself was largely a male province but recent years have changed that lia matera b who was born in canada to an italianamerican family received her law degree from the university of californias hastings college of law where she was the editor in chief of the hastings constitutional law quarterly she was later a teaching fellow at stanford law school the author of two separate series about lawyer sleuths matera is one of the best of the lawyersturnedmysterywriters her first series beginning with where lawyers fear to tread which draws on her background as a law review editor introduces willa jansson the daughter of fiercely leftwing parents the family political background gives a political charge to the series that often results in widely divergent critical reaction as contemporary authors volume points out in a discussion of hidden agenda though a reviewer for publishers weekly felt that the novel is angry and devoid of humor or emotions other than hate a booklist critic praised the novel as offbeat and very funny the smart money began a shorter series about a sharperedged higherprofile advocate laura dipalma matera has written relatively few short stories and several of those few were originally envisioned as novels all her stories to date are collected in counsel for the defense and other stones in introducing that collection she identifies the river mouth an outdoor account of gathering menace as among those stories that have given her a welcome break from writing about lawyers to reach the mouth of the klamath river you head west off just south of the oregon border you hike through an old yurok meeting ground an overgrown glade with signs asking you to respect native spirits and stay out of the cooking pits and the splitlong amphitheater the trail ends at a sand cliff from there you can watch the klamath rage into the sea battering the tide waves break in every direction foam blowing off like rising ghosts sea lions by the dozens bob in the swells feeding on eels flushed out of the river my boyfriend and i made our way down to the wetclay beach the sky was every shade of gray and the pacific looked like mercury we were alone except for five yurok in rubber boots and checkered flannel fishing in the surf we watched them flick stiff whips of sharpened wire mounted on pick handles when the tips lashed out of the waves they had eels impaled on them with a rodeo windup they flipped the speared fish over their shoulders into pockets theyd dug in the sand we passed shallow pits seething with creatures that looked like short meanfaced snakes we continued for maybe a quarter mile beyond the river mouth we climbed some small sharp rocks to get to a tall flat one midway between the shore and the cliff from there we could see the fishermen but not have our conversation carry down to them our topic of the day we go to the beach to hash things out was if we wanted to get married because it was a big intimidating topic wed driven almost four hundred miles to find the right beach wed had to spend the night in a tacky motel but this was the perfect spot no question patrick uncorked the champagne we had two bottles it was likely to be a long talk i set out the canned salmon and crackers on paper plates on the old blue blanket i kicked off my shoes so i could cross my legs i watched pat pour wondering where wed end up on the marriage thing when he handed me the paper cup of bubbles i tapped it against his to marriage or not to i do or i dont he agreed the air smelled like cold beach like wet sky and slick rocks and storms coming at home the beach stinks like fish and shored seaweed buzzing with little flies if there are sunbathers on blankets you can smell their beer and coconut oil so pat i looked him over trying to imagine being married to him he was a freckly babyfaced scot with strange hair and hardly any meat on him whereas i was a blackhaired mutt who tended to blimp out in the winter and get it back under control in the summer but the diets were getting harder and i knew fat women couldnt be choosers i was thinking it was time to lock in and worrying that was an unworthy motive maybe were fine the way we are now right away he frowned i just mean its okay with me the way it is because you were married to mr perfect and how could i ever take his place heartyhar mr perfect meaning my exhusband had plenty of money and good clothes pat had neither right now hed just got laid off and there were a thousand other software engineers answering every ad he did i guess he wasnt an inyourface child pat added aha here we had last nights fight with mr perfect you didnt even have arguments he knew when to stop me and pat fight on long drives i say things i dont necessarily mean them it was too soon to call the caterer i guess i held out my paper cup for more all i meant was he had more experience dealing with oh it goes without saying he poured refills so fast they bubbled over im a mere infant about as cleanly as a teenager and as advanced in my political analysis as a college freshman what is this a retrospective of old fights okay so it takes some adjustment living with a person ive said things in crabby moments on the drive up crabby moments you no youre an artist you could have wrung the scorn out of the word and still had it drip sarcasm realitys just more complicated for you i felt my eyes narrow i hate that patrick oh shes calling me patrick usually i got formal when i got mad im not in the best mood when i write if you could just learn to leave me alone then like i said in the car his pale brows pinched as he flaked salmon onto crackers i made a show of shading my eyes and watching a yurok woman walk toward us when she got to the bottom of our rock she called up got a glass for me usually we were antisocial which is why we did our drinking at the beach instead of in bars but the conversation wasnt going the greatest a diversion a few minutes to chill why not sure i said pat hit me with the angrybull look face lowered brows down nostrils flared as she clattered up the rocks he muttered i thought we came here to be alone hi there she said reaching the top she was slim maybe forty with long brown hair and a semiflat nose and darkish skin just light enough to show some freckles she had a great smile but bad teeth she wore a black hat almost like a cowboys but not as western she sat on a wet part of the rock to spare our blanket whatever funk was on her jeans as if we cared picnic huh great spot i answered yeah because pat was sitting in pissy silence she drank some champagne not many people know about this beach you expecting other folks no were pretty far from home this is off the beaten path all right she glanced over her shoulder waving at her friends we had to hike through yurok land to get here i admitted almost elven and that wonderful little amphitheater i felt embarrassed didnt know how to assure her we hadnt been disrespectful id had to relieve myself behind a bush but we didnt do war cries or anything insensitive i hope it isnt private property i hope this beach isnt private nah thatd be a crime against nature wouldnt it she grinned theres a trailer park up the other way that is private property but as long as you go out the way you came in no problem thanks thats good to know we heard about this beach on our last trip north but we didnt have a chance to check it out we didnt expect all the seals or anything best time of year eels come upriver to spawn in the ocean swim twentyfive hundred miles some of them she explained its a holy spot for the yurok the river mouth a break in the clouds angled light under her hat brim showing leathery lines around her eyes this place is about mouths really in the river the eel is the king mouth he hides he waits he strikes fast but time comes when hes got to heed that urge and he swims right into the jaws of the sea lion yup she motioned behind her here and now this is the eels judgment day pat was giving me crabby little getridofher looks i ignored him okay we had a lot to talk about but what are the odds of a realmccoy yurok explaining the significance of a beach she lay on her side on the blanket holding out her paper cup for a refill and popping some salmon into her mouth salmon means renewal she said carrying on the life cycle all that you should try the salmon jerky from the rancheria pat hesitated before refilling her cup i let him fill mine too king mouth of the river thats the eel she repeated of course the eel rivers named after him but its the klamath thats his castle theyll stay alive out of water longer than any other fish i know you see them flash that ugly graygreen in the surf and thwack you get them on your whipstick and flip them onto the pile you do that awhile you know and get maybe fifteen and when you go back to put them in your bucket maybe eight of the little monsters have managed to jump out of the pit and crawl along the sand you see how far some of them got and you have to think they stayed alive a good half hour out of the water now hows that possible i lay on my side too sipping champagne listening watching the gorgeous spectacle behind her in the distance seals bobbing and diving the river crashing into the sea waves colliding like hands clapping her yurok buddies werent fishing anymore they were talking one gestured toward our rock i kind of hoped theyd join us except pat would really get cranky then maybe i did go too far on the drive up but i wished hed let it go so its not much of a surprise huh the woman continued that theyre king of the river theyre mean and tough they got teeth like nails if they were bigger man sharks wouldnt stand a chance never mind seals she squinted at me sipping because the cussed things can hide right in the open their siltbark color they can sit right in front of a rock forget behind it they can look like part of the scenery and you swim by feeling safe and cautious whoever you are maybe some fancy fish swum upriver and munch youre eel food but the river ends somewhere you know what i mean every river has its mouth theres always that bigger mouth out there waiting for you to wash in no matter how sly and bad you are at home you heed those urges and leave your territory and youre dinner pat was tapping the bottom of my foot with his tapping tapping urgently like i should do something thats when i made up my mind forget marriage he was too young didnt want to hear this yurok woman talk and was tapping on me like make her go away mom i had kids two of them and they were grown now and out of the house and not much later their dad went too though i didnt miss him and i did miss the kids at least sometimes and i didnt need someone fifteen years younger than me always putting the responsibility on me i paid most of the bills got the food together didnt cook but knew my delis picked up around the house told pat what he should read because engineers dont know squat about literature or history and every time someone needed getting rid of or something social had to be handled or even just a business letter had to be written it was taptaptap oh maggie could you please i reached behind me and shoved pats foot away if he wanted to be antisocial he could think of a way to make the woman leave himself we had plenty of time to talk just the two of us i didnt want her to go yet got any more the yurok asked i pulled the second bottle out of our beatup backpack and opened it trying not to look at pat knowing hed have that hermity scowl now bigtime you picnic like this pretty often she asked yeah we always keep stuff in the trunk wine canned salmon crackers gives us the option that was the other side of it pat was fun and he let me have control if i said lets go he said okay that means everything if you spent twenty years with a stickinthemud you come here a lot she asked no this was a special trip it was supposed to be pat fussed i hastily added our beaches down around santa cruz and monterey are nice but weve been to them a thousand times mmm she let me refill her cup i had more too pat didnt seem to be drinking now the sea lion is a strange one she said theres little it wont eat and not much it wont do to survive but it has no guile it swims along dodedo and has a bite whenever it can it doesnt hide or trick its lazy if it can find a place to gorge itll do that and forget about hunting it doesnt seem to have the hunting instinct it just wants to eat and swim and jolly around mate be playful she broke another piece of salmon off holding it in fingers with silt and sand under the nails whereas an eel is always lurking even when its just eaten it never just cavorts its always thinking ahead like a miser worrying how to get more until it leaves home and washes into the sea lions mouth i concluded the thought for her what the eel needsshe sat upis a way to say hell no here it is the smarter stealthier creature and what does nature do but use its own instinct against it favor some fat lazy thing thats not even a fish its a mammal that lives in the water that doesnt really belong and yet has food poured down its gullet just for being in the right place she pointed at the sea lion heads bobbing in the waves look at them this is their welfare cafeteria they do nothing but open their mouths pat put in you could say youre like the seals youre out there with those steelpronged things spearing eels i wanted to hit him it seemed a rude thing to say the yurok are like the eels she removed her hat her dark hair flattened on top began to blow in the wind coming off the water the yurok were king because the yurok knew how to blend in the yurok thought always of food for tomorrow because yurok nightmares were full of yesterdays starvation the yurok were part of the dark bottom of historys river silent and ready and they got swept out into the bigger mouths that waitedwithout deserving she leaped to her feet she looked majestic her hair blowing against a background of graywhite clouds her arms and chin raised to the heavens this is where the ancient river meets the thing that is so much bigger the thing the eel cant bear to understand because the knowledge is too bitter behind me pat whispered this is weird look at her friends on the beach the yurok men raised their arms too they stood just like the woman maybe imitating her to tease her maybe just coincidence where the ancient river meets the thing that is much bigger and the eel cant understand because the knowledge is too bitter she repeated to the sky pat was poking me now hardly bothering to whisper i dont like this shes acting crazy i smacked him with an absentminded hand behind my back like a horse swatting off a fly maybe this was too much for a software engineer why had i ever thought i could marry someone as unlyrical as that but it was a writers dream it was realdeal yurok lore if she quit because of him id push pats unimaginative damn butt right off the rock she shook her head from side to side hair whipping her cheeks at the mouth of the river you learn the truth follow your obsession and the current carries you into a hundred waiting mouths but if you lie quietshe bent forward so i could see her bright dark eyesand think passionately of trapping your prey if your hunger is a great gnawing within you immobilizing you until the moment when you become a rocket of appetite to consume what swims near what do they want pats shadow fell across the rock i turned to see that he was standing now staring down the beach at the yurok men theyd taken several paces toward us they seemed to be watching the woman she was on a roll didnt even notice then you dont ride the river into the idle mouth the appetite without intelligence the hunger that happens without knowing itself pats anoraked arm reached over me and plucked the paper cup from her hand you better leave now what is your problem patrick i jumped to my feet big damn kid jesus christ scared by legends by champagne talk on a beach mellow the hell out my words wiped the martial look off his face a marveling betrayal replaced it you think youre so smart maggie you think you know everything but youre really just a sheltered little housewife i was too angry to speak i maybe hadnt earned much over the years but i was a writer his lips compressed his eyes squinted his whole freckled scots face crimped with wronged frustration but i guess the mature one has seen more than a child like myself i guess it takes an artist to really know life oh for christ sake i spoke the words with both arms and my torso are you such a whitebread baby you cant hear a little bit of yurok metaphor without freaking out he turned began to clamber down the rock he was muttering i caught the words princess and know everything as well as some serious profanity i turned to find the yurok woman sitting on the blanket drinking sedately her posture unabashedly terrible i remained standing for a few minutes watching patrick jerk along the beach fists buried in his pockets he doesnt want my friends to join us she concluded correctly from the look of it he was marching straight over to tell them so the men stood waiting a hundred yards behind them desperate eels wriggled from their sand pits like the rays of a sun i had a vision of roasting eels with the yuroks learning their legends as the waves crashed beside us what a child pat was just because wed fought a bit in the car i know why he thinks im crazy the woman said i sat with a sigh pulling another paper cup out of the old backpack and filling it i handed it to her feeling like shit so what if the men wanted to join us for a while patrick and i had the rest of the afternoon to fight maybe the rest of our lives we came out here to decide if we should get married i told her i could feel tears sting my eyes but the trouble is hes still so young hes only seven years older than my oldest daughter he doesnt have his career together he just got laid off hes been moping around all month getting in my way hes an engineer i met him when i was researching a sciencefiction story all he knows about politics and literature is what ive made him learn i wiped the tears hes grown a lot in the last year since weve been together but its not like being with an equal i mean we have a great time unless we start talking about something in particular and then i have to put up with all these halfbaked collegestudent kind of ideas i have to give him articles to read and tell him how to look at things i mean yes hes smart obviously and a quick learner but fifteen years you know she nibbled a bit more salmon probably he saw the van on the road coming down what van our group theyurok she wrinkled her nose no theyre up in hoopa on the reservation whats left of them theyre practically extinct we assumed you were yurok youre all so dark you know how to do that whipspear thing yeah were all darkhaired she rolled her eyes but jeez theres only five of us youre darkhaired youre not yurok her expression brightened but the whipstick thats yurok youre right our leadershe pointed to the notyuroks on the beach i wasnt sure which onemade them were having an outofculture experience you could say patrick had reached the group now was standing with his shoulders up around his ears and his hands still buried in his pockets how did you all get so good at it good at it she laughed the surfs absolutely crawling with eels if we were good at it wed have hundreds of them whats the group patricks hands were out of his pockets now he held them out in front of him as he began backing away from the four men you didnt see the van really maybe pat did i was reading the map i rose to my knees watching him patrick was still backing away picking up speed up here showing fear of a ranting woman hed seemed ridiculous down on the beach with four longhaired men advancing toward him his fear arguably had some basis what had they said to him the van scares people she nodded the slogans we painted on it who are you i asked her eyes still locked on patrick i was going to say before your fiance huffed out what about the sea lions they get fat with no effort just feasting on the selfenslaved blacksouled little eels do they get away with it the sky was beginning to darken the sea was pencillead gray now with a bright silver band along the horizon patrick was running toward us across the beach two of the men started after him i tried to rise to my feet but the woman clamped her hand around my ankle no she said the sea lions arent happy very long theyre just one more fat morsel in the food chain offshore there are sharks plenty of them the mightiest food processors of all this is their favorite spot for sea lion sushi what are they doing what do your friends want my voice was as shrill as the wind whistling between the rocks the yurok were the eels kings of the river stealthy and quick and hungry but the obsessions of history washed them into the jaws of white men who played and gorged in the surf she nodded the ancient river meets the thing that is much bigger the thing the eel cant bear to understand because the knowledge is too bitter shed said that more than once almost the same way maybe thats what scared pat her words were like a litany an incantation some kind of cultish chant and the men below had mirrored her gestures i knocked her hand off my ankle and started backward off the rock all shed done was talk about predation shed learned we were alone and not expecting company and shed signaled to the men on the beach now they were chasing patrick afraid to realize what it meant too rattled to put my shoes back on i stepped into a slick crevice i slid losing my balance i fell racketing over the brutal jags and edges of the smaller rocks wed used as a stairway i could hear patrick scream my name i felt a lightning burn of pain in my ribs hip knee i could feel the hot spread of blood under my shirt i tried to catch my breath to stand up the woman was picking her way carefully down to where i lay theres another kind of hunter maggie i could hear the grin in her voice not the eel who waits and strikes not the seal who finds plenty and feeds but the shark she stopped silhouette poised on the rock stair who thinks of nothing but finding food who doesnt just hide like the eel or wait like the sea lion but who quests and searches voraciously looking for another patrick screamed but not my name this time looking for a straggler again she raised her arms and her chin to the heavens letting her dark hair fly around her patrick was right she did look crazy she jumped down patrick screamed again we screamed together finally in agreement i heard a sudden blast and knew it must be gunfire i watched the woman land in a straddling crouch her hair in wild tendrils like eels wriggling from their pits oh patrick let me turn back the clock and say im sorry i looked up at the woman thinking too late too late i rode the river right into your jaws another shot did it hit pat a voice from the sand cliff boomed get away the woman looked up and laughed she raised her arms again throwing back her head a third blast sent her scrambling off the small rocks kicking up footprints in the sand as she ran away she waved her arms as if to say goodbye i sat painfully forward id cracked a rib broken some skin i could feel it nevertheless i twisted to look up the face of the cliff in the blowing grass above me a stocky man with long black hair fired a rifle into the air a real yurok pat and i learned later a scandal in winter gillian linscott gillian linscott b was born in windsor england the daughter of a shoe shop manager and a shop assistant holding an oxford degree in english language and literature she worked as a newspaper journalist in liverpool and birmingham between and moved to the guardian manchester and london until then turned to broadcast journalism reporting on parliament for the british broadcasting corporation for which she has also written radio plays her first novel a healthy grave was set in a nudist camp and introduced her shortlived series character birdie linnet a former policeman whom she described to contemporary authors volume as being no super sleuth in facthe is remarkable chiefly for getting the point later than anybody else on the page hes wellmeaning none too intelligent and frequently hit on the head as this description suggests linscott does not take the detectivestory form too seriously liking it because its not pompous in my view there are few books that couldnt be improved by dumping a body in them somewhere the mystery novel is a very artificial creation and im not greatly concerned with realism linscott achieved her greatest renown as well as possibly greater realism when she moved from contemporary whodunnits to historical first with murder i presume set in the s then with the series about earlytwentiethcentury suffragette nell bray beginning with sister beneath the sheets one prominent subcategory of historical mystery fiction is the sherlock holmes pastiche once relatively rare and for whatever reason usually written by men in recent years following the bestselling success of nicholas meyers sevenpercent solution new holmes novels have become a cottage industry and several original anthologies have been filled with shorter adventures for the baker street sleuth some of the best of these have been written by women including the work of l b greenwood at novel length and june thomson in a series of shortstory collections with her knowledge of the victorian and edwardian eras linscott was a natural to write a holmes pastiche a scandal in winter one of the best stories in the christmas sherlockian anthology holmes for the holidays gains some of its freshness and originality from the use of a narrator other than dr watson at first silver stick and his square bear were no more to us than incidental diversions at the hotel edelweiss the edelweiss at christmas and the new year was like a sparkling white desert island or a very luxurious ocean liner sailing through snow instead of sea there we were a hundred people or so cut off from the rest of the world even from the rest of switzerland with only each other for entertainment and company it was one of the only possible hotels to stay at in for this new fad of winter sporting the smaller berghaus across the way was not one of the possible hotels so its dozen or so visitors hardly counted as for the villagers in their wooden chalets with the cows living downstairs they didnt count at all occasionally on walks amanda and i would see them carrying in logs from neatly stacked woodpiles or carrying out forkfuls of warm soiled straw that sent columns of white steam into the blue air they were part of the valley like the rocks and pine trees but they didnt ski or skate so they had no place in our world apart from the sleighs there were two of those in the village one a sober affair drawn by a stolid bay cob with a few token bells on the harness brought guests and their luggage from the nearest railway station the other the one that mattered to amanda and me was a streak of black and scarlet swift as the mountain wind clamorous with silver bells drawn by a sleek little honeycolored haflinger with a silvery mane and tail that matched the bells a pleasure sleigh with no purpose in life beyond amusing the guests at the edelweiss wed see it drawn up in the trampled snow outside the handsome young owner with his long whip and blond mustache waiting patiently sometimes wed be allowed to linger and watch as he helped in a lady and gentleman and adjusted the white fur rug over their laps then away theyd go hissing and jingling through the snow into the track through the pine forest amanda and i had been promised that as a treat on new years day we would be taken for a ride in it we looked forward to it more eagerly than christmas but that was ten days away and until then we had to amuse ourselves we skated on the rink behind the hotel we waved goodbye to our father when he went off in the mornings with his skis and his guide we sat on the hotel terrace drinking hot chocolate with blobs of cream on top while mother wrote and read letters when we thought mother wasnt watching amanda and i would compete to see if we could drink all the chocolate so that the blob of cream stayed marooned at the bottom of the cup to be eaten in luscious and impolite spoonfuls if she glanced up and caught us mother would tell us not to be so childish which since amanda was eleven and i was nearly thirteen was fair enough but we had to get what entertainment we could out of the chocolate the truth was that we were all of us most of the time bored out of our wits which was why we turned our attention to the affairs of the other guests and amanda and i had our ears permanently tuned to the small dramas of the adults conversation i still cant believe she will well thats what the headwaiter said and he should know shes reserved the table in the corner overlooking the terrace and said they should be sure to have the tokay the same table as last year the same wine too our parents looked at each other over the croissants carefully not noticing the maid as she poured our coffee one doesnt notice the servants dear it only makes them awkward im sure its not true any woman with any feeling what makes you think she has any silence as eye signals went on over our heads i knew what was being signaled just as id known what was being discussed in an overheard scrap of conversation between our parents at bedtime the night we arrived effect it might have on jessica my name i came rapidly out of drowsiness kept my eyes closed but listened i dont think we need worry about that jessicas tougher than you think my mothers voice she needed us to be tough so that she didnt have to waste time worrying about us all the same she must remember it it is only a year ago that sort of experience can mark a child for life darling they dont react like we do theyre much more callous at that age even with eyes closed i could tell from the quality of my fathers silence that he wasnt convinced but it was no use arguing with mothers certainties they switched the light off and closed the door for a minute or two i lay awake in the dark wondering whether i was marked for life by what id seen and how it would show then i wondered instead whether id ever be able to do pirouettes on the ice like the girl from paris and fell asleep in a wistful dream of bells and the hiss of skates the conversation between our parents that breakfast time over what she would or wouldnt do was interrupted by the little stir of two other guests being shown to their table amanda caught my eye silver stick and his square bear are going skiing both gentlemen elderly gentlemen as it seemed to us but they were probably no older than their late fifties were wearing heavy wool jumpers tweed breeches and thick socks just as father was he nodded to them across the tables wished them good morning and received nods and goodmornings back even the heavy sports clothing couldnt take away the oddity and distinction from the tall man he was i think the thinnest person id ever seen he didnt stoop as so many tall older people did but walked upright and lightly his face with its eagles beak of a nose was deeply tanned like some of the older inhabitants of the village but unlike them it was without wrinkles apart from two deep folds from the nose to the corners of his mouth his hair was what had struck us most it clung smoothly to his head in a cap of pure and polished silver like the knob on an expensive walking stick his companion large and square shouldered in any case looked more so in his skiing clothes he shambled and tended to trip over chairs he had a round amiable face with pale rather watery eyes a clipped gray mustache but no more than a fringe of hair left on his gleaming pate he always smiled at us when we met on the terrace or in corridors and appeared kindly wed noticed that he was always doing things for silver stick pouring his coffee posting his letters for this reason wed got it into our heads that square bear was silver sticks keeper amanda said silver stick probably went mad at the full moon and square bear had to lock him up and sing loudly so that people wouldnt hear his howling she kept asking people when the next full moon would be but so far nobody knew i thought hed probably come to switzerland because he was dying of consumption which explained the thinness and square bear was his doctor i listened for a coughing fit to confirm this but so far thered been not a sign of one as they settled to their breakfast we watched as much as we could without being rebuked for staring square bear opened the paper that had been lying beside his plate and read things out to silver stick who gave the occasional little nod over his coffee as if hed known whatever it was all the time it was the times of london and must have been at least two days old because it had to come up from the station in the sleigh amanda whispered he eats the waiter had brought a rack of toast and a stone jar of oxford marmalade to their table instead of croissants silver stick was eating toast like any normal person father asked who eats we indicated with our eyes well why shouldnt he eat you need a lot of energy for skiing mother taking an interest for once said they seemed old for skiing youd be surprised dr watsons not bad but as for the other one well he went past me like a bird in places so steep that even the guide didnt want to try it and stayed standing up at the end of it when most of us would have been just a big hole in the snow the mans so rational hes completely without fear its fear that wrecks you when youre skiing you come to a steep place you think youre going to fall and nine times out of ten you do fall holmes comes to the same steep place doesnt see any reason why he cant do it so he does it my mother said that anybody really rational would have the sense not to go skiing in the first place my ear had been caught by one word square bears a doctor is silver stick ill not that i know is there any more coffee in that pot and there we left it for the while you might say that amanda and i should have known at once who they were and i suppose nine out of ten children in europe would have known but wed led an unusual life mainly on account of mother and although we knew many things unknown to most girls of our age we were ignorant of a lot of others that were common currency we waved off father and his guide as they went wallowing up in the deep snow through the pine trees skis on their shoulders then turned back for our skates we stopped at the driveway to let the sober black sleigh go past the one that went down the valley to the railway there was nobody in the back but the rugs were ready and neatly folded somebody new coming amanda said i knew mother was looking at me but she said nothing amanda and i were indoors doing our holiday reading when the sleigh came back so we didnt see who was in it but when we went downstairs later there was a humming tension about the hotel like the feeling you get when a violinist is holding his bow just above the string and the tingle of the note runs up and down your spine before you hear it it was only midafternoon but dusk was already settling on the valley we were allowed a last walk outside before it got dark and made as usual for the skating rink colored electric lights were throwing patches of yellow red and blue on the dark surface the lame man with the accordion was playing a strauss waltz and a few couples were skating to it though not very well more were clustered round the charcoal brazier at the edge of the rink where a waiter poured small glasses of mulled wine perhaps the man with the accordion knew the dancers were getting tired or wanted to go home himself because when the waltz ended he changed to something wild and gypsy sounding harder to dance to the couples on the ice tried it for a few steps then gave up laughing to join the others round the brazier for a while the ice was empty and the lame man played on to the dusk and the dark mountains then a figure came gliding onto the ice there was a decisiveness about the way she did it that marked her out at once from the other skaters theyd come on staggering or swaggering depending on whether they were beginners or thought themselves expert but staggerers and swaggerers alike had a selfconscious air knowing that this was not their natural habitat she took to the ice like a swan to the water or a swallow to the air the laughter died away the drinking stopped and we watched as she swooped and dipped and circled all alone to the gypsy music there were no showy pirouettes like the girl from paris no folding of the arms and lookatme smiles its quite likely that she was not a particularly expert skater that what was so remarkable about it was her willingness to take the rink the music the attention as hers by right she wasnt even dressed for skating the black skirt coming to within a few inches of the instep of her skate boots the black mink jacket the matching cap were probably what shed been wearing on the journey up from the station but shed been ready for this had planned to announce her return exactly this way her return at first absorbed by the performance i hadnt recognized her id registered that she was not a young woman and that she was elegant it was when a little of my attention came back to my mother that i knew she was standing there as stiff and prickly as one of the pine trees staring at the figure on the ice like everybody else but it wasnt admiration on her face more a kind of horror they were all looking like that all the adults as if she were the messenger of something dangerous then a womans voice not my mothers said how could she really how could she there was a murmuring of agreement and i could feel the horror changing to something more commonplace social disapproval once the first words had been said others followed and there was a rustling of sharp little phrases like a sledge runner grating on gravel only a yearto come here againno respectlucky not to beafter what happened my mother put a firm hand on each of our shoulders time for your tea normally wed have protested begged for another few minutes but we knew that this was serious to get into the hotel from the ice rink you go up some steps to the back terrace and in at the big glass doors to the breakfast room there were two men standing on the terrace from there you could see the rink and they were staring down at what was happening silver stick and square bear i saw the thin mans eyes in the light from the breakfast room they were harder and more intent than anything id ever seen harder than the ice itself normally being properly brought up wed have said good evening to them as we went past but mother propeled us inside without speaking as soon as shed got us settled at the table she went to find father whod be back from skiing by then i knew theyd be talking about me and felt important but concerned that i couldnt live up to that importance after all what id seen had lasted only a few seconds and i hadnt felt any of the things i was supposed to feel id never known him before it happened apart from seeing him across the dining room a few times and i hadnt even known he was dead until they told me afterward what happened at dinner that evening was like the ice rink only without gypsy music that holiday amanda and i were allowed to come down to dinner with our parents for the soup course after the soup we were supposed to say good night politely and go up and put ourselves to bed people whod been skating and skiing all day were hungry by evening so usually attention was concentrated discreetly on the swing doors to the kitchen and the procession of waiters with the silver tureens that night was different the focus of attention was one small table in the corner of the room beside the window a table laid like the rest of them with white linen silver cutlery goldbordered plates and a little array of crystal glasses a table for one an empty table my father said looks as if shes funked it cant say i blame her my mother gave him one of her be quiet looks announced that this was our evening for speaking french and asked me in that language to pass her some bread if i pleased i had my back to the door and my hand on the breadbasket all i knew was that the room went quiet dont turn round my mother hissed in english i turned round and there she was in black velvet and diamonds her hair with more streaks of gray than i remembered from the year before was swept up and secured with a pearlanddiamond comb the previous year before the thing happened my mother had remarked that she was surprisingly slim for a retired opera singer this year she was thin cheekbones and collarbones above the black velvet bodice sharp enough to cut paper she was inclining her elegant head toward the headwaiter probably listening to words of welcome he was smiling but then he smiled at everybody nobody else smiled as she followed him to the table in the far the very far corner you could hear the creak of necks screwing themselves away from her no entrance she ever made in her stage career could have been as nerveracking as that long walk across the hotel floor in spite of the silent commands now radiating from my mother i could no more have turned away from her than from blondin crossing niagara falls my disobedience was rewarded as disobedience so often is because i saw it happen in the middle of that silent dining room amid a hundred or so people pretending not to notice her i saw silver stick get to his feet among all those seated people he looked even taller than before his burnished silver head gleaming like snow on the matterhorn above that rock ridge of a nose below it the glacial white and black of his evening clothes square bear hesitated for a moment then followed his example as in her lonely walk she came alongside their table silver stick bowed with the dignity of a man who did not have to bow very often and again square bear copied him less elegantly square bears face was red and flustered but the other mans hadnt altered she paused for a moment gravely returned their bows with a bend of her white neck then walked on the silence through the room lasted until the headwaiter pulled out her chair and she sat down at her table then as if on cue the waiters with their tureens came marching through the swinging doors and the babble and the clash of cutlery sounded as loud as war starting at breakfast i asked mother why did they bow to her i knew it was a banned subject but i knew too that i was in an obscurely privileged position because of the effect all this was supposed to be having on me i wondered when it would come out like secret writing on a laurel leaf you keep close to your chest to warm it when i was fourteen eighteen dont ask silly questions and you dont need two lumps of sugar in your caf√© au lait father suggested a trip to the town down the valley after lunch to buy christmas presents it was meant as a distraction and it worked to an extent but i still couldnt get her out of my mind later that morning when i was supposed to be having a healthy snowball fight with boring children i wandered away to the back terrace overlooking the ice rink i hoped that i might find her there again but it was occupied by noisy beginners slithering and screeching i despised them for their ordinariness id turned away and was looking at the back of the hotel thinking no particular thoughts when i heard footsteps behind me and a voice said was that where you were standing when it happened it was the first time id heard silver sticks voice at close quarters it was a pleasant voice deep but clear like the sea in a cave he was standing there in his rough tweed jacket and cap with earflaps only a few yards away from me square bear stood behind him looking anxious neck muffled in a woolen scarf i considered looked up at the roof again and down to my feet yes it must have been about here holmes dont you think we should ask this little girls mother she might my mother wasnt there i was perhaps id learnt something already about taking the center of the stage the thought came to me that it would be a great thing if he bowed to me as hed bowed to her quite so he didnt bow but he seemed pleased you see watson miss jessica isnt in the least hysterical about it are you i saw that he meant that as a compliment so i gave him the little inclination of the head that id been practicing in front of the mirror when amanda wasnt looking he smiled and there was more warmth in the smile than seemed likely from the height and sharpness of him i take it that you have no objection to talking about what you saw i said graciously not in the very least then honesty compelled me to spoil it by adding only i didnt see very much its not how much you saw but how clearly you saw it i wonder if youd kindly tell dr watson and me exactly what you saw in as much detail as you can remember the voice was gentle but there was no gentleness in the dark eyes fixed on me i dont mean they were hard or cruel simply that emotion of any sort had no more part in them than in the lens of a camera or telescope they gave me an odd feeling not fear exactly but as if id become real in a way i hadnt quite been before i knew that being clear about what id seen that day a year ago mattered more than anything id ever done i closed my eyes and thought hard i was standing just here i was waiting for mother and amanda because we were going out for a walk and amanda had lost one of her fur gloves as usual i saw him falling then he hit the roof over the dining room and came sliding down it the snow started moving as well so he came down with the snow he landed just over there where that chair is and all the rest of the snow came down on top of him so you could only see his arm sticking out the arm wasnt moving but i didnt know he was dead a lot of people came running and started pushing the snow away from him then somebody said i shouldnt be there so they took me away to find mother so i wasnt there when they got the snow off him i stopped short of breath square bear was looking ill at ease and pitying but silver sticks eyes hadnt changed when you were waiting for your mother and sister which way were you facing the rink i was watching the skaters quite so that meant you were facing away from the hotel yes and yet you saw the man falling yes what made you turn round id no doubt about that it was the part of my story that everybody had been most concerned with at the time he shouted shouted what shouted no when did he shout it i hesitated nobody had asked me that before because the answer was obvious when he fell of course but at what point during his fall i take it that it was before he landed on the roof over the dining room or you wouldnt have turned round in time to see it yes and you turned round in time to see him in the air and falling holmes i dont think you should oh do be quiet watson well miss jessica yes he was in the air and falling and hed already screamed by then so at what point did he scream i wanted to be clever and grownup to make him think well of me i suppose it was when she pushed him out of the window it was square bears face that showed most emotion he screwed up his eyes went red and made little imploring signs with his furmittened hands causing him to look more bearlike than ever this time the protest was not at his friend but at me silver stick put up a hand to stop him saying anything but his face had changed too with a sharp v on the forehead the voice was a shade less gentle when who pushed him out of the window his wife mrs mcevoy i wondered whether to add the woman you bowed to last night but decided against it did you see her push him no did you see mrs mcevoy at the window no and yet you tell me that mrs mcevoy pushed her husband out of the window why everybody knows she did i knew from the expression on square bears face that id gone badly wrong but couldnt see where he kindly man must have guessed that because he started trying to explain to me you see my dear after many years with my good friend mr holmes yet again he was waved into silence miss jessica dr watson means well but i hope he will permit me to speak for myself its a fallacy to believe that age in itself brings wisdom but one thing it infallibly brings is experience will you permit me from my experience if not from my wisdom to offer you a little advice i nodded not gracious now just awed then my advice is this always remember that what everybody knows nobody knows he used that voice like a skater uses his weight on the blade to skim or turn you say everybody knows that mrs mcevoy pushed her husband out of the window as far as i know you are the only person in the world who saw mr mcevoy fall and yet as youve told me you did not see mrs mcevoy push him so who is this everybody who can claim such certainty about an event which as far as we know nobody witnessed its miserable not knowing answers what is nineteen times three what is the past participle of the verb faire i wanted to live up to him but unwittingly hed pressed the button that brought on the panic of the schoolroom i blurted out he was very rich and she didnt love him and now shes very rich and can do what she likes again the bears fur mitts went up scrabbling the air again he was disregarded so mrs mcevoy is rich and can do what she likes does it strike you that shes happy holmes how can a child know i thought of the gypsy music the gleaming dark fur the pearls in her hair i found myself shaking my head no and yet she comes here again exactly a year after her husband died the very place in the world that youd expect her to avoid at all costs she comes here knowing what people are saying about her making sure everybody has a chance to see her holding her head high have you any idea what that must do to a woman this time square bear really did protest and went on protesting how could he expect a child to know about the feelings of a mature woman how could i be blamed for repeating the gossip of my elders really holmes it was too much this time too silver stick seemed to agree with him he smoothed out the v shape in his forehead and apologized let us if we may return to the surer ground of what you actually saw i take it that the hotel has not been rebuilt in any way since last year i turned again to look at the back of the hotel as far as i could see it was just as it had been the glass doors leading from the dining room and breakfast room onto the terrace a tiled sloping roof above them then joined onto the roof the three main guest floors of the hotel the top two floors were the ones that most people took because they had wroughtiron balconies where on sunny days you could stand to look at the mountains below them were the smaller rooms they were less popular because being directly above the kitchen and dining room they suffered from noise and cooking smells and had no balconies silver stick said to square bear that was the room they had last year top floor second from the right so if he were pushed hed have to be pushed over the balcony as well as out of the window that would take quite a lot of strength wouldnt you say the next question was to me he asked if id seen mr mcevoy before he fell out of the window and i said yes a few times was he a small man no quite big the same size as dr watson here for instance square bear straightened his broad shoulders as if for military inspection he was fatter younger or older quite old as old as you are square bear made a chuffing sound and his shoulders slumped a little so we have a man about the same age as our friend watson and heavier difficult wouldnt you say for any woman to push him anywhere against his will perhaps she took him by surprise told him to lean out and look at something then swept his legs off the floor that wasnt my own theory the event had naturally been analyzed in all its aspects the year before and all the parental care in the world couldnt have kept it from me a touching picture shall we come back to things we know for certain what about the snow was there as much snow as this last year i think so it came up above my knees last year it doesnt quite this year but then ive grown square bear murmured theyll keep records of that sort of thing just so but were also grateful for miss jessicas calibrations may we trouble you with just one more question i said yes rather warily youve told us that just before you turned round and saw him falling you heard him shout no what sort of no was it i was puzzled nobody had asked me that before was it an angry no a protesting no the kind of no youd shout if somebody were pushing you over a balcony the other man looked as if he wanted to protest again but kept quiet the intensity in silver sticks eyes would have frozen a brook in midbabble when i didnt answer at once he visibly made himself relax and his voice went softer its hard for you to remember isnt it everybody was so sure that it was one particular sort of no that theyve fixed their version in your mind i want you to do something for me if you would be so kind i want you to forget that dr watson and i are here and stand and look down at the ice rink just as you were doing last year i want you to clear your mind of everything else and think that it really is last year and youre hearing that shout for the first time will you do that i faced away from them first i looked at this years skaters then i closed my eyes and tried to remember how it had been i felt the green itchy scarf round my neck the cold getting to my toes and fingers as i waited i heard the cry and it was all i could do not to turn round and see the body tumbling again when i opened my eyes and looked at them they were still waiting patiently i think ive remembered and what sort of no was it it was clear in my mind but hard to put into words itit was as if hed been going to say something else if hed had time not just no no something no something what more silence while i thought about it then a prompt from square bear could it have been a name my dear dont put any more ideas into her head you thought he was going to say something after the no but you dont know what is that it yes like no running or no cakes today only that wasnt it something you couldnt do or something not there like the cakes yes something like that only it couldnt have been could it couldnt if something happened in a particular way then it happened and theres no could or couldnt about it it was the kind of thing governesses said but he was smiling now and i had the idea that something id said had pleased him i see your mother and sister coming so im afraid we must end this very useful conversation i am much obliged to you for your powers of observation will you permit me to ask you some more questions if any more occur to me i nodded is it a secret do you want it to be holmes i dont think you should encourage this young lady my dear watson in my observation theres nothing more precious you can give a child to keep than a secret my mother came across the terrace with amanda silver stick and square bear touched their hats to her and hoped we enjoyed our walk when she asked me later what wed been talking about i said theyd asked whether the snow was as deep last year and hugged the secret of my partnership i became in my imagination eyes and ears for him at the childrens party at teatime on christmas eve the parents talked in low tones believing that we were absorbed in the presentgiving round the hotel tree but it would have taken more than the porter in red robe and white whiskers or his largesse of three wooden geese on a string to distract me from my work i listened and stored up every scrap against the time when hed ask me questions again and i watched mrs mcevoy as she went round the hotel through christmas eve and christmas day pale and upright in her black and her jewels trailing silence after her like the long train of a dress my call came on boxing day there was another snowball fight in the hotel grounds for parents as well this time i stood back from it all and waited by a little clump of bare birches and sure enough silver stick and square bear came walking over to me ive found out a lot about her i said have you indeed he was her second husband she had another one she loved more but he died of a fever it was when they were visiting egypt a long time ago ten years ago silver sticks voice was remote he wasnt even looking at me she got married to mr mcevoy three years ago most people said it was for his money but there was an american lady at the party and she said mr mcevoy seemed quite nice when you first knew him and he was interested in music and singers so perhaps it was one of those marriages where people quite like each other without being in love you know i thought id managed that rather well id tried to make it like my mother talking to her friends and it sounded convincing in my ears i was disappointed at the lack of reaction so brought up my big guns only she didnt stay liking him because after they got married she found out about his eye his eye a reaction at last but from square bear not silver stick i grabbed for the right word and clung to it roving it was a roving eye he kept looking at other ladies and she didnt like it i hoped theyd understand that it meant looking in a special way i didnt know myself exactly what special way but the adults talking among themselves at the party had certainly understood but it seemed id overestimated these two because they were just standing there staring at me perhaps silver stick wasnt as clever as id thought i threw in my last little oddment of information something anybody could understand i found out her first name its irene square bear cleared his throat silver stick said nothing he was looking over my head at the snowball fight holmes i really think we should leave jessica to play with her little friends not yet theres something i wanted to ask her do you remember the staff at the hotel last christmas here was a dreadful comedown id brought him a head richly crammed with love money and marriages and he was asking about the domestics perhaps the disappointment on my face looked like stupidity because his voice became impatient the people who looked after you the porters and the waiters and the maids especially the maids theyre the samei think i was running them through my head there was petra with her thick plaits who brought us our cups of chocolate fat renata who made our beds grayhaired ulrike with her limp none left i dont think so then the memory came to me of blond curls escaping from a maids uniform cap and a clear voice singing as she swept the corridors blithe as a bird there was eva but she got married who did she marry franz the man whos got the sleigh it was flying down the drive as i spoke silver bells jangling the little horse gold in the sunshine a good marriage for a hotel maid oh he didnt have the sleigh last year he was only the under porter indeed watson i think we must have a ride in this sleigh will you see the head porter about booking it i hoped he might invite me to go with them but he said nothing about that still he seemed to be in a good temper again although i couldnt see that it was from anything id told him miss jessica again im obliged to you i may have yet another favor to ask but all in good time i went reluctantly to join the snowballers as the two of them walked through the snow back to the hotel that afternoon on our walk they went past us on their way down the drive in franzs sleigh it didnt look like a pleasure trip franzs handsome face was serious and holmes was staring straight ahead instead of turning up toward the forest at the end of the hotel drive they turned left for the village our walk also took us to the village because father wanted to see an old man about getting a stick carved when we walked down the little main street we saw the sleigh and horse standing outside a neat chalet with green shutters next to the church i knew it was franzs own house and wondered what had become of his passengers about half an hour later when wed seen about fathers stick we walked back up the street and there were holmes and watson standing on the balcony outside the chalet with eva the maid from last year her fair hair was as curly as ever but her head was bent she seemed to be listening intently to something that holmes was saying and the droop of her shoulders told me she wasnt happy why is silver stick talking to her amanda very properly was rebuked for staring and asking questions about things that didnt concern her being older and wiser i said nothing but kept my secret coiled in my heart was it eva who pushed him would they lock her up in prison a little guilt stirred along with the pleasure because he wouldnt have known about eva if i hadnt told him but not enough to spoil it later i watched from our window hoping to see the sleigh coming back but it didnt that day instead just before it got dark holmes and watson came back on foot up the drive walking fast saying nothing next morning square bear came up to mother at coffee time i wonder if you would permit miss jessica to take a short walk with me on the terrace mother hesitated but square bear was so obviously respectable and anyway you could see the terrace from the coffee room i put on my hat cape and gloves and walked with him out of the glass doors into the cold air we stood looking down at the rink in exactly the same place as id been standing when they first spoke to me i knew that was no accident square bears fussiness the tension in his voice that he was so unsuccessful in hiding left no doubt of it there was something odd about the terrace too far more people on it than would normally be the case on a cold morning there must have been two dozen or so standing round in stiff little groups talking to each other waiting wheres mr holmes square bear looked at me eyes watering from the cold the truth is my dear i dont know where he is or what hes doing he gave me my instructions at breakfast and i havent seen him since instructions about me before he could answer the scream came it was a mans scream tearing through the air like a saw blade and there was a word in it the word was no i turned with the breath choking in my throat and just as thered been last year there was a dark thing in the air its clothes flapping out round it a collective gasp from the people on the terrace then a soft thump as the thing hit the deep snow on the restaurant roof and began sliding i heard no again and this time it was my own voice because i knew from last year what was coming next the slide down the steep roof gathering snow as it came the flop onto the terrace only a few yards from where i was standing the arm sticking out at first the memory was so strong that i thought that was what i was seeing and it took a few seconds for me to realize that it wasnt happening that way the thing had fallen a little to the side and instead of sliding straight down the roof it was being carried to a little ornamental railing at the edge of it where the main hotel joined onto the annex driving a wedge of snow in front of it then somebody said unbelievingly hes stopped and the thing had stopped instead of plunging over the roof to the terrace it had been swept up against the railing bundled in snow like a cylindrical snowball and stopped within a yard of the edge then it sat up clinging with one hand to the railing covered from waist down in snow if hed been wearing a hat when he came out of the window hed lost it in the fall because his damp hair was gleaming silver above his smiling brown face it was an inward kind of smile as if only he could appreciate the thing that hed done then the chattering started some people were yelling to get a ladder others running the rest were asking each other what had happened until somebody spotted the window wide open three floors above us her window mrs mcevoys window he fell off mrs mcevoys balcony just like last year but he didnt at some point square bear had put a hand on my shoulder now he bent down beside me looking anxiously into my face saying we should go in and find mother i wished hed get out of my way because i wanted to see silver stick on the roof then mother arrived wafting clouds of scent and drama i had to go inside of course but not before id seen the ladder arrive and silver stick coming down it a little stiffly but dignified and one more thing just as he stepped off the ladder the glass doors to the terrace opened and out she came she hadnt been there when it happened but now in her black fur jacket she stepped through the people as if they werent there and gave him her hand and thanked him at dinner that night she dined alone at her table as on the other nights but it took her longer to get to it her long walk across the dining room was made longer by all the people who wanted to speak to her to inquire after her health to tell her how pleased they were to see her again it was as if shed just arrived that afternoon instead of being there for five days already there were several posies of flowers on her table that must have been sent up especially from the town and champagne in a silver bucket beside it silver stick and square bear bowed to her as she went past their table but ordinary polite little nods not like that first night the smile she gave them was like the sun coming up we were sent off to bed as soon as wed had our soup as usual amanda went to sleep at once but i lay awake resenting my exile from what mattered our parents sitting room was next to our bedroom and i heard them come in excited still then soon afterward a knock on the door of our suite the murmur of voices and my father a little taken aback saying yes come in by all means then their voices square bears first fussing with apologies about it being so late then silver sticks cutting through him the fact is youre owed an explanation or rather your daughter is dr watson suggested that we should give it to you so that some time in the future when jessicas old enough you may decide to tell her if id owned a chest of gold and had watched somebody throwing it away in a crowded street i couldnt have been more furious than hearing my secret about to be squandered my first thought was to rush through to the other room in my nightdress and bare feet and demand that he should speak to me not to them then caution took over and although i did get out of bed i went just as far as the door opened it a crack so that i could hear better and padded back to bed there were sounds of chairs being rearranged people settling into them then silver sticks voice i should say at the start for reasons we need not go into that dr watson and i were convinced that irene mcevoy had not pushed her husband to his death the question was how to prove it and in that regard your daughters evidence was indispensable she alone saw mr mcevoy fall and she alone heard what he shouted the accurate ear of childhood once certain adult nonsenses had been discarded recorded that shout as precisely as a phonograph and knew that strictly speaking it was only half a shout that mr mcevoy if hed had time would have added something else to it a pause i sat up in bed with the counterpane round my neck straining not to miss a word of his quiet clear voice no something the question was no what mr mcevoy had expected something to be there and his last thought on earth was surprise at the lack of it surprise so acute that he was trying to shout it with his last breath the question was what that thing could have been silence waiting for an answer but nobody said anything if you look up at the back of the hotel from the terrace you will notice one obvious thing the third and fourth floors have balconies the second floor does not the room inhabited by mr and mrs mcevoy had a balcony a person staying in the suite would be aware of that he would not necessarily be aware unless he were a particularly observant man that the secondfloor rooms had no balconies until it was too late i formed the theory that mr mcevoy had not in fact fallen from the window of his own room but from a lower room belonging to somebody else which accounted for his attempted last words nobalcony my mother gasped my father said by jove once id arrived at that conclusion the question was what mr mcevoy was doing in somebody elses room the possibility of thieving could be ruled out since he was a very rich man then he was seeing somebody the next question was who and here your daughter was incidentally helpful in a way she is too young to understand she confided to us in all innocence an overheard piece of adult gossip to the effect that the late mr mcevoy had a roving eye my father began to laugh then stifled it my mother said well in a way that boded trouble for me later once my attention was directed that way the answer became obvious mr mcevoy was in somebody elses hotel room for what one might describe as an episode of galanterie but the accident happened in the middle of the morning did ever a lady in the history of the world make a romantic assignation for that hour of the day therefore it wasnt a lady so i asked myself what group of people are most likely to be encountered in hotel rooms in midmorning and the answer was good heavens the chambermaid my mothers voice and holmes was clearly none too pleased at being interrupted quite so mr mcevoy had gone to meet a chambermaid i asked some questions to establish whether any young and attractive chambermaid had left the hotel since last christmas there was such a one named eva shed married the under porter and brought him as a dowry enough money to buy that elegant little sleigh now a prudent chambermaid may amass a modest dowry by saving tips but one look at that sleigh will tell you that evas dowry might best be described as wellimmodest another laugh from my father cut off by a look from my mother i could well imagine dr watson and i went to see eva i told her what id deduced and she poor girl confirmed it with some details the sound of the housekeepers voice outside mr mcevoys wellpracticed but illadvised tactic of taking refuge on the balcony you may say that the girl eva should have confessed at once what had happened i do indeed but bear in mind her position not only her post at the hotel but her engagement to the handsome franz would be forfeited and after all there was no question of anybody being tried in court the fashionable world was perfectly happy to connive at the story that mr mcevoy had fallen accidentally from his window while inwardly convicting an innocent woman of his murder my mother said sounding quite subdued for once but mrs mcevoy must have known why didnt she say something ah to answer that one needs to know something about mrs mcevoys history and it so happens that dr watson and i are in that position a long time ago before her first happy marriage mrs mcevoy was loved by a prince he was not i must admit a particularly admirable prince but prince he was can you imagine how it felt for a woman to come from that to being deceived with a hotel chambermaid by a man who made his fortune from bathroom furnishings can you conceive that a proud woman might choose to be thought a murderess rather than submit to that indignity another silence then my mother breathed yes yes i think i can then poor woman it was not pity that irene mcevoy ever needed then in a different tone of voice so there you have it and it is your decision how much if anything you decide to pass on to jessica in due course there were sounds of people getting up from chairs then my father said and your um demonstration this morning oh that little drama i knew what had happened but for mrs mcevoys sake it was necessary to prove to the world she was innocent i couldnt call eva as witness because id given her my word id studied the pitch of the roof and the depth of the snow and i was scientifically convinced that a man falling from mrs mcevoys balcony would not have landed on the terrace you know the result good nights were said rather subdued and they were shown out through the crack in the door i glimpsed them as they came level with the crack silver stick usually so precise in his movements dropped his pipe and had to kneel to pick it up as he knelt his bright eyes met mine through the crack and he smiled an odd quick smile unseen by anybody else hed known id been listening all the time when theyd gone mother and father sat for a long time in silence at last father said if hed got it wrong hed have killed himself like the skiing he must have loved her very much its his own logic he loves but then my mother

the front door unlocked and inside his mother lying in a pool of squid ink on the hardwood floor at the foot of the stairs shed apparently fallen down the steep length of the stairs and broken her neck judging from her twisted upper body shed also been bludgeoned to death the back of her skull caved in with one of her own golf clubs a twoiron but he hadnt seemed to see that immediately squid ink well the blood had looked black in the dim foyer light it was a trick his eyes played on his brain sometimes when hed been studying too hard getting too little sleep an optic tic meaning you see something more or less and valid but it registers surreally in the brain as something else like in your neurological programming theres an occasional bleep in derek peck jrs case confronted with the crumpled lifeless body of his mother this was an obvious symptom of trauma shock the visceral numbness that blocks immediate grief the unsayable the unknowable hed last seen his mother in that same buttercupyellow quilted satin robe that had given her the look of an upright bulky easter toy early that morning before hed left for school hed been away all day and this abrupt weird transition from differential calculus to the body on the floor from the anxietydriven jokes of his math club friends a hard core of them were meeting later weekdays preparing for upcoming sat exams to the profound and terrible silence of the town house that had seemed to him even as hed pushed open the mysteriously unlocked front door a hostile silence a silence that vibrated with dread he crouched over the body staring in disbelief mother mother as if it was he derek whod done something bad he the one to be punished he couldnt catch his breath hyperventilating his heart beating so wildly he almost fainted too confused to think maybe theyre still here upstairs for in his dazed state he seemed to lack even an animals instinct for selfpreservation yes and he felt to blame somehow hadnt she instilled in him a reflex of guilt if something was wrong in the household it could probably be traced back to him from the age of thirteen when his father derek senior had divorced his mother lucille same as divorcing him hed been expected by his mother to behave like a second adult in the household growing tall lank and anxious as if to accommodate that expectation and his sandcolored body hair sprouting and a fevered grimness about the eyes fiftythree percent of dereks classmates girls and boys at the mayhew academy were from families of divorce and most agreed that the worst of it is you have to learn to behave like an adult yet at the same time a lesser adult one deprived of his or her full civil rights that wasnt easy even for stoic streetwise derek peck with an iq of what was it at age fifteen he was seventeen now so his precarious adolescent sense of himself was seriously askew not just his body image his mother had allowed him to become overweight as a small child they say that remains with you forever irremediably imprinted in the earliest brain cells but more crucially his social identity for one minute shed be treating him like an infant calling him her baby her babyboy and the next minute she was hurt reproachful accusing him of failing like his father to uphold his moral responsibility to her this moral responsibility was a backpack loaded with rocks he could feel it first fucking thing in the morning exerting gravity even before he swung his legs out of bed crouched over her now badly trembling shaking as in a cold wind whispering mommy cant you wake up mom my dont be balking at the word dead for it would hurt and incense lucille like the word old not that shed been a vain or frivolous or selfconscious woman for lucille peck was anything but a woman of dignity it was said of her admiringly by women who would not have wished to be her and by men who would not have wished to be married to her mommy dont be old derek would never have murmured aloud of course though possibly to himself frequently this past year or so seeing her wan bigboned and brave face in harsh frontal sunshine when they happened to descend the front steps together in the morning or at that eerie position in the kitchen where the overhead inset lights converged in such a way as to cruelly shadow her face downward bruising the eye sockets and the soft fleshy tucks in her cheeks two summers ago when hed been away for six weeks at lake placid and shed driven to kennedy to pick him up so eager to see him again and hed stared appalled at the harsh lines bracketing her mouth like a pikes and her smile too happy and what he felt was pity and this too made him feel guilty you dont pity your own mother asshole if hed come home immediately after school by four pm instead of a quick call from his friend andys across the park guilty mumbled excuse left on the answering tape mother im sorry guess i wont make dinner tonight okay math club study group calculus dont wait up for me please how relieved hed been midway in his message she hadnt picked up the phone had she been alive when hed called or alreadydead last time you saw your mother alive derek theyd ask and hed have to invent for he hadnt seen her exactly no eye contact and what had he said a rushed schoolday morning a thursday nothing special about it no premonition cold and windy and winterglaring and hed been restless to get out of the house snatched a diet coke from the refrigerator so freezing his teeth ached a blurred reproachful look of mother in the kitchen billowing in her buttercupyellow quilted robe as hed backed out smiling bye mom sure shed been hurt her only son avoiding her shed been a lone woman even in her pride even with her activities that meant so much to her womens art league east side planned parenthood volunteers healthsty fitness center tennis and golf in east hampton in the summer subscription tickets to lincoln center and her friends most of them divorced middleaged women mothers like herself with highschool or collegeage kids lucille was lonely how was that his fault as if his senior year in prep school he had become a fanatic about grades obsessed with early admission to harvard yale brown berkeley just to avoid his mother at that raw unmediated time of day that was breakfast but god how hed loved her he had planning to make it up to her for sure sat scores in the highest percentile hed take her to the stanhope for the champagne brunch then across the street to the museum for a motherson sunday excursion of a kind they hadnt had in years how still she was lying he didnt dare touch her his breathing was short ragged the squidinky black beneath her twisted head had seeped and coagulated into the cracks of the floor her left arm was flung out in an attitude of exasperated appeal the sleeve stained with red her hand lying palmup and the fingers curled like angry talons he might have noted that her movado watch was missing her rings gone except grandmas antique opal with the fluted gold setting the thief or thieves hadnt been able to yank it off her swollen finger he might have noted that her eyes were rolled up asymmetrically in her head the right iris nearly vanished and the left leering like a drunken crescentmoon he might have noted that the back of her skull was smashed soft and pulpy as a melon but there are some things about your mother out of tact and delicacy you dont acknowledge seeing mothers hair thoughit was her only remaining good feature shed said a pale silverybrown slightly coarse a natural colour like wheaties the mothers of his classmates all hoped to be youthful and glamorous with bleached or dyed hair but not lucille peck she wasnt the type you expected her cheeks to be ruddy without makeup and on her good days they were by this time of night lucilles hair should have been dry from her shower of so many hours ago derek vaguely recalled shed had the upstairs bathroom filled with steam the mirrors shortness of breath tickets for some concert or ballet that night at lincoln center lucille and a woman friend but derek didnt know about that or if hed known hed forgotten like about the golf club the twoiron which closet upstairs or down the drawers of lucilles bedroom bureau ransacked his new macintosh carried from his desk then dropped onto the floor by the doorway as if what theyd changed their minds about bothering with it looking for quick cash for drugs thats the motive whats booger up to now whats going down with booger you hear he touched her at last groping for that big artery in the throat cateroid car toid should have been pulsing but wasnt and her skin clammycool his hand leapt back as if hed been burnt jesus fucking christ was it possible lucille was dead and hed be to blame that booger man one wild dude his nostrils flared his eyes leaked tears he was in a state of panic had to get help it was time but he wouldnt have noticed the time would he pm his watch was a sleek blackfaced omega hed bought with his own cash but he wouldnt be conscious of the time exactly by now hed have dialed except thinking confused the phone was ripped out was the phone ripped out or one of them his mothers killers waiting in the darkened kitchen by the phone waiting to kill him he panicked he freaked running back to the front door stumbling and shouting into the street where a taxi was slowing to let out an elderly couple of neighbors from the adjoining brownstone and they and the driver stared at this chalkfaced griefstricken boy in an unbuttoned duffel coat bareheaded running into the street screaming help us help us somebodys killed my mother east side woman killed robbery believed motive in a late edition of fridays new york times the golf clubbludgeoning death of lucille peck whom marina dyer had known as lucy siddons was prominently featured on the front page of the metro section marinas quick eye skimming the page

celebration of a private individual of no evident civic cultural significance or beauty for times readers the news value lay in the victims address close by the mayors residence the subtext being even

sanctity of her home an instrument of class privilege a golf club snatched up by the killer as the murder weapon the intruder or intruders police said were probably looking for quick cash drug money it was a careless crude cruel crime a senseless crime one of a number of unsolved breakins on the east side since last september though it was the first to involve murder the teenaged son of lucille peck returned home to find the front door unlocked and his mother dead at about eleven pm at which time shed been dead approximately five hours neighbors spoke of having heard no unusual sounds from the peck residence but several did speak of suspicious strangers in the neighborhood police were investigating poor lucy marina noted that her former classmate was fortyfour years old a year most likely part of a year older than marina that shed been divorced since from derek peck an insurance executive now living in boston that she was survived by just the one child derek peck jr a sister and

must be silent a photocopied handout for communication arts class the instructor a cool youngish guy with a princeton phd yet he believed he could recall the circumstances of his birth in in barbados where his parents were vacationing one week in late december he was premature by five weeks and lucky to be alive and though barbados was an accident yet seventeen years later he saw in his dreams a cobaltblue sky rows of royal palms shedding their bark like scales shriekbrightfeathered tropical birds a fat white moon drooping in the sky like his mothers big belly sharks dorsal fins cresting the waves like the death raiders video game hed been hooked on in junior high wild hurricane nights kept him from sleeping a normal sleep din of voices as of drowning souls crashing on a beach he was into metallica urge overkill soul asylum his heroes were heavy metal punks whod never made it to the top ten or if they did fell right back again he admired losers who killed themselves oding like dyings joke one final fuck you to the world but he was innocent of doing what theyd claimed hed done to his mother for gods sake absolutely unbelieving fucking fantastic he derek peck jr had been arrested and would be tried for a crime perpetrated upon his own mother hed loved perpetrated by animals he could guess the color of their skin who wouldve smashed his skull in too like cracking an egg if hed walked in that door five hours earlier she wasnt prepared to fall in love wasnt the type to fall in love with any client yet here is what happened just seeing him his strange tawnyyearning eyes lifting to her face help me save me that was it derek peck jr was a botticelli angel partly erased and crudely painted over by eric fischl his thick stiffly moussed unwashed hair lifted in two flaring symmetrical wings that framed his elegantly bony longjawed face his limbs were monkeylong and twitchy his shoulders were narrow and high his chest perceptibly concave he might have been fourteen or twentyfive he was of a generation as distant from marina dyers as another species he wore a tshirt stamped soul asylum beneath a rumpled armani jacket of the color of steel filings and pinstriped ralph lauren fleece trousers stained at the crotch and sizetwelve nikes mad blue veins thrummed at his temples he was a preppy cokehead whod managed until now to stay out of trouble marina had been warned by derek peck srs attorney whod arranged through marinas discreet urging for her to interview for the boys counsel probably psychopathmatricide who not only claimed complete innocence but seemed actually to believe it he gave off a complex odor of the ripely organic and the chemical his skin appeared heated of the color and texture of singed oatmeal his nostrils were rimmed in red like nascent fire and his eyes were a pale acetylene yellowgreen flammable you would not want to bring a match too close to those eyes still less would you want to look too deeply into those eyes when marina dyer was introduced to derek peck the boy i stared at her hungrily yet he didnt get to his feet like the other men in the room he leaned forward in his chair the tendons standing out in his neck and the strain of seeing thinking visible in his young face his handshake was fumbling at first then suddenly strong assured as an adult mans hurtful unsmiling the boy shook hair out of his eyes like a horse rearing its beautiful brute head and a painful sensation ran through marina dyer like an electric shock she had not experienced such a sensation in a long time in her soft contralto voice that gave nothing away marina said derek hi it was in the s in an era of celebrityscandal trials that marina dyer made her reputation as a brilliant criminal defense lawyer by being in fact brilliant and by working very hard and by playing against type there was the audacity of drama in her positioning of herself in a maledominated courtroom there was the startling fact of her physical size she was a petite size five selfeffacing shyseeming a woman easy to overlook though it would not be in your advantage to overlook her she was meticulously and unglamorously groomed in a way to suggest a lofty indifference to fashion an air of timelessness she wore her sparrowcolored hair in a french twist ballerina style her favored suits were chanels in subdued harvest colors and soft dark cashmere wools the jackets giving some bulk to her narrow frame the skirts always primly to midcalf her shoes handbags briefcases were of exquisite italian leather expensive but understated when an item began to show signs of wear marina replaced it with an identical item from the same madison avenue shop her slightly askew left eye which some in fact had found charming shed long ago had corrected with surgery her eyes were now direct sharply focused a perpetually moist shiny darkbrown with a look of fanaticism at times but an exclusively professional fanaticism a fanaticism in the service of her clients whom she defended with a legendary fervor a small woman marina acquired size and authority in public arenas in a courtroom her normally reedy indistinct voice acquired volume timbre her passion seemed to be aroused in direct proportion to the challenge of presenting a client as not guilty to reasonable jurors and there were times her admiring fellow professionals joked about this that her plain ascetic face shone with the luminosity of berninis st teresa in her ecstasy her clients were martyrs their prosecutors persecutors there was a spiritual urgency to marina dyers cases impossible for jurors to explain afterward when their verdicts were sometimes questioned you would have had to be there to hear her to know marinas first highly publicized case was her successful defense of a us congressman from manhattan whod been charged with criminal extortion and witness tampering her second was the successful if controversial defense of a black performance artist charged with rape and assault of a druggiefan whod come uninvited to his suite at the four seasons there had been a prominent photogenic wall street trader charged with embezzlement fraud obstruction of justice there had been a woman journalist charged with attempted murder in the shootingwounding of a married lover there had been lesserknown but still meritorious cases rich with challenge marinas clients were not invariably acquitted but their sentences given their probable guilt were considered lenient sometimes they spent no time in prison at all only in halfway houses they paid fines did community service even as marina dyer shunned publicity she reaped it after each victory her fees rose yet she was not avaricious nor even apparently ambitious her life was her work and her work her life of course shed been dealt a few defeats in her early career when shed sometimes defended innocent or quasiinnocent people for modest fees with the innocent you risk emotions breakdown stammering at crucial moments on the witness stand you risk the eruption of rage despair with accomplished liars you know you can depend upon a performance psychopaths are best they lie fluently but they believe marinas initial interview with derek peck jr lasted for several hours and was intense exhausting if she took him on this would be her first murder trial this seventeenyearold boy her first accused murderer and what a brutal murder matricide never had she spoken with in such intimate quarters a client like derek peck never had she gazed into for long wordless moments any eyes like his the vehemence with which he stated his innocence was compelling the fury that his innocence should be doubted was mesmerizing had this boy killed in such a way transgressedviolated the law which was marina dyers very life as if it were of no more consequence than a paper bag to be crumpled in the hand and tossed away the back of lucille pecks head had literally been smashed in by an estimated twenty or more blows of the golf club inside her bathrobe her soft nakedflaccid body had been pummeled bruised bloodied her genitals furiously lacerated an unspeakable crime a crime in violation of taboo a tabloid crime thrilling even at second or third hand in her new chanel suit of such a purplishplum wool it appeared black as a nuns habit in her crisp chignon that gave to her profile an avedonlupin sharpness marina dyer gazed upon the boy who was lucy siddonss son it excited her more than she would have wished to acknowledge thinking i am unassailable i am untouched it was the perfect revenge lucy siddons my best friend id loved her leaving a birthday card and a red silk square scarf in her locker and it was days before she remembered to thank me though it was a warm thankyou a bigtoothed genuine smile lucy siddons who was so popular so at ease and emulated among the snobbish girls at finch despite a blemished skin buck teeth hefty thighs and waddlingduck walk for which she was teased so lovingly teased the secret was lucy had personality that mysterious xfactor which if you lack it you can never acquire it if you have to ponder it its out of your reach forever and lucy was good goodhearted a practicing christian from a wealthy manhattan episcopal family famed for their good works waving to marina dyer to come sit with her and her friends in the cafeteria while her friends sat stonily smiling choosing scrawny marina dyer for her basketball team in gym class while the others groaned but lucy was good so good charity and pity for the despised girls of finch spilled like coins from her pockets did i love lucy siddons those three years of my life yes i loved lucy siddons like no one since but it was a pure chaste love a wholly onesided love his bail had been set at the bond paid by his distraught father since the recent republican electionsweep it appeared that capital punishment would soon be reinstated in new york state but at the present time there was no murderone charge only murdertwo for even the most brutal andor premeditated crimes like the murder of lucille peck about which there was regrettably so much local publicity in newspapers magazines on television and radio marina dyer began to doubt her client could receive a fair trial in the new york city area derek was hurt incredulous look why would i kill her i was the one who loved her he whined in a childish voice lighting up another cigarette out of his mashed pack of camels i was the only fucking one who loved her in the fucking universe each time derek met with marina he made this declaration or a variant his eyes flamed with tears of indignation moral outrage strangers had entered his house and killed his mother and he was being blamed could you believe it his life and his fathers life torn up disrupted like a tornado had blown through derek wept angrily opening himself to marina as if hed slashed his breastbone to expose his raging palpitating heart profound and terrible moments that left marina shaken for hours afterward marina noted though that derek never spoke of lucille peck as my mother or mother but only as her she when shed happened to mention to him that shed known lucille years ago in school the boy hadnt seemed to hear hed been frowning scratching at his neck marina repeated gently lucille was an outstanding presence at finch a dear friend but still derek hadnt seemed to hear lucy siddonss son who bore virtually no resemblance to her his glaring eyes the angular face hardchiseled mouth sexuality reeked about him like unwashed hair solid tshirt and jeans nor did derek resemble derek peck sr so far as marina could see in the finch yearbook for there were numerous photos of lucy siddons and the other popular girls of the class the activities beneath their smiling faces extensive impressive beneath marina dyers single picture the caption was brief shed been an honors student of course but she had not been a popular girl no matter her effort consoling herself i am biding my time i can wait and so it turned out to be as in a fairy tale of rewards and punishments rapidly and vacantly derek peck recited his story his alibi as hed recited it to the authorities numerous times his voice resembled one simulated by computer specific times addresses names of friends who would swear to it i was with them every minute the precise route hed taken by taxi through central park on his way back to east end avenue the shock of discovering the body at the foot of the stairs just off the foyer marina listened fascinated she did not want to think that this was a tale invented in a cocaine high indelibly imprinted in the boys reptilebrain unshakable it failed to accommodate embarrassing details enumerated in the investigating detectives report dereks socks speckled with lucille pecks blood tossed down a laundry chute wadded underwear on dereks bathroom floor still damp at midnight from a shower he claimed to have taken at seven am but had more plausibly taken at seven pm before applying gel to his hair and dressing in punkgap style for a manic evening downtown with certain of his heavymetal friends and the smears of lucille pecks blood on the very tiles of dereks shower stall he hadnt noticed hadnt wiped off and the telephone call on lucilles answering tape explaining he wouldnt be home for dinner he claimed to have made at about four pm but had very possibly made as late as ten pm from a soho club these contradictions and others infuriated derek rather than troubled him as if they represented glitches in the fabric of the universe for which he could hardly be held responsible he had a childs conviction that all things must yield to his wish his insistence what he truly believed how could it not be so of course as marina dyer argued it was possible that the true killer of lucille peck had deliberately stained dereks socks with blood and tossed them down the laundry chute to incriminate him the killer or killers had taken time to shower in dereks shower and left dereks own wet wadded underwear behind and there was no absolute unshakable proof that the answering tape always recorded calls in the precise chronological order in which they came in not percent of the time how could that be proven there were five calls on lucilles answering tape for the day of her death scattered throughout the day dereks was the last the assistant district attorney who was prosecuting the case charged that derek peck jrs motive for killing his mother was a simple one money his monthly allowance hadnt been enough to cover his expenses evidently mrs peck had canceled her sons visa account in january after hed run up a bill of over relatives reported tension between mother and son certain of dereks classmates said there were rumors he was in debt to drug dealers and terrified of being murdered and derek had wanted a jeep wrangler for his eighteenth birthday hed told friends by killing his mother he might expect to inherit as much as million and there was a lifeinsurance policy naming him beneficiary there was the handsome fourstory east end town house worth as much as million there was a property in east hampton there were valuable possessions in the five days between lucille pecks death and dereks arrest hed run up over in bills hed gone on a manic buying spree subsequently attributed to grief derek was hardly the model preppy student he claimed to be either hed been expelled from the mayhew academy for two weeks in january for disruptive behavior and it was generally known that he and another boy had cheated on a battery of iq exams in ninth grade he was currently failing all his subjects except a course in postmodernist aesthetics in which films and comics of superman batman dracula and star trek were meticulously deconstructed under the tutelage of a princetontrained instructor there was a math club whose meetings derek had attended sporadically but he hadnt been there the evening of his mothers death why would his classmates lie about him derek was aggrieved wounded his closest friend andy turning against him marina had to admire her young clients response to the detectives damning report he simply denied it his hotflamed eyes brimmed with tears of innocence disbelief the prosecution was the enemy and the enemys case was just something theyd thrown together to blame an unsolved murder on him because he was a kid and vulnerable so he was into heavy metal and hed experimented with a few drugs like everyone he knew for gods sake he had not murdered his mother and he didnt know who had marina tried to be detached objective she was certain that no one including derek himself knew of her feelings for him her behavior was unfailingly professional and would be yet she thought of him constantly obsessively hed become the emotional center of her life as if she were somehow pregnant with him his anguished angry spirit inside her help me save me shed forgotten the subtle circuitous ways in which shed brought her name to the attention of derek peck srs attorney and began to think that derek junior had himself chosen her very likely lucille had spoken of her to him her old classmate and close friend marina dyer now a prominent defense attorney and perhaps hed seen her photograph somewhere it was more than coincidence after all she knew she filed her motions she interviewed lucille pecks relatives neighbors friends she began to assemble a voluminous case with the aid of two assistants she basked in the excitement of the upcoming trial through which she would lead like a warriorwoman like joan of arc her beleaguered client they would be dissected in the press they would be martyred yet they would triumph she was sure was derek guilty and if guilty of what if truly he could not recall his actions was he guilty marina thought if i put him on the witness stand if he presents himself to the court as he presents himself to mehow could the jury deny him it was five weeks six weeks now ten weeks after the death of lucille peck and already the death like all deaths was rapidly receding a latesummer date had been set for the trial to begin and it hovered at the horizon teasing tantalizing as the opening night of a play already in rehearsal marina had of course entered a plea of not guilty on behalf of her client who had refused to consider any other option since he was innocent he could not plead guilty to a lesser charge firstdegree or seconddegree manslaughter for instance in manhattan criminal law circles it was believed that going to trial with this case was for marina dyer an egregious error but marina refused to discuss any other alternative she was as adamant as her client she would enter into no negotiations her primary defense would be a systematic refutation of the prosecutions case a denial seriatim of the evidence passionate reiterations of derek pecks absolute innocence in which on the witness stand he would be the star performer a charge of police bungling and incompetence in failing to find the true killer or killers who had broken into other homes on the east side a hope of enlisting the jurors sympathy for marina had learned long ago how the sympathy of jurors is a deep deep well you would not want to call these average americans fools exactly but they were strangely almost magically impressionable at times susceptible as children they were or would like to be good people decent generous forgiving kind not condemning cruel they looked especially in manhattan where the reputation of the police was clouded for reasons not to convict and a good defense lawyer provides those reasons especially they would not want to convict of a charge of seconddegree murder a young attractive and now motherless boy like derek peck jr jurors are easily confused and it was marina dyers genius to confuse them to her advantage for the wanting to be good in defiance of justice is one of mankinds greatest weaknesses hey you dont believe me do you hed paused in his compulsive pacing of her office a cigarette burning in his fingers he eyed her suspiciously marina looked up startled to see derek hovering rather close beside her desk giving off his hot citrusacetylene smell shed been taking notes even as a tape recorder played derek it doesnt matter what i believe as your attorney i speak for you your best legal derek said pettishly no you have to believe me i didnt kill her it was an awkward moment a moment of exquisite tension in which there were numerous narrative possibilities marina dyer and the son of her old now deceased friend lucy siddons shut away in marinas office on a late thunderydark afternoon only a revolving tape cassette bearing witness marina had reason to know that the boy was drinking these long days before his trial he was living in the town house with his father free on bail but not free hed allowed her to know that he was clean of all drugs absolutely he was following her advice her instructions but did she believe him marina said again carefully meeting the boys glaring gaze of course i believe you derek as if it was the most natural thing in the world and he naive to have doubted now please sit down and lets continue you were telling me about your parents divorce cause if you dont believe me derek said pushing out his lower lip so it showed fleshy red as a skinned tomatoill find a fucking lawyer who does yes but i do now sit down please you do you believe derek what have i been saying now sit down the boy loomed above her staring for an instant his expression showed fear then he groped his way backward to his chair his young corroded face was flushed and he gazed at her greenytawny eyes with yearning adoration dont touch me marina murmured in her sleep cresting with emotion i couldnt bear it marina dyer strangers stared at her in public places whispered together pointing her out her name and now her face had become mediasanctioned iconic in restaurants in hotel lobbies at professional gatherings at the new york city ballet for instance which marina attended with a friendfor it had been a performance of this ballet troupe lucille peck had been scheduled to attend the night of her death is that woman the lawyer the one who the boy who killed his mother with the golf clubpeck they were becoming famous together his street name his name in the downtown clubs fez dukes mandible was booger hed been pissed at first then decided it was affection not mockery a pretty white uptown boy had to pay his dues had to buy respect authority it was a tough crowd took a fucking lot to impress them money and more than money a certain attitude laughing at him oh you booger man one wild dude but now they were impressed whacked his old lady no shit that booger man one wild dude never dreamt of it nor of mother who was gone from the house as traveling except not calling home not checking on him no more disappointing mother never dreamt of any kind of violence that wasnt his thing he believed in passiveism there was the great indian leader a saint gandy taught the ethic of passiveism triumphed over the racist british enemies except the movie was too long didnt sleep at night but weird times during the day at night watching tv playing the computer myst his favorite he could lose himself in for hours avoided violent games his stomach still queasy avoided calculus even the thought of it the betrayal for he hadnt graduated class of ninetyfive moving on without him fuckers his friends were never home when he called even girls whod been crazy for him never home never returned his calls him derek peck boooogerman it was like a microchip had been inserted in his brain he had these pathological reactions not being able to sleep for say fortyeight hours then crashing dead then waking how many hours later drymouthed and hearthammering lying sideways on his churnedup bed his head over the edge and doc martens combat boots on his feet hes kicking like crazy like somebody or something has hold of his ankles and hes gripping with both hands an invisible rod or baseball bat or club swinging it in his sleep and his muscles twitched and spasmed and veins swelled in his head close to bursting swinging swinging swinging and in his pants in his calvin klein briefs hed come when he went out he wore dark very dark glasses even at night his long hair tied back rattail style and a mets cap reversed on his head hed be getting his hair cut for the trial but just not yet wasnt that likegiving in surrendering in the neighborhood pizzeria in a place on second avenue hed ducked into alone signing napkins for some giggling girls once a father and son about eight years old another time two old women in their forties fifties staring like he was son of sam sure okay signing derek peck jr and dating it his signature an extravagant redink scrawl thank you and he knows theyre watching him walk away thrilled their one contact with fame his old man and especially his ladylawyer would give him hell if they knew but they didnt need to know everything he was free on fucking bail wasnt he in the aftermath of a love affair in her early thirties the last such affair of her life marina dyer had taken a strenuous ecological field trip to the galapagos islands one of those desperate trips we take at crucial times in our lives reasoning that the experience will cauterize the emotional wound make of its very misery something trivial negligible the trip was indeed strenuous and cauterizing there in the infamous gal√°pagos in the vast pacific ocean due west of equador and a mere ten miles south of the equator marina had come to certain lifeconclusions shed decided not to kill herself for one thing for why kill one self when nature is so very eager to do it for you and to gobble you up the islands were rockbound stormlashed barren inhabited by reptiles giant tortoises there was little vegetation shrieking sea birds like damned souls except it was not possible to believe in souls here in no world but a fallen one could such lands exist herman melville had written of the galap√°gos hed called also the enchanted isles when she returned from her weeks trip to hell as she fondly spoke of it marina dyer was observed to devote herself more passionately than ever more singlemindedly than ever to her profession practicing law would be her life and she meant to make of her life a quantifiable and unmistakable success what of life that was not consumed by law would be inconsequential the law was only a game of course it had very little to do with justice or morality right or wrong common sense but the law was the only game in which she marina dyer could be a serious player the only game in which now and then marina dyer might win there was marinas brotherinlaw who had never liked her but until now had been cordial respectful staring at her as if hed never seen her before how the hell can you defend that vicious little punk how do you justify yourself morally he killed his mother for gods sake marina felt the shock of this unexpected assault as if shed been struck in the face others in the room including her sister looked on appalled marina said carefully trying to control her voice but ben you dont believe that only the obviously innocent deserve legal counsel do you it was an answer she had made numerous times to such a question the answer all lawyers make reasonably convincingly of course not but people like you go too far too far people like me you know what i mean dont play dumb but i dont i dont know what you mean her brotherinlaw was by nature a courteous man however strong his opinions yet how rudely he turned away from marina with a dismissive gesture marina called after him stricken ben i dont know what you mean derek is innocent im sure the case against him is only circumstantial the media her pleading voice trailed off hed walked out of the room never had she been so deeply hurt confused her own brotherinlaw the bigot selfrighteous bastard never would marina consent to see the man again marina dont cry they dont mean it marina dont feel bad please hiding in the lockerroom lavatory after the humiliation of gym class how many times even lucy one of the team captains didnt want her that was obvious marina dyer and the other lastchoices a fat girl or two myopic girls uncoordinated clumsy asthmatic girls laughingly divided between the red team and the gold then the nightmare of the game itself trying to avoid being struck by thundering hooves crashing bodies yells piercing laughter swinging flailing arms muscular thighs how hard the gleaming floor when you fell the giant girls lucy siddons among them glaring fierce ran over her if she didnt step aside she had no existence for them marina made by the gym teacher so absurdly a guard you must play marina you must try dont be silly its only a game these are all just games get out there with your team but if the ball was thrown directly at her it would strike her chest and ricochet out of her hands and into the hands of another if the ball sailed toward her head she was incapable of ducking but stood stupidly helpless paralyzed her glasses flying her scream a childs scream laughable it was all laughable yet it was her life lucy goodhearted repentant lucy sought her out where she hid in a locked toilet stall sobbing in fury a bloodstained tissue pressed against her nose marina dont cry they dont mean it they like you come on back whats wrong goodhearted lucy siddons shed hated the most on the afternoon of the friday before the monday that would be the start of his trial derek peck jr broke down in marina dyers office marina had known something was wrong the boy reeked of alcohol hed come with his father but had told his father to wait outside he insisted that marinas assistant leave the room he began to cry and to babble to marinas astonishment he fell hard onto his knees on her burgundy carpet began banging his forehead against the glasstopped edge of her desk he laughed he wept saying in an anguished choking voice how sorry he was hed forgotten his mothers last birthday he hadnt known would be her last and how hurt shed been like hed forgotten just to spite her and that wasnt true jesus he loved her the only person in the fucking universe who loved her and then at thanksgiving this wild scene shed quarreled with the relatives so it was just her and him for thanksgiving she insisted upon preparing a full thanksgiving dinner for just two people and he said it was crazy but she insisted no stopping her when her mind was made up and hed known there would be trouble that morning in the kitchen shed started drinking early and he was up in his room smoking dope and his walkman plugged in knowing there was no escape and it wasnt even a turkey she roasted for the two of them you needed at least a twentypound turkey otherwise the meat dried out she said so she bought two ducks yes two dead ducks from this game shop on lexington and sixtysixth and that mightve been okay except she was drinking red wine and laughing kind of hysterical talking on the phone preparing this fancy stuffing she made every year wild rice and mushrooms olives and also baked yams plum sauce corn bread and chocolatetapioca pudding that was supposed to be one of his favorite desserts from when he was little that just the smell of it made him feel like puking he stayed out of it upstairs until finally she called him around four pm and he came down knowing it was going to be a true bummer but not knowing how bad she was swayingdrunk and her eyes smeared and they were eating in the dining room with the chandelier lit all the fancy irish linens and grandmas old china and silver and she insisted he carve the ducks he tried to get out of it but couldnt and jesus what happens he pushes the knife in the duck breast and theres actual blood squirting out of it and a big sticky clot of blood inside so he dropped the knife and ran out of the room gagging itd just completely freaked him in the midst of being stoned he couldnt take it running out into the street and almost hit by a car and her screaming after him derek come back derek come back dont leave me but he split from that scene and didnt come back for a day and a half and ever after that she was drinking more and saying weird things to him like he was her baby shed felt him kick and shudder in her belly under her heart shed talk to him inside her belly for months before he was born shed lie down on the bed and stroke him his head through her skin and theyd talk together she said it was the closest shed ever been with any living creature and he was embarrassed not knowing what to say except he didnt remember it was so long ago and shed say yes oh yes in your heart you remember in your heart youre still my baby boy you do remember and he was getting pissed saying fuck it no he didnt remember any of it and there was only one way to stop her from loving him he began to understand but he hadnt wanted to hed asked could he transfer to school in boston or somewhere living with his dad but she went crazy no no no he wasnt going shed never allow it she tried to hold him hug and kiss him so he had to lock his door and barricade it practically and shed be waiting for him halfnaked just coming out of her bathroom pretending shed been taking a shower and clutching at him and that night finally he mustve freaked something snapped in his head and he went for the twoiron she hadnt had time even to scream it happened so fast and merciful him running up behind her so she didnt see him exactlyit was the only way to stop her loving me marina stared at the boys aggrieved tearstained face mucus leaked alarmingly from his nose what had he said he had said what yet even now a part of marinas mind remained detached calculating she was shocked by dereks confession but was she surprised a lawyer is never surprised she said quickly your mother lucille was a strong domineering woman i know i knew her as a girl twentyfive years ago shed rush into a room and all the oxygen was sucked up shed rush into a room and it was like a wind had blown out all the windows marina hardly knew what she was saying only that words tumbled from her radiance played about her face like a flame lucille was a smothering presence in your life she wasnt a normal mother what youve told me only confirms what id suspected ive seen other victims of psychic incest i know she hypnotized you you were fighting for your life it was your own life you were defending derek remained kneeling on the carpet staring vacantly at marina tight little beads of blood had formed on his reddened forehead his snakygreasy hair dropped into his eyes all his energy was spent he looked to marina now like an animal who hears not words from his mistress but sounds the consolation of certain cadences rhythms marina was saying urgently that night you lost control whatever happened derek it wasnt you you are the victim she drove you to it your father too abrogated his responsibility to you left you with her alone with her at the age of thirteen thirteen thats what youve been denying all these months thats the secret you havent acknowledged you had no thoughts of your own did you for years your thoughts were hers in her voice derek nodded mutely marina had taken a tissue from the burnishedleather box on her desk and tenderly dabbed at his face he lifted his face to her shutting his eyes as if this sudden closeness this intimacy was not new to them but somehow familiar marina saw the boy in the courtroom her derek transformed his face fresh scrubbed and his hair neatly cut gleaming with health his head uplifted without guile or subterfuge it was the only way to stop her loving me he wore a navyblue blazer bearing the elegant understated monogram of the mayhew academy a white shirt bluestriped tie his hands clasped together in an attitude of buddhistic calm a boy immature for his age emotional susceptible not guilty by reason of temporary insanity it was a transcendent vision and marina knew she would realize it and that all who gazed upon derek peck jr and heard him testify would realize it derek leaned against marina who crouched over him hed hidden his wet hot face against her legs as she held him comforted him what a rank animal heat quivered from him what animal terror urgency he was sobbing babbling incoherently save me dont let them hurt me can i have immunity if i confess if i say what happened if i tell the truth marina embraced him her fingers at the nape of his neck she said of course ill save you derek thats why you came to me english autumn american fall minette walters minette walters b born minette jebb in bishops stortford england to an army captain and an artist attended godolphin and latymer school and spent six months as a volunteer in israel before attending durham university where she took a degree in french the mother of two sons with husband alexander walters she lists her prewriting careers as magazine journalism in london pta work and standing for local elections in walters is one of the most critically acclaimed new writers to debut in the s indeed her first three novels were all awardwinners the ice house won the british crime writers associations john creasey award for best first novel the sculptress won the edgar for best novel from the mystery writers of america and the scolds bridle won the gold dagger award from the crime writers association for best novel most frequently compared to ruth rendell to whose success she attributes her own opportunity to be published walters is a traditionalist with a difference emphasizing family relationships and the importance of a puzzle but disclaiming indeed denouncing coziness walters has written few short stories apart from some romance novelettes done in her magazine days under unrevealed pseudonyms english autumn american fall is an example of the shortshort demonstrating how much character and suggestion can be packed into a very brief tale iremember thinking that mrs newbergs problem was not so much her husbands chronic addiction to alcohol as her dreary pretense that he was a man of moderation they were a handsome couple tall and slender with sweeps of snowwhite hair always expensively dressed in cashmere and tweeds in fairness to her he didnt look like a drunk or indeed behave like one but i cannot recall a single occasion in the two weeks i knew them when he was sober his wife excused him with cliches she hinted at insomnia a death in the family even a gammy leg a legacy of war naturally which made walking difficult once in a while an amused smile would cross his face as if something shed said had tickled his sense of humour but most of the time he sat staring at a fixed point in front of him afraid of losing his precarious equilibrium i guessed they were in their late seventies and i wondered what had brought them so far from home in the middle of a cold english autumn mrs newberg was evasive just a little holiday she trilled in her birdlike voice with its hint of northern europe in the hard edge she gave to her consonants she cast nervous glances toward her husband as she spoke as if daring him to disagree it may have been true but an empty seaside hotel in a blustery lincolnshire resort in october seemed an unlikely choice for two elderly americans she knew i didnt believe her but she was too canny to explain further perhaps she understood that my willingness to talk to her depended on a lingering curiosity it was mr newberg who wanted to come she said sotto voce as if that settled the matter it was an unfashionable resort out of season and mrs newberg was clearly lonely who wouldnt be with only an uncommunicative drunk for company on odd evenings a rep would put in a brief appearance in the dining room in order to fuel his stomach in silence before retiring to bed but for the most part conversations with me were her single source of entertainment in a desultory fashion we became friends of course she wanted to know why i was there but i too could be evasive looking for somewhere to live i told her how nice she said not meaning it but do you want to be so far from london it was a reproach for her as for so many capital cities were synonymous with life i dont like noise i confessed she looked toward the window where rain was pounding furiously against the panes perhaps its people you dont like she suggested i demurred out of politeness i dont have a problem with individuals i said casting a thoughtful glance in mr newbergs direction just humanity en masse yes she agreed vaguely i think i prefer animals as well she had a habit of using non sequiturs and i did wonder once or twice if she wasnt quite with it but if that were the case i thought how on earth had they found their way to this remote place when mr newberg had trouble negotiating the tables in the bar the answer was straightforward enough the hotel had sent a car to collect them from the airport wasnt that very expensive i asked it was free said mrs newberg with dignity a courtesy the manager came himself she tuttutted at my look of astonishment its what we expect when we pay full rate for a room im paying full rate i said i doubt it she said her bosom rising on a sigh americans get stung wherever they go during the first week of their stay i saw them only once outside the confines of the hotel i came across them on the beach wrapped up in heavy coats and woolen scarves and sitting in deck chairs staring out over a turbulent sea which labored beneath the whip of a bitter east wind from siberia i expressed surprise to see them and mrs newberg who assumed for some reason that my surprise was centered on the deck chairs said the hotel would supply anything for a small sum do you come here every morning i asked her she nodded it reminds us of home i thought you lived in florida yes she said cautiously as if trying to remember how much shed already divulged mr newberg and i exchanged conspiratorial smiles he spoke rarely but when he did it was always with irony florida is famous for its hurricanes he told me before turning his face to the freezing wind after that i avoided the beach for fear of becoming even more entangled with them its not that i disliked them as a matter of fact i quite enjoyed their company they were the least inquisitive couple i had ever met and there was never any problem with the long silences that developed between us but i had no wish to spend the daylight hours being sociable with strangers mrs newberg remarked on it one evening i wonder you didnt go to scotland she said im told you can walk for miles in scotland without ever seeing a soul i couldnt live in scotland i said ah yes id forgotten was she being snide or was i imagining it youre looking for a house somewhere to live i corrected her an apartment then does it matter i think so mr newberg stared into his whiskey glass das geheimni√ü um die gr√∂√üte fruchtbarkeit und den gr√∂√üten genu√ü vom dasein einzuernten hei√üt gef√§hrlich leben he murmured in fluent german the secret of reaping the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment from life is to live dangerously friedrich nietzsche does it work i asked i watched him smile secretly to himself only if you shed blood im sorry but his eyes were awash with alcohol and he didnt answer hes tired said his wife hes had a long day we lapsed into silence and i watched mrs newbergs face smooth from sharp anxiety to its more natural expression of resigned acceptance of the cards fate had dealt her it was a good five minutes before she offered an explanation he enjoyed the war she told me in an undertone so many men did its the camaraderie i agreed remembering how my mother had always talked fondly about the war years adversity brings out the best in people or the worst she said watching mr newberg top up his glass from the liter bottle of whiskey which was replaced new every evening on their table i guess it depends which side youre on you mean its better to win i expect it helps she said absentmindedly the next day mrs newberg appeared at breakfast with a black eye she claimed she had fallen out of bed and knocked her face on the bedside cabinet there was no reason to doubt her except that her husband kept massaging the knuckles of his right hand she looked wan and depressed and i invited her to come walking with me im sure mr newberg can amuse himself for an hour or two i said looking at him disapprovingly we wandered down the esplanade watching seagulls whirl across the sky like windblown fabric mrs newberg insisted on wearing dark glasses which gave her the look of a blind woman she walked slowly pausing regularly to catch her breath so i offered her my arm and she leaned on it heavily for the first time i thought of her as old you shouldnt let your husband hit you i said she gave a small laugh but said nothing you should report him to whom the police she drew away to lean on the railings above the beach and then what a prosecution prison i leant beside her more likely a court would order him to address his behavior you cant teach an old dog new tricks he might have a different perspective on things if he were sober he drinks to forget she said looking across the sea toward the faroff shores of northern europe i turned a cold shoulder towards mr newberg from then on i dont approve of men who knock their wives about it made little difference to our relationship if anything sympathy for mrs newberg strengthened the bonds between the three of us i took to escorting them to their room of an evening and pointing out in no uncertain terms that i took a personal interest in mrs newbergs wellbeing mr newberg seemed to find my solicitude amusing she has no conscience to trouble her he said on one occasion and on another i have more to fear than she has during the second week he tripped at the top of the stairs on his way to breakfast and was dead by the time he reached the bottom there were no witnesses to the accident although a waitress hearing the crash of the falling body rushed out of the dining room to find the handsome old man sprawled on his back at the foot of the stairs with his eyes wide open and a smile on his face no one was particularly surprised although as the manager said it was odd that it should happen in the morning when he was at his most sober some hours later a policeman came to ask questions not because there was any suggestion of foul play but because mr newberg was a foreign national and reports needed to be written i sat with mrs newberg in her bedroom while she dabbed gently at her tears and explained to the officer that she had been sitting at her dressing table and putting the finishing touches to her makeup when mr newberg left the room to go downstairs he always went first she said he liked his coffee fresh the policeman nodded as if her remark made sense then inquired tactfully about her husbands drinking habits a sample of mr newbergs blood had shown a high concentration of alcohol he told her she smiled faintly and said she couldnt believe mr newbergs moderate consumption of whiskey had anything to do with his fall there was no elevator in the hotel she pointed out and he had had a bad leg for years americans arent used to stairs she said as if that were explanation enough he gave up and turned to me instead he understood i was a friend of the couple was there anything i could add that might throw some light on the accident i avoided looking at mrs newberg who had skillfully obscured the faded bruise around her eye with foundation not really i said wondering why id never noticed the scar above her cheek that looked as if it might have been made by the sharp corner of a bedside cabinet he told me once that the secret of fulfillment is to live dangerously so perhaps he didnt take as much care of himself as he should have done he flicked an embarrassed glance in mrs newbergs direction meaning he drank too much i gave a small shrug which he took for agreement i might have pointed out that mr newbergs carelessness lay in his failure to look over his shoulder but i couldnt see what it would achieve no one doubted his wife had been in their room at the time she bowed graciously as the officer took his leave are english policemen always so charming she asked moving to the dressing table to dust her lovely face with powder always i assured her as long as they have no reason to
