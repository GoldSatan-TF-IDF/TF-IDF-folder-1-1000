jonathan kellerman deception book in the alex delaware series to oscar chapter the woman had haunted eyes pale drooping at the outer edges they stared into the unseen camera with an odd combination of defiance and defeat she didnt move neither did the camera the wall behind her was brownblue the color of an old bruise the couch on which she perched was gray she was a pretty woman made less so by fear her shoulders were bunched high her neck tendons taut as bridge cables a black sleeveless dress showcased soft white arms tooblond hair fell limply to her shoulders moments passed nothing happened in another situation i mightve cracked wise about it being one of andy warhols old antifilms interminable static studies of the empire state building a man sleeping when a homicide lieutenant brings you something to watch you keep your mouth shut milo stood behind me his black hair and raincoat were rumpled the coat was cheap green wrinkled past the point of salvation it gave off a not unpleasant vegetative odor hed placed a massive breakfast burrito in a takeout box on my desk hadnt touched it when he drops in he usually beelines for the fridge empties a quart of something raids the shelves for bad carbs this morning hed marched to my office loaded the dvd with a flourish for your consideration blanche my little french bulldog sat next to me uncharacteristically serious shed tried her usual smile had figured out something was different when milo didnt stoop to pet her i rubbed her knobby head she looked up at me returned her attention to the monitor the womans lips moved milo said here we go more silence on the screen so i lied the woman said my name is elise freeman im a teacher and tutor at windsor preparatory academy in brentwood her voice was throaty she knotted her fingers flopped them onto her lap im making this recording to document sustained abuse i have received at the hands of faculty members at windsor preparatory academy in brentwood which i will hereon refer to as prep deep breath for the past two years at prep i have been subjected to repeated unwarranted aggressive and distressing sexual harassment from three individuals their names are her right hand rose a finger pointed upward enrico hauer hauer two fingers james winterthorn more slow enunciated spelling then a trio of digits pat skaggs the hand dropped for the past two years enrico hauer james winterthorn and pat skaggs have made my life a living hell by engaging in brutal unsolicited and threatening sexual behavior i am making this recording so that in the event something violent happens to me the authorities will know where to look i do not know what else to do as i feel trapped and frightened and have nowhere to turn i hope this recording never needs to come to light but if it does i am glad that i made it her eyes clenched shut her lips moved soundlessly and she slumped suddenly her jaw jutted and she was sitting up straight more defiance than defeat staring hard at the camera thanks for listening the screen went blue milo said talk about a dmovie plot device i said but youre here she was murdered maybe shes on ice backlog at the coroner his laughter was harsh nope this morning im mr literal ice of the dry sort frozen co she was found in her home lying in a bathtub full of the stuff i tried to picture the blond woman as a frozen corpse didnt like the image that flashed in my head and reverted to doctor helpful someone trying to mess up the timeofdeath estimate or maybe a psychopath coming up with a new way to showcase his handiwork he winced as if all contingencies were painful removing the disc he slipped it back into a clear plastic jewel box not bothering to glove up the dvd had already been printed matched only to elise freeman i said where are you going with this he rotated his neck got coffee maybe some toast chapter we left my house with black coffee in travelcups and six slices of lavishly buttered sesamerye when milo wants to think phone text or sleep he sometimes asks me to do the driving its against lapd regs but so are lots of things he makes up for my mileage cost with bar tabs and such the toast was occupying his attention so i offered to take my seville he shook his head scattering crumbs continued to his latest unmarked a bronze chevy malibu with a phlegmy ignition heading north on beverly glen he steered with one hand stuffed rye bread into his mouth with the other the police radio was switched off the burrito rested in the backseat and filled the car with eau de frijole he said in answer to your question too messy that was low on my list of questions where are we going where she died studio city not a west la case but youre on it not an official homicide but im on it the difference between an experienced psychologist and a novice is knowing when not to speak i sat back and drank coffee milo said maybe therell be a microwave and i can heat up the burrito elise freeman had resided in a greensided tarroofed bungalow on a spidery treeshaded lane east of laurel canyon and north of ventura boulevard close enough to the thoroughfare to hear valley traffic but mature vegetation and larger houses blocked any urban visuals the little green box sat at the terminus of a long dirt driveway split by a strip of concrete a gray sedan was parked near the front door fullsized car but not big enough to hide the bungalows blemishes as we drew close worn and ragged siding eroded to raw wood in patches curling shingles a noticeable listing to the right due to a sinking foundation no crime scene tape that i could see no uniforms on watch i said when was she found last night by her boyfriend he says he talked to her on the phone three days ago but after that she stopped returning his calls a fortyeighthour time frame fits the coroners tod guesstimate probably at the tail endearly morning apparently dry ice doesnt melt it sublimatesgoes straight into the atmosphereso theres no water residue for estimating degradation in an ice chest the rate of sublimation is five to ten pounds every twentyfour hours but its faster under normal room temperature any empty ice bags left behind nope exactly someone had cleaned up the scenes still intact he scowled i never got a chance to see the scene because my involvement began at five thirty am today when deputy chief weinberg woke me from a rare good dream the dvd the key to the house and whats passing for a file were messengered to my house ten minutes later high intrigue and an egregious break in procedure i said sounds like orders from on high he continued slowly up the drive checking out the surroundings layers of greenery to the left a twostory colonial mansion to the right the big house was woodsided like the bungalow but what i could see of it was painted white and adorned with black shutters it sat on a generous lot partitioned from freemans skimpy ribbon of real estate by a tenfoot stucco fence topped with used brick bougainvillea topped areas of brick amping up the privacy quotient on both sides the smaller structure mightve begun life as an outbuilding of the manse back when multiacre estates spread across valley hillsides a guesthouse servants quarters maybe tack storage for one of the cowboy actors wanting proximity to the burbank filmlots that passed for wild west badlands milo rolled to a stop inches from the crown vic no one at the wheel but a man in a creamcolored suit emerged from behind the bungalow a hair over milo s six three he was broad black bespectacled the suit was doublebreasted and tailored to nearly conceal a gun bulge he gave a cursory nod milo stan and this is dr delaware your psychologist that makes it sound like im in therapy stan therapys in fashion now milo the department looks kindly on selfawareness and insight must have missed that memo a big hand extended stanley creighton doctor we shook milo said what brings you down from olympus stan more like bunker hill said creighton im here to keep an eye out new clause in the captains job description creighton said one does what one is told he turned to me speaking of which doctor i appreciate what you do but you shouldnt be here hes cleared for takeoff stan creighton frowned cool morning but the back of his neck was moist ebony i mustve missed that memo probably buried under a pile of wisdom from his munificence creighton flashed beautiful teeth why dont you call him that to his face doctor you really need to absent yourself stan he really doesnt creightons smile degraded to something cold and menacing youre telling me you got papal dispensation for his presence at this specific crime scene why would i improvise about that stan why indeed said creighton except for the fact that rationality doesnt always figure into human behavior which is why my wife who has an md still smokes a pack and a half a day feel free to call the vatican to verify stan creighton studied me can i assume that lieutenant sturgis has informed you of the need for exceptional discretion here doctor absolutely exceptional he repeated i love exceptions i said whys that doctor theyre a lot more interesting than rules creighton tried to smile again the result fit him like panty hose on a mastiff i respect what you do doctor my wifes a neurologist works with psychologists all the time but now im wondering if lieutenant sturgis relies on you so not because of your professional skills maybe its more of a personality thing expanding his chest as in wiseass loves company before i could answer he wheeled on milo how much time are you going to need here hard to say im after a little more precision cmon stan youve already seen the crime scene pix the bodys long gone the prints and fluid swabs are at the lab and your vics computer was lifted so what do you expect to accomplish no mention of the dvd milo said hell stan why even bother to work when we can go on detectivecom yuk yuk yuk kaching rim shot said creighton bottom line theres nothing this place can tell you unless youre one of those paranormals think you can feel vibrations you were in my place you wouldnt do a walkthrough sure cover your ass but walk quickly ive been here since six am which is an hour after weinberg woke me up and gave me my orders mornings arent my fun time this particular morning my knees being a nasty bitch so what im gonna do right now is go for a nice loose walk and when i get back i strongly prefer to see you the hell out of here so i can get the hell out of here and do the job they officially pay me for favoring me with a contemptuous glance be careful doctor we watched him stride off limping slightly i said whod he play for u nevada didnt make the bigtime what do they officially pay him for he used to work sex crimes now he pushes paper and attends meetings and occasionally plays watchman funny bout that we continued toward the green house i said if its all so hushhush howd you get the chief to approve me ill answer that once youre approved the bungalows front porch creaked under our weight a hummingbird feeder dangling from the overhang was empty and dry milo pulled out a tagged key and unlocked the door and we stepped into a small dim living room blank space atop a tv table i said her video gears at the lab nod where was the dvd found stuck in the middle of a stack of her favorite movies or so the file claims creighton didnt mention it like i said it got messengered by who guy in a suit and a badge that too i said any explanation a note in the envelope said it was found in a stack of the victims dvds but not cataloged as evidence funny bout that who took the initial call two north hollywood ds who have absolutely nothing to say to me are you planning to tell me what got the gears grinding it wasnt her he said they couldnt care less about her thats the point alex i said the suspects are the point where theyre employed you never heard that from me a school has that much clout it does when the right peoples kids are enrolled you ever have patients from windsor prep a few any pattern youd care to share affluent attractive kids for the most part bright but under lots of pressure academically athletically and socially in other words no different from any other prep school this case makes it real different because of one student in particular silence college applications go in soon i said heres a wild guess the chief has a kid aiming for the ivy league he shoved a coarse shock of hair off his brow fuzzy light advertised every pock and knot on his face i never heard that from you son or daughter son he said only child another einstein according to his mommy the virgin mary talk about a mixed metaphor what the hell they were both nice jewish boys graduating senior graduating with honors and aiming for yale i said its the toughest year ever huge upsurge of applications lots of honor students are going to be disappointed a couple of patients i saw as little kids have come back for moral support and they say the most trivial factor can nudge the scales a bigtime scandal would energize the rejection gods he bowed o great swami of the east your wisdom has pierced the miasma he began circling the room ol stanley was wrong why i rely upon you has nothing to do with personality creighton mightve been off about that but to my eye he was right about the house yielding nothing of value the miserly space had already taken on an abandoned feel the front room carelessly and cheaply furnished sported a ubuild bookshelf full of high school texts sat and act practice manuals a few photography volumes featuring pretty shots of faraway places paperbacks by jane austen aphra behn and george eliot the plywoodandformica kitchenette was a sixties bootleg wilting fruit and vegetables moldered in the minifridge a couple of lean cuisine boxes sat in the freezer compartment a kitchen cabinet was crammed full of liquor minibottles and some fullsized quarts budget gin but grey goose vodka no mixers prettying up intentions the sole bedroom was a ninebynine cave set up with a twin bed and ikea trimmings gloomy because a single window looked out to a wall of creeping ivy hillside close enough to touch but the frame was painted shut a cheap fan in the corner pretended to circulate air no match for faint overtones of decomposition faint because dry ice had slowed down the inevitable but we all rot its just a matter of time i said any maggots a sprinkle in her nose and ears mommy flies probably got in under the door little bastards were frozen stiff dumb vermin he searched the room a limited drab wardrobe filled a makeshift closet oppressively sensible down to white cotton fullcut underwear crowding the bed was a spacesaving nearly wood desk vase of dry flowers on top next to a pale rectangle where the computer had sat a photo in a white wood frame showed elise freeman and a redbearded bald man around her age standing near a bank of slot machines in an excruciatingly bright garish room both of them in tshirts and shorts glazed around the eyes beaming the man held up a sheaf of paper money elise freeman snaked an arm around his waist and flashed a victory sign on the bottom frame panel cursive in red marker read sal strikes it big in reno adorning the boast were handdrawn pink hearts and green daisies milo said nice to be lucky once in a while and continued to have his way with drawers and shelves the final stop was the bathroom modular fiberglass prefab unit another aftermarket the medicine cabinet had been emptied by the crime scene techs the tub was grubby but unhelpful milo kept staring at it if he was feeling vibrations he wasnt showing it finally he turned away boyfriends a guy not surprisingly named sal last name fidella he let himself in with his own key her car was here no sign of forced entry or disarray he found her in the tub immersed in dry ice naked and blue accounting for sublimation someone bought bags of the stuff maybe twenty thirty pounds because of no blood the initial assumption was an od even though she hadnt vomited and fidella claims she didnt use drugs and there were no pill bottles nearby fidella called the tapes in the file and ive listened to it three times he sounds totally freaked but i havent met him and i know nothing about him except what north hollywood wrote which is no more than his drivers license says so im reserving judgment where does he live not far from here sherman oaks a couple but they live apart sometimes that works better sometimes it means domestic drama youll have a chance to meet the guy any other insights on the dvd she doesnt come across theatrical just the opposite when she had good reason to dramatize she played herself down depressed youre thinking suicide was she on top of the ice or submerged partially submerged that wouldve meant severe coldpressor pain within seconds skin burns as well she was burned all right most suicides avoid pain i said and displaying yourself that way is flamboyant and exhibitionistic nothing like the woman on that disc maybe she was trying to draw attention to those three teachers in that case she wouldve left a note and made sure the dvd was out in the open not in the middle of a stack better yet shed have mailed it theres also the matter of no empty ice bags those could be out in the trash soon as were out of here ill check he took another look at the bathtub sagged yeah its murder you know it i know it his grace knows it but hed love it if you could say otherwise no signature on the note that came with the disc but i know his handwriting even when he prints thought he had integrity everythings relative i said who sells frozen co around here lets find out chapter two plastic garbage cans at the rear of the house were empty milo phoned the sanitation department found out pickup wasnt for three days ten minutes of bureaucraticmazerunning got him talking to a lab supervisor downtown yes all trash and other items from the crime scene had been taken for analysis not a clue on when that would start the case had been marked nonemergency when milo asked if empty dry ice bags and elise freemans computer were part of the haul he got put on hold the answer several minutes later raised lumps on his jaw he clicked off strode toward the unmarked no access to that information at this time we got in just as captain stan creighton returned necktie loose jacket flapping talking on a cell phone as we drove away he was still on the phone talking faster a trio of icerental outfits were situated within five miles of the murder scene at the closest two no one had purchased any frozen co for weeks both clerks said we do that mostly in the summer at garys ice house and party rentals on fulton and saticoy in van nuys a muscular puffyfaced kid with three eyebrow rings and a barbedwire biceps tattoo studied milo s card and said yeah dude bought a whole bunch staring closer homicide hes like a killer when did this happen id have to say monday what time of day id have to say seven morning or evening evening i close at eight you sell a lot of dry ice tailgate parties long trips not that much most places dont sell nuggets just block i asked dude which one he wanted hes like dry ice thirty pound in this spanish accent i gave him nuggets because we dont sell so many of those why not get rid of em out came milo s pad latino guy yeah how old i dunno thirty forty looked like one of them dudes waits for day jobs outside the paint store over there pointing west howd he pay three tens how much dry ice did that buy him thirty pounds of nuggets they come in special bags slows down the sublimation a little that means the stuff turns to gas even with bags and an ice chest youre gonna lose ten percent a day this guy have an ice chest not that i saw he just carried the bags away what was his demeanor his what his mood was he nervous friendly id have to say kinda confused and in a hurry confused how didnt know squat about what he was buying said the kid took nuggets when most people like blocks and we even trim to size how many bags of nuggets are we talking about three tenpounders dude really killed someone with di what like froze someone to death or burned em you gotta be careful with it it touches you it burns bad how else could you hurt someone with it what do you mean is there anything besides freezing or burning that makes it dangerous well said the kid i use it to kill ants you get something in a closedoff space you put a piece of di in and they get so cold their bodies stop working and also they breathe in the sublimation and die its carbon dioxide thats the global warming gas plants breathe carbon dioxide said milo they do well ants aint plants laughter my sister had an ant problem in her basement and i stuck in a piece of di block taped off everywhere couple days later millions of dead ants all over she had to vacuum them it was gross so what did the dude do were not sure do you still have the bills he paid you with nope armored car came yesterday collected everything from the register and the safe can you describe this guy a little more mexican like i said like thirty forty little guy facial hair like a beard nope clean what makes you think he was one of the day laborers he was wearing those white painters pants nodding in appreciation of his own insight the eyebrow rings jangled remember his shirt um lets see tshirt like too big for him umoh yeah white from a college uc something had a weirdlooking animal on it like a big rat with a long tongue oversized said milo like a gangbanger might wear dude was no gangbanger no tats no attitude just a confused little dude in painters pants i figured he wanted the di for a job killing ants or something wearing a college shirt but not a college guy the kid laughed dudes waiting for day labor he probably didnt even get a ged as we left i said the uc irvine mascot is an anteater and here i was thinking skunks were finally getting some respect we walked the two blocks to the paint store lots of boardedup businesses punctuated the journey with others on the brink five day laborers idled by the curb looking bored and defeated when times are bad the trickledown switches to misery all five men wore baggy white painters pants two had on white tees one shirt was printed with the disneyland logo the other was paintspecked but blank the first man who spotted us tried to walk away milo bellowed stop when that didnt work policia no la migra he talked to each worker using lapd spanish and a relatively soft detached approach no one admitted to buying dry ice most of the men claimed not to know what it was one guys eyes moved a lot and milo asked for his id first close to fifty tall thin balding droopy mustache a california drivers license was handed over with shaking hands milo s request for backup paper brought a shrug handing the man his business card he said amigo you help me i help you downcast eyes anything you wanna tell me now about a guy wears a uc irvine shirt no boss milo pointed to the card see that lieutenant that means big bossgran patron muy importante okay okay what you gran patron elise freemans dmv picture elicited a blank stare same for the other men milo handed out five cards told the men cooperating would bring good luck five blank faces stared back heading back to the car milo reread the jumpy guys stats hector ruiz lives in beverly hills north of the boulevard where the estates are some forgers got a sense of humor maybe he was a livein employee oh sure they dress him in livery and call him jeeves so you see any obvious reason for a day laborer to need thirty pounds of ice and the quantitys damn close to the techies estimate unless anteater picked his shirt with significance my bets on a paid buy to muddy the trail or nervous little dudes our killer laughing like i believe that his cell played beethovens fur elise dark joke no sense asking a twentysecond conversation ensued milo s part consisted of several yessirs each one lowered his posture he pocketed the phone summoned to the mount asap have fun we not me im invited youre demanded chapter in dream traffic the police chiefs office at parker center is a twentyminute eastbound glide from van nuys change of venue and bad traffic turned the drive into a seventyminute westbound stopandfume the stagecoach bistro abutted the ninth hole of a calabasas country club built to look exclusive but open to anyone who could come up with the monthly as we drove toward the restaurants gravel lot perfect lawns and barbered pepper trees ill suited for the climate gave way to dust and rustic fencing the sprinkle of cars out front included a navy lincoln town car that milo identified as the chiefs civilian ride no bodyguard no auxiliary vehicle in sight the building was logs and shingles a posted menu listed a french chef and described the fare as nouveautexmexthai comfort cuisine a perky ponytailed hostess guided us to a redwood picnic table tucked in a corner of a patio shaded by vegetation that fit ancient california oaks twisted by centuries of santa ana winds the chief had concealed himself behind the rhinothick trunk of the granddaddy tree he continued chopsticking as we sat pointed to two menus comfort cuisine translated to heroic portions and headacheinducing prose the chiefs rectangular platter was two feet wide whatre you having sir number six thirtytwo spicy mekong shrimp swimming in asparagus coulis and tinctured by a lemongrassoregano reduction nestled in a terroir of goatcheese livened by refried black beans and guarded by palace walls of homecured porkbelly the chief said seeing as youre a gourmet sturgis appreciate that sir the chief lowered the brim of a gray suede baseball cap instead of the usual black suit and fivehundreddollar tie he wore jeans and a brown leather bomber jacket the hat and mirrored aviator shades obscured a healthy portion of his mercilessly pitted oddly triangular face additional tortured flesh was shielded by a bushy white mustache hes one of the few people who make milo looked unscathed another ponytailed girl came over lofting a handheld computer whatre you guys having today milo said number six i scanned the menu and ordered an elk burger with bison bacon the chief said watching your cholesterol dr delaware i like bison you and buffalo bill and the plains indians you have native american in your background right along with a lot of other stuff mongrel just like me id never heard he was anything but irish he said got some seneca in there or so my paternal grandmother claimed cant be sure of that though woman was a serious drinker twirling his chopstick just like your father i didnt respond he removed the sunglasses small black eyes scanned my face like a dermatologist probing for lesions clouds the judgment serious drinking i said its a problem in some families he turned to milo what the hell were you thinking taking him along to the freeman scene without authorization then bullshitting creighton about it didnt you figure hed check with me i assumed he would sir down went the chopstick it was a fuck you no sir it was a doing my job as best i can given the constraints you cant do your job without him were talking some kind of psychological dependency here were talking preference based on past experience sir you need a shrink on board to function when cases are unusual and dr delaware has time i find his input helpful i thought you agreed so i didnt foresee any objection and creighton creightons a bureaucrat the chief retrieved the stick rolled it impressively from finger to finger the black eyes divided their time between milo and me you didnt foresee any objection based on i get it but its still bullshit amazing the doctor still puts up with you twice the chief had offered me importantsounding jobs with the department that id turned down i can see the value of shrinkery for weird cases sturgis but im not sensing any psychosexual horror on this one milo said a body packed in dry ice no obvious cause of death and a total disregard for proper procedure made it unusual to me you think its unusual doctor its different sturgis explain to you why discretion is paramount he did what exactly did he tell you that your son attends windsor tech and has applied to yale what do you think about yale top school great reputation he said just like the hedgefund wizards and the cretins at fannie mae had until they got their britches yanked and guess what was underneath empty space you dont like yale i dont care enough about the place to like or dislike doctor theyre all the same holding pens for spoiled rich brats and kids who aspire to be spoiled richer brats a few years ago the geniuses on yales admissions committee rejected thousands of smart qualified american kids but accepted some afghan whod served as the talibans spokesman want to take odds the guy ever took ap calculus and served as captain of his model un debate team then those same geniuses let in an alleged art student her idea of creativity is getting knocked up aborting the fetus and videotaping the mess after which she repeated the freak show over and over or maybe she was faking were living in bizarro world rembrandts writhing in his grave no doubt i said i have nothing against yale more than any other ivy league resort what i cant figure out is why charlie wants to go there when my wife went to columbia and penn law school and i got that ridiculous masters degree at harvardtwo years commuting to boston every week my reward was listening to puffedup fools yakking about nothing i made the mistake of attending graduation brought my wife and my mother charlie wasnt born yet they do the ceremony in harvard yard which was fine back in the seventeen hundreds when it was a little divinity school for rich twits now theres space for maybe a quarter of the people who show up they give you a predetermined seat number with preferences for rich assholes who endow buildings my wife and my eightysevenyearold mother stood for two hours in ninetydegree weather finally they get to their seats and end up not seeing a damn thing because inconsiderate twits stood in front of them the whole time a bunch of nice black ladies from the bronx were in the row behind their niece was the first person in the family to attend college they had no clue what the hell was going on my wife turned around and said these are the geniuses who ran the vietnam war theyre all the same doctor arrogant thoughtless impractical ivy league schools any elite institution its like junior high insecure assholes cant feel popular unless everyone else is an outcast head shake my kids got legacy status at columbia penn and harvard he obsesses on yale kids will do that i said be stupid and obnoxious try to differentiate themselves psychtalk he said yeah yeah thats what my wife says supposedly charlies got a tough row to hoe being under the alleged shadow of his father so he needs to find himself as an individual which is ridiculous you see me as intimidating not to him trust me hes twice as smart as me and plays the fucking cello milo s smile was fleeting but the chief saw it youre just loving this arent you im in a spot where i cant kick your ass with my customary aim and fervor to me i told charlie apply to harvard for early acceptance its nonbinding hell have a fallback no he said that wouldnt be fair to kids who really want to go to harvard guess what the average acceptance rate was last year at the big threeh y and princeton six fucking percent and this years going to be worse because of the baby boom charlies got over a when you factor in aps and honors courses and he scored on the sat only took it once sounds like a shooin right forget that fairy tale i said sounds like hes a strong applicant on his own and being your kidand your wifesshould help him why youre famous he jabbed his chest if i was a braindead actor with a braindead kid id be famous to those twits im a rightwing social climberand dont think politics doesnt play into it yeah charlies brilliant but im not booking advance flights to new haven under the best of circumstances now ive got this that stupid dvd then she actually goes and gets herself killed give the twits an excuse to pass over my kid for some some hamas engineering whiz from gaza who they can teach to build better fucking bombs and theyll jump at it i said so you dont see it as a suicide bodys packed in ice but no bags on the scene vics computers missing shes already given advance warning people are out to get her why the hell would i see it as a suicideoh jesus sharp laughter you geniuses actually thought i was gonna push suicide on you turn this into some fucking icegate give me a break i went to fucking harvard he resumed eating when milo said sir he was waved into silence milo tried again two bites later so ill be able to do my job as i see fit now said the chief youre sounding paranoid maybe youre the wrong guy for this case seeing as it has psychological overtones even paranoiacs have enemies said milo if theyre assholes they have a whole bunch the chiefs face flushed but a tirade was cut short by the arrival of our food my burger was dry and i put it aside milo feasted when hed cleared half his platter he inhaled and put his fork down sir apologies for any offense but im still not clear whats expected of me close the damn case is whats expected of you but do it with discretion what does that mean fine ill tell you do not go public on anything prior to my approval no unnecessary ruffling of feathers no loose talk about windsor prep being a den of iniquity no stomping into the place like a storm trooper no intimidation of administration faculty students janitors the squirrels that scurry up their damn trees the birds that fly in their damn airspace what about the three teachers freeman named they will be made available to you have you checked out freemans boyfriend yet the italian guy all ive done so far is visit the scene and read the file sir what there is of it what there is of it is enough for you to start on begin with the boyfriend who kills women men theyre involved with the italian turns up absolutely clean youll have access to the teachers dont pester me until then and no emails about the case to me or anyone else the same goes for recording phone calls the sole chronicle will be the murder book you will chart strictly in accordance with the regs that means no speculating in print or verbally to any civilian or any member of the department other than me got it yes sir furthermore when you are not writing or consulting said murder book you will keep it locked in your desk the same goes for your daily notes and your message slips even your damn postits will be locked up and dont photocopy anything until ive reviewed the material spearing a shrimp other than that its business as usual what about dr delaware now that youve made him a fait accompli i might as well take advantage of him im sure therell be no problem because he knows that indiscreet psychologists get bitten hard by the medical board tipping the brim of his suede cap he winked not that it would ever come to that doctor chapter we left the chief mulling flan versus flourless chocolate cake as the unmarked idled milo found sal fidellas cell number in his pad and called helpful fellow ready to meet us right now onward to sherman oaks he looked up the address in his thomas guide hmm this says its van nuys maybe ol sals a little pretentious be nice if he turns out to be a degenerate psychopath and lies about everything i said be nicer if the chiefs kid had a low iq the house was a spanish onestory on burdette court just north of burbank boulevard turned mangy by flaking gray spraycoat a brown seventies corvette occupied the driveway the neighborhood ranged from spotless cottages sporting prideofownership gardens to dumps with pavedover frontage hosting trailers and junkers fidellas place was somewhere in the middle with a neatly edged lawn but no landscaping other than a struggling banana plant inches from the sidewalk the picture window was draped with what looked like a bedsheet the corvette was dirtstreaked the concrete beneath its wellworn tires cracked and crumbling milo said he didnt spend his casino dough on decor fidella came out the door unlit cigar in hand and gave a small wave five six with a low center of gravity he wore a whiskeycolored velour sweat suit and yellow flipflops hed traded the red beard for a soul patch and let it go white a hunk of something shiny gleamed from one earlobe playah mumbled milo whats your guess diamond or zircon fidella studied us but didnt approach licking the tip of the cigar he folded an arm across his chest he look griefstricken to you wouldnt that be nice i said what he really is a murderous psychopath you close it quick charlie gets into yale and becomes president of the united states dare to dream he got out of the car sal fidella extended a hand to milo then to me hey this stinks he had deep blue eyes pudgy oversized fingers and a backslanted gait that made his upper body look as if it were hurrying to catch up with his feet a smooth basso radioannouncer voice could sell you things you didnt need the living room he led us into was bachelor cliche central black leather couches fitted with builtin head pillows and cup holders matching ottoman in lieu of a coffee table set up with ashtrays cigarette packs a cigar box a collection of remote controls a wet bar favored tequila and rum a stack of audiovisual gizmos took up most of the hearth the sixtyinch flatscreen above the mantel was tuned to espn classic no sound lakersceltics playoff from back when giants were okay wearing shortshorts the adjoining dining room was unfurnished an open doorway flashed a glimpse of bare kitchen counters the window cover wasnt a bedsheet a frayed beige curtain had come loose from its rod was held in place by duct tape and clothespins the place smelled like a cocktail lounge after closing fidella said beer guys something else no thanks said milo mind if i do suit yourself fidella slouched to the bar poured himself a double shot of silver patron selected a lime wedge from a bowl of mixed citrus segments and squirted the tequila half the drink was gone by the time he sat facing us cant believe elise is gone crazy mustve been tough discovering her said milo oh man it was out of a movie fidella sucked on his cigar and sipped i mean the moment i saw her wow it was i knew she was gone but i guess i didnt wanna accept it so i kept telling myself shed be okay it wasnt till later that it started sinking in a meaty hand slashed air permanent fidella began rooting inside an eyelid with a fingertip pulled something out studied flicked guess she wasnt being paranoid about what bastards at prepthe school she worked at she told me they were out to get her which bastards said milo fidella shook his head thats the thing she wouldnt mention names i tried to get it out of her but she changed the subject all she said was someone was out to get her yeah not how or why uhuh when did this conversation take place mr fidella maybe a month ago three weeks to be honest guys i figured she was being a drama queen elise could get like that specially that time of the month know what i mean hormonal almost kinda bipolar she could be moody one day shes sweetness and light next day its like a dark clouds over her shes all closed up when she gets like that she doesnt answer her phone what i used to do was come over try to work things out you know but she never answered the door and if i used my key shed freak out even though she was the one gave it to me in the first place tell the truth thats what i kinda assumed when she didnt return calls for three days that she was in one of those closedup situations but i went over anyway cause it wasnt that time of the month know what i mean you keep tabs on that kind of thing said milo huh no its just that when youre with a girl you get to know her rhythm so you knew elise wasnt premenstrual and you went over because she didnt answer the phone you let yourself in with your key i call out her name no answer figure maybe shes sick in the bedroom whatever im worried so yeah i go in shes not in the front not in the bedroom i go into the bathroom the doors closed i call her name she doesnt answer thats when i get this weird feeling i open the door wince see her i was gonna pull her out but she was clearly gone you know blue not moving i figured moving her wouldnt be a good thing for you guys sake preserving the scene if id moved her and messed things up youd be pissed right cause she was obviously dont think i wouldnta helped her if i could you did the right thing sal that was my intention so said milo a month or so ago she told you people at prep were out to get her she definitely used the plural huh they were out to get her more than one person hmm yeah im pretty sure yeah yeah definitely they not him thats another reason i thought she was being dramatic what do you mean everyones against her like a conspiracy was elise into conspiracies like kennedy stuff ufos nah but you know what i mean you didnt take her seriously i wouldve if shed told me something said fidella also to be honest when elise drank she could get that way what way feeling sorry for herself maybe a little paranoid about what fidella looked at the carpet twirled his cigar slugged back tequila and put the glass down to be honest guys mostly about me enough juice in elises system shed start convincing herself i didnt like her no more was gonna find myself another girl someone younger stuff like that but normally she was a great girl she could be fun im nauseoussick over what happened to her you gotta nail whoever did it he rubbed one fist with an open hand i know im not supposed to say stuff like this but you get this asshole you just leave me alone with him i used to box golden gloves back in connecticut last i heard said milo golden gloves didnt use tagteams huh they sal more than one person oh yeah well whatever leave me with all of them milo crossed his legs and spread his arms along the back of the sofa whered you meet elise a bar which one not here santa barbara place called ship ahoy off south state i was there on work santa barbara not the bar elise was on vacation she was all by herself and i was all by myself we got to talking we hit it off what kind of work do you do im in between right now back then i was a sales executive whatd you sell used to rep band equipment to schools for gosgerhardt orchestral supply theyre headquartered in akron ohio i was their west coast guy the state budget for music classes got cut my contracts started drying up for a while santa barbara was still good its a rich town but then even they started holding on to their old instruments longer i tried to switch to guitars and amps because theyre hotter than trumpets and tubas but the schools dont buy them and the megastores have that buttoned up i tried to work for guitar center or sam ash figured my experience would be a big deal they use guys in their twenties got eight million tattoos pierces heavymetal hair extensions touching his own bald head before that i used to sell truck tires airspace for office buildings exercise equipment you name it so when you met elise you were on a business trip said milo how long ago are we talking about two years give or take you two ever move in together no reason to said fidella i was traveling a lot and elise liked her own space plus she enjoyed going off on her owngirlie vacations you know thats what she was doing in santa barbara some spa they had a special elise was good at finding bargains we didnt get possessive you get what im saying everyone had their own life when we were both in the mood we enjoyed each others company milo said like that time in reno huh there was a picture in elises house you and her having a great time oh that said fidella jackpot day yeah that was a fantastic day how often does that happen never to me me ive had some nice experiences but not like that elise and me were getting eaten alive at the blackjack table left for the buffet and walked past a dollar slot just for the hell of it i tossed in a token and boom bells start ringing lights start blinking five thousand bucks i split it with elise told her she was my lucky charm you both like to gamble we like our games no harm in that if you keep it under control right elise keep it under control absolutely unlike her drinking yeah vodka was a problem for her said fidella sometimes sometimes what im saying is she wasnt one of those drunks sucks it back every day but give her a long afternoon shes not working she could put away a bottle of grey goose doing it slowly you know you wouldnt even notice unless you were with her the entire time how often did she do that it wasnt binging said fidella she could control whether or not she drank but if she felt like being a fish she had the capacity same question huh how often did she polish off a bottle i dunno maybe two three times a month maybe other times when i wasnt there i really cant tell you she paced herself what would happen was shed have spare time or one of those moody times id say something innocent shed march out and lock herself in her bedroom with her grey goose or sometimes it was gin i learned to just leave cause when it happened talking to her was no use silent treatment i said silenter than fidella let out an odd laughgirlish squeakyslapped his own mouth milo said something funny sal something stupid guys as in me i was gonna say elise could get silenter than the dead we didnt reply fidella picked up his glass finished the tequila sure you dont want nothing were fine im sure as hell not he got up poured more patron guess im still in that denial stage like when my mother passed i kept expecting to hear her voice it went on for weeks last night i dreamed about elise saw her walking through the door like the whole ice thing was a stupid joke what was the point of that the ice thats what were trying to find out sal well i say its weird elise didnt even like ice in her vodka i dont want you to think she was some drunk there was plenty of times like out to dinner shed have a nice cocktaila stinger a manhattan like anyone else she could keep control you know shed pick the time and place to finish a bottle the place was always her house what about the time when she worked she needed to be sharp whos gonna hire a teacher stumbles in drunk as a skunk what subjects did she teach english she substituted at that place anytime a regular english teacher was out she was on call like a doctor did she teach anywhere other than windsor prep not since i knew her she said they made her an offer she couldnt refuse do you know the details something like thirty grand just to be on call then thirty bucks for every hour over ten per week that she actually worked she was putting away decent dough also she did tutoring at night for that she got eighty ninety an hour more if she sniffed out the family was filthy rich how much tutoring did she do to be honest i couldnt tell you but she was busy plenty of times i called to go out and got her machine the pressure worked for her the pressure on the kids she didnt tutor just dumb kids she had smart ones too parents pushing on them she told me sometimes a kid would come in with an aminus parents wouldnt let up till the minus went away these are students from windsor prep were talking about yeah said fidella she did sat tutoring and that other test i forget the name i said the act thats the one she said all those tests were stupid and meaningless but god bless whoever invented them because rich people were so insecure they needed their kids to be perfect she could charge em big bucks for something they could do themselves what was her training what do you mean to tutor sats she went to college where somewhere in the east i dont know the thing about elise she didnt like to talk about herself he spread his palms im the kind of guy you want to know something about me ask elise was just the opposite were not going there sal she said that a lot were not going there but i stuck with her she was goodlooking could be a ton of fun milo said the times she got moody and nursed the bottle did things ever get unpleasant what do you mean she ever get aggressive elise you kidding she was a pussycat like i said shed just go into her room and you left no point staying did things ever get argumentative how can you argue with someone who wont talk that musta been frustrating sal i figured it out soon enough any idea what happened to elises computer huh her computers gone really you didnt notice i was looking for elise not some computer what kind of computer was it i dunno laptop or desktop laptopa dell i think whens the last time you saw it fidellas mouth screwed up hell if i know youre saying the killer took it makes sense if it was those bastards from the school whys that maybe elise learned something weird about some rich family put it on her computer that makes sense right anythings possible sal milo uncrossed his legs i need to ask this what was your schedule the day before you discovered elise the whole day as much of it as you can recall fidella brushed his soul patch with the side of his thumb youre asking this because i was the one found her there are basic questions we always need to ask sal fine i get it no offense taken but the blue eyes had narrowed and fidellas thighs tightened lifting his shoetips above the carpet let me just say one thing sal fidella loves women and respects them granted said milo we still need to ask where was i that day said fidella i was at star toys and novelties san pedro street the toy district why was i there trying to get a job repping crap from china they had an ad on craigslist for an opening i show up its all bullshit they had to run it to show they were being fair know what i mean theyre all chinese every one of them some of them didnt even speak no english youd think my speaking english would be a good thing right wrong they wanted someone chinese they didnt come out and say it but it was pretty damn obvious when they asked me if i spoke mandarin they couldnt put that in the ad must speak mandarin what a hassle said milo so what time were you there lets see the appointment was for eleven i showed up early maybe a quarter to they kept me waiting till noon im in there maybe five minutes sitting and listening to the guy behind the desk talk in chinese over the phone then he smiles walks me out dont call us well call you so you were out of there shortly after twelve guess so what about the early part of the morning what time did you wake up youre kidding said fidella cmon guys i loved elise we still need to ask sal what you need to do is go to that fuckin school and find out who was hassling elise she hated the place called it a hotbed of stupidity and pretentiousness she only stayed there for the money well be heading to the school soon as we finish talking to you what time did you wake up fidella exhaled maybe eight eight thirty i didnt have to get downtown until eleven i wasnt exactly setting the alarm whatd i do from then till i left at ten thirty real exciting guys i had some breakfast watched some shows i tivodrides they made over a chevy pickup if you wanna know and repo men stealing for a living some guy with a semi got his entire rig taken away talk about pissed then i took a shower got dressed drove to star toys and got shafted by the chinese what happened after you left star toys i ate lunch said fidella philippes on alameda the french dip will they remember me hell no place was jammed like it always is i waited in line ate my sandwich had a beer got the hell outta there whered i go nextby then its probably one thirty two i drive back to san pedro looking for other places i can contact for a job interview if the signs got no chinese lettering just english did i follow up when i got home hell yeah with half a dozen did it make a difference hell no oh yeah i also drove around the garment district a little never repped clothes before but its how you do it not what youre doing that counts did that work out any better hell no sorry said milo for what tough times hey said fidella it happens you wanna cheer me up find out who killed elise and leave me with em five minutes youre sure she was killed what theres no official cause of death yet sal you said you were homicide we look into suicides as well suicide why would elise commit suicide she was moody sal sometimes moods get the best of people she wasnt moody like that said fidella like what like suicidal she never talked about ending it i said those times shed drink and lock herself into her room there was no way to know how she felt but she always came out of it and got herself in a good mood how long did she take to cheer up like a day shed call me lets go out sal have a nice dinner was it ever longer than a day i dunno maybe sometimes it was two fidella cracked his knuckles elise wasnt some nutjob you guys are on the wrong path if youre thinking suicide lots of times i saw her happy why would she kill herself she did okay moneywise was even talking about getting a bigger place she own the house no its a rental she was talking about renting a bigger place and its not like she was drinking the day i found her there was no bottle in the bathroom and why the hell would she put herself on ice you answer me that milo said at this point sal weve got questions not answers lets get back to your schedule after lunch you drove around looking for possible employment then what then like i said i drove home and got on the phone and came up empty you want my phone records if you dont mind fidella stared youre serious we need to be sal fine look at my phone records i got nothing to hide milo had him sign a release form fidella said you guys are unbelievable you wanna bother suit yourselves but i can tell you what youre gonna find i made calls to a buncha places downtown real short calls no one gave me the time of day frustrating i said been through it before somethingll turn up milo said what time did you finish making your calls musta been fiveish five thirty took a walk over to van nuys boulevard theres a bar arnie josephs i had a coupla drinks some shrimp and wasabi peas and hickory almonds and watched tv over there theyll remember me they know me just do me a favor dont tell them im a suspect or nothing i dont need no one looking at me weird no problem said milo fidella studied him whatre you gonna tell em that youre a witness when did you leave arnie josephs musta been eightish eight thirty whatd i do then go home fix myself a sandwichanchovies tomatoes and mozzarella cheese then i called elise because she still wasnt picking up so i watched more tivo had a beer brushed my teeth and used mouthwash for the cheese and the anchovies just in case elise answered she didnt i said forget about her shell call you like she always does then i got worried cause this was longer than usual and drove over musta been close to elevenish you were home for most of the evening seeing as the yacht was out of commission and the malibu beach house was being borrowed by brad and angelina yeah i was home where else should i go fidella slumped and his eyes grew sad as if his question had turned metaphysical nowhere to go he said we left him pouring a third tequila chapter milo drove a block from fidellas house parked and called in a search for current wants and warrants clean but fidella had paid a fine for a firstoffense dui eighteen months ago time to verify his whereabouts ill drop you off first you see him as a serious suspect i see him as someone whose whereabouts need to be verified planning on taking van nuys to the glen yup youll pass that bar on the way arnie josephs good times inn sat north of riverside your basic dim tobaccobitter seriousdrinker establishment the octogenarian behind the bar verified sal fidellas account so did bowls of dried shrimp that looked like fish food hickory almonds wasabi peas mention of fidellas name elicited smirks from the other customers a woman nursing a beer said sal fidella the luckiest fella lucky how said milo he won a jackpot in reno didnt he tell you he tells everyone claim to fame said a man the woman put her beer down fifty stout grayhaired wearing a pink waitress uniform created by the same sadist who designs bridesmaids dresses so whats he a witness to a crime not some getrichquick thing sals into that sal talks a lot about what coulda been shoulda been whats he a witness to a crime she shrugged turned away milo walked up to her anything else i should know not from me she buried her face in her mug another man said hey if sal had enough money he could finance an infomercial sell a million of something you ask him what something is he says it dont matter thats cause money aint the issue smarts is said a guy nursing a tall glass of something amber milo said sals not smart wins a tengrand jackpot and blows it in a day you tell me the guy next to him said straight down the toilet oughta work for the government laughter slithered up and down the bar milo distributed business cards like a vegas dealer a few people actually read them anything else anyone wants to tell me about sal a man laughed we love sal sometimes he even offers to pick up a tab back in the car milo said tells us five tells them ten even a bunch of alkies know hes a loser elise was an educated woman smart enough to teach at prep and tutor sats why would she hang with someone like that love i said the ultimate mystery seriously alex im trying to know my victim people tend to select mates they think they deserve elise didnt like herself so she aimed low im not saying she thought it through but low selfesteem generally shoves you downhill its also a factor in depressioncause as well as effect fidella claims elise withdrew only when she drank but who knows on the dvd her words werent slurred on the contrary she seemed focused so either shed built up enough tolerance over time to maintain or alcohol wasnt the only thing that laid her low sexual harassment could do that he said any other situation youd already be talking to those teachers he frowned and drove south to ventura boulevard headed west and connected to beverly glen people get what they think they deserve huh whats that say about rick and me ricks smart affluent handsome strip away all that morose irish cop stuff and ill bet you feel pretty nifty about yourself only on alternate wednesdays he said we wont get into ricks psyche robins pickup was parked in front of the house i found her in her studio at the back carving the top of a mandolin spruce shavings created a soft creamy carpet at her feet blanche had found herself a warm spot and burrowed cozy as elise freeman in her bed of frozen carbon dioxide the studio smelled like a conifer forest after a drizzle that brought back autumns in missouri walking through the parkland behind the little sad house i grew up in a kid with a head full of fear and confusion sneaking out when mom escaped to her locked room and dad raged at highburn hoping id get lost i smiled and kissed robin she put down her chisel flexed her fingers perfect timing im ready to quit the mandolin top was smooth curvy with a subtly arched belly unmistakably female nice robin tapped the spruce a musical tone rang out the musics already in the wood my job is to not screw it up any serious job is like that we headed for the house pausing by the fishpond to feed the koi blanche stuck by us smiling in that strange but endearingly humanoid way over coffee i told robin about the woman on ice she said someone bragging im a stonecold killer interesting slant long days carving i get symbolic i filled her in on the chief she said politicians are a low lifeform the chiefs appointed his commoditys power alex that puts him two notches below slime mold my girlfriend the anarchist if only she said if only you were an anarchist if only reality made anarchy a reasonable approach that evening i was at my computer keywording windsor prep and learning nothing beyond official pr i switched to victimology elevenyearold elise freeman from great neck new york had an artful myspace page that showcased her pastel drawings and successful orthodonture ninetysixyearold elise freeman had just celebrated her birthday in pepper pike ohio and received a card from the cleveland cavaliers no hits on elise freeman deceased tutor when milo rang in at nine forty i said shes cyberinvisible fidella was right about her liking her privacy everything else fidella told us is checking out including his calls to elise four hours before she died the phone subpoena only covered one week of his account im preparing another one for elises well see how far back theyll let me go for the time being sals out of the spotlight had a beer and watched tv at home isnt much of an alibi thats what his augustness said i asked him for alternative suspects and he responded with lessthanpristine language ten minutes later his secretary calls back weve got face time with windsor preps president guy named edgar helfgott saw his name on the website i said a parent no at prep thats a paid job helfgott used to be the headmaster before they created the position for him and moved him into the oval office his assistant is now the headmaster a dr rollins under her is an assistant headmaster and it keeps going the place is structured like a fortune corporation anyway helfgott will grant us an audience tomorrow at eleven youll never guess where some manse the school lets him use as an official residence even better chapter edgar helfgott deplaned from the gulfstream v a trim rockjawed uniformed pilot descended behind him lugging two burnished leather suitcases the aircraft was sleek and white the same could be said for helfgott pausing at the bottom of the stairs he removed and pocketed a pair of earplugs gazed up at the silver sky rotated his neck quiet time at santa monica airport lots of private jets parked on the tarmac but no other takeoffs or landings after a bit of negotiation milo s badge had gained us access to the field we stood five yards behind helfgotts prearranged black escalade moments before the gulfstreams arrival wed made small talk with the chauffeur yes hed driven mr helfgott a few times but didnt really know him the man didnt talk much always read books in the car unlike the man who owned the plane and the car and paid the drivers salary mr wydette talks to you like a regular guy lets you know whats on his mind whats mr wydettes first name myron said the chauffeur not that i ever use it milo said what did he do to afford a plane fruit fruit peaches apricots that kind of thing he owns a lot of land i dont know the details he lend the plane out often nah mostly its the family sometimes its mr helfgott mr helfgotts a frequent flier the driver frowned i dont keep a list he headed back toward his suv milo and i followed wheres mr helfgott flying in from this morning the driver opened his door i just show up where they tell me he got inside the suv up went the windows milo looked back at the building behind us a fixed base of operations called diamond aviation the pretty young female concierge in the marbleandglass terminal had responded with the same level of protectiveness unless youre homeland security were not allowed to give out flight information can i get you guys some coffee one step from the bottom of the jets stairs helfgott spotted us showing no sign of surprise or recognition he snatched his bags from the pilot toted them to the escalade and placed them in the trunk rotating his neck again he shot his cuffs as he walked toward us expressionless morning i think ed helfgott six feet tall and somewhere in his sixties windsor preps president was thin and angular but slightly broad in the beam with the kind of pale waxy skin that shaves well and connotes long nights of scholarly study longish rusty hair streaked with silver swept back over a high brow and broke over his collar in waves the glasses were owlish framed in tortoiseshell a gold watch chain hung from the vest of a whiskeycolored glen plaid suit tailored to give him more shoulder his shirt was limegreen broadcloth his tie a hugely knotted ocher foulard a yellow handkerchief flecked with brown was stuffed haphazardly into a breast pocket just short of tumbling thanks for meeting with us sir helfgott scanned milo s card absently my pleasure lieutenant i do hope this doesnt stretch on for too long sudden incongruous smile im a bit tuckered long journey journeys plural said helfgott monday was a conference in dc then on to new york to interface with some alums followed by a jaunt over the pond to london and back for a stop in cambridge mass london in particular posed challenges scaffolding everywhere and despite the financial vicissitudes the pace and magnitude of construction remain promethean unfortunately so does the volume of motor traffic none of my destinations were in walking distance from my lodgings in mayfair so a fair bit of ingeniousness was at play i said school business in london helfgotts thin lips turned up what resulted was the initial knifeslice for a jackolantern mouth if youre asking was it a holiday quite the opposite i interfaced with my equal numbers at oxbridge cambridge and lsethe london school of economics a high school administrator with counterparts at three major universities i said smoothing the way for your graduates most of my time was spent listening as they tried to attract our alums in a world of growing globalism windsor prep people are regarded as prime intellectual property creators rather than prisoners of destiny if you will one of our grads attended oxford twenty years ago and ended up settling in scotland hes just been shortlisted for the booker prize congrats said milo sounds like ultraprime propertykind of like wagyu beef helfgott squinted sir wagyu i know what wagyu is lieutenant what im failing to see is the crux of your analogy the stuff comes from pampered cows right back in japan they get to guzzle beer snarf gourmet grub have regular massages all that to keep the meat tender then theyre shipped off to dates with destiny helfgott removed his specs ripped the silk handkerchief free wiped both lenses energetically glancing at the escalade he pulled out his pocket watch i was close enough to see it had stopped six hours ago that didnt stop helfgott from tsktsking later than i thought how say we wend our way to the lounge do whatever it is you feel is important then we can all be on our merry ways diamond aviations waiting area was thirty feet high walled in glass with air spiced by cinnamonflavored airfreshener a man in a white jumpsuit drymopped the black marble floor no jetsetters occupied the puce leather seating off to the side a couple of boredlooking pilots studied a computer terminal one said something about weather in roseville the other said maybe well get delayed enough to stick around and try that sushi place without being asked the same cute concierge addressed helfgott by name as she set down a glass of soda water and lime change your mind about coffee guys no thanks anything else mr helfgott not for the moment amy thank you anytime mr helfgott she sashayed away he drank rotated his neck yet again milo said are you in pain sir chronic condition exacerbated by age and toofrequent air travel lieutenant yoga helped for a while then some unfortunate personal training led to sprains precisely where i didnt need them he eyed myron wydettes jet through the glass now being fueled by a tanker truck held his gaze and inhaled as if yearning to be aloft nice piece of machinery mr helfgott work of art lieutenant i wont pretend its not immeasurably superior to commercial aviation but in the last analysis flying is flying one strives to eat properly stretch hydrate oneself nevertheless the hours of enforced immobility take their toll as soon as we wrap up whatever it is you feel you need to do im going to swim then settle in a warm bath and pop off to sleep sounds good sir what have you been told about this meeting mr wydettes office called me midflight to inform me that poor elise freeman had passed on and the police had requested to speak with me i took that to assume an irregular death all the emotion of a chia pet he continued admiring the gulfstream until his eyes lost focus somewhere else maybe thinking about his bath milo said if by irregular you mean other than old age thats true sir how dreadful said helfgott may i ask when and where it occurred and the particulars several days ago at her house sir the particulars remain the big question im not sure i understand lieutenant mode of death hasnt been determined so theres no obvious crime milo didnt answer helfgott finally swiveled away from the jet field and you requested to speak with me because elise freeman worked at prep surely you cant imagine her passing has anything to do with her job was she happy at prep why wouldnt she be any job can be stressful sir helfgott put his water glass down removed his specs his eyes were small diminished further by heavy lids with watery hazel irises i dont customarily deal with faculty issues but if thered been a serious problem i assume id have heard about it in fact she seemed quite pleased at the contract we offered her after i received mr wydettes call i immediately phoned headmaster rollins and she confirmed that fact as well as the fact that ms freeman had been happily and uneventfully employed sounds like you wondered yourself if her death had anything to do with prep back went the glasses not at all lieutenant i am not a brilliant thinker and i attempt to compensate for my intellectual deficits with meticulousness thats a lesson i try to pass on to our less inspired students rara avises though they are preps website says you graduated cum laude from brown helfgott smiled youve researched me i read the website well lieutenant that was a different brown now what else can i help you with when did you offer ms freeman her contract she came on as a per diem temporary employee four years ago a year later we offered her more steady employment i remain puzzled by that termmode of death shes being processed by the coroner as we speak how grim sounding so it could be a medical condition one of those rough patchesan aneurysm at this point anythings possible mr helfgott then why may i ask am i talking to homicide detectives we investigate any unusual death helfgott tucked his handkerchief tighter i see when can we expect some definitive answers as to mode of death i really cant say mr helfgott are we talking days weeks an inordinate amount of time i really cant answer that sir surely some kind of narrowing milo leaned in closer sir i know from your website that preps got a great mocktrial team maybe the best in the country you guys took high national honors last year all those bigtime lawyers kids no surprise but right now its best if i ask the questions helfgotts manicured fingers grazed the tips of the handkerchief mea culpa lieutenant i didnt mean to upset your investigatory routine i was simply thinking of our students and faculty the news of elises death is going to be upsetting particularly if the mode is unusual ergo the sooner we can offer accurate information the sooner closure will arrive faint smile i should point out that the captain of that extraordinary debate team was the daughter of a neurosurgeon not an attorney i stand corrected sir so ms freemans employment was uneventful we paid her handsomely her duties were light no reason for her to be unhappy what was her salary helfgotts hand waved i dont get involved in that kind of thing but typically our salaries are the best in the preparatory school universe do you work regularly with the chief of police lieutenant we talk when necessary i ask that because when myronmr wydetterequested that i meet with you immediately as a favor to the chief of police i was surprised whys that sir mr wydette emphasized the chiefs affection for prep and how its benefited his son charlie who if you werent aware is a graduating senior milo remained silent helfgott said until now the chief and charlies mother have been rather lowprofile members of the prep parent community no participation no donations no asskissing have you met charlie lieutenant no sir not a social boy but bright were not easily impressed so tell your boss not to push it milo pulled out his pad so to your knowledge ms freeman never complained about any problems with students or facultywith anyone at prep lieutenant we seem to be hovering over a single issue and not moving forward appreciably are you saying youre aware of a complaintlet me amend that to a statement it sounds as if you doubt my word about ms freemans sanguine employment history hard glint behind the eyeglasses not at all sir and sorry for implying that like you said you dont usually get involved in faculty issues but unfortunately weve become involved in just that helfgotts waxy skin paled to cold tallow what exactly are you saying were in possession of a communication from ms freeman in which she claims she was sexually harassed by fellow teachers at prep spots of color splashed on helfgotts sunken cheeks his lips twitched ludicrous milo thumbed through his pad three other teachers to be exact enrico hauer james winterthorn pat skaggs are those individuals still employed at prep this is beyond absurd helfgott had kept his tone low enough to discourage eavesdroppers but something in his body language caused one of the pilots to turn milo said im sure youre right but with ms freeman deceased we need to check it out enrico jimno thats not possible so they are still working there of course theyre still with us no reason they shouldnt be helfgott rose to his feet teetered regained balance by clutching the arm of his chair im sorry lieutenant i know youve got your job to do but so do i ergo i cannot continue in this vein without benefit of legal counsel not because those outrageous accusations are anything but slanderous rubbish pausing to let that sink in because my responsibility to prep precludes me from exposing the school to untrammeled attack without prior consultation institutions cant be slandered sir only individuals well then enrico jim and pat have been slandered and i wont have it milo stood no ones saying the accusations are true mr helfgott but my responsibilities preclude me from ignoring them and im sure all three of the individuals in question will appreciate the chance to clear their names i dont see why theyd need to the point of todays meeting was extending a courtesy to you sir as well as to prep i need to have access to enrico jim and pat and rather than disrupt your school during working hours im giving you the opportunity to set up offcampus interviews at a discreet time and place stepping closer he invaded helfgotts personal space his bulk turned helfgott into a small man furthermore its essential that my courtesy doesnt lead to advance preparation on the part of enrico jim and pat meaning i expect you not to alert them as to the purpose of the interviews helfgott backed away two steps nostrils flaring beads of moisture collecting under the rims of his eyeglasses the police chief has authorized this the police chief takes his responsibilities seriously how interesting suddenly helfgotts hand landed on milo s shoulder patted im sure youre a fine dedicated police lieutenant sir merely doing your job however i must do mine i cannot commit to a course of action without conferring with professionals well chat in due time he headed toward the electric doors that opened to the tarmac before he got there the concierge pushed a button and the doors swung open helfgott marched toward the escalade the driver popped out hurried to open the passenger door milo said who says teachings a thankless job as we passed the desk the concierge looked up from her copy of elite traveler smiling and murmuring bye guys her eyes said wed soiled the furniture chapter as we passed from santa monica into west la milo placed a call to the chiefs office failed to get past the first secretarial rung and hung up so what do you think of il presidente loves his job will do anything to keep it perks like hes got hed probably kill to keep it alex tapping the wheel too bad pompositys not a felony i thought your beef analogy was particularly astute yeah my high school experience was ground chuck you know what really irritated me alex that patronizing false modestyim just a poor dumb hardworking mope who somehow managed to earn a cum laude at brown a different brown i said but there might be some truth to that like the chief said most of the ivies began as divinity schools but they quickly became repositories for rich white boys later when quotas were relaxed they became meritocracies but helfgotts old enough for the premerit days you were a whiz kid how come you didnt go ivy my high school was blue collar same as yours the guidance counselors directed kids to the trades most of my friends never even thought about college i aimed higher because i knew i needed to get away from my family the night i left missouri i snuck out without saying goodbye hit the road in a clunker id bought on the sly sixteen years old gutsy boy it was a matter of survival i said and heres something ive never told anyone i enrolled at the u under false pretenses my mother had an old friend whod made her own escapemoving to oakland becoming a teacher she knew what i was contending with lied about being my aunt and my guardian claimed id been a california resident for years without that i couldve never afforded the outofstate tuition i stayed with her for two weeks mowed her lawn painted her gutters then i bought her some daisies left a note and cut out again in the middle of the night drove down to la it wasnt until my postdoc at langley porter that i even saw oakland again my buddy the miscreant time to revoke your degrees i said frauds below your pay grade a mile later if you add up the alumni contributions ive made they exceed the difference he laughed everything needs to be atoned for huh you have to start somewhere back at his office milo phoned dr clarice jernigan at the coroners office last year hed closed the murder of one of jernigans investigators a man named bobby escobar though the solve was officially recorded as a sheriffs homicide victory back when the case had looked hopeless jernigan flippantly offered to trade priority cutting for resolution on bobby woman of her word milo switched his phone to conference as jernigans crisp voice filled his tiny office just sewed up your victim milo which demigod do you have inroads with besides me what do you mean doc freemans body comes in leapfrogs immediately over our backlog straight to the table along with an unsigned message slip on different paper from the ones we use with orders for me to get to it stat and keep the findings to myself when i call my boss hes not in even though i know he is my ci is sure the slip wasnt with the body when it came in our drivers say the same thing so somehow this body got tagged without our spotting it i figure maybe it was you youre pushing our arrangement a bit but fine then moments after the body hits the table someone calls my private cell linethe ones my kids useand warns me to be discreet on elise freeman i think the exact phrase was this needs to be handled ultraquietly when i try to ask why she hangs up whos she someone who identified herself as calling from parker is it true probably whats going on milo i googled freeman and shes not rich or famous or otherwise noteworthy its complicated doc meaning shut up and cut said jernigan well i put my irritation aside and did both and heres what ive got for you freemans blood alcohol was over three times the legal limit plus shed ingested some kind of opiate no needle marks so she probably snorted precise metabolites will take time to analyze theres also clear pulmonary evidence of an overdose in a relatively healthy young woman relative to what she had a smidge of atherosclerosis and some hepatic scarringthe beginnings of cirrhosis meaning she couldve been hitting the sauce pretty hard clogged arteries could also be boozerelated or she had bad genetics or both but none of that wouldve proved problematic in the short run she had years to go before she slept there are no signs of violence to the body no damage to the hyoid to indicate strangulation same for ocular petechiae no sexual assault and shes never been pregnant cause of death is overdose mode of death is up for grabs could it be an accidental od or suicide or homicide my ci didnt spot any vomitus at the scene or other signs of a seizure same for empty liquor bottles or drug baggies that dry ice bath is bizarre never seen that before i suppose it couldve been some sort of erotic game that she played by herself though its hard to see how she couldve withstood the agony could she have odd herself into stupor slipped into the ice just before losing consciousness i suppose its theoretically possibletalk about feeling no pain any idea where the ice came from my ci didnt see any bags either i just got the case doc given a drugged state said jernigan id expect her to plunge rather than slip and that wouldve caused a mess maybe even a head bump there was none of that dry ice doesnt melt it sublimates so you wouldnt expect puddles but still she was tucked in too perfectly and skin burns say shed been in there for a while we both know this is homicide but i dont have enough to put that in writing any way to know if she was alive or dead when she got put in rosiness in the burns suggests alive but on the stand my answer would be i dont know how come you caught it when its a valley case my silence is profound doc got it said jernigan well good luck thanks doc if you really want to show your gratitude said jernigan continue to keep me out of the loop milo phoned the lab ate some double talk engaged in a spirited conversation with someone named bill and said i dont get clarification right now im coming over to do a handson instructions from above bill said what do you mean above use your imagination i dont get paid for that see you in thirty thats not going to work milo per our specific instructions my instructions are as of five minutes ago and they trump your instructions who are yours from said bill from where you cant go higher just like that youve got a direct line to god santa too dont believe me heres the number now tell me what i need to know were there dry ice bags at the scene empty booze bottles drugs or drug paraphernalia negative on the bags said bill one empty grey goose bottle in the kitchen negative on the dope and heres a freebie the only prints throughout the house are the vics and thats just on a corner of the bed which is not right my guess someone wiped the place down but im not allowed to guess on this one now do me a favor okay what dont call for a while chapter the following noon milo phoned ready for a dta meeting it took a moment to process that theres a detectiveteacher association there is now his exaltedness just let me know three members of windsor preps faculty will avail themselves to me at two pm three fifteen and four thirty not at the school god forbid some address in beverly hills i said arbitrary time limits dont help sir he said be thankful youre getting more than a fortyfiveminute hour ask delaware that was his way of saying you can be there are they coming with lawyers didnt get the chance to ask heres the place mccarty drive two blocks south of wilshire i said nice neighborhood who lives there guess well find out when we get there we got there twenty minutes early the house was a white twostory mediterranean with diamond mullion windows a front courtyard teeming with flowers beginning to go to seed a lawn greener than envy a for sale sign was staked to the left of a gracefully winding stone footpath the front door was unlocked we stepped into a high tiled entry clean warm light filtered to the right of a sinuous staircase in an otherwise empty living room a woman sat reading in a folding chair from what i could see the entire house was vacant she put her book down ash blond midforties she wore a black pantsuit and a white silk blouse with ruffles that spilled over her lapels like whipped cream the book was a fourinchthick bio of lincoln she placed it on the chair lieutenant doctor youre a little early and you are mary jane rollins her face was round soft and unlined pale eyes and lashes said the blond was probably a renewal of her childhood nice to meet you headmaster rollins mr helfgott assigned you to me dr helfgott she said standing hes got an edd in educational administration and yes he asked me to facilitate edd from brown said milo rollins cocked an eyebrow from the u going the public route huh the u runs a fine program in education lieutenant you send many of your students there when appropriate if you dont mind ive got some reading to do weve set up a back room for your as long as youre here lets chatis it dr rollins curt nod what can you tell us about elise freeman nothing dr helfgott hasnt told you dr helfgott told me he doesnt get involved in faculty matters so youd be the person to ask i can tell you about elises lesson plans but im sure thats not going to help you was she happy at prep of course of course why wouldnt she be happy smiling suddenly jarringly as to her private life thats a matter about which i have no information no socializing with the help huh rollins fingered the frothy blouse my knowledge of elise is limited to the hours she worked at prep she was a diligent substitute teacher unfailingly responsible thats why you gave her a standing contract whether or not she worked we felt it was the best way to provide her a sense of security teaching as im sure youre aware is not a lucrative profession dr helfgott said you pay better than anyone we certainly do even so the life of a substitute is unpredictable and many people need to supplement which is how elise came to our attention shed tutored several of our students had produced excellent results raising sat scores doing what was necessary meaning correcting deficits and aiming people in the proper direction now if you dont mind who owns this house dr rollins she licked her lips i do more precisely i own half divorce another abrupt smile ergo the sale another ergo i wondered if the school offered a latin course sorry said milo dont be its in everyones best interest my ex and i have both moved on literally and figuratively got yourself a nice condo mary jane rollinss mouth tightened my living circumstances are relevant my bad doctor sorry as a matter of fact ive acquired a condominium much more suitable to my current circumstances leaving my ex to contend with his dogs his fish his children and all the hideous furniture he brought with him from his previous marriage now if you dont mind ill doctor did elise freeman have any conflict with anyone at prep not that i know of and certainly not with the three people youll be interrogating shortly we dont interrogate maam we interview i stand corrected milo said what about dissatisfied customers parents or students who didnt like her results rollins tugged at her ruffles lieutenant you cant seriously be suggesting someone did harm to elise because their sat scores were below expectation impossible beyond impossible hmmlets be hypothetical for a moment dr rollins say theres a student ambitious reasonably smart comes from a long line of ivy alumssay harvard his dad granddad bunch of greatgranddads went to harvard say all the way back to john adams one of those whatchamacallits legacies said rollins exactly a serious legacy maybe some of those ancestors werent even that bright back then places like harvard were repositories for rich white boys unfortunately for our brightbutnogenius applicant now youve got to be supersmart like another student at the same prep school im talking certified genius lieutenant we send far more than two alums a year to harvard granted but not everyone gets in right even from a great place like prep silence milo said so on top of the national competition theres competition among your students okay so what if the morning of the sat that legacy kid smart but not as smart as the other kid happens to find himself with access to an unpleasant chemical and the geniuss can of soft drink is all by itself this is absurd lieutenant is it thats exactly what happened a few years ago at an elite east coast school the victim didnt die but he was sick for a long time mary jane rollinss hand flew to pale lips i dont know where you learn these things ive certainly never heard of this and regardless a prep alum would never stoop to something so utterly criminally repellent im sure youre right dr rollins but my point is high stakes can lead to desperate behavior now let me repeat my question to your knowledge were any students or parents highly dissatisfied with elise freeman enough to complain to you a beat no lieutenant did anyone complain to dr helfgott or to anyone else in administration no one mary jane rollinss hands relaxed lieutenant faced with a baffling case im sure you need to hypothesize imaginatively all i can tell you is youre way off the mark if you believe elises death had anything to do with our people one of preps virtues is our ability to combine rigorous academic training with the instillation of solid moral values weve gone so far as to adapt vanlights moral dilemma training into our curriculum our students wrestle with a variety of complex choices i said vanlight committed suicide after being accused of sexually harassing his students rollins studied me like a zoologist confronting a new species be that as it may now i do need to return to president lincoln hes the topic of my upcoming chautauquathats a miniseminar ill be offering the graduating seniors next semester freeing the slaves said milo good timing doctor pardon graduating seniors are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel you could call it their own emancipation proclamation before rollins could reply the doorbell rang chapter the man at the door was young sparely built with an elfin face cropped hair the color of muddy water a scatter of freckles and searching green eyes he wore a white buttondown shirt blue slacks brown loafers mightve passed for a windsor prep senior mary lou rollins said thanks for being punctual jim lieutenant this is mr james winterthorn assistant head of our science department winterthorn took our hands warily offering limp dampish fingers i wish i knew what this was about come on in sir and well educate you rollins led us past the staircase to a rear space that looked out to a vestpocket garden empty bookshelves working fireplace cable hookup for the flatscreen that once sat over the mantel the family room back when rollins had adapted to the life her husband had brought with him two folding chairs faced a third with seven or eight feet between them milo narrowed the gap by half directed winterthorn to the singleton turned to rollins enjoy your book doctor somewhere other than the house please i was instructed to remain here lieutenant sturgis i respect that maam however youre being reinstructed lieutenant please dont put me in an awkward situation heaven forbid you can stay close just not inside my suggestion is you take a stroll weathers good rodeo drive s not far otherwise well have to be the ones who leave with mr winterthorn winterthorn followed the exchange with growing agitation rollins said ill have to report this milo said good idea nothing like open communication when it comes to inculcating solid moral values rollinss footsteps on hardwood were followed by the thump of a closing door james winterthorn sat with his hands in his lap his bare forearms were pallid hairless prominently veined milo said thanks for coming sir i really didnt have a choice dr helfgott pulls me out of my chem class he obviously feels its important did he explain why it was important actually it was his office i spoke to shehis secretarysaid elise freeman had passed away and the police needed to talk to faculty members i dont understand why what was your relationship with elise freeman relationship we were colleagues so to speak so to speak she subbed english and history i teach chem and physics never the twain shall meet science faculty tends to stick with science faculty and so on maybe that kind of tribalism is embedded in our dna so not much socializing at work said milo what about after hours i wouldnt know about that lieutenant youre not much for socializing i have a girlfriend we plan to move in together at the end of the school year between work and hanging out with emily my days are pretty full emilys a teacher too shes a medical student at the u you both live by yourselves at present winterthorn blushed we both live with our parents its not ideal but with the economic situation the way it is we felt maximizing our savings will give us a leg up on ownership where do your parents live encino south or north of the boulevard south said winterthorn nice my fathers a neurosurgeon dad and girlfriend are both doctors said milo my brother and sister as well youre the rebel winterthorn smiled premed didnt work for you the smile vanished why is my educational history important to you just trying to get to know you jim how old are you twentynine how long have you been working at prep two years whatd you do between college and work frown got a masters and began work on a phd in physics still working on the phd ill finish the dissertation eventually whered all this education take place mit undergrad u mich for grad school milo whistled you teach anything else at prep advanced placement chem ap physics and a seminar in the biophysics of ecology offered to students who get as in the ap classes the lowdown on global warming were a bit more complex than that milo edged closer winterthorns startled look said what did i do chemistry you work with dry ice winterthorn giggled something funny jim my fifthgrade science teacher brought dry ice into class and did volcano tricks trying to show us science could be cool no lieutenant were a bit beyond that in ap theres an emphasis on computation its basically a collegelevel curriculum no volcanoes said milo too bad when my teacher did that i was convinced science was cool winterthorn turned serious are you saying dry ice had something to do with elises with what happened what were your impressions of elise jim winterthorns thin frame pressed against his seatback as if trying to will the chair into reverse she seemed conscientous seemed im sure she was occasionally id see her making herself available after hours you noticed her afterhours because i do the same thing myself do the students appreciate that kind of dedication i would think so did elise have any particular favoritesstudents she hung out with more than others i wouldnt knowcan you tell me what this is about im assuming theres something suspicious about her death why else would we be talking to police detectives milo handed winterthorn his card the young mans eyes widened she was definitely murdered definitely what i mean is the immediacy said winterthorn something so terrible hitting so close he sounded more fascinated than horrified mightve been describing a complex molecule so said milo no favorites you were aware of i wasnt paying attention what about conflict with anyone at prep students faculty janitors absolutely nothing like that said winterthorn if she did have problems with someone would you have known jim what do you mean being in the mathscience tribe that demarcation applies to socializing said winterthorn shifting his weight and scratching the bridge of his nose preps an intimate place significant events can attain broad coverage if elise was experiencing significant conflictsomething that would lead to yes i might know about that but i never heard a thing youre saying theres a welloiled gossip mill operating not really its just important facts travel what did the mill have to say about elise winterthorn bit his lip im not comfortable talking behind her back especially now now is when you need to talk behind her back jim that back is currently resting on the cold steel surface of a coroners dissection table winterthorn shuddered good lord you dont pull punches do you ive found that unhelpful when dealing with murder murder this is surreal lets get back to the gossip question jim what did loose lips flap about concerning elise do i have to be quoted on this in your official documentyour file whatever you call it not if youre forthcoming jim smooth lie winterthorn rubbed his eyes i cant vouch for this firsthand but yes there was talk to the effect that elise had a drinking problem i certainly never saw it but people claimed they had which people other teachers names please i jim this is important please dont say it came from me deal who jim enrico hauer he teaches psychology and urban studies he claimed hed seen elise drunk at school head shake at a bar which one i didnt ask he said she was pretty much wasted are we talking a single episode or a pattern he claimed hed smelled it on her breath at work and what did mr hauer do with this information nothing said winterthorn at least as far as i know i didnt want to hear it i try to remain above the fray what fray is that its an expression lieutenant i dont like getting involved in other peoples issues winterthorns voice had taken on metal tightened posture brought out muscle in the thin pale arms small man but sinewy with square shoulders maybe stronger than he looked milo said what about drugs that i never heard said winterthorn are you saying drugs were somehow used in conjunction with dry ice because as a chemist i really cant come up with an obvious scenario so you never hung out with elise never so if someone else testified that you did hang out with her theyd be lying winterthorns eyes raced from side to side who told you that what would you say if i told you elise did id say thats ridiculous milo summarized the dvd winterthorn gripped the sides of his chair burst into tears lips churning milo said that goes beyond hanging out jim winterthorn rocked clutched his hair as his mouth continued to work soundlessly two strangled words finally escaped only once chapter james winterthorn kept shaking milo said tell us about the one time you know already why play games know what jim its your strategy said winterthorn dont ask questions unless you already know the answer lawyers do that bitter smile moms a litigator tell us anyway jim one damn time okay we were both working late and then we walked to our cars together and thats where it happened in one of your cars hers i walked her there being a gentleman and all that arid laugh she thanked me and kissed my cheek winterthorns arms crossed his chest she turned her head cheek turned into mouth and then whats the difference it was one time neither of us talked about it again and there was certainly no harassment and if she claimed different she was obviously deranged milo kept silent in point of fact winterthorn went on she was the aggressorshe initiated i was just stupid we didnt even have conventional sexno that came out wrong im not implying anything weird or kinky im just saying we didnt have intercourse understand not fully jim she went down on me okay winterthorn sprang up walked to the french doors looked out at impatiens begonias ferns a cute little pathway fashioned from round pond stones and then it was over and we never talked about it and its not relevant because elise wasnt significant to me and im sure the same went for her he faced us i was nothing to her she made that clear howd she do that jim after she finished she wiped her mouth and laughed and said dont make a big deal of that jimmy i was just in a mood that kind of attitude could make someone mad the only one i was mad at was myself ive always prided myself on being faithful and up until that point i had been i was a total ass no excuse i still dont understand how it happened but i certainly didnt pursue her just the opposite i wanted nothing to do with her she took you by surprise jim she sure as hell did but i was an ass nonetheless i know this sounds like something a woman would say but the entire episode made me feel dirty feeling dirty could make someone mad i didnt kill her winterthorn pounded a pane rocked on the balls of his feet goddammit why dont you sit back down jim i prefer to stand milo said im going to give you a time span and id like you to tell me where you were during that period he outlined the parameters of the murder day winterthorn said i was withno i wasnt with emily thank god i was with my mother she wasnt feeling well and my father was at a conference so i went and sat with her facing us theres no reason to drag emily into this right hopefully not jim please i had nothing to do with elises death even though she made you feel cheap an isolated event said winterthorn i put it behind me something like that a lot of guys would remember it fondly im not a lot of guys guess not that doesnt mean im a killer milo said lets go back to that event for a sec you tell it as elise coming on to you she tells it as persistent sexual harassment thats insane i have no idea why shed say that why me of all people who then winterthorn looked to the side thats not what i meant what did you mean jim winterthorn slumped this is crazy totally crazy dr helfgott pulls me out of class and now im being interrogated like a criminal interviewed said milo i feel interrogated worseintimidated like guantanamo how did you and elise get along after the event i avoided her she made you nervous maybe thats why she made those insane accusations she felt rejected she came on to you again and you turned her down no no id avoid eye contact she never had the opportunity maybe it annoyed her i dont know but what was my choice science teachers not hobnobbing with english teachers made it easier for you said milo but general job stuff mustve thrown you together what do you mean gripe sessions in the faculty lounge winterthorns laughter was quick too emphatic grateful for the opportunity to be other than scared there are no gripe sessions at prep theyd be considered unseemly milo said that sounds like a word dr helfgott would use as a matter of fact its one of his favorite adjectives unseemly said milo guess that could apply to murder that dr h would probably call abominable hmm okay jim ill need your mothers phone number and address winterthorns eyes bugged youre kidding shes your alibi jim i need an alibi jim look at the facts objectively a woman accuses you of sexual harassment and now shes dead im the only person she accused should there be others jim silence if theres something you know said milo nows the time winterthorn sat down lowered his head im probably opening a can of worms sometimes thats what it takes to catch fish jim seconds passed a sparrow settled on a rock in the garden a raven swooped down and scared the smaller bird away winterthorn covered his mouth with one hand moaned into his palm softly the hand lowered if you want to pursue that angle id have a look at enricoenrico hauer im sure he and elise were seeing each other why they werent exactly subtle lieutenant long looks smiles brushing against each other sounds like you were watching them jim no no thats my point it was hard to miss what else can you tell me about mr hauer hes from argentina hes selfassured teaches urban studies and psychology he and elise had something going on that was my impression problem is jim that boils down to consensual hankypanky not harassment the same applies to me it was totally consensualshe initiated for gods sakeand it was only one time enrico on the other hand winterthorn trailed off milo said okay thanks for the help jim now whats your moms number what are you going to tell her that your whereabouts are part of a routine investigation thats going to freak her out said winterthorn could you say im not a suspect youre checking out other people hmmif youve been totally truthful i guess i could do that i have been i swear and you wont tell emily right same answer jim thank you i meant that winterthorns eyes misted milo held out a tissue men usually refuse the offer winterthorn didnt chapter enrico hauer smiled dreamily as if aroused from a pleasant nap how bizarre windsor preps head of social studies had arrived ten minutes late giving milo time to call james winterthorns mother and inquire about the science teachers whereabouts martha winterthorn esq played lawyer for a while finally filled in the time frame her account left an hour or so unaccounted for and mothers were dubious guarantors but milo hung up saying at this point you see any reason to bust the poor bastards life wide open not yet bell ring number two the man we found striding into the empty living room was thirtyfive to forty tall muscular broadshouldered and handsome in a mirrorjunkie way thick black pomaded hair worn shoulderlength perfectly arched eyebrows glossed and buffed fingernails he wore a bodyconscious chocolate turtleneck black slacks twotone brownandblack clogs his gold watch was thin his pinkie ring bulky as we got closer the aroma of a lemony cologne thickened he took in the houses interior nice when can we open escrow mellow baritone the barest hint of latin accent neither milo nor i laughed enrico hauer said im joking because im upset and disoriented being called to face the police is kafkaesque milo said one of those days huh and guided hauer to the back of the house seated in the chair james winterthorn had occupied hauer slipped his hand between buttock and metal already warm this is the hot seat its good to have a sense of humor mr hauer rico as a defense mechanism its less damaging than others what have you been told about this meeting dr helfgotts secretary informed me elise freeman was dead and that the police wanted to talk to some of the faculty how well did you know elise not well at all its been suggested that you and elise freeman had an affair an affair how silly never happened huh by silly i meant that word affair as if formal invitations were printed we had sex hauer shook his head thats why im here for having sex for having sex with a dead woman hauer laughed i am not a necrophiliac correction said milo a woman who ended up dead well im sorry for that but here are the facts elise and i had purely physical sex many times surely you guys dont see that as strange a woman i can see objecting the blending of emotion and physicality but we are different no you teach psychology right i love it said rico hauer one day i may pursue a phd what other subjects do you teach social justice thats a twosemester course spanning the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries as well as an honors seminar in urban studies and a superhonors minicourse in poverty and social adjustment superhonors hauer winked kids who are really motivated get rewarded with extra homework and long papers milo said sounds like youve got a busy schedule one who loves his work is never busy only engaged ah that apply to sex with elise oh yes lieutenant we were both definitely engagedengrossed really how often did you and elise get mutually engrossed as often as we couldno forgive me im being flippant again because this really has unnerved me being here being here to discuss elises death which im assuming was unpleasant and irregular otherwise why would i be here forgive the teleologythe circular logic milo handed over his card hauer said i hope she didnt suffer elise did not like to suffer she told you that oh yes explicitly im not into pain rico how did the topic of pain come up mr hauer hauer crossed long legs white silk socks thin enough to suggest chestnut ankles contrasted with the black pants youre probably assuming paraphiliapain in a sexual context but not so lieutenant the conversation was postcoital elise did what many women do in that situation began talking about herself conspiratorial grin milo remained impassive hauer turned to me for empathy i pretended to be a dmv clerk he said what im trying to get across is elise began talking about her childhood a very unpleasant childhood as it turned out how so mr hauer a father who withheld love in my view it had turned elise needy and vulnerable that particular night her point was that shed escaped an unsatisfying family situation and had no desire to repeat it hence im not into pain rico to my mind it sounded like anxious denialtrying to convince herself that she was strong on the other hand not repeating history would be a positive step so i didnt debate her hauer turned serious she yearned for gentleness in fact id say that was the unifying concept of her sexually thats why i find it so unnerving that someone has harmed her was it violent were keeping the details to ourselves for now yes said hauer that makes sense milo said you always treated her gently im a guy who loves to make women happy lieutenant the pleasure of others increases my own so if a woman wanted it rough youd oblige within bounds but that wasnt elise quite the opposite she was more tickle than tussle milo flipped pages in his pad hauer looked out to the garden smiled serenely you like working at prep for the time being thinking of leaving not imminently said hauer but i do like to keep life well seasoned a few years ago i rode my motorcycle from san diego into central america shortly after that i managed to enter myanmar burma on a cargo ship that is a place americans are advised against visiting i managed quite nicely for two weeks ive lived on the isle of gibraltar observing the monkeys ive studied flamenco guitar in andalusia as a historian not a musician so one day you might just pick up and take another adventure life is adventure i said where are you from a place where italians speak spanish and think theyre germans smile argentina but america suits me better the land of endless opportunity like a phd in psychology or a position at a think tank or ten more years teaching bright nervous kids a big hand waved whatever life brings what aspect of psychology would you study i would become a master psychotherapist isnt the phd a research degree i said least thats what my cousin the psychologist says i would research becoming a master psychotherapist my secondary topic would be psychotherapeutic valences as they enhance affective gestalt gibberish i nodded as if it were profound rico hauer said dreadful dreadful poor elise touching his chest he blinked all the emotional depth of a sheet of vinyl milo told him about the dvd hauer didnt move a muscle seconds ticked a full minute of mute immobility milo said thats a serious charge sir no reaction what reaction would you like denial fine i deny shock and surprise fine i am appalled if i believe you you think were lying i think said hauer that the police use deception because the courts have granted legitimacy to that tactic in fact i cover that issue in my urban studies class pose it to my students as a serious moral dilemma no dilemma here mr hauer elise really did make that claim took the time to record it on a dvd poor elise to engage in such delusions then again she had her own moral issues such as lack of fidelity to who some poor devil who believed she had special feelings for him a boyfriend he may have thought so hauer smiled elise enjoyed playing with his head used me as a vehicle for her mean little games how so mr hauer she liked to phone him while we were having sex hauers eyes brightened there you go perhaps he found out jealousys an excellent motive does the poor devil have a name sal elise enjoyed making small talk with him as she wiggled in interesting ways sometimes shed cover the phone and moan sometimes shed hold a photograph of herself and him while she and i tangoed so to speak what kind of photograph nothing erotic said hauer the two of them at a casino this sal had won some money a bald little man i attribute her hostility to him as a yearning for mastery after a childhood filled with affective helplessness she kept that picture in her living room said milo that mean you tangoed at her house of course where else lieutenant your place hauer grinned my wife would object avoiding the bait milo took him over the same ground hauer grew bored a guy hooked on novelty the request for an alibi elicited a yawn and the explanation that hed been with his wife a spanish teacher at a girls school in hancock park feel free to ask her lieutenant you dont care claudia will pretend to be resentful but she has her own diversions open marriage there is no such thing said hauer lets just say claudia and i are more forgiving than most people i would of course resent your telling her about elises accusation as it is patently false and defamatory defamatory said milo thats kind of legalistic i studied law in buenos aires lieutenant decided not to live my life as an attack dog smoothing his hair doesnt it bother you dealing with the worst in people i manage to cope mr hauer good for you now what else can i help you with milo s wave was dismissive hauer sat there milo got up and rapped the back of hauers chair with a knuckle hauer flinched out rico we watched him speed off in a yellow mazda miata convertible ten minutes remained until pat skaggss appointment milo lit a cigar and we idled on the sidewalk three puffs and two smoke rings later he said elise was a busy girl i said esteemed educators molding young minds its like hauer and winterthorn own a testosterone time share but winterthorn never gets to use it wimp or stud cast your ballot for prime suspect ill withhold judgment until mr skaggs tells his story who knew the faculty lounge was such a hotbed of naughty what do you think of elises accusations now same answer cmon stretch your theoretical wings both men fessed up to sex with her but consents a rapists favorite excuse because it can neutralize dna its possible as soon as hauer and winterthorn were summoned they conspired to hedge with partial truth but i really dont know he cursed in a normal situation ida popped in on them thered be no chance to collude what about their personalities winterthorns an excitable boy my guess is nothing much shocks hauer unflappable sociopath hes got the pretentiousness mr amateur psychologist mile wide inch deep i said one day he can get his own talk show or run for office he laughed smoked pulled out his cell and punched in claudia hauers number the resulting conversation was brief pleasant ambiguous mrs rico verifies senor smooth was with her all night which is worth about as much as mommy winterthorn vouching for junior trouble i said whatever hauers character flaws if what he told us about elises childhood is true it is a nice fit with her bingedrinking and promiscuity also with choosing a guy like sal fidella then degrading him id be interested in talking to her relatives someones going to have to deal with the body eventually in a normal situation he said id have already put sean or moe on a backtrace for nearest kin he flicked ashes prankcalling the poor fool while she romped with el gaucho was pretty damn cold interesting word choice big guy he lowered the cigar gonna show me some inkblots now got em back at the office im serious youve got good instincts maybe you just hit on something elise freezes sal out emotionally so he gets back at her with dry ice she staged her games i said he devised one of his own he had a key to her house and his alibis no better than winterthorns or hauers and what looks like a whodunit is just another stupid domestic talk about multiple orgasms for his splendiferousness yeah sal needs to be looked at harder but so do our esteemed educators neither of them wasted time casting suspicion on someone else for winterthorn it was hauer hauer aimed us back at sal get on the love train i said reminds me of something one of my professors said when i was considering a teaching career backbiting is the mothers milk of academia son because so little is at stake i had a graduate advisor tell me basically the same thing he said dr carter chairman of my masters committee that was a coupla days before he put a move on me he checked his timex be interesting to see who mr skaggs dumps on just as milo stubbed out his cigar a small white car approached from the north belching exhaust slowing it parked across the street nissan sentra dusty windows multiple dings the woman who got out was young tall sturdily built with long dark wavy hair a full face goldrimmed specs her gray pantsuit fit loosely as did the yellow blouse underneath a big brown leather purse arced wildly as she jogged across the street police and you are pat skaggs they say you want to talk to me about elise chapter patricia ann skaggss robust frame and broad shoulders were belied by a beseeching littlegirl voice frequent ticlike eyeblinks turned gorgeous cornflower eyes into sputtering gasflames ten seconds with her in the back room and enrico hauers insouciance had been neutralized milo said so you know why youre here marlenedr hs secretarytold me elise died the police were talking to her colleagues was she murdered its possible oh thats horrid you two were close i liked her said pat skaggs we socialized at work but i really cant say much about her personal life blink blink milo said workplace friend the first time i saw her she having lunch by herself in a corner of the faculty lounge she subbed so no one knew who she was i introduced myself i figured it was difficult to get into our circle faculty at preps like a club oh no nothing like that said pat skaggs its just that the rest of us were accustomed to each other not much faculty turnover at prep its a great place to work raising her volume on that proclamation how long have you been teaching there pat five years starting right after college which college wellesley thats a great place impish smile now youre going to say hillary went there i said madeleine albright and diane sawyer went there she laughed they as well milo said what do you teach at prep advanced placement and honors history honors world civilizations seminar bonus chautauqua on womens rights in the wake of the industrial revolution elise tutored history and english so you had something in common ever send any students to her for tutoring a couple they seemed satisfied no complaints from pushy parents about someone getting an aminus instead of an a pat skaggs pushed hair off a moist forehead im sure youve heard stories but for the most part preps not like that no grade pressure by the time kids get to ap and honors theyve pretty much selfselected still i said some of them require tutoring she licked her lips some people are extremely perfectionistic some people get upset when perfections not attained youre not really saying some student did this because they werent pleased with elises performance milo said at this point were open to any theory pat oh wow she said no honestly i dont see that small hands quivered honestly i just dont see that where did elise go to school pat u of maryland she talk much about her college days not really not really she did tell me shed preferred to go to a small college like wellesley nod why didnt she money whatd she have to say about her family nothing said skaggs nothing at all she avoided talking about her family lieutenant as to why i can only conjecture that her memories werent pleasant avoided how i just got a general sense of avoidance okay heres an example once before thanksgiving i was talking about how much i looked forward to seeing my family elise said sounds nice and there was a wistful tone in her voice i mistook that for her missing her own family said something along those lines elise shook her head rather vociferously then she smiled and changed the subject but i felt id touched a nerve on the other hand maybe im reading too much into it what else did you and elise talk about work stuff girl stuff she hadnt dated in a long time said she might be getting ready for that but wasnt sure when did she tell you that id have to say a few months ago three well past the time when shed started seeing sal fidella milo said whered you have those girl chats blink blink blink we went out a couple of times after work had a drink to unwind not at bars at restaurants with bars because of me im not into places where people just sit and get drunk even at wellesley i wasnt much for the bar scene poor elise i cant believe anyone would do that to her did she suffer sounds like you really liked her as a person i did he frowned shook his head that makes it a little tough pat makes what tough having to tell you something that might conflict with your opinion of elise im not following moisture darkened the armpits of her jacket enough sweat to seep quickly through heavy twill milo pulled his chair closer leaned in close pat skaggss lower lip shook pat he said the sad truth is you may have thought elise was a nice person but the feeling wasnt mutual iwhat are you saying he summed up the dvd patricia ann skaggs screamed and ran from the room we caught up to her in the hallway near the vacant kitchen where shed slumped against a wall and was sobbing into both palms im sorry pat milo placed a hand on her shoulder its not true its an ugly ugly ugly lie we waited until tears gave way to snuffles lets sit back down and hear your side of it pat she pulled away redfaced and some of the color had spread to the sclera of her eyes red white and blue the patriotism of fear lets sit down pat there is no other side if she said thati cant believe shed say that why would she say that thats what were trying to figure out pat she lied about jim winterthorn and rico hauer too why would you ask that pat theyre the only other faculty members summoned to talk to you who told you that marlene pat have you discussed anything related to this case with winterthorn or haueror anyone else absolutely not she said i need you to be straight about that pat i am being straight ive had no time to talk to anyone so you tried silence pat after marlene told me i tried to call both of them but neither picked up their phones when an hour ago i assure you there was no attempt to dissemble i was merely curious about why only the three of us was any other faculty member at prep as friendly with elise as you i really wasnt that friendly myself same question pat she chewed her lip shook her head truthfully i never saw elise with jim or rico do you know jim and rico pretty well uhuh no way im not getting into personalities not when you drag me here and make vicious accusations the accusations are not ours pat theyre elises how do i know thats true why else would we be talking to you and jim and rico lets concentrate on you right now pat theres nothing to concentrate on i want to get out of here thats your right said milo but it will result in a subpoena and further questioning at the police station pat skaggs gaped why are you doing this to me a womans dead and leaves behind a taped accusation if we didnt follow through on something like that would we be doing our job no answer what kind of grade would you give us for that type of sloppiness pat d f pat skaggs ground her teeth she may have said it but it never happened elises death has nothing to do with me thats why we need to sit back down and hear what you have to say oh god she said this is kafkaesque same adjective hauer had used if a tormented tubercular jew hadnt penned a handful of stories what would academics do for emotional shorthand im sure it feels that way pat lets head back and clear everything up theres nothing to clear up she said but his gentle prod got her walking when she was back in the chair i said so the sex was consensual milo s turn to blink pat skaggs didnt notice her eyes were on me wild and redveined and bulging stricken as if id stripped her naked in a way i had she let loose another flood of tears but made no attempt to bolt sat there snuffling and mumbling milo said whats that pat it was only twice she sat up now youre going to say its because of wellesley well its not im tired of all those harvardboy jokes and i wasnt gay at wellesley i had a boyfriend i was engaged to be married your sexuality doesnt matter to us pat except as it relates to elise freeman twice she said two damn times okay satisfied and you cannot tell my girlfriend you simply cannot the girlfriend was a harp teacher from glendale named michelle washburn she and pat skaggs had been living together for three months in an apartment not far from the galleria the dual sexual encounters with elise freeman preceded that arrangement though skaggs and washburn had been dating seriously skaggss account evoked james winterthorns story following drinks and dinner elise freeman had initiated contact substituting soft kisses and affection then a grope up skaggss skirt for the sudden fellatio shed performed on winterthorn both times the women had ended up at elises house both times skaggs had left without spending the night worried about giving herself away to michelle washburn brief encounter then good night said milo that makes it sound i guess it was tawdry i was an idiot i still dont understand why i acceded the first time couldve been written off as mojitos and bad judgment the second moronicand now i have to talk to you about it good lord this is humiliating we hear all kinds of things pat if its not related to homicide we couldnt care less well i certainly didnt kill her i never never never did anything remotely abusive or coercive with elise i just cant see why shed say that tears abrupt panic you dont have to notify prep about this right of course not please i beg you i love my job pat if youve told us the complete truth no one will know i have i swear please okay then you can go thats it milo smiled we could stretch this out a bit if youd prefer pat skaggs inhaled stood ran from the room looking smaller chapter when we were alone milo paced the vacant house i stayed in the back room enjoying the view of the garden and wondering his footsteps lingered in the kitchen the primeval urge when he stomped back in i said my bets on freeman making it up milo said the teachers are horny but not monsters if they were drama coaches i might feel differently but all three seemed genuinely surprised about the accusation and its hard to see the three of them cooperating on a campaign to torment poor elise also elise made the dvd but never did anything with it maybe she contemplated an extortion scheme but changed her mind seducing teachers for blackmail not exactly deep pockets these are teachers who work for the richest school in the city i said talk about a massive workplace harassment suit and something that waitress at the bar said makes me wonder if fidella was involved she pegged him as a getrichquick type he circled the room stopped winterthorn and skaggs i can see as vulnerable to extortion but rico suavisimo doesnt care what wifey thinks why would elise pick him as a stooge maybe she didnt know about his wifes tolerance shed see a married man one clearly giving off sexual vibes using the three of them to get to ultradeep pockets then why change her mind given what were learning about her i dont see a burst of moral growth could be she lost her nerve about doing battle with an institution like prep especially after they gave her a permanent gig maybe the gig was payoff for not suing alex i thought about that doubt it shed hold out for a lot more than a steady job another reason could be rico unlike the other two he describes a prolonged affair maybe elise decided making love beat making war she falls for senor stud decides not to drag him into the muck and if things went bad she always had the disc bestlaid plans he said so to speak which brings us back to fidella i said if he was involved in the scheme hed lose twice another jackpot dashed and his girlfriends making a fool of him with another man i keep going back to his having a key to her house what if he dropped in one night found elise and hauer together but left without a scene he stews builds up the rage finally accepts the fact that elise wont go forward with her threats he also was aware of elises bingedrinking who better to lace her vodka with some kind of opiate he waits until shes wasted and helpless lowers her into the tub packs her like crab legs at the fish market he grimaced and here i was thinking seafood for dinner wonder where that waitress hangs out when shes not drinking at arnie josephs the octogenarian bartender held a glass to the light thats doris she does the threetoeleven shift at fat boy wheres fat boy two blocks north if youre thinking doris had a thing with sal she didnt who did said milo some blonde milo showed him a snap of elise freeman thats her she in here a lot a few times grey goose up sometimes a twist sometimes nothing not an ice freak said milo nope heavy drinker one drink period thank god most aint like her what else do you know about her nothing i know drinks not people studying milo youre beer to me blended scotch maybe a highend single malt if youre feeling flush both of you drink wine when your wives want you to lets hear it for the wives said milo youre an oracle been doing this for fiftythree years nothing changes what does your crystal ball tell you about sal beer same as you only difference is you i might let run a tab sals not a good risk im a trusting sort said the old man but jerk me around enough and its cash on the barrel sal has trouble meeting his obligations the bartender laid down his towel folded it neatly what kind of dumbass empties a slot machine of ten grand and blows it the same day when it comes to settling up hes always got a sad story so now its cash on the barrel sal react okay to that said milo what do you mean he have a temper people dont do that do what fuss when i read em the law he reached behind the bar hefted a louisville slugger black worn to gray same for the tape around the handle milo said it came to that with sal nah but he knows its here everyone does got robbed twentyeight years ago coupla cholos pistolwhipped me my skull was like eggshell i got smart a bats enough the old man winked watery eyes dropped to a spot behind the bar gotta be seeing as how normal people cant get carry permits for firearms only rich dumbasses who know the mayor you got that right said milo sal ever hit you up with easymoney schemes people dont do that with me he ever hit up your patrons probably probably people drink their lips flap sal flaps a lot even before the first beer but he never impresses anyone i ignore all that noise and think about my grandchildren hear no evil crap floats by me why would i touch it still said milo you smell it what kinds of things is sal into mostly he bitches about how he used to have money stocks bonds real estate back when kids played instruments you believe that ill sell you gm want anything a soft drink on the house no thanks tell us about the blonde not much to tell said the barkeep quiet but not friendly quiet more like nose in the air she was too good for the place shed drink her one goose get all fidgety make sal leave he followed her like a puppy dog lifting the towel with deft fingers he snapped it midair you want doris shes on shift right around now dont tell her i sent you doris likes her privacy the old man returned the bat to its hiding place i dont give a rats ass what she or anyone else likes my age i keep things simple fat boy was a holdout against franchise fever a glassfronted fifties cube with an upwardly thrusting roof that evoked manned space travel breakfast special banner taped to the glass breakfast smells late in the afternoon blue naugahyde booths counter stools and aqua carpeting had long conceded the war against dirt and wear the place was empty but for two bearded truckers inhaling bacon and eggs at the counter and a young hispanic woman tending to them with good cheer and banter same unflattering pink uniform as doris but she made it work you guys can sit up here no sign of doris then she emerged through rear doors carrying a twofoot stack of yellow paper napkins milo waved she ignored him and began filling dispensers her name tag said dorrie afternoon dorrie to you its doris she said what now a few more questions about sal i already told you what i know moving on to the next booth she spotted a crumb flicked it away before drywiping the formica pressed the springlatch of the dispenser crammed in paper letting go with an audible snap she did the same at the neighboring booth soon as youre done doris ill be done in five hours doesnt look too crowded rub it in how about we help you load the napkins you spare us a few minutes soon youll be wanting to split tips the truckers turned milo stared them down and they returned to their food doris said howd you find out i was here adolph told you right whos adolph the mummy pours drinks at arnies just a few questions said milo damn adolphlook its not like me and sal are buddies you mentioned getrichquick schemes what kind that card you handed out said homicide not con stuff what sal killed his girlfriend over money what girlfriend is that some blonde was it her milo produced freemans picture thats the one said doris he really did her jesus i never woulda thought hes not a suspect at this time she snorted youre here for your health a woman dies we look at her boyfriend doris if youve got information about their relationship that would be helpful he brought her to arnies thats all often sometimes she never talked to no one wasnt exactly fun in the drinking department timid drinker one vodka she sometimes didnt even finish she scowled expensive stuffgrey goose making like she was superior a snob said milo doris put her napkins down the way she talked overly pronouncing her words you know like i went to college and you didnt like anyone gives a rat at a place like arnies whyd she hang with sal how should i know the other guy i saw her with was a lot cuter too young for her but maybe she was one of those goldilocks girls know what i mean one day its too hot the next too cold no nose for justright tell us about the other guy doris hes the one killed her not sal we dont know who killed her doris thats why were here doris s smile spread like a rash her teeth were randomly placed you didnt even know about the other guy did you well dont get me involved i just saw him once where walking down van nuys with her they stop short of arnies theres an alcove this old office building they duck in there theres an overhang soon theyre in there doing kissyface she plants a big one on him takes his face like this cupping her chin in goes the tongue blech were talking young enough to be her kid maydecember romance you could say that or you could say they had the hots for each other i aint dr ruth you saw all this because i was walking behind them from my bus stop like i always do what time of day two two thirty i like to get to arnies lubricate the throat before i arrive at this gourmet palace only reason i noticed her was id seen her with sal also her getup tight red dress talk about advertising the goods i said to myself hey thats goose gal but that cutie sure aint sal what happened after they kissed she pats him on his cute little butt he leaves she goes to arnies soon after sal shows up blondies smiling at him like its true love one drink and shes bugging him to leave he doesnt even finish his beer what a limp onion so maybe he found out she was cheatin and got mad huh thats what youre thinking right calling out to the young waitress behind the counter guess what rosie im a bigtime detective now rosie said how much they payin you dorrie milo said how young was this other guy a lot younger than herwhat was she forty fortyfive thirtyeight ida pegged her as older what about him twentiestwentytwo twentythree not younger thats not young enough could he have been a high school student to me he looked twenties she said but who knows he dressed like one of those preppies nice buttondown shirt khaki pantsbut tennis shoes kind of nerdy pen protector in the pocketthat i remember cause i thought it was real nerdy but he didnt look like a nerd too cute more like a surferthe peroxide hair grinning real tight butt id think he could do better than her but guys want one thing give it to em and theyre burgers on the griddle hot said milo hot and sizzly and bad for your heart lets talk about sals money schemes doris said who listenedokay heres one i remember because it was so stupid im enjoying my drink before work sal comes in sits at the other end of the bar pretends hes not gonna talk to me has a beer and gives out this big sigh all of a sudden hes next to me pretends to make small talk then would you believe this dorrie i just got a huge commission check for some tubashe sells instruments or so he claims i never saw him do nothing but sit and drink i say congratulations he says problem is it wont clear for a week i got a pile of bills do me a little favor ill make it worth your while milo said lemme guess you deposit the check in your account he withdraws some of the money and pays you interest if the check bounces youre saddled with the charges guess youre a bigtime detective too how much money we talking about doris two thousand and some change he said hed give me a hundred for my trouble like id do it too good to be true always is why would he try to scam someone at a place he frequented why dont you ask him she said far as i know no one at arnies ever says yes to his bs he tries that kind of thing regularly hes always inching up to someone with that look like hes carrying around the biggest secret in the world oh yeah i remember another one he had truckloads of surplus trumpets and trombones coming in just needed some money to ship them to indiana or wherever it is they melt trombones down for brass i pitch in hell split the profits with me another time he tried to sell everyone new jersey lottery tickets at a discount hes annoying but he gives up quick not pushy and no one gets mad because hes pathetic i got him pegged as a spineless worm no guts no glory thats why it surprises me you think he killed her we dont doris whatever hes at his finest after a few she said six seven beers and hes creative you really think he killed her we left fat boy got back into the car clumsy con man he said yeah i can see him getting tumescent over a bigmoney squeeze job on a place like prep and correspondingly mad when elise pulled out of the scheme plus the jealousy angle just got stronger our tutor and a young guy she sure covered a lot of ground meaning there could be whoknowshowmany partners out there chuckling she might as well have tutored biology you got where i was going with that age question a preppie type i said if doris s age estimate is off elise couldve been sleeping with a student pens in the pocketmaybe a math brain but he needed help in english be nice to get hold of some prep yearbooks have doris go through the boys if prep even has yearbooks why wouldnt they mere paper and ink im thinking sacred tablets chapter back at his closetsized office milo bellydived into the cyberworld if windsor prep issued yearbooks they werent cataloged online and none of the pay services promising to hunt down alumni had anything on the school no snarky critiques on the internet either just paeans to the schools physical plant and academic standards i said didnt know police protection could reach that far his smile devolved to an abdominal growl time to subpoena elises phone records something traces back to a student im beelining for the damn school rubbing his face thatll be so much fun ill follow it up with doityourself openheart surgery using a rusty can opener i drove home cleared paper drank two black coffees and began my own computer search starting with myspace and facebook and using windsor prep as keywords no shortage of smiling attractive kids attending the school along with the usual friends lists music choices poetic excerpts ranging from lewd to sad some homedrawn comic strips the occasional photo of a cat or dog a handful of postings about elise freeman but nothing more specific than did u hear ms f died bizarre no memorials or calls for tribute not a hint of rumor about sexual indiscretions returning to the commercial alumni sites i plugged elise freemans name into the u of maryland database no such person pairing her name with maryland pulled up a fiveyearold search for graduates of blessed heart college on garrison boulevard in baltimore the school wanting to get in touch for a centennial celebration what else had she lied about i clicked the reunion link elise freeman appeared in the where are you column so did sandra freeman stuehr graduation date two years later four forty pm made it past working hours in baltimore so i tried the citys white pages over five hundred freemans but only one stuehr a business address stuehrs crab cooker e pratt street the woman who answered put me on hold a minute or so later she returned talking over restaurant clatter when do you want your reservation id like to speak to sandra who sandra stuehr two beats hold on the silence lasted nearly three minutes before a man got on no more clatter maybe a private office this is frank what now clipped diction vocal cords that sounded as if theyd been dragged a few miles on a gravel road im looking for sandra youre mr stuehr yeah right pardon another lawyer heard from christ stop bugging me i told him who i was played up the lapd connection more than reality justified yeah right more cock and bull look pal i cant stop you from calling but trust me next time you wont get through just like those other guys this is a homicide investigation mr stuehr the victims elise freeman if shes not related to sandra elise someone killed her youre kidding im not mr stuehr silence i havent seen elise in a long time not since the wedding which was i married sandy nine years ago wish i could forget the date sandy and elise arent close elise showed up drank herself silly left early sandra is her sister one and only could i talk to sandra be my guest pal shes where you are california or maybe its arizona by now she likes warm weather could be florida for all i know or care weve been divorced three years shes still filing paper on me shes moneymadwhats the diff for all i know this conversation really is cock and bull and youre one of her lawyers call the lapd west la station and ask for lieutenant sturgis i gave him milo s cell you just told me another name im delaware lieutenant sturgis is the chief investigator on the case talk to him directly about what were trying to track down elises family theres a body that needs to be dealt with oh well thats not my problem how about the last known address and number for sandra he rattled off the information as if he chanted it daily gutierrez street santa barbara three years of animosity but he kept his ex close at hand i said thanks anything you want to tell me about elise from what i hear shes just like her sister how so hotpants thinks shes an intellectual lies like a convict my familys been running one of the best crab joints in baltimore for sixty years listen to sandy its a greasy spoon im imposing by wanting her to occasionally help out hotpants i said frank stuehr said im not talking fashion thats an oldfashioned expression for slut okay you want to know something about eliseand sandy both of them got bothered by their old man know what i mean molested thats another word for it sandy talked about that only once when she was in one of her weepy moods wanted me to put my arm around her or something after that nothing like it never happened in the first place only other time i raised the topic was when sandy and me tried mediation she was making a play to steal a big chunk of the cooker and that really pissed me off so i put forth the case she was morally turpitude spelled it out she gets up walks around the table smacks me wham across the face that ended mediation she screwed herself the judge didnt look kindly on her you find her dont give regards what kind of guy was the father he died before i met sandy but i hear he was a runaround thats what people said in the neighborhood outward he was respectable never met a mass he didnt like principal of a school top of that id love to hear his confession a virtuous father dont turn out two sluts sandy was promiscuous sandy was a slut never stopped banging other guys the whole time we were married out at night all the time i was a dumbass believed those stories about scrabble club bridge gardening same for elise elise once came on to me sandy was in the kitchen elise makes a grab for my youknowwhat i look at her like are you out of your mind she pretends it never happened theyre both good at that pretending what was their mother like also dead by the time i met sandy sandy never talked about her like she didnt exist at what school was the father principal some black public school i dont know what was his name cyrus freeman he said phd sandy kept reminding me of that how shed lowered herself marrying a guy with only one year at towson meanwhile shes screwing half the population of baltimore and spending my money like shes a member of congress s freeman stuehr was listed in the santa barbara book her voicemail message was warm and friendly offered in a voice as silky as her exs was ragged hi there whoever you are this is sandy im sure id love to talk to you but either im out or just catching a little california sunshine so please leave a message tempting offer but i resisted one hit for cyrus freeman a tiny squib in the baltimore sun plans to name the auditorium at chancellor middle school in west baltimore after its former principal had been deferred due to institutional and budgetary concerns including the expense of new signage i got on the phone milo picked up found you some next of kin big guy i filled in the details nothing like bitter exes for filling in blanks thanks for taking the time alex two lying sluts huh theres a clinical diagnosis for you sandy lives ninety miles away but hasnt contacted you so most likely she doesnt know elise has been murdered that suggests the sisters werent close that could make her a less useful informant on the other she may be willing to give up some interesting details i love santa barbara give me her number after he copied it down i said frank stuehrs judgment is clouded by animosity but hes right about the link between a sexually abusive father and promiscuity i told him about the change in chancellor school s plans the expense of signage he said thats a new one youre thinking something came out about ol cyruss past a middle school oh man innercity kids would be easy victims especially back then elise told fidella her father was rough on her but she never said it was sexual clouding the truth is a common defense mechanism and that couldve led to a lifelong pattern case in point lying about where she attended college i checked out blessed heart and its a small wellthoughtof catholic womans college with high standards by no means inferior to u maryland so its not like she was padding her resume lying for the hell of it thats possible i said but i thought of something else turns out blessed hearts campus is two blocks from chancellor middle so maybe she grew up in that neighborhood that district is also close to the pimlico racetrack what if she developed an early affinity for gamblingand gamblers fidella he said yeah blowing a jackpot in one day says hes probably got gaming issues maybe she did too and thats why one or both of them hatched up an extortion scheme then she changes her mind my dear vic led a complicated life talk about multitasking maybe just the opposite she compartmentalizeddivided her life into little boxestrying to keep things simple esteemed teacher by day wild girl by night and somehow she ends up in the freezer compartment chapter milo was at my house by nine the following morning we took the seville to santa barbara because two hours on the road pal i like leather and functional ac i said howd the sister react to the news gasped once then she got calm pretty fast sexy voice like elises on the disc minus the depression as i drove up the glen he unwrapped the skirtsteakbakedchickenbaconfriedpotatoesonrye sandwich hed constructed from leftovers scrounged in my fridge hydration came from slurps of diet dr pepper in a halfliter bottle hed brought with him by the time i reached mulholland he was phoning and eating trying to find out why his priority request for elise freemans phone records had received no response drones at her carrier kept transferring him then cut him off a second attempt produced technical issues as an excuse when he inquired about the subpoena of her financials at the das office he was informed of transfer delays he tried deputy da john nguyen who put him on hold one minute later milo clicked off scowling john cant cut through the fog either everything gets shunted to the chiefs office hardening of the procedural arteries clutching his chest in mock horror he buried his face in animal protein gulping fast without taking a breath more distraction than gustatory pleasure i picked up the north at sepulveda merged to the west coasted through the western reaches of the valley as it turned into the speeding past brownfelt hills and plugs of the heroic trees that gave thousand oaks its cachet i cut through the widening gullies and ambitious peaks of camarillo a few exits north and pleinair ceded to concrete one beige mall after another a razorstraight shot through the agricultural bounty of oxnard and ventura took us past carpinteria where the pacific became a western neighbor flat blue breaking frothily the water softsold peace of mind sea lions bobbed surfers took advantage of swells tankers big enough to merit a zip code floated on the horizon a few miles before santa barbara the rich green buffer formed by the oldgrowth vegetation of montecito cooled and sweetened the air global warming on your mind plant a tree santa barbara announced itself with a glorious lagoon that rimmed cabrillo boulevard s eastern edge to the west the ocean persisted tourists worked both sides of the sunkissed thoroughfare on bikes and pedicabs sandra freeman stuehr lived a few miles past stearns wharf west of state in a mintgreen bungalow on a quiet shady street three individual units on an eighthacre lot hers faced the street not that different in style from her sisters home but none of the isolation she came to the door holding a coffee mug and flexing a bare foot she wore a crisp black linen mandarincollar blouse butteryellow walking shorts hoop earrings half a dozen gold bangles her toenails were polished scarlet her fingers glazed flesh pink honeyblond hair was clipped in a pageboy thirty pounds heavier than elise and two years younger she had bonechina skin clear blue eyes and a way with makeup that widened the age gap she couldve passed for late twenties milo made the introductions sandra stuehrs handshake was topped by a quick little aftersqueeze the merest pressure of warm fingertip on knuckle she beckoned us in curling hair around an index finger cocking a hip and secreting chanel no a perfect hourglass shape was enhanced by an even cushion of firm flesh back in reubenss day painters wouldve lined up for the privilege milo said so sorry for your loss thank you im ready to help you with whatever i can brief pout but no evidence of teartracks and her sapphire eyes sparkled coffee im having a refill if its no trouble its no trouble at all pivoting like a dancer she crossed to a bright open kitchen with a view of coral bougainvillea the aroma of french perfume permeated the little houses interior we were miles from the beach but sandra stuehrs decor did its best to evoke sand and surf overstuffed seating slipcovered in white canvas pine tables waxed to a soft gleam seashells and driftwood and bits of tumbled rock placed cleverly so as not to crowd the limited space here you go the mug she handed me was pearl gray embossed with a gold crucifix and a gilt legend blessed heart college the first hundred years she settled on a love seat folded her legs to one side how was the traffic from la easy said milo great coffee thanks french press and i grind the beans myself soft sad smile if you cant do something right why do it at all were trying to investigate your sisters murder the right way ms stuehr of course you are tooquick toowide smile the tension of a first date i rotated the mug so milo would notice he pointed and said blessed heart is how we found you really they put a call for alumni on the internet that silly reunion said sandra stuehr you didnt attend huh only sad people live in the past lieutenant blessed gave out my number no that we got from your exhusband good old frank im sure he had all sorts of wonderful things to say about me we didnt get into personal details ms stuehr did elise happen to attend the reunion i tend to doubt it you dont know for sure if thats a subtle way to ask if elise and i were close the answer is far from it still im devastated by what happened did she suffer no said milo how often did the two of you see each other seldom verging on never said sandra stuehr even after i moved to california two and a half years ago not for lack of trying on my part one of the first things i did was drive down to la to have lunch with elise it was pleasant but not intimate and afterward we both lied about staying in touch elise didnt even invite me to her home ive never seen it i said so youve never been close elise always resented me and i got tired of trying to earn her approval despite that im crushed by her death do you have any idea who could do such a terrible thing milo shook his head thats why were here well i wish i could tell you something profound lieutenant but the harsh truth is my sister and i have been virtual strangers since birth whyd she resent you i said instead of answering she said i always felt it a wallthere might as well have been a physical barrier when we were teenagers it blossomed to outright hostility and we ended up barely tolerating each other being the baby i grew up thinking it was my fault something id done to alienate her eventually i came to realize it was because of what i was pause the favored child eyelash flutter a flicker of frown which in our family meant the ignored child i said parental attention wasnt much of a prize she waved a hand like i said guys reminiscence is for losers your parents we had one functional parent father mother was a nonentity a shadow just a total dishrag she came from a poor family never finished high school that allowed father to convince her hed bestowed a great gift by deigning to wed her i always suspected they married because he got her pregnant with elise his family was prominent not in the sense of being rich but they were highly educated his father was a physics professor at hopkins his mother taught violin im sure mother was initially impressed daggerpoint laugh she died when i was three and elise was five and im not even sure the memories i have of her are accurate all of them revolve around drudgerydown on her knees scrubbing something as if she was the maid i suppose she was we never had help i said after she died is when the problems began her mouth hardened what are you getting at paternal attention not being welcome her mug faltered she held it with both hands until it steadied ran a finger under her bangs ive worked hard at resolving so i can talk about it but i dont see how it relates to what happened to elise anything that helps us understand elise is useful more haircurling she picked up a cowry shell massaged it laid it down he was a monster he damaged elise and that prevented the two of us from becoming real sisters the pathetic thing is elise and i had so much in common we liked the same music enjoyed the same subjects in school both of us became teachers though i never need to work we couldve had a fantastic relationship if that bastard hadnt fucked things up her mug went down hard on an end table coffee sloshed wood thrummed she stared at the stain he abused her but not me im sure she blamed me i refuse to feel guilty maybe if shed talked about it we couldve worked it out i dont know milo said physical abuse or oh it was sexual all right said sandra stuehr it was nothing but sexual those good old dependable latenight visits to elises bedroom you could set your watch by it eleven twenty pm and his slippers were making those vile scraping sounds on the carpet like a slithering snake i still hear it from time to time you shared a room rapid head shake elise and i had adjacent bedrooms but i could hear his footsteps hear the bed bumpfeel it my headboard was right next to the wall then everything would grow quiet and id hear elise whimpering i could hear her i was too scared to do anything but stay in my bed what if he paid me a visit and started bumping my bed but he never did i was relieved when i wasnt wondering if it was because elise was the slim pretty one and i was the chubby little pillsbury doughgirl her lips folded inward she got up took her mug to the kitchen opened the refrigerator popped a can of fresca and sat back down sure be nice to put some vodka in this but i dont drink anymore not that i had a problem nothing like that i was always moderate but since i moved here i decided to get healthy yoga meditation walking on the beach i quit smoking put on fifteen pounds but i can breathe again i said your father was a middle school principal did you see any sign he abused his students im sure he did all those little girls running around easy for the taking he ran chancellor for nearly forty years why miss out on a great opportunity but what goes around comes around as im sure youve found out something happened to him you dont know she said nine years ago someone put a bullet in his head milo said who unsolved she said grinning the cops said it was a street robbery but ive always wondered if it was some father or brother getting even or even a girl whod grown up and gotten in touch with her rage someone like your sister did elise do it maybe i have no knowledge of her being in baltimore when it happened but who knows was he still working when it happened first year of retirement they found his body on the sidewalk two blocks from his house his pants pockets were turned inside out his wallet was gone and he was lying facedown with a hole in the back of his head there was certainly no shortage of muggings in the neighborhood that part of west baltimore had changed since he was a boy he was the last white man standing not that it stopped him from taking his nightly walks denial i guess or plain old arrogance how did elise react to his murder neither of us talked about it and we had his body cremated id like to think part of her was happy if she allowed herself to get in touch with her feelings part of her there was probably sadness even i occasionally feel that crazy as it is he did make me breakfast every morning for fifteen years combed my hair until i was eleven everyone said he was a wonderful nurturing man milo said you and elise never talked at all about his murder not a word in his will he asked to be buried next to mother i had one of franks busboys toss the ashes into the chesapeake bay out in back of the cooker where the garbage cans are can i warm up that coffee for you as we drank she excused herself returned with a yellowed newspaper clipping in a plastic sleeve former principal murdered milo said could we make a copy you think its relevant to elises murder i dont see how it could be im sure youre right ms stuehr but two murders in one family is worth looking at the freeman curse she said you know last night when you called and told me what happened to elise i actually started thinking about that wondering if our family is doomed and im next this morning i woke up decided that was stupid superstition it was time to have a lovely dayyou know dont even bother copying keep it i dont know why i held on to it in the first place i said what youve told us about your father might help explain why elise made some highrisk choices such as she bingedrank sandra stuehrs eyes got huge youre kidding are you sure we are wow she said ive always thought of her as the moderate one from the time she turned twentyone all i got were pompous lectures about the need to control my drinking we were both attending blessed she was a senior i was a sophomore got into partying pretty hard did you see each other much in college not even then its a small school but we managed to avoid each other what did she drink when she binged vodka interesting said sandra stuehr something else we had in common she drank her fresca not a coincidence i suppose part of her sermon was if youre going to be pigheaded and make a fool out of yourself sandy at least drink vodka itll keep your breath fresh no one will know youre a reprobate i said you avoided each other but she found time to lecture exactly my best years were the two after she graduated i could finally be myself did she do anything else highrisk milo said the coroner found opiates in her system like heroin or something similar sandra stuehr placed the flat of a hand against her cheek as if propping her head unbelievable people change said milo theres change and theres charade she said all this time ive seen her as the smart one are there any other crushing insights you want to give me about my sister milo said you lived near pimlico any sign elise played the ponies she gambled said sandra stuehr this is like meeting her for the first time no i never saw her wager on anything and i sure spent some time at pimlico she was the smart one guys summa cum laude at blessed hopkins offered her a scholarship to go to grad school in english i on the other hand barely passed the teachers licensing exam though that was cause i was distracted by my relationship with frank she went to the track no but she did go to reno and play blackjack must be genetic he played the ponies nothing serious that i knew about hed take twenty thirty dollars to the track rationalize his losses as recreation otherwise he was a total cheapskate how often did elise go to reno milo said we know about once she went with her boyfriend guy named sal fidella sounds like a mafia type hes an unemployed salesman he and elise won a fivethousanddollar jackpot in reno lost it the same day like father like daughter said sandra stuehr her mouth turned down hope that doesnt end up applying to me i cant see how it would i said what else can you tell us about elise she enjoyed lying lying about what anything really my theory is it began with him when she was around twelve she began faking illness probably to keep him out of her bed she did it all kinds of waysputting a finger down her throat and vomiting all over herself soaking a thermometer in hot water rubbing her skin with one of those sandpaper dishsponges to bring up a rash complaining of horrible cramps she also lied about things that seemed pointless not eating the lunch he fixed but telling him it was delicious or just the opposite finishing every bite but coming home and telling him shed lost her lunch was starved i guess she was trying to feel in control shed pull sneaky pranks on him hiding his slippers putting his reading glasses where hed have trouble finding them once i looked out my bedroom window in the middle of the night and saw her letting air out of one of his tires how old was she a teenager maybe fifteen did you let her know youd seen her no way i wanted her to like me did she lie to anyone but your father sure she said she cheated in school stole old tests and sold them i found out because a boy whod bought one bragged about it to his friend that night i searched elises drawers found a waddedup bunch of money i didnt count it but it looked like a lot she never got caught at graduation she won honors and commendations for character did your father ever figure out she was pranking him not a chance in his eyes elise could do no wrong she was the clear favorite i said too bad for her sandra stuehr turned to me her eyes were wet good bad right wrong sometimes it all gets scrambled youre sure she didnt suffer further questioning produced nothing and we were preparing to go when a soft knock sounded on the front door sandra stuehr said its open honey come on in the man who entered was midtwenties goodlooking asian with expensively spiked hair he wore a white silk nat nast bowling shirt with blue vertical stripes cobalt linen slacks brown handstitched deck shoes and a rosegold rolex she got up took his hand kissed his lips lightly perfect timing were finishing up milo introduced himself will kham sandra stuehr said will kham md chief resident in rheumatology at cottage hospital kham toed the floor its okay sandy wills been on call for three days finally has a day off im sure you guys wont mind if we get going milo said thanks for your time ms stuehr if you think of anything else please let us know of course she said to kham they dont think she suffered baby kham said thats good as we closed the door she was saying im thinking san ysidro inn baby that new chef theyve got is fantastic chapter milo scanned the clippings on cyrus freemans murder before slipping them back into the sleeve nothing more than sandy just told us flipped the sleeve onto the backseat and checked his timex four hours of freeway for the sister who knows nothing and yet she told us so much i said elise mightve killed daddy maybe so alex but im not curious enough to find out i meant elise developing her lying skills early as a survival strategy faking illness to avoid getting raped was as good a ploy as any but theres always collateral damage thats consistent with chronic depression drinking using sex as a means of control and hooking up with a hustler like fidella same for concocting an extortion scheme involving her sexuality but what really interests me is her selling tests back in middle school that kind of thing would come in handy at a place like prep traffic slowed along the beach we caught the long stoplight at state more tourists easels full of sidewalk art a few homeless guys lounging on the grass playing critic he said she peddles exams then tries to beef up the take with a little extortion picking the wrong sucker could be hazardous to your health wonderful even if i put the rape aside i cant avoid the damn school he closed his eyes rested his head against the seat best way to find out if she was raking in a lot of extra dough are those goddamn financials another set of calls made him smile on their way and her phone records are on my desk what do you think about elise twotiming sal with a young guy and sandra leaving her husband for a young guy some sort of symbolic distancing themselves from their old man could be i said or they just prefer younger men for that i need a pal with a phd we were back at his office by three thirty pm to the left of his computer sat a loose stack of paper he began pawing crumpling and tossing departmental memos sheet after sheet of the city and county junk mail taxpayers pay for but never read toward the bottom eighteen months of elise freemans bank records at wachovia and her phone history for sixty days the financials elicited an immediate whoa ninety thousand and some change in a passbook account most of it accounted for by sixteen fivethousanddollar deposits posted irregularly over the last three years it aint buried treasure but its a lot for a teacher making thirty a year he said wonder what five grand buys you at prep turning to the phone records he used two felttipped markers to highlight yellow pink pink pink yellow the end result was a cheery zebra thirtytwo yellow stripes for sal fidellas number seventeen pinks for someone in the rest was uninteresting pasadena he said phoning the number he listened wideeyed hung up caltech some chemical engineering lab everyones out at this timeprobably blowing something upbut leave your name blah blah blah far be it from me to stereotype i said but elises young guy wore a pocket protector mr notquiteanerd he found the caltech website zeroed on chemical engineering the only bios were of faculty members but a few more clicks brought up an account of a research presentation two months before a quintet of doctoral students summarizing their research projects no pictures ellen choi vladimir bobrosky tremaine franck mitchell yamaguchi arlen arabian he said long years of detective training tells me its unlikely ms choi has undergone a sexchange operation same for mr yamaguchi undergoing surgery to look caucasian so lets pare down and see what myspace has to offer within seconds hed pulled up a trio of pages guess even brainiacs crave their fifteen nanoseconds of fame arlen arabian was mid to late thirties with brillo hair and a rabbinic beard already graying skinheaded vladimir bobrosky was built like the superheavyweight power lifter his page claimed him to be tremaine l franck was young slim pleasantlooking in a doeeyed anemic way long lank brown hair swept diagonally over a broad unblemished brow so he peroxided to blend in with the dudes at county line he googled franck found the young mans name in a windsor prep newsletter dated the previous year and pumped his fist after completing harvard summa in three years treys been accepted at caltech for phd studies in chemeng and looking forward to getting back to sunny southern california but he admits he will miss the bonhomie of cabot house as well as selected undergraduate courses particularly those of professor feldheim who was a shining beacon of erudition coherence and tolerance despite treys attempts to convince him of the benefits of application as opposed to pure cogitation couldnt agree more said milo pure cogitation gives me gas he switched to the lapd data bank plugged in his departmental password got to work on trey francks stats no criminal record a few parkers one speeding ticket two years ago twentytwo years old five eleven one fiftytwo blond blue first he darkens then he lightens said milo embrace change look at his address i said south side of brentwood an apartment number not the highpriced spread he said but close enough to prep maybe franck was one of their deserving scholarship students elise started four years ago when he was a senior maybe she liked em real young and tutoring turned to something else he doesnt sound like the type whod need tutoring not in math or science alex but elise coached english i need to meet this genius and screw due process he used his personal cell to contact a source at the phone company and copied down the landline matching francks address ten rings no answer no machine milo said what the hell brentwood s close whats your gas situation half a tank i said no problem if we dont cogitate too much the building was a spaceclogging twentyunit heap two blocks south of wilshire faced with poorly tended balconies and satellite dishes perched on railings security door no answer to the bellpush for franck j we were about to leave when a woman with short gray hair and sturdy limbs stepped out with a black brindle french bulldog dead ringer for blanches feisty predecessor spike and a smile hijacked my mouth the woman noticed smiled back serenely as if used to the attention so was the dog he planted his legs faced forward stacked like a champ milo said brings back memories huh the woman said pardon my friend here had one of those same color theyre the best arent they quasihuman i said how long have you had him three years he just finished filling out im guessing twentysix pounds on the nose may i ask how long yours lived he was a rescue so i dont know for sure best guess is twelve thirteen years thirteen would be great i hear some are making it longer whats his name herbie hey herbie i bent rubbed the broad knobby head herbie panted gathered his dignity and continued to pose milo said do you happen to know a young man who lives in this building trey franck the womans eyes grew wary milo showed her his id police treys such a nice boy he hasnt done anything wrong maam were looking for information trey was a witness to something its possible wow she said well he doesnt live here anymore has been at harvard for years may still be for all i know who lives here his parents junes a nurse and josephs some kind of scientist a little distant but overall nice they both work long hours herbie blew out air his flews vibrated he tugged on the leash the woman said the boss needs his walk bye herbie led her toward wilshire jaunty walk suggesting life really was wonderful milo said rushhour drive to pasadena theres a concept lets hedge with a stopoff at the office then another in the valley no sense pursuing a nice boy unless hes the one doris saw he inserted trey francks face into a sixpack photo lineup composed of similar young white men then i hazarded beverly glen toward van nuys brutal congestion at sunset continued as far as i could see as i neared the road leading up to my house milo said go home ill pick up my wheels continue solo not necessary feeling benevolent feeling curious i called robin told her not to keep dinner waiting i might be at caltech for a while youve already got a bunch of degrees she said i was thinking chemical engineering and here i thought our chemistry was great wait up and ill engineer something long as its structural babe not civil i drove up to fat boy just after six half the counter stools were occupied same for the booths the same scaldingoil smell doris was tending to a party of cheerful hispanic kids unloading a tray full of fried food uhuh too busy cant break my rhythm we stood to the side she finished and walked past us and we tagged along enough i told you everything i know two seconds to look at a picture and were out of your way it goes to three seconds youre tipping me milo showed her the sixpack a bluntnailed finger jabbed trey francks face thats him satisfied extremely im even willing to tip he reached into his pocket dont insult me said doris then she laughed punched his shoulder lightly im giving you attitude cause thats what i do boys what the kids a dangerous criminal not so far but maybe not even maybe doris tease she said you ever solve this thing come back and ill trade you the gory details for lunch another punch but you still have to tip chapter milo worked the phone as i picked up the freeway well past working hours at caltech but he tried the chemical engineering department again same recording theyre definitely blowing something up dmv gave up an address for tremaine l franck two blocks from campus fortyfive minutes later we were pulling up to a sixunit dingbat enhanced by two flowering magnolia trees but otherwise sad a tilting bicycle rack stood near the entrance a single chain coiled around the slats but no bikes in sight inside the place smelled like a dorm with twowheelers crowding a dim hallway green walls were chipped and cracked ravaged carpeting was worn down to the padding in spots hiphop blared through plywood doors one section of the hallway had been glued with hundreds of pennies crude blackmarker lettering above the array penny paved is penny ioned no music leaked from trey francks unit no answer to milo s knock he slipped his card between the jamb and the door with a message to call asap lets grab a bite in olde towne try him again i know a fishandchips place got the whole english pub thing going on ever throw darts five minutes later as i neared colorado boulevard his cell beeped a bach fugue mr franck thanks for calling back listen i was wondering if we could talk about elise freeman you havent heard sorry to be the one to tell you but shes passed no not naturally were not certain yet that would be good mr franck trey it is no it wont take long at all trey pull a uey dr d haddock will have to wait he was in the apartment next door we just missed him sounds like a nice kid appropriately freaked about elise on the other hand he snuck around with her while she was supposedly going with fidella and he changes his hair like i change shirts so maybe he got involved in more than maydecember hoohah multifaceted i said that could help get you into harvard you bet look at his flawlessness as we returned to trey francks building the fugue repeated sturgis dr jernigan whats up no i havent probably yeah it does what can i say you play the cards youre dealt thats pretty quick not that im complaining okay makes sense no i havent thanks for letting me know yes i will keep it close to the vest he hung up bounced his lower teeth against his uppers the unnamed opiate has been identified as oxycodone possibly administered as a liquid because there was no pill residue in elises stomach but jernigan wont swear to that not enough dope for an od but the interaction with all the booze in elises system would significantly kick up the risk for heart stoppage someone gave her a chaser i said liquid form would make it easier to doctor the alcohol jernigan was doublechecking to see if there were oxy bottles at the scene or in the trash when i told her no she said that clinched it shes calling it a homicide what are you keeping close to the vest the fact that she called me the labs came in yesterday with instructions from above not to disseminate without official permission jernigan was surprised when i didnt do a followup call so she went out on a limb nothing like a pal at the coroner too bad i need one trey franck slumped on the murphy bed of his shabby single room near his left hand was a contactlens case and a bottle of eyedrops the orbs to which hed just applied the drops were big and round grayblue flecked with gold shiny with moisture hanging on a grimy wall opposite the bed was the rooms sole nod to decoration a black poster curling at the corners bearing a single line of white script limned in electric blue digital cloud boston milo pointed that a band art exhibit said trey allison birnbaum a friend from college harvard indeed thats a college franck shook his head i cant believe this howd you know elise i did some work for her this is utterly horrifying whens the last time you and she had contact we spoke on the phone around two weeks ago confirmed by the records social call she called me to catch up francks speech had an odd delay to it lips forming words milliseconds before any sound emerged about work franck knuckled an eye touched a chin dotted with sparse blond stubble he had on a baggy blue yale tshirt gray sweatpants rubber thongs his hair was longer than his dmv shot a good two inches below his shoulders and tinted coppery brown with whiteblond tips smooth hairless arms hung like vines from narrow sloping shoulders nails bitten to the quick a bright green beanbag chair and a splintering dresser comprised the decor atop the dresser a hot plate shared space with food spatter used and unused cans of pepsi a bag of cheese curls books spiral notepads one corner was filled with a jumble of dirty clothing a laptop and a printer sat on the floor milo had considered the beanbag eyed an ambiguous stain and opted to remain on his feet what kind of work did you do for elise i took tutoring jobs when she was full up did she pay you or just recommend your services elise handled the business aspect for every hour i worked i earned half so she had plenty of business gave you the overflow her business is seasonal said franck but yes did elise ever tutor you back in your high school days franck blinked no reproachfully as if the question was absurd perfect sats all on your own shrug its just a test what subjects do you specialize in trey anything thats required mathscience as well as english yes elise only tutored english and history she could do basic math but she preferred not to go beyond that so for algebra calculus aps and such youre the man was said franck i dont do it anymore too busy ive got a research assistantship that pays for room board and tuition taking in the room its not luxe but im fine this building a dorm not officially said franck its owned by an alumnus and he gives a substantial break on the rent what exactly happened to elise all we can say at this point is that shes deceased trey tell us how you met her thats relevant because its relevant because i asked franck stared up at him sorry im still trying to integrate you were close to elise she helped me by sharing her business when did that start i was a senior at prep she knew i needed the money and you were smart shrug she thought so no problems tutoring your peers i had something they needed for the most part they were smart kids why would smart kids need tutoring francks smile said we couldnt hope to understand milo said smart but not supersmart at a place like prep boosting a sat to is profound how much do smart kids pay for something like that trey their parents pay a hundred an hour with a onethousanddollar retainer up front my cut was fifty percent how many clients a week did elise send you at the peak i was putting in fifteen hours a week i still cant believe shes gone francks eyes drifted to the ceiling gray stains marred the plaster as if a greasyhaired giant had butted his head seven fifty a week said milo well earned lieutenant you dont have time for it anymore i need to concentrate on my research said franck slapping hair from his brow what are you researching catalysis and response engineering oh yeah said milo saw a tv guide special on that franck didnt react milo edged an inch closer youre into color huh pardon your hair you dye it franck licked his lips you take your fun where you find it whats the next step a catalysis tattoo reluctant smile i dont think so lieutenant were you elises only employee i was when you went off to harvard she didnt hire anyone else no when i was back for summers i resumed it beat flipping burgers guy with your talents said milo i dont see you in fast food guess what lieutenant thats exactly what i did for two high school summers mcdonalds burger king then i promoted myself to busboy at sheckys deli you want corned beef sliced thin im your man no summer fellowships available for smart kids theres no shortage of unpaid internships said franck and the best summer programs like oxbridge you pay for my father teaches math and my mothers a nurse ergo a funny hat and playing solo deepfryer so it was a match made in heaven said milo you and elise it worked out for both of us how come youre wearing a yale tshirt franck blinked why wouldnt i why advertise the opposition the young mans smile was wide and toothy its an ivy thing flaunting your own school is pretentious so when some jerk cuts me off in traffic and hes got a yoohoo university decal on the rear window of his mercedes he probably didnt go to yoohoo if hes a jerk he probably did said franck can i assume you have no idea who killed elise i never said she was killed trey youre homicide detectives sometimes we investigate suicides you think thats what it was you see that as possible trey what do you mean any signs of depression on elises part no just like that said milo snapping his fingers no hemming and hawing i never saw any depression not in the clinical sense meaning she had her moods said franck like anyone mostly when i saw her she was in fine spirits he picked at a cuticle i probably shouldnt get into this but i feel dutybound not that i think its necessarily relevant but pick pick theres a kid named martin mendoza hes a senior at prep and elise tutored him but he didnt come to her in the usual way prep assigned him to elise and and there were problems what kinds of problems anger management said franck he didnt want to be thereat prep or working with eliseand he let her know he came in as a junior recruited to pitch for the baseball team hed been a star in public school early in the season he got injured couldnt play anymore but prep had already contracted with him for the full two years contracted said milo sounds like the major leagues in a sense it is lieutenant when a prize athlete from the inner city fits a niche at prep prep draws up a written agreement if it works out everyone gets their moneys worth if it doesnt and the student has significant academic issues to begin withwhich is fairly typicalthe problem generally fixes itself in a darwinian sense the student drops out because he cant handle the workload its a highpressure environment to begin with said franck unless youre academically oriented youre likely to be miserable blow your knee back to urban sprawl high well put lieutenant martin mendoza didnt oblige from what elise told me transferring to prep wasnt his choice it was his parents his father works as a waiter at a country club thats where he met an alum who hooked him up but overcoming historical deficits is tough whats a historical deficit trey public school said franck martin had some monumental catching up prep hired elise to help him nice of them even though he wasnt pitching anymore guess so you dont think it was altruism i think by seventeen a kid should have some control over his life and when you neglect that youre playing with fire martin got pretty aggressive with elise it upset her physically aggressive verbally but it bothered her enough to tell me about it did she ask you to protect her from mendoza nothing like that she just wanted to talk about it normally i wouldnt be thinking about it but now that shes i have to tell you im not comfortable talking out of school so to speak said milo silence so elise was scared of mendoza more like i guess she was lieutenant she tried to do her job but he kept missing appointments and messing up her schedule never followed through on homework assignments went out of his way to be uncooperative elise finally told him he was wasting her time and preps money and not doing himself a favor he got in her face started screaming elise said she backed away was ready to call but he just cursed and ran out and she never saw him again when did this happen a month or so ago whens the funeral at this point thats unclear milo produced his pad flipped it open scanned arnie josephs pardon its a bar on van nuys boulevard elise used to drink there occasionally but you know that i dont drink francks finger worked a cuticle a seam of blood appeared and he stanched it with a thumb another look at the greasy ceiling youre saying youve never been to arnie josephs franck licked his lips i havent but you have been near arnie josephs thats how we found you trey you walked elise over there then the two of you shared a byebye kiss hot and heavy was the way it was described to us trey franck blurted oh god plopping back on his bed he lay on his back closed his eyes breathed fast anything else you want to tell us trey franck mumbled something i didnt catch that trey we did it did what franck propped up on his elbows stared past us we made love not regularly once in a while nothing emotional for fun fun said milo stress relief franck swiveled and met our eyes held the gaze defiantly dealing with idiots hour after interminable hour it helped us forget chapter trey franck sat up and spread his shoulders admitting his affair with elise freeman had enlarged him milo said when did you and elise begin your stressreduction program dont worry i was over eighteen im not worried son im looking for details i still dont see why anything ive done is relevant milo squatted and put his big face close to francks franck edged back when we investigate a nasty death trey we begin by looking at people close to the deceased because statistically most nasty deaths are perpetrated by someone the victim knows when we ran elises phone records you popped up as a frequent contact one thing in your favor is that you didnt lie about not speaking to her in two weeks the record backs that up but that doesnt mean were not interested in learning more about you statistics said franck are group measurements intended for samples not individuals they possess absolutely no validity when applied to individuals thanks for the math lesson son but right now youre what we call a person of interest and if you want to stop being a person of interest youll just answer the questions i just dont see why my sex life is heres a theoretical situation trey what if you and elise had a hotandheavy romance going and she broke it off jealousy and resentment are great motives it may be theoretical but its definitely not empirical said franck elise and i got together occasionally for recreational sex and no one broke anything off if youre looking at jealousy pay attention to a loser who had a serious thing for her named sal fidella since youve got phone records im sure youve seen his number you know mr fidella no i know of him elise said shed dated him on and off he was getting annoying annoying in what way wanting to keep getting with her but she was over it she thought he was a loser always talking to her about getrichquick schemes such as she didnt elaborate and i didnt ask it wasnt anything we dwelled upon did elise ever say fidella had actually gone through with any of his schemes franck smirked so you already suspect him dont secondguess us son she never got specific beyond saying he was all heat no light she ever say he was violent unfortunately she never mentioned that unfortunately youd concentrate on him and i wouldnt have to talk about my sex life youve seen a photo of elise and fidella in her living room okay so that didnt make you think about what shes over him but hangs on to his picture francks knees pressed together i suppose that was incongruous but so what i wasnt romantically attached to elise obviously said milo she kept no picture of you silence unless she did and you removed it after she died no way i havent been to her house in months you keep coming back to total irrelevancies milo said of course there could be another reasonanother theoretical elise had students coming in and out parents too sometimes flaunting a nonromantic recreational relationship with a former student wouldnt do much for business i was never her student you were eighteen when you met her that made me legal were not talking legal trey were talking appropriate silence milo said how soon after you started working for elise did it get personal i dont recall guy like you with memory problems my memorys fine said franck i never made note of the precise date because i never thought id have to explain myself to was it soon after or did it take a while to develop franck shook his head this is humiliating so was elises death the young man lowered his head how soon trey not weeks months franck looked up you want the voyeuristic details fine one night i went over to elises house to collect my money she was wearing a tank top and shorts white top blue shorts all the other times id seen her shed dressed in dresses to the knee or slacks her hair tied back no makeup that night her hair was loose she wore makeup she had on perfume she told me i was doing a great job invited me to sit down have a drinknot alcohol i dont drink alcohol never have she meant a soft drink thats what she was having we sat down together on the couch talked his eyes moved to one side drifted back cloudy with reminiscence it just happened and kept happening said milo were talking four years on and off have you heard the expression bootycall milo smiled yes son who bootycalled who she always called me the last one was two weeks agothe phone call you saw but that time i didnt go over why not other obligations franck scratched a corner of his mouth id grown ambivalent about the relationship for one thing i came to learn that elise has a drinking problem nothing chronic but she binges my mother has a problem in that area and ive seen how its affected her secondly i prefer to date women my own age im not claiming to be some kind of bigtime player but right now theres someone im involved with she knows nothing about elise and id like to keep it that way im deeply sorry elise is dead i couldnt feel worse she did a lot for me but im really nervous about my personal life going public that would be hell no reason for your girlfriend to know unless shes your alibi francks eyes widened i need an alibi let me give you somei guess youd call them parametersfor the period of elises death as milo outlined the time frame francks shoulders loosened almost immediately his grin was christmasmorning bright a kid in a room full of presents during that entire time i wasnt even in la i was in palo alto for a series of research meetings with professor milbankprofessor seth milbank hes conducting research at stanford that might conceivably relate to mine professor moonmy advisor professor norman moonthought it would be a good idea for the three of us to sit down facetoface and discuss possibilities professor moon has travel money on his grant so we flew up feel free to check my plane tickets and my hotel reservation id show you restaurant receiptswe ate out every mealbut professor moon paid for everything with his business card milo said tickets and hotel sound like a good start trey the young man slid off the sofa bed retrieved his laptop from the floor held the computer like a glockenspiel and typed while standing seconds later he showed us an online travel site screen fourday stay at the palo alto sojourner inn incoming and outgoing flights on southwest satisfied said franck four days said milo thats a lot of meetings we made a side trip to berkeley to confer with professor rosen milo phoned the hotel spoke with the desk hung up looks like youre cleared trey unless youve figured out how to be in two places simultaneously not yet but maybe one of these days said franck youre working on that wait long enough lieutenant and everything happens we left the shabby building nearly collided with a helmeted student speeding up the footpath on a skateboard hey watch it milo said put more time into your physics homework huh plotting trajectories pal yours sucked the kid stared waited until milo s back was turned before flipping us off back in the car i said fishandchips somethings off with franck but i cant pinpoint it theres a minuscule speech delay i said like a machine processing thats it reminds me of a witness on the stand whos been coached a fouryear affair leaves plenty of room for rage too bad hes alibied tight youre not buying the bootycall defense thats what it was to elise but young guy experienced older woman ill bet franck was a virgin when she seduced him and he grew a lot more emotionally involved than hes letting on the door to francks building opened franck stepped out and walked straight toward us this should be interesting said milo starting to roll down the window but franck staring down as he hurried never saw us cutting across the lawn he continued south we waited a few minutes before following him two blocks south he entered another apartment building a whole different world from francks dump this one was thirties spanish architecture immaculate upkeep thoughtful landscaping the right side of the building was a wide veranda arranged with wroughtiron furniture real estate ads would call the place charming and for once they wouldnt be lying we didnt sit long before franck was out again arm in arm with a petite darkhaired girl in jeans and a brown sweatshirt milo said obviously she went to columbia franck and the girl faced pecked lips strolling to the veranda they pushed a love seat toward the shadows settled held hands kissed some more the girls head rested on francks shoulder milo said now i feel like a voyeur and now it is fishandchips the pub was gone replaced by half a storefront peddling vintage jeans another serving fastfood thai time to be geographically eclectic he said what can i get you im fine dont think your discretion will shame me into fasting i idled by the curb as he loped into the thai place something he told the counter girl made her smile he got back in the car with bags full of takeout double order of pad to go just in case you change your mind extra spice extra shrimp extra everything she could think of i cruised west on the as he wielded a plastic fork and gobbled when he stopped to breathe i said the daisy chain continues he wiped his mouth meaning another helpful witness winterthorn punted you to hauer hauer to fidella now franck gives you a twofer fidella and martin mendoza he flicked the prong of the fork lets hear it for upright citizens doing their duty maybe two votes for sal should put him square on my radar if he did find out elise was cutting him off sexually and financially were talking bigtime hurt feelings which puts me right back where i started the socalled boyfriend he poked noodles wrapped up the bulk of the thai food and bagged it not good i said good enough he appeared to doze off but a few miles later without opening his eyes he said as far as young master mendoza with the temper hes latino meaning he might know spanish meaning hed find it easy enough to pay mr anteater for buying ice on the other hand murders a pretty strong reaction to being tutored against your will and according to franck mendoza had stopped showing up at elises place i said for tutoring his lids rose she was doing him too another younger man oh boy but with a young offender something sexual gone bad id expect disorganization overkill this was just the opposite alex antiseptic staged it doesnt feel right it doesnt unless martins one of those longsimmering types he called in an autotrack on martin mendoza plenty of registered drivers with that name but none in the age range same for a criminal record kid doesnt even have a license must love watching rich kids zoom into the

achieved closure about ms freemans death weve held two town halls as well as a voluntary grief counseling seminar for anyone interested its been an emotional experience i said how was the turnout for the seminar what difference does that make just wondering about student interest why so you can interrogate them turnout was fine our people are doing well all things considered or they were until two men were spotted lurking implies underhanded said milo we stood right out in the open and to my eye none of the kids seemed bothered mary jane rollins fingered eyeglasses hanging from a chain with all due respect to the acuity of your eye lieutenant you created stress and bother now if theres nothing more youre not curious why were here dr rollins ive too many things on my plate for idle curiosity walkowicz rolled his eyes rollins sensed something and pivoted toward him by the time their gazes met the guard had returned to stoic immobility but when rollins faced us again his mouth flirted with mirth milo said we need to talk to one of your students the intention was to find him before he entered the school grounds to minimize disruption a student who martin mendoza silence he is a student

with no authorization working on my improv skills stan cut the shit man this is a major problem what possessed you a problem for who dont play with me said creighton what was going through your head i need to talk to a student i figure schools the logical place to find a student what student kid named martin mendoza milo offered a sketchy summary creighton said kids got a temper so hes a suspect im open to suggestions stan whatever the point is even with a student the schools not the logical place because the rules were made clear to you kids have homes start there now get the hell out of here and here i was thinking a stroll on campus would be educational for all concerned you really have a death wish dont you milo smiled im assuming youre talking metaphor stan creightons pupils were

you again milo said can i check first to see if ive got rope in my car rope for so you can tie one of my legs back so i cant walk without falling on my ass then you can bind both of my arms to my side and oh yeah maybe ive got some rags in the trunk so you can gag me if god forbid i should talk to a goddamn witness without seeking permission then you can use some other rags for the blindfold so i

you access turning heel he marched away i followed catching my breath creighton said yeah right neither of us spoke until he drove away keeping a light touch on the gas humming a weird minorkey tunemaybe some old druid chant buried in his celtic consciousness did i mean it hell yes or no or maybe goddammit will i regret it probably okay lets find martin mendoza off the job but on the job i said as an independent citizen howre you going to approach him with my usual tact and sensitivity i meant under what authority hmm he said how about power to the people chapter la county hosts scores of golf courses but exclusive enclaves for the bigrich number less than a dozen milo began with the westside used his suddenly defunct rank to get through to human resource directors success on the third try emilio mendoza was a waiter at mountain crest country club id been there a few years ago as the lunch guest of a psychiatric entrepreneur wooing me to direct a nonprofit home for wayward children amiable meal but the devil had messed up the details and id declined despite a great steak soon after the home closed down in a corruption scandal the club occupied lovely rolling bluffs where pacific palisades abuts malibu by the sixth hole ocean views distract stout fees and extensive vetting limit the membership to people of a certain type that day at lunch the only dark faces had been those of the staff i wondered if emilio mendoza had been the one to place a plattersized rib eye before me as if it were a sacrament the hr woman on the phone said hes at work ill have him call you milo said it would be better if i talk to him now maam may i ask what this is concerning a family matter said milo emilios family yes maam the policeoh dear youre not saying something terrible has happened terrible things happen all the time but mr mendozas family is fine then why if youd prefer i can drop by talk to him in person maybe shoot a few holes hold on ill try to find him a few

okay was just sick of school we were tired of arguing so we let him stay home sick of school in general or prep in particular he didnt like that place emilio mendozas voice faltered three days my wife is having a real hard time have you called the police i was going to today i kept hoping hed come home when you called i thought maybe you found him somewhere milo said kids drop out for a few days all the time i see it all the time martin has left before said mendoza twice he took the bus to his sister in texas this time she says hes not there you think shed cover for martin theyre close but no after gisella heard how upset her mother was she wouldnt do that lets get together mr mendoza im sure we can sort things out what could you do tell me about martin maybe i can help find him if a missing persons report is the way to go ill see that yours gets full attention you want to talk about ms freeman said mendoza you dont suspect martin of anything milo nodded and mouthed now i do not at all sir i dont know said mendoza brief chat sir im working all day and then maybe i do a double shift if they need me whenever youre free said milo i dont know mendoza repeated okay enough of anna

youre hungry theyre okay see you there sir thanks i dont know what ill even say to you malibu mikes was a flimsy whiteframe leanto set on a patch of landside asphalt a grinning overly fanged shark cutout teetered atop the fraying roof picnic tables canted on the uneven pavement some shaded by windscarred umbrellas behind the property a hill of iceplantencrusted soil formed a bright green curtain the chalkboard menu listed burgers hot dogs fish tacos and something called a captains burrito milo said im underranked youre no rank at all i said order half and call it a lieutenant lets eat something i need to fuel up for serious lying a young chubby brunette girl worked the counter a young floppyhaired asian boy the grill the ocean across the highway couldnt compete with blaring hiphop from a speaker placed perilously close to the burners some millionaire gangsta bragging about having no conscience help you guys i ordered a chili dog milo said two halfpound cheeseburgers anything extra you want to put on is fine with me the girl said all we got extra is onion and picklesi guess we could throw on chili too but ill have to charge you go for it hows that captains burrito the girl grimaced guys order it but i dont like it its messy you end up with most of it on the paper then it sticks to the paper cause a the cheese then it hardens you cant peel it off without peeling off the paper then afterward your hands smell of sauce cheese its gross captains can be like that huh all show no substance no comprehension in young brown eyes milo said but the burgers okay i like it milo finished his first halfpounder unwrapped the second but didnt touch it the ocean was calm he wasnt kid runs away right maybe franck did me a favor he studied the water got up i will not be influenced by the opinions of others gonna try the damn burrito get it to go ricks on call i can eat with my hands no ones gonna squawk should reheat okay dont you think he returned with a greasy cardboard box that he placed in the trunk of the unmarked the cars built as tight as a drunks resolve so the ride home would be fragrant just as he returned to the table a white hyundai drove into the lot and a smallish man got out round face thinning dark hair combed straight back pale complexion crisp features lieutenant milo waved emilio mendoza seemed disappointed hed arrived ten minutes early maybe wanting to rehearse his own script but wed beat him by fifteen he wore a white dripdry shirt pleated black pants tiny black bow tie no sign of the red waistlength jacket i remembered from my lunch milo said thanks for coming sir well wait while you order im not eating said emilio mendoza even if i wanted to spend the money my stomachs jumping all over the place patting the offending area i cant stay long theres a big dinner crowd a couple rookies need educating milo said speaking of education how did martin come to prep you mean how could a waiter from uruguay afford to send his kid to a place like that i cant they gave him a scholarship baseball mendoza s eyes narrowed youve already talked to the school i looked up martins myspace only thing on there was baseball mendoza looked at him doubtful thats why they call us detectives mr mendoza so howd martin end up at prep rather than at another school youre talking to students you dont think martin did something are you worried martin did something of course not emilio mendozas eyes watered maybe ill get a coffee after he sat down with a cardboard cup milo said does martin have a special friend someone hed go to when hes upset only his sister where in texas is she san antonio shes a nurse at bexar hospital martin called her the day he leftafter his mother and i went to work just to say hi that bothered gisella it wasnt like martin your sons not talkative hes a quiet boy what was his mood with gisella she said he sounded distracted she couldnt say by what is gisella martins only sibling yes its only the two of them as if he regretted that gisellas seven years older but theyre close milo let him sip coffee used the time to finish his second burger id still like to hear how you connected to prep oh that said mendoza a good mana regular at the club his kids and grandkids went to prep i was talking to him about martin how martin was a smart boy i wasnt happy with his education we live in el monte martin was happy with the public school but no way sure he liked it everything was too easy for him he didnt have to work you go to college like that you cant compete with kids who went to tough schools the member hes a rich man but a good man treats everyone like a personhe said maybe theres a solution emilio i say what sir he just smiles next time he comes in orders his tritip and his martini gives me a brochure from windsor prep mendoza s laugh was more nose than mouth that is what i gave mr kenten a big laugh then i apologized for being rude a fool he says dont worry emilio i know i caught you by surprise if its money youre worried about maybe we can find a solution for that too mendoza placed the coffee on the table i felt even more the fool then he says didnt you once say your boy was an excellent pitcher mendoza shrugged i dont remember saying it we dont get personal with the members but the nice ones he always comes in by himself i figure its good for him someone pays attention i say sure martins a great pitcher strong like his mothers side pinching his own thin biceps his mothers father was a blacksmith muscles out to here his uncle tito his mothers brother played basketball for miramar thats a big team in uruguay before he got hurt frowning martin also got hurt maybe thats from her side too what was martins injury mendoza touched his left shoulder rotator cuff it can heal if he rests maybe surgery maybe no either way no baseball for a long time mendoza slapped the table perfect opportunity like from god they need a star pitcher martin needs a good education at south el monte there was talk some professional scouts came to see him but no one said anything to me so i think it was just talk when did martin transfer to prep last year second half of eleventh grade middle of the year i was worried about them being snobs but let me tell you they rolled out the carpet big deal he wasnt impressed martin didnt like the attention martin didnt like anything the kids the teachers the buildings even the trees too many trees papi they put dust in my hair i say are you crazy man its beautiful a garden of eden you want south el monte after seeing this he says yeah thats what i want i say youre out of your mind boy he turns his back on me says i like what i like and its my life head shake stubborn like his mother maybe it helps with baseball saturdays he went to the upitch throwing all day one time he came home with the arm all black under the skin he threw so much the muscles were bleeding under the skin it looked like a disease his mother screamed i called his coachthis was middle school he was twelve thirteen say talk to martin no more bleeding he tells me martins gifted maybe he overdoes a little but thats better than being lazy stupid man i hang up talk to martin myself martin says sandy koufax used to pitch with black arms i say whos sandy koufax martin laughs and walks away later i look up sandy koufax hes the greatest pitcher ever lived fine good for him i still dont like my son with a black arm another look at his watch i go to martins games he says dont embarrass me by screaming and going crazy like the other fathers just sit there thats all i can tell you i need to get back to work i said how did martin adjust to the tougher curriculum at prep did he feel stupid said mendoza oh yeah and he let me know all the time i made him feel stupid by moving him did his grades suffer sure this was a real school no more easy as now its bs if hes lucky i tell him a b from prep is worth more than a public school a he walks away mendoza threw up his hands thats when elise freeman stepped into the picture she was their ideathe schools what happened was martin wrote a compositiona term paper it was no good sloppy he can do better ive seen him do better maybe he did it on purpose you know to prove a point i said exactly making himself look stupid so the school say byebye i tell him instead of making a scheme study hard youre a smart boy now with no baseball you got extra time he hands the paper in anyway got a d as if announcing a terminal diagnosis never ever before did he get a d not him or his sister never did i see a d anywhere in my house i was ready to i got angry okay i admit it there was loud yelling thats the first time martin took the bus to his sister how long did he stay away just the weekend gisella convinced him to go home she bought him an airline ticket i paid her back every penny what about the second time i said a few weeks later blinking what was that about sigh her ms freeman the school arranged a tutor for him all paid to martin that was saying youre stupid stubborn like i said maybe for baseball its okay but not for life anger had winched his voice higher no more fatherly protectiveness he leaned closer everyone helping him hes spitting in everyones facenot really spitting you know what i mean milo said attitude oh boy hes got attitude mendoza swigged coffee narrowly missed sloshing liquid onto his white shirt he inspected the placket flicked off a speck of dust lucky i only got one more clean in my locker another glance at his watch i got to go they need me i said how long did martin stay in texas the second time same thing three days that time gisella put him on the bus cause i told her no more airplane theres no chance he returned to gisellas gisella never lies milo said could we have her phone number please you dont believe me of course we do sir but just in case martin shows up sometime in the future you think he could said mendoza kids do all sorts of things that would be good his mother could stop throwing up milo copied as he recited i said youre sure martin doesnt have any friends he could find refuge with thats part of the problem he didnt like the kids there too rich too snobby too whiteeven the latino kids and the black kids were white according to him i say youre the one being a snob judge people by what they do not by who their parents are he laughs like youd understand i say youre a star athlete goodlooking guy youre smart whats not to like he gets really mad with the attitude starts screaming about what about everything nice i said im a star athlete he shakes his bad shoulder this is an athlete he pinches his cheek stretches the skin out this is goodlooking martins dark not like me his mothers side sometimes her brotherthe basketball playergets taken for a brazilian i say calm down he keeps going you think this is goodlooking at a place like that im a fucking outcast excuse the language thats how he said it he was pretty upset hes waving his arms gonna hurt that rotator cuff he walks out but this time he comes back with the d term paper rips it up starts eating it still incredulous chewing the paper swallowing im screaming now what are you doing fool youll get sick he says since you stuck me in that place i been eating shit whats a little paper for dessert then he leaves the house i dont see him until i get home from work the next day whered he go he never says where he goes he didnt want to be tutored but he showed up hes a good boy said emilio mendoza how did he like it he says its a waste of time and money she doesnt care about him all she wants is the money all she does is sit there while he reads and writes then she gives him extra homework that no way hes going to do mendozas eyes shot to the sky i said anything else about her bother him not really he gripped his cup with both hands dented the cardboard what is it mr mendoza look he said martin can think things that are wrong like one time he knew one of gisellas friends was interested in him but she wasnt gisella told him they had a fight martin thought something about ms freeman that you dont think was true he said she touched him too much nothing sexy his arm his hand i say whats the big deal shes friendly he says what the hell papi does touching have to do with english i say youre making a big deal shes there to help you i said ms freeman tutored english and history what about martins science and math grades in sciencebiologyhes better got the bs he hates writing said ms freeman figured that out and thats why she gave him extra writing i say shes trying to fix what you need to be fixed then he walked out you got it said mendoza hes a good boy please dont think he did anything the whole thing with herms freemanits no big deal he went three times maybe four martins a good boy he has a lot of pressure maybe i did the wrong thing by putting him in prep my wife says i did split second of reflection but no i dont think so you need a challenge without a challenge you dress up in a bow tie and serve rich people who look at you like youre a piece of furniture now i have to go please dont say a little more emilio i have to go chapter mendoza s white hyundai rolled down to pch milo said he started off protective but ended up giving up info way i see it one of two things happened elise came on to martin and it creeped him out she got pissed at being rejected he got pissed that she was pissed it escalated and martin bore a grudge or he succumbed to her charms but she made him feel inadequate or played around with him and rejected him later theres a third possibility he had nothing to do with killing her he rabbited alex thats his pattern when the tension piles up he leaves like you said a teen with a short fuse still doesnt sync with the planning that went into the murder and nothing martins father told us depicts martin as a good planner just the opposite hes impulsive true but ive got to listen to my victim even a lying victim like elise martin scared her enough for her to tell trey franck about it time to find this kid he found gisella mendozas number in his pad ms mendoza this is lieutenant sturgis from the los angeles police department your parents are worried about your brother martin and im checking his whereabouts yes your father told me he wasnt but i was wondering if martins shown up since then yes of course youd call your parents and thats still the first thing you should do but if you dont mind please let me know too because once i close the file on martin i can pay attention to other missing kids yes unfortunately weve got lots im sure you are yes i know its anxietyprovoking though your dad does say martin has left before and he always comes back quickly yes that was good of you your parents really appreciated your convincing martin to return let me ask you something gisella the second time martin showed up your dad said he had issues with a teacher right a tutor did martin mention anything about what bothered him about this tutor because maybe the same thing happened and itll help us find him thats it okay thanks for your timeoh yeah could i have your address for the file he clicked off nice girl im gonna ask san antonio pd to do a driveby at her place what did martin tell her about elise he felt she didnt care about him that could mean she blew him off sexually wonder if hes fluent in spanishshoulda asked his dad about that dr rollins might know i said like shed tell me i pulled out my phone called prep asked for rollins got put on hold he said youre kidding nothing ventured four minutes later i had the answer provided by a borderlinehostile headmaster eager to get me off the line when i thanked her she said please note once again ive been fully cooperative repay the kindness by respecting preps privacy milo said you gotta give me some charm lessons so does he habla espanol well enough to pass out of the foreignlanguage requirement excellent who better to pick some spanish day laborer to do the heavy lifting hell for all we know mr anteater was directly involved with the killing mr anteater bought dry ice in van nuys martins got no drivers license but he somehow managed to get from el monte to the heart of the valley then over to elises place in studio city big deal he borrowed wheels or stole emor got someone to drive him he calls himself an outcast but that doesnt mean he couldnt find another outcast cant you see a couple of bitter adolescents hatching a weird ice scheme his cell rang fur elise again i said got the joke but he was concentrating didnt hear afternoon sir no i suppose not sir in all fairness sir it wasnt a deliberate provoca yes sir but still yes sir i just felt stan creighton came on a bit heavy yes sir can i say one thing strictly speaking if im off the job im not actually obligated to yes sir yes sir yes sir right now sir snapping the phone shut he rubbed his face i said out of retirement apparently i never was in retirement apparently decisions about my career arent mine to make apparently doing the job properly has nothing to do with your fucking ego or your histrionic grandstanding bullshit sturgis im due at his office asap this time youre explicitly disinvited aw shucks his exact wording was dont even think about shlepping along your phd nursemaid this shit you wipe on your own and be thankful your fucking badge doesnt end up in a bodily orifice maybe you can bring a peace offering i said like specialorder a doublesized burrito tell him its the chief oh man he said therell be enough gas without that i next heard from him at eight pm standing at my door holding a bouquet of flowers for robin he said because im invading her privacy he walked past me stopped to pet blanche griping as always about a taller dog not killing his back blanche licked his hand and pressed her head against his shin he muttered yeah youre cute wheres robin out for dinner with an old friend from san luis he handed me the flowers put em in water theyll keep howd it go downtown he strode to the kitchen searched the fridge pulled nothing out i arrive expecting to be disemboweled with garden shears hes all mellow smoking a cigar tie loosened come right in sturgis its like nothing ever happened he just wants a progress report it was only after i finished that he reverted to type i said progress sturgis not a fucking exposition of the obvious why the hell havent you followed up on the italian boyfriend seeing as hes a con and a loser work this one logically which translates to forget about the school hed rather have you on supervised duty than freelancing what does he think about martin mendoza not impressed same for trey franck its always loved ones and lowlifes sturgis the italian guy is both he opened the fridge again retrieved a loaf of bread and snarfed a slice dry blanche looked up with customary fascination so guess where im headed now reason i stopped here first is im not sure how to approach fidella hes cooperated so far whats my reason for recontacting him without getting him antsy and pulling back into his shell i said if hes a con man hell be naturally suspicious so im not sure you can avoid getting him wary you could try telling him youve found some kids at the school who had conflict with elise figured if she confided in anyone it would be him which leads to an interesting point elise told trey franck about martin but if she mentioned it to fidella he didnt pass that along so either she felt closer to franck or fidellas keeping his cards under the table if its the latter fidella may be considering another extortion scheme all the more reason to tantalize him with a possible link to the school youre confirming his initial theory and making him feel like part of your team as opposed to a suspect he lets his guard down you might learn something interesting and santas on call twelve months a year yanking the fridge open for the third time he scored a second slice of bread deliberated added a third pulled out a jar of boysenberry jam topped by a ginghamwrapped lid looks homemade you guys going slowfood robins friend brought it slathering both slices he chewed noisily id love to see fidellas spontaneous reaction to the mention of francks name he gives off a serious tell ive got a clear pathway to your basic crime of passion but i cant risk showing my cards not that the odds like uncle milo unlike sal i never scored a jackpot if you had you mightve held on to the dough well look at that he pinged the vase of flowers with a fingernail for the price of some stems and petals i get therapy chapter the sky above sal fidellas block was moonlit particleclogged heavy with mist houses and shrubs and trees appeared partially erased no corvette in the driveway dim yellow porch light over the door but no illumination from within milo got out and rang the bell anyway was greeted by the expected silence someone called scuse me from across the street a man gestured from the lawn of a neatly kept ranch house big man in tshirt and shorts big shaggy dog on a leash sitting obediently at his side the dog studied our approach dark bearlike unmoving but for intelligent eyes that cut through the haze the man was in his early thirties bullnecked and crewcut with a fuzzy chinbeard and the topheavy physique of a silverback gorilla youre cops right i came out with rufus and seen you he hooked a thumb at fidellas house whatd he do milo said what makes you think he did anything he didnt whats on your mind sir the man shifted his weight the dog didnt budge tell the truth officer none of us likes him living so close none of us being me my wife also the barrettstwo houses down they also got kids youre worried about your kids not yet said the man so far he just bothered the wives bothered them how trying to sell em stuff they didnt want with my wife it was a guitar for my oldest but sean dont play the guitar seans into sports she told him that he kept pushin telling dara kids who played instruments were smarter than kids who didnt play instruments he had some good cheap guitars sean could pick his color dara said thanks but no thanks he follows her all the way up to our door finally she has to say really im not interested and hes still talking dara told me about it later i said let me go over there she said if he does it again no sense making a scene later we were having a barbecue with doug and karenthe barrettsand dara found out hed pulled the same stunt with karen trying to sell her a guitar drums their oldest plays the drums you can hear it a mile away when he practices one day he catches karen as shes driving up tells her doesnt sound like ryans drum kits any good she says its fine he says its really not he can get her a better one cheap karen says no thanks were fine he gets pushy the same way he did with dara karens tougher than dara she yells at him to back off did he yeah but he had a foot in her door thats weird no anything else about him we should know mr roland staubach said the man i go by rolly this is a nice family block he lives by himself never goes to work so tell me howd he get that corvette and that ginormous flatscreen youve been inside his house me why should i you saw his flatscreen its right in front and sometimes he opens those sheets he uses for curtains ill be walking rufus and hes right there for the whole world to see sitting on the couch in his underwear drinking and watching his flatscreen when i saw you drive up in that unmarked i said finally someone i can talk to you know about unmarkeds said milo i used to drive for one of the towyard services used by your department van bruggens over in silverlake once in a while i hooked up an unmarked so whatd he do nothing said milo nothing you knocked on his door hes a potential witness mr staubach to what nothing that concerns the neighborhood is there anything else you want to tell me about him he gives me a bad feeling said staubach anytime he gets in that corvette guns the engine like he does rufus is at the front window all tense rubbing the dogs neck also he never goes to a regular job this is a working block i drive for ups work weekends at macks aquarium in tarzana daras a teachers aide at the kids school for tuition doug and karen are both at con edison the millers down the block are respiratory therapists everyones working like crazy except him how long has he lived here said milo he was already here when we moved in thats a year and a half ago thanks mr staubach well be back to talk to him you could talk to him now officer hes home i saw him pulling that corvette into the driveway around four thirty never saw him leave gunning it like he always does rufus was up at the window all tense then an hour ago the corvette starts up again only this time no gunning and rufus is relaxed so i go check it out some other guys driving it away some kid how old of a kid said milo didnt get a long look at him but i could see him through the open window and it sure wasnt fidella we talking teenager could be i really didnt see that good caucasian not black thats for sure said staubach hair color couldnt tell you could he have been hispanic all i can say is light enough so he wasnt black or maybe he was black but a light black i figured maybe hes fidellas kid a divorce situation fidella never sees him that would fit with his character you know you figured fidella loaned him his car i guess youre thinking the car got stolen was the kid inside fidellas house that i cant tell you youre thinking this kid hotwired it or something youre sure fidella wasnt in the passenger seat i guess he couldve been all i saw was someone at the wheel milo looked up and down the block there was enough light staubach pointed he passed right under that street lamp officer i wouldnt tell you something i saw when i didnt what was the kid wearing all i saw was his head said staubach thats my point im not gonna make stuff up have there been any other car thefts in the neighborhood you know last year mr feldmanhes an old man his wife just died that blue house with all the flowers last year someone drove off in mr feldmans cadillac middle of the night rolled it right out of his driveway it got found in east la tires gone the moonroof cut out thats why you asked about hispanic some kind of east la gangbangers yeah sure he couldve been you saw this kid drive off an hour ago what time is it now nine fifteen then its an hour and a quarter so whats next officer ill give mr fidella another try great idea milo said looks like rufus is itching for his walk already walked him said staubach then i guess he deserves a nice rest whaoh sure ill stay out of your way but keep in touch okay were a block likes to know whats going on another try at fidellas front door brought the same result he peered across the street at staubachs house neatly pleated drapes ruffled as someone moved i said your year for helpful citizens must be el nino we continued up fidellas cracked driveway the yard was an unlit patch of dirt or grasstoo dark to tell which high hedges loomed on three sides the rear door was wood set with a glass panel the single garage was bolted shut no illumination milo pulled out his little fiberoptic flashlight held it high the way cops are trained to do aimed at a rusty light fixture over the rear door empty socket lots of rust sals behind in his maintenance a rap on the panel was followed by silence he cast a cool white beam over the property mostly dirt some weeds a single struggling orange tree the hedge was ficus worn bare in spots by disease and backed by cement block a second goround closer to the rear of the property picked up something lying near the hedge what looked to be a roll of carpeting closer inspection showed it to be a cloth tube fattened by substantial content giant sausage personsized sausage milo held me back instinctively inched forward scanned stopped clamping the flashlight in one armpit he gloved up lit up the dirt separating him from the package bent at the knees footprints looks like some sort of sneaker shifting to the left he skirted the prints checked the ground for other signs of disruption inched his way toward the roll of cloth stooping he held the flashlight in his teeth peeled back a corner of sheeting bald head he announced cracked like an egg lots of blood he got up walked backward cant move anything until the ci gets here but anyone taking bets this aint sal i said no good odds on that one three hours later fidellas body had been taken to the crypt blood spatter freckled the kitchen of the house including some fairly heavy ceiling castoff a pool cue coated with skin and brain matter stood propped in a corner bloody sneaker prints trailed through the hallway near the linen closet under strong light red specks darkening the dirt outside grew visible despite all the blood no sign of a struggle milos working hypothesis was a bluntforce blitz near the kitchen sink followed by wrapping of the body in a blanket and three fitted sheets taken from the linen closet and a dump in a corner of the yard no argument from the ci or anyone else techs dusted and processed van nuys uniforms guarded the yellow tape out front a grayhaired stoopshouldered van nuys detective named wally fishell showed up after the body was gone looking sleepy and putupon after getting the facts from milo he said im happy to work with you lieutenant but if you see this as fruit from the tree you planted thats fine with me meaning farewell and good luck if thats your preference said fishell because youre a pal fishell looked as if hed been slapped im not dumping i dont want to get in your way is all no prob look whatever you want lieutenant i been working like a dog supposedly im off the plan was to spend time with my granddaughter she lives in san mateo i dont get to see her often enough go home then naw its okay im here already forget it said milo this is definitely gonna hook into mine you have an idea who killed him probably the same person who killed my vic fishell waited milo said thats as far as its gotten go home and enjoy the granddaughter how old is she five great age you bet we were watching dora the explorer said fishell thats a cartoon showyou got kids nope oh said fishell well thanks i get back now i can finish dora we waited around longer in case the crime scene crew came up with anything dramatic no signs of forced entry fidellas slippers and three empty beer bottles with fidellas prints were found in the living room no prints on the pool cue probably wiped clean same for a bloodstained leather case screening the house for physical evidence would stretch until morning no sign of any computers but clear space on a bedroom desk and an old laser printer in the closet suggested a linkup had once existed fidellas cell phone lay on the bed milo checked recent calls nothing since morning he returned the phone to a tech admiring the murder weapon look at this lieutenant ivory handle probably genuine and this is real cute eyeing a middle section of rosewood imprinted with silver hearts clubs spades and diamonds this cost some serious bucks lieutenant no table in the house so he probably took it with him to bars pool halls whatever or the killer brought the cue with him and risk damaging something so cool said the tech depends on the payoff for what bashing in mr fidellas skull oh i guess maybe we left the scene roland staubach observed accompanied by rufus and a fairhaired woman also in shorts and a tee neighbors drifted out of their homes and stayed to watch milo waved staubach returned the gesture woodenly before looking away milo drove on all of a sudden its a block doesnt want to know too much midway up beverly glen he said martin mendozas looking better and better bashing fidellas skull then stealing the car is exactly the kind of poorimpulse crap a kid like him would do whats the motive i said he had no answer for that and ignorance didnt sit well with him hunching over the wheel he switched on the police radio pretended to be interested in misdemeanors and traffic violations by the time he dropped me at my house we hadnt spoken for ten minutes night i said guess who im calling soon as youre out of the car cursing under his breath dont suppose hell take the news well seeing as he just lost his favorite suspect and this puts it right back at the school why would martin go after fidella dont know hey he said thats my mantra be sure to tell robin where the flores came from i forgot a card he drove off as i climbed the stairs to my front door moments after i was inside settled next to robin a familiar knock sounded at the front door milo stood there looking like a shy kid at the prom robin stood on tiptoes and bussed his cheek thanks for the bouquet darling what have you brought me now i should bring you something same reason abuse of privacy cmon in darling love to but ive been summoned by the boss as in now unfortunately so has alex if you can spare him ill send you three dozen roses tomorrow hes worth more than vegetative matter but sure i said im reinvited better youre the guest of honor chapter the freeway at one am was slick black tape i said chiefs in his office this late hes home you do house calls now i do i said anyone in the office notices a meeting at this hour it arouses suspicion and documents his meddling meaning where he lives no onell notice last time he met us in calabasas my guess is hes got one of those secluded west valley spreads now you know why he likes you sherlock the chiefs spread in agoura backed up against horse farms undeveloped pasture the umber mass of the santa monica mountains getting close took us half an hour beyond the freeway past the point where streets were identified by signs early on wed sped past desperately cute strip malls a porsche dealership a gas station charging ten percent more than in the city now we hurtled through dark unfocused space milo had trouble navigating the increasingly complex web of trails barely wide enough for a vehicle several wrong turns into frustration he flipped on the dome light read his own handscrawled directions while coasting by the time we arrived at a small wooden sign he was sweating and cursing burned into rough plank serenity ranch i said bit of a commute to windsor prep nothing like parental dedication nothing like mommy dedication we passed through an open swing gatejust a steel frame and a single diagonal crossbeamand the crown vic labored up an asphalt ribbon worn to raw earth in spots lumped unpleasantly in others the cars overtaxed suspension whined at every concussion the gate wasnt much of a barrier i said a lesser man might be concerned about intruders apex predators dont fret about that kind of thing a halfacre motor court spread tight as a fitted sheet fronted a wide shallowroofed onestory house parking for scores of cars but no vehicles in sight maybe the family wheels were buttoned up in the quadruple garage the court was unadorned concrete other than a couple of huge oaks listing dangerously no greenery graced the house the rear was clear flat acreage lots of it the trees were probably the last surviving remnants of an ancient grove decimated for top cops lair too many wet years and they might topple vengefully the chief was waiting for us rocking in a chair set at the front edge of the court tastefully lit by a lowwatt pole fixture resembling a gas lamp the tip of his cigar created tiny orange curlicues wisps of smoke were ingested by the darkness milo cruised to a halt opened his window sir over there a stiff thumb jabbed to the left embers tumbled to the concrete sparked died we parked got out no other seating meant we stood like supplicants the chiefs white hair gave off metallic glints when the cigar tip favored it with transitory light otherwise he was a charcoal sketch two murders dr delaware he said softly my diagnosis is big fucking mess whats yours ill go with that inconsiderate bastard the italian guy i liked him better as an offender he clicked his tongue so were looking at the mexican kid for the italian that made it sound like an international conspiracy i suppressed the urge to say with an american pool cue milo said like i said a young man was spotted leaving the exactly youve said lets move on in terms of freeman weve pretty much eliminated those teachers milo said theres no evidence against them but so we move on long silence then the sound of a slow sucking inhalation the cigar tip expanded a miniature orange planet smokerings floated upward like tiny ufos not that youve got anywhere to move sturgis i said hard to go anywhere when youre stuck in park the orange disk bounced meaning doctor meaning this hasnt been a conventional investigation throat clear youre a social observer doctor a casual observer more isnt required maybe wed all be better off doctor if we stuck to our areas of expertise yours being psychopathology in terms of that does the mexican kid sound potentially violent to you he sounds frustrated i said his familys from uruguay wherever hes from he sounds like a fucking ingrate senor daddy tell you which alumnus got his nino into prep a man named kenten edwin kenten he said another fucking layer of complication who is he a builder of cities doctor laughing bitterly a titan among mere mortals his game is partnering with municipalities then evoking eminent domain to bulldoze private property in place of which he nails up lowbudget housing and bigbox stores financed by taxpayer money all in the name of the greater good his laugh was low hoarse ominous ed kenten served on the committee that recommended hiring me we had an interview during which he led me to believe he supported me when the time came to vote he supported someone else because their dark skin mattered more to him than the ability to get the fucking job done another threatening snicker yeah can see him putting the mexican kid in an awkward situation just so he could feel noble kid freaks out gets violent does freeman but thats not enough to quell his rage so he bashes the italians brains he clucked eddies going to have to find himself another barrio darling meanwhile hes playing his eighteen holes at mountain crest and getting chauffeured to paradise cove hell the kids daddys probably still serving ed his shrimp cocktail the cigar tip danced merrily i said why does kenten complicate matters once the kid gets busted eddie being his mentor will come to light and first thing hell assume is im out to make him look bad so you be damn sure sturgis that youve got rocksolid evidence before you stir up the cesspool a light went on in the big low house the chief shot a quick look back faced us again okay heres the deal sturgis concentrate on finding the corvette it shows up with the mexican kids prints in it or if you get any kind of physical evidence from the house pointing to the kid well be forced to deal with the consequences you find squat in the car and the house you leave the kid alone and said milo and take a breather regroup put everything on ice until youve got evidence pun intended and dont worry about getting bored i just sat through a powerpoint dogandpony from my math techies and they say west las due for a fresh homicide in thirty to fifty days most likely a gang shooting once in a while even you can catch something easy milo said mendozas never been in the system afis wont have his prints a nice lawabiding nino said the chief how uplifting maybe eddie kenten sensed that on the other hand maybe the kids kind of cute the orange disk dipped catch my meaning sturgis kentens gay laughter a married grandpa tsktsk i dont rumormong on the other hand you tell me mendozas a strapping muscular stud im not going to gasp in shock sir in terms of martin mendozas prints not being in the no sense whatiffing you dont even have the car find it have the techies do their thing who knows you might luck out and get prints from someone who is in the system i just saw the gta stats for van nuys shameful its something we definitely need to work on so the italian couldve gotten brained by a jackhappy eastside punk just like the neighbor assumed and we can all go home have a beer fuck whoever it is we customarily fuck that doesnt close freeman sir some of lifes mysteries sturgis are destined to remain enigmatic milo didnt respond i said convenient except for the moral dilemma the chiefs head shot forward cigar sparks flew like miniature fireworks whose dilemma might that be doctor charlies his next words came out tight as if extruded from a clogged machine you dont know charlie i know kids and from what you said last time charlie sounds like a thoughtful kid the murder of a teacher would get any student curious a serious young man with a moral compass and a direct link to law enforcement might take that curiosity to another level it wouldnt surprise me if this is the first time hes expressed any interest in your work the cigar tip dipped suddenly i said if elise freemans murder languishes in bureaucratic purgatory charlie will want to know why youll give him an explanation and he might even pretend to accept it alternatively hell be assertive and push you and youll embroider either way hes smart nothing short of the truth is going to satisfy his curiosity the kind of curiosity that could linger well past graduation from yale yale he said boolah boolah fight songs endure i said surrender songs dont the orange dot bobbled shaky hand he tried to steady it failed dropping the cigar he stomped hard embers scattered glinted vanished he sat there bracing his hands on his knees shot upright like a switchblade flicking open turning his back on us he trudged across the cement court grew small entered his house and closed the door silently lights off i said sorry big guy for what messing you up with the boss screw that he said quitting and getting roped back in gave me a whole new perspective staring at the house never seen him retreat like that he could be too mad to speak who cares you got to him alex trust me hes in there right now brooding about junior and being a rank opportunist im grabbing the white card what white card carte blanche mon frere until he specifies otherwise im gonna do whatever the hell i please on freeman and fidella he already specified the plan i said halfassed search for mendoza freeman goes cold that was before you tweaked his psyche and he didnt fight back silence is acquiescence amigo the lion wimps out the wildebeests proceed to the drinking hole chapter carte blanche at two am meant putting a bolo out on sal fidellas corvette as we sped east on the milo said i get nonafis prints that arent fidellas all the more reason to hunt for marty mendoza seriously as in talking to every damn student and teacher at prep who knew him maybe flying out personally to san antonio where i will enjoy tamales and carne asada and drive by his sisters apartment at frequent intervals myself i am detective hear me roar beasts of burden make noise too nine hours later he called me top of the morning lightness in his voice you found the car nope but i made a new friend i met him at noon at the culver city jail on duquesne where a guard named shirronne bostic led us to a locked holding room tapping a foot she shuffled through a key ring milo said when did he come in last night around ten picked up in a hooker sting pretended no hablo ingles then changed his tune when he got hauled in instead of just a ticket like the last time your card was in his pocket along with some bullshit id you were his one call flattered he for real lieutenant depends on what he has to say guess he is real said bostic youre here inside the holding cell a middleaged balding man with a droopy mustache sat on a metal bench dusky skin jaundiced by cruel light white stubble dotted his face his eyes were defeated jumpy eyes and unstable hands same as when hed been part of the daylaborer crowd waiting for pickup work near the ice joint the one whod claimed a fake address in beverly hills officer bostic said he claims to be hector ruiz but he also claims to live near movie stars thats my name said the man milo said ill take it from here thanks and bostic left mr ruiz howre things in bh hector ruiz said the guy in anteater shirt in barely accented english what about him i know him ruiz rotated his wrists tugged the side of his mouth into a grotesque demismile milo said im waiting i need to get

same thing two weeks ago hector that was a ticket said ruiz this time they take me in thats called being a repeat offender please i got no bail money they gonna keep me here she coming two days tough lady ruiz pressed a palm against a temple oh man im lapd hector most i can do is talk to culver city vice why just talk do said ruiz you say you gran patron in la they lie to me she was a cop ruiz outlined female curves they give her the hot pants and the boots she say i blow you for thirty the bootsll do it every time said milo she say she blow me before i say nothing clear case of entrapment hector i need out tomorrow mrs ruiz isnt arriving for two days i need clean the house hiding the evidence huh i need out whats anteaters name and where can i find him get me out i tell you said ruiz milo leaned in close it doesnt work that way hector and just giving me information wont be enough until i make sure its worth more than your id card ruiz looked away what you want with him not your business hector but if you want the wife to be happy i need him in custody no answer comprende hector i know english and a good english it is milo shot a cuff checked his timex hector ruiz said you promise to help me once ive got mr shirt in custody okay okay okay he live in my apartment youre roommates no no same building he number five the bottom i number seven the top milo suppressed a smile beverly hills no no here said ruiz culver city venice boulevard near the freeway out came the pad address ruiz tugged his mouth complied now i need a name hector gilberto said ruiz gilberto chavez he say he a painter in juarez he never paint just drywall and no good at drywall one of those darn painter wannabes said milo dont say i the one tell you what else do you know about mr chavez he smoke a lot miming a twofingered cigarette grasp ruiz brought his hand to his mouth scrunched his eyes hollowed his cheeks gave a goofy look marihuana que fumar said milo all the time said ruiz thats what they pay him with who kids what kids they pay him with weed to buy dry ice he say lucky day tell me about these kids hector thats all he say kids how many ruiz shook his head thats all he say milo waited ruiz said you got to get me out before lupe come if youve done your best hector ill do mine tell me about the kids thats what he say crossing himself kids thats all milo headed for the door hector ruiz said please a call to a vice d named gerald santostefano revealed that ruiz was scheduled for release in three hours due to overcrowding at the jail whyd you take him in to begin with hes a chronic lieutenant likes the ladies huh likes em in boots real pest said santostefano you know what its like we cant get em unless we nab em in the act we put one of our cuter rookies in a pair of kneehigh white plastics with stacked heels he was toast theres an idea for project runway santostefano cracked up milo said any way you can keep him in for a while whats a while until i call you and let you know his infos good well said santostefano i got no personal problem with that but its a jail issue whos on shift there officer bostic shirronnes okay i can maybe get her to lose paper for another few hours beyond that i cant promise milo thanked him hey said santostefano who knows maybe one day ill need you not for fashion advice the building besmirched a corner lot on the south side of venice just west of sepulveda two gloomy stories of cracked gray stucco were ruststriped like a tabby cat waisthigh chain link boxed in a yard coated with powdery brown dust cans and bottles and trash bags had been kicked into a corner errant flecks of garbage dotted the dirt near the doorway during the quarter hour we watched the premises two hispanic males left and three others entered the third swaggering arm in arm with a chubby heavily madeup woman wearing a floral microdress gilberto chavez aspiring housepainter didnt show up in dmv autotrack or any other database making the surveillance guesswork milo watched another man enter could be any one of them a few more minutes passed then might as well unit five was at the rear of the ground floor a bumper sticker issued by a spanish am station was glued diagonally across the door milo put one hand near his glock and knocked three times the door opened and the sweet vegetative aroma of marijuana blew out the man who blinked at us in surprise was smallfive four tops with thick black hair that shrouded his forehead and grazed the top of bushy eyebrows the eyes below were brown meatballs floating in hotpink soup his mouth hung open showcasing half the teeth hed grown by six he was dressed for stoner comfort in loose grubby pale blue sweatpant shorts and a tshirt the tee was white three sizes too big emblazoned with the uc irvine logo in gold lettering and an anteater of matching hue the animal was caricatured in profile extravagantly snouted hipsterslouching in a way that evoked robert crumb milo said gilberto chavez the man blinked ah no on the contrary ah yes chavez tried to close the door milo had him spun around cuffed patted and trundling toward the curb before chavez got out another denial one of the sweatpant pockets gave up mexican id a tin of organic rolling papers and a baggie of cleanlooking marijuana no gilberto he insisted that juarez drivers license sure looks like you no gilberto gimme a break said milo okay milo stared down at his diminutive quarry okay what i gilberto so glad weve reached a consensus no my weed we waited until traffic thinned to cross venice put chavez in the car the dope reek embedded in his clothes saturated the interior and milo cranked open a window tell me about dry ice gilberto huh kids paying you to buy dry ice huh last week in the valley some kids gave you marijuana after you bought them dry ice blank stare from chavez hielo seco said milo muy frio some kids asked you to oh said chavez grinning broadly somethings funny gilberto chavez turned serious this no about weed its about dry ice what the problem no problem just tell me about the kids girls the kids were girls oh yeh nice said chavez very nice how many two how old i dunno guess huh how old eighteen whyd they want dry ice i dunno how much weed they give you silence milo dug up a business card and flashed it in front of chavezs bloodshot orbs see what it says here homicide i dont care about dope chavezs blank look said he wasnt processing illiteracy or too much thc homicide gilberto know what that is someone get kill yes gilberto so so the ice you bought was involved in someone being killed chavezs mouth dropped open anxiety burned through some of his high and his eyes sharpened oh no no no no no no yes yes yes tell me about the two girls i dint do nothin then you have nothing to worry about i dint do nothin okay now tell me about the girls i dint do nothin we drove chavez to west la station where a claustrophobic solo cell was available because no psychotics were in residence in the holding jail milos repeated attempts to open chavez up failed he seemed to drop in and out of lucidity we left him curled on the floor snoring and climbed to milos office on the second floor he shuffled through messages tossed everything theres enough product in that bag to keep him here on a possession with intent maybe jail foodll convince him to look at pictures of those girls you think theyre in a mug book i think theyre in another book lets get outta here this time we drove straight up to the windsor prep guardhouse herb walkowicz emerged khakis pressed an oldfashioned visor cap jaunty on his head hey guys gonna get me in trouble again well do our best said milo dr rollins in since eight am eye roll unless she climbed over a back fence or something without snagging her designer pantsuit she in trouble i just need to talk to her walkowicz looked disappointed id like to see that one in an interview room without her damn blackberry not a pleasant gal herb you could say that wink wink you could also say shes a tightassed snobby bitch but you never heard that from me what about her boss dr helfgott hes okay not around much day to day rollins runs the place know any of the teachers know em by sight thats all said walkowicz everyone goes in and out im in my cage watching the invisible man take my advice dont retire just die on the job im working on that herb walkowicz laughed so you want to go in i got a key to that big front gate only problem is i have to let the office know before i let anyone through and when rollins finds out its you shes for sure gonna make a stink last time she told me not to let you get within twenty feet call her and tell her were being obnoxious then put me on the line yeah said the guard that would be better ten minutes later mary jane rollins emerged swinging a royalblue book bag marked with the schools crest she wore a charcoal pinstriped pantsuit red flats a withering frown here thrusting the bag im sure you couldve gotten one on ebay nothing like straight from the source said milo how much is it gonna cost me oh please what i dont see is why you need it to identify martin you already know what he looks like its called careful documentation doctor of what everything associated with a case so martin is we still havent seen him not for days matteroffact not the least bit upset i said whats he like dr rollins in what sense what kind of kid is he personalitywise i have no idea while he was here you didnt have much contact with him nothing out of the ordinary no special attention i said despite his circumstances we were acutely aware of his circumstances thats why we paid to hire a tutor for him obviously that didnt work out irritation not a trace of horror so he got no other help besides tutoring such as counseling maybe from someone on the faculty who knew him well sir she said we have two hundred and ninetythree students preselected for intelligence character and the ability to reason independently that means minimal need for babysitting other than academic tutoring that is a matter among students their families and their tutors our paying was an additional courtesy we extended martin obviously it didnt work out as wed hoped now in the future if you people believe theres something you absolutely must have immediately use the phone crooked smile during these days of fiscal austerity id think city agencies would prefer to save on gasoline milo said we like the personal touch good day gentlemen thanks for your cooperation doctor im not cooperating said rollins im acquiescing when she was back behind the gates herb walkowicz whistled softly through his teeth welcome to my world working with stan creighton was better herb let me tell you something about stan he used to be a good guy before he got involved involved with what suits and weenies and other assorted bullshit artists said walkowicz his mouth tightened kinda people send their kids to a place like this as we headed to the car milo reached into the blue bag and drew out last years windsor prep yearbook threehundredplus giltedged pages bound in royalblue calfskin each students headshot in full highdef color i said nice production values only the best for showpooches he inspected a few photos some of them even look happy gilberto chavez remained curled on the floor of his cell he been that way all this time milo asked the uniform on duty for the most part he peed once we made him clean it up hey dr delaware how come the deceptive ones always sleep like babies i said minimal or no conscience milo said pop the lock on rip van winkle the uniform opened the cell made sure the door clanged loud chavez stirred but but didnt awaken when milo called out his name he opened his eyes briefly before clamping them shut milo toed his shoulder sit up now chavez groaned struggled to his elbows finally complied with theatrical sluggishness milo took him by the shoulder propped him up slid him to the edge of the bench flipping the yearbook to the freshman page he placed it on chavezs lap start looking uhuh uhuh what i dint do nothin i know you didnt but those two girls you got weed from were involved in something bad so unless you want to take all the heat and go up for murder youll show me who they are i dint show me who they are gilberto and were finished dont cooperate and youre never getting out of here i dint shut the fuck up said milo softly now start looking seventy minutes later chavez had been through every photo three times same baleful head shake after each pass he tried to return the book to milo again gilberto i don lie chavez whined no in here you ever wear glasses gilberto no way try again and take your time fourth pass same result chavez looked ready to cry i wanna go home but they no in here lets talk about them gilberto what makes you think they were eighteen i dunnothey wasnt fifteen how do you know in a car what car black

youre doing good gilberto what else i bring the ice to the honda they gimme the bag same bag i found in your pocket yeh who else was in the honda nobody youre sure i put the ice in the backseat nobody else whered they wait while you bought the ice a block i had to carry that didnt make you curious whuh them paying you to buy something they could buy themselves waiting a block away no said chavez no what two weeks i got no work i don wonder about nothin we left the station and walked up butler avenue milo said girls and not prep students lord hand me the prozac i said teenage girls like to please teenage boys getting ice for a young stud one of them being latin could mean she knows martin from his former life in el monte smiling god forbid i should racially profile he called the lab about fidella listened turned serious hung up one palm print showed up on a gutter that runs down a corner of the garage the sneaker impressions are probably nikes a common model but too shallow to have evidentiary value all the bloods sals and wherever there was no blood the house was cleandefinitely a wipedown same as with elise that and the computer theft tells me were dealing with the same guy in terms of the palm print the garage is near where the body got dumped so maybe a glove slipped while it got dragged past nothing shows up on afis but palms havent been cataloged long enough to make that meaningful i get a suspect its sufficient for a match he phoned martin mendozas house got the boys mother listened for a long time with what sounded like sympathy but when he hung up he said she said all the right things but her tone wasnt right alex too composed like she was reading a script this after her husband said shed been throwing up nonstop i said not enough anxiety because she knows hes safe safe he said is a relative concept hitching his trousers he growled time to hunt chapter san antonio pd agreed to two daily drivebys of gisella mendozas apartment for the next three days the shift supervisor said you got a serious fugitive call the marshals milo phoned gisella again reached her at work at bexar hospital too damn polite and she worked hard at telling me nothing time to get some pix of the south el monte student body maybe gilberto can pick out our enterprising twosome no yearbooks available on a site that trafficked in academic nostalgia but the high schools website linked to its store where eagle pride dvds sold for ten dollars milo tried to placed a rush order was told by an administrative assistant named jane virgilio that he had to purchase online and shipping would take at least ten working days even for the police why would the police want our dvd its related to a former student maam martin mendoza martin why in the world you know him he was one of our stars everyone said hed go to the major leagues then that prep school stole him away hes in trouble hes gone missing so knowing who his friends are might help locate him any idea who he hung out with missing said virgilio for how long several days said milo his parents must be frantic they are ms virgilio who were his closest friends i cant really pinpoint any no one actually martin was kind of a loner team player but not a team player ioh i see what you mean guess thats true martin practiced pitching all the time maybe he didnt have time to socialize any girlfriend i have no idea the family didnt say theyre not aware of any special girl in his life maam then i guess there isnt one i knew martin more by reputation than personally athletic star all he had to do was throw that ball straight and fast and the game was ours when you say missing do you mean he might be hurt sure hope not maam said milo tell you what ill come by and pick up that dvd right now um okay i think we have some in stockif youre moving this fast it sure doesnt sound good those poor parents mrs mendoza volunteered for every bake sale and cinco de mayo celebration and mr mendoza didnt mind serving food to hundreds of people i should call them not a good time maam theyre sequestered oh anything else you can tell me about martin hmm she said terrific kid thats all we were just out the door when the phone rang sierra madre pd sal fidellas corvette had been found early this morning abandoned and partially burned in a ravine along the northern edge of that pretty city milo checked a map ten miles north of el monte forget texas the kids sticking close to home the high school was on the way so we stopped there first clean and well maintained but your basic institutional architecture and no evidence of a golf course jane virgilio wasnt in but her assistant handed us the disc another check of the thomas guide the mendoza residence was five blocks away and we headed there i thought of martin getting up early for the commute to brentwood rewarded for the trek with frustration emilio and anna mendozas residence was small white nondescript drapes blocked every spotless window no answer to milos ring a vestpocket backyard shaded by an umbrellalike agonis tree was overstuffed with bromeliads ferns palms coleus a bulkrate sack of plant food was propped against a trellis wall and the grass had been watered to emerald a knock on the rear door evoked the same silence milo put his ear to the panel cant hear anything but they could be holed up he phoned the house got no answer i said maybe theyve all packed up to texas after the car was dumped family that flees together yeah why not that theory was shattered when a call to mountain crest country club revealed that emilio mendoza was on shift may i speak with him please ill see moments later sorry hes tied up click a quick ride through pasadena took us into the northeast corner of sierra madre houses were long gone and brown hills rolled lazily no police presence announced itself in advance of the dump spot we drove right to the rim of a shallow depression far short of being a ravine a female uniform stood next to a blackandwhite talking on a cell phone forty dark hair drawn into a ponytail smile on her face as she chatted she waved languidly no tape cordon no evidence markers nothing to say this was a crime scene nothing to guard the corvette was gone the site was a fortyfoot beige soup bowl sides eroded and bearded by serpentine roots and the stumps of longdead trees at the bottom nothing but flat dry space scorch marks scarred the first few feet of drop along the southern wall the corvette hadnt rolled to the bottom a large clump of petrified root boll beneath the burned area seemed a likely culprit white flecks said someone had tried to cast prints the cop pocketed her phone two stripes on her sleeve e pappas la all yours i was just on my way out milo handed her a card no debate on my place or yours my chief isnt much for jurisdictional quibbles lieutenant car got towed to your auto lab good riddance huh you bet she said without a trace of regret were a force of twentyone people im the only corporal and in six years i can remember exactly one homicide and that was an openshut domestic arsons another story we get the usual pyros during dry season our fd has its hands full thank god this one didnt spread it wont even appear on our stats did you see the initial scene first to arrive who called it in elementary school chaperonea parent with some little kids on a field trip im no arson detective but it looked like an amateur job gasoline got poured on the passenger seat but the windows were left closed so the fire got starved out quickly your offender wasnt any wizard at hiding evidence either tried to roll the darn thing down to the bottom but it got caught on that chunk of root even if it had made it to the bottom it still wouldve been in plain view you want to conceal something ill show you gullies ten minutes from here so overgrown you could hide stuff forever anything on the casts nope sorry after the car had been moved we saw what looked like shoe prints but they turned out to be twig marks maybe youll pull up some latents from the vehicle only thing left behind was a hat and i made sure it got bagged and tagged for you thanks what kind of hat it was partially burned but id say a baseballtype the little color left was blue where was it left we found it on the passenger seat where the accelerant was squirted that tells you how dinky the fire was couldnt even finish off a cloth cap this spot isnt particularly hard to get to said milo people come here a lot would you said pappas weve got gorgeous areas all over the place my opinion this is one of the uglier ones only reason that field trip was here was the teacher wanted to scare the kiddies about erosion as corporal pappas drove off we inspected the scene achieved no insights a call to the auto lab supervisor verified the arrival of the corvette the trunk and glove compartment had been emptied but the vin number traced to a vehicle registered to salvatore fidella moderate fire damage to the interior left plenty of vinyl and metal to process for prints fluids and fibers same for the remnants of a partially burned blue cap already processed and found devoid of prints or dna a handful of scorched fibers with metallic content suggested brass or gold thread maybe an insignia milo reached detective i sean binchy at the station directed binchy to run an image search on south el monte baseball team when do you need it loot now sure here we go theyre called the eagles heres a group picture game they won from temple city theyre all smiling what color are their caps sean navy blue any insignia looks like a snakeno its an s probably for south gold right on loot anything else you need pray for world peace sean i already do that every morning sir we drove back to la stopping at a place on colorado for takeout coffee that we drank while in motion just west was pasadena and that got me thinking but i didnt have enough for sparkling conversation milo said the kid pays girls to buy ice so he can ice freeman in a dramatic way then mops up fidella for good measure only question is why with elises proclivities and fidella being a lowlife maybe sex and education got jumbled up together in a particularly nasty way i said martin was careful enough to set elises murder up with surgical precision and to wipe fidellas house clean amid a horrendous scene but left his hat in the carand the car out in the open teenagers alex youre the one always saying theyre unpredictable or maybe hes reached that point big drop in adrenaline tired of running and ready to get caught we can discuss this till forever but right now hes a good lead the car gives up the same prints as fidellas garage im going public i said prep school makes noble attempt at diversity but best intentions fail the manorborn sail into their dream schools martin mendoza ends up in jail the chiefand darwinwill be pleased yeah it stinks but that doesnt make it untrue he finished his coffee chewed on a cold cigar drove faster a few freeway exits later he said life aint a surprise party we both know that no message from darwin on his desk but the chief had left an unfamiliar number one ring then a familiar voice on conference talk sturgis milo filled him in fool leaves his hat in the car hes that strong for the italian well get him for freeman its looking that way sir find those girls ive got a dvd of the south el monte student body about to show it to chavez shouldve done that before calling me sorry sir you get verification on those little bitches were pressing fullcourt loading the eagle pride dvd into his computer he brought up pages of fresh faces printed every one and xd out the boys with a sharpie make gilbertos job easier back at the holding cell chavez was wide awake jumpy complaining about the food the guard said no more dope in his system hes getting grumpy he unlocked the door milo said more pictures gilberto you kidding chavez reached behind scratched his back clawed hard i think you got bugs in here no were clean gilberto start looking chavez flipped pages too quickly take your time i see i know upon turning the final page oh shit you found them no thats the shit said chavez they no here now you gonna keep me go through them again gilberto they no here chavez shouted small rough workingmans hands curled i want out easy gilberto you lock me up i do what you say and you still lock me up that weed locked you up that no mine milo flashed him a pitying look weed said chavez is jus a ticket not that much weed gilberto tears filmed chavezs eyes milo said do your best for me and ill help you fine fine fine you want me look say yes i say yes jabbing the first page this one this one and this one i give you three okay you want four five okay this one and settle down gilberto madre de diosthey no here go through it one more time said milo but his heart wasnt in it chapter milo slouched back to his office tried the lab again for prints in the corvette the car had been wiped clean he knuckled both eyes yeah yeah hes that careful but leaves the damn hat out in plain view maybe it fell off his damn head when he lit the damn fire and he got scared and ran figured the damn blaze would get rid of damn everything i said nothing dont use that attitude with me sonny he called san antonio pd about the first driveby of gisella mendozas place been and gone no sign of unusual activity when in doubt gluttony at cafe moghul the bespectacled woman heaped his plate with every item on the buffet added lobster just out of the tandoori at least somebody loves me he muttered tucking a napkin under his chins the woman beamed as he finished his third bowl of rice pudding sean binchy entered the restaurant wouldnt bug you but some guy called twice in the last half hour loot says its about martin mendoza i tried your cell but it was off milo fumbled in his pocket flipped the phone open switched off by accident glancing at me unless freud was right and there are no accidents i said freud was wrong about lots of things but this one ill leave up to you huh he turned to binchy whatd this guy have to say about mendoza no details just that he wants to talk to you how did he know to ask for me beats me loot binchy pulled out his pad names edwin kenten heres the number kenten phoned personally yup why wouldnt he what ive been told hes a guy gets people to do things for him edwin kenten put the lie to that by answering his own phone his voice was nasal thin softened by a musical accentwetlands florida southern georgia lieutenant sturgis thanks for calling back promptly no problem mr kenten who referred you to me marty mendoza s family gave me your name and its marty id like to talk to you about i know youre extremely busy sir but if theres some way we could meet id be grateful we could have tea in my office im in westwood wilshire near broxton whats a good time mr kenten at your convenience lieutenant i can be there in twenty ill leave your name with my parking man a gracious fourteenstory office building clad in limestone and brick and crowned by handcarved moldings took up the southwest corner of wilshire and glendon butting up against all that architecture was edwin kentens fifteenstory headquarters an assertively ugly offwhite rectangle striped with garish blue glass the gift said milo and the box it came in knt enterprises took up the top floor of the shipping carton accessible by a keyoperated elevator marked private the parking lot attendant was built like a bouncer with a wide smile as deep as a decal phoning for authorization he produced the key turned twice mr ks ready for you have a nice day we stepped into a windowless offwhite waiting room carpeted in shag the color of a puppys accident an unmarked door at the rear was painted matte gray the amenities consisted of four folding chairs haphazardly positioned a coffee table hosting a jar of crumbling biscotti a few plastic bottles of generic water and two leaningtower heaps of old magazines the man waiting for us was sixtyfive to seventy pudgy and bald on top with gray curls tufting above leprechaun ears a powderblue silk shantung shirt billowed over pink linen pants and white patent loafers the shirt matched the mans curious eyes the trousers colorcoordinated with a diamond pinkie ring the face of his wristwatch was larger than some cell phones he inspected both of us guessed correctly lieutenant eddie kenten good to meet you sir this is alex delaware pleasure you boys come in kentens sunburned face was a nearperfect sphere same for his torso and abdominal region as if a trio of apples had been stacked carelessly when he turned toward the door each segment rolled with eerie independence he appeared on the brink of falling apart and i felt myself tensing up to prevent disaster we followed him past a maze of plainwrap cubicles twenty or so people worked quietly at phones and computers kenten waved to a few smiled at everyone continuing toward the requisite corner office he exuded gingery aftershave that hit us in gusts his personal space was predictably vast with blueglass walls but northern and western vistas were blocked by taller structures to the east the tops of wilshire corridor condos were barely visible only the southern view was free and clear miles of houses and lowprofile shopping sinking into the flight paths over inglewood everything clouded by a milkchocolate puff of smog a cheaplooking desk was heaped with papers where it wasnt crowded with framed snapshots some of the pictures were positioned for visitor viewing a younger thinner crewcut kenten in formal army dress marrying a bony woman nearly a head taller a slew of kids and grandkids in various stages of development a circular folding banquet table and plastic chairs served as the conference area a plugin kettle tea bags strewn loosely and more crumbling biscotti were the refreshments du jour kenten said can i pour for you fellows no thanks sir you dont mind if i indulge do you ripping open a packet of earl grey kenten poured steeped pawed a biscotti chewed noisily unmindful of crumbs on his shirtfront blowing into the teacup he pursed his lips nice and hot thank you for coming what can we do for you mr kenten everyone calls me eddie ill come right to the point the mendozas are worried youre looking into marty as having something to do with the death of ms elise freeman im here to tell you marty had nothing to do with it you know that because because i know marty lieutenant im the one who brought him to prep kenten put down his tea i thought id done him a favor you feel differently now with the police chasing after him challenging words but twinkly eyes and grandfatherly cheer were not chasing him mr kenten wed like to talk to him why we cant get into that right now kind of a catch said kenten no sir just the early stages of an investigation a murder investigation head shake never thought id be talking to the police about murder especially in regard to marty trust me lieutenant he had absolutely nothing to do with ms freemans death hes told you that kenten put down his teacup no im being logical how well did you know ms freeman i knew of her said kenten by reputation what reputation was that sir sexually inappropriate marty told you that kenten lifted the cup she tutored many students not just marty you heard it from another kid at prep at this point said kenten id prefer not to get into those details suffice it to say they dont impact your investigation i should be the judge of that mr kenten lieutenant i didnt need to call you in the first place so please dont punish civic responsibility lets just say that ms freeman had acquired what you people would call a jacketthat is the correct term milo said a jacket is a criminal history backed up by an official record well then lets say ms freeman had acquired a sweater something jacketlikea cardigan kenten chuckled encountered two stoic faces please forgive me im not making light of her death terrible terrible thing no one should die unnaturally im just saying she trod on shaky grounds with some male students so perhaps you should broaden your focus sure said milo give me some names someone i knownot martytalked to me in strict confidentiality someone with only thirdhand knowledge so thered be no point school gossip said milo im sorry thats all i can say she was a cougar so she had to die pardon you said no one should have to die unnaturally that sounds as if shed been sentenced kenten massaged a freckled dome i thought i left that kind of parsing behind when i dropped out of law school it was a figure of speech lieutenant look i sympathize with ms freeman and her family im sure theyre devastated and im certain youll eventually get to the bottom of it but im here to tell you that the sooner you get away from chasing marty the sooner youll succeed hes a fine boy id be proud to call him one of my own and ive got six of my own as well as nine grandchildren with two more on the way so id like to think im a pretty good judge of juvenile character and martys character is sterling the same applies to his family youll never meet more upstanding industrious people i found out about marty through emilio he works at my club and weve become friends mistaking subservience for friendship the way rich delusional people do milo said youve called us here for the sole purpose of offering character testimony forgive me if ive wasted your time said kenten however this isnt some situation where a friend of a friend asks me to write their offspring a letter to get them into prep or yale im familiar with this boys character in depth you went to yale class of fiftytwo graduated at the bottom of my class started law school quit and went to korea youre exmilitary correct combat or ancillary i was a medic thats combat said kenten i was ancillary monitoring inventory at one of the larger armories in seoul taught me all about people no need to get an mba after that glad it was a good experience for you sir vietnam said kenten was a whole different ball of paraffin my eldest eddie junior serviced helicopters still wont talk about it in any event back to marty wonderful boy bright industrious but for that blasted accident hed be destined for stardom even with the injury im holding out hope the key is for him to take care of the shoulder avoid undue stress im afraid your chasing him doesnt help wheres marty now mr kenten why are you after him id like an answer to my question sir what makes you think i know his whereabouts youre his mentor and id be happy to mentor him now unfortunately my efforts to reach him have failed the poor boys so frightened who knows where hes gone kenten drank tea im surprised lieutenant at what you didnt come back with the standard warning about aiding and abetting are you aiding and abetting sir kenten laughed hardly im available to emilio and anna for support is all for marty as well should he ask if he does contact you mr kenten youll need to let me know and youll go straight to your boss pardon said milo no need to be coy lieutenant we both know your bosss boy attends prep and that raises the stakes needless to say marty or someone like him would be a much better suspect than a student from the right zip code if youve got other students i should be looking at mr kenten give me their names if i did id have already given them to you two things i do know martys not involved and the chiefs situation raises the risk of tunnel vision the chief and everyone else in the department is interested in arresting the right offender for both cases both yesterday ms freemans boyfriend was beaten to death his car stolen from his driveway a young man was seen driving it away i just returned from a dump site where the victims car was found partially burned all the contents had been removed except for a baseball cap that may have fallen off during the arson dark blue cap with what looks to be a gold s kentens cup held steady so did his eyes thats your evidence a baseball cap a south el monte eagles baseball cap marty hasnt pitched for them for over a year its not exactly a commonplace garment kenten looked away im sure theres an explanationanyone can buy a baseball cap im sure your intentions were noble sir but from what ive heard public school was a happier place for marty than prep that would be good reason for him to hold on to a memento silence sir have you ever seen a cap like that in martys house ive never been to martys house has he been to yours ive had the entire family over for cookouts and suchweve got a fire pit a game court access to the beach my grandchildren call it the fun house marty hung out with my grandchildren does that tell you about my level of trust theres no violence in the boy lieutenant he ever show up wearing a hat like that blue with never kenten snapped never saw anything like that we havent latched on to him randomly mr kenten elise freeman was frightened of him thats ridiculous spoken like a mentor kentens blue eyes hardened given your unique perspective about me i can understand your skepticism but mark my words lieutenant you wont solve your caseyour casesuntil you take off the blinders and stop pursuing marty marty could help himself by showing up and submitting to an interview kenten rose and rolled toward the door ive done my best to educate you if ive frittered away your time im truly regretful milo said what did you mean by my unique perspective oh come now lieutenant im serious kenten eyed him ill take you at your word what i meant was you need to be thinking about your bosss role in this investigation because of my involvement how so mr kenten i was asked to serve on the ad hoc public safety committee searching for a new police chief i interviewed your boss and found him an interesting capable man but i had reservations about his judgment and his temperament one example of his weaknesses in those areas was his pressing me to commit to hiring him early in the interview needless to say i resisted but apparently not with sufficient clarity because he left that meeting convinced i supported him unconditionally nothing couldve been further from the truth though part of the blame may rest with me im not one to confront so he probably mistook lack of debate for assent when it came time to vote on himan allegedly confidential processi was a dissenting voice since that time hes convinced i sandbagged him kenten plinked one elfin ear lieutenant dont tell me the moment he made the link between marty and myself he didnt inform you of his version lieutenants and police chiefs dont meet regularly for tea sir that may be so sir but this particular chief meets with this particular lieutenant kenten took hold of the doorknob twisted released let his arms drop as if suddenly exhausted lieutenant sturgis im going to leave you with something to chew on your name came up during that first interview milo blinked but remained impassive did it oh yes said kenten he cited you as an example of what a tolerant fellow he was im paraphrasing but his little speech went something like this you know ed theres a detective in the department named sturgis queerer than a second left shoe but does the job someone else would be put off by that lifestyle but i keep my personal feelings of revulsion to myself as long as he continues to do the job send me a threeeyed albino dwarf chimpanzee who can clear felonies ed and ill make sure it gets regular promotions milo said that hasnt happened yet but we do have some knuckledragging primates in the department lieutenant queerer than a second left shoe is a verbatim quote at the time i wondered why he brought up the matter of homosexuality just to make a point years later when i found out what he was saying about me i figured it out not only does he think im insincere hes convinced im gay for the record im not though if i was id be comfortable with it any idea why he thinks that of me why sir ive donated substantial money to aids research five million just at the u want to guess why i did that lieutenant you thought it was a good cause sir there are lots of good causes lieutenant i prioritized aids because major andrew jack kenten one of the finest fighter pilots the united states air force has ever produced but more important a kid brother i raised after our parents died was one of the first americans to die of the plague your boss never took the time to learn that because his perspective makes it impossible for him to understand why anyone would operate outside a narrow range of selfish interest kenten twisted the doorknob again smiled to be fair i have been known to wear pastels from time to time i see that sir your boss can be an effective leader and he deserves some of the credit for the current drop in crime though we both know its men and women such as yourself who do the actual work whatever his administrative virtues hes wearing blinders on this case because for some reason his son wants to attend yale for some reason i enjoyed my time there but its not where we get our education lieutenant its what we do with it we both know the chiefs primary goal is keeping the school out of the limelight until the letters come in marty mendoza being a suspect could focus attention on the school not if hes no longer enrolled and is held up as an example of affirmative action gone wrong kentens face flushed with anger to the people who run places like prep boys like marty are serfshired help wrench a shoulder goodbye they hired elise freeman to tutor him a formality and she knew it thats why she shirked marty told you she shirked when i called to ask him how it was going he said it wasnt going anywhere because she began sessions late ended them early and took phone calls throughout the hour it was clear to marty that she had no interest in him did she act out sexually marty denied that but he did say some of those calls were from male students and she was flirtatious marty denied after you asked him i asked him after he told me about the flirtatious calls said kenten i was wondering if he was veiling the truth to cover his own embarrassment ive got a friend with a problem exactly flirtatious how we didnt get into details lieutenant i phoned mary jane rollins she said shed look into it but i never got a followup and soon after marty quit the sessions but never once did he express anger toward her lieutenant on the contrary he laughed it off to be frank i think he was relieved to be free of academic pressure hes a bright boy needs to have confidence beyond his ability to throw a baseball if you allow another persons narrow selfinterests to influence you youll be hindered not helped kenten flung the door open on office soundtrack good luck to you the parking halfback handed the keys over no more smile as we drove away milo said talk about heavyhanded paying your bills with tax money can do that to you i said that reference to yale the clear implication was mess with me i take it out on little charlie guys way past overinvolved alex think there could be more than mentoring going on another nosedive into yuck territory he does wear pastels smiling faintly if kentens involved in something that sleazy and highrisk why would he initiate a meeting and attract attention because he cant imagine not getting his way for all we know marty mendozas living a pampered life at kentens estate as we speak his graciousness tagged it as paradise cove but i looked it up and its actually north of there above broad beach were talking fiveplus acres of oceanfront one entry on pch real easy to stash someone for a long time he got hold of binchy again ordered roundtheclock surveillance of the propertys front gate sean alternating with detective i moses reed and any halfway intelligent undercover officer they could find i said what about the mendoza house thats mine rank has its privilege el monte outclasses malibu im hoping the kidll sneak back for some mama love i get him away from the good life hell cave spoken like a true hunter chapter we met the next morning in an empty interview room milo and moe reed had been up all night despite clean living the young detective looked beat milo s bearontheprowl instincts kept him brighteyed first my showandtell moses because its brief martins mommy showed up just after eight pm lugging a single bag of groceries i said not cooking for a family for all i know it was a bag full of chocolate chip cookies for marty at ten twenty mr m arrives still in his waiters uniform carrying what looks like doggie bags from the country club no further action until seven am when he leaves in a fresh uniform i wager on him going to work and stick around to watch missus seven fortytwo she drives to a day care center where a bunch of little kids greet her like the bestest grandma in the whole wide world i phone the club misters on the job hardworking folks going about their business said reed you could subpoena their phone records i could if john nguyen changed his mind about my having no grounds how was your day at the beach lad im not seeing any tan im one of those pink ones loo only place i could park was the land side of pch ten yards up what you see from there is a wall of hedges and big gates i picked up from sean after he trailed kenten from the office to mountain crest then home by then it was close to six sean got photos of kenten entering guy wasnt exactly incognito he tools around in a powderblue bentley continental convertible hes even got powderblue caps on the wheels it was me id go black charcoal at the lightest keep it assertive huh were talking five hundred sixty horses loo anyway the top was down no passengers that model doesnt have much of a trunk muscle under the hood said milo and yet he paints it like a carousel pony what does that say about him moses reed shifted his torso his eyes darted to the left he likes to be noticed that must be it after reed left i said carousel pony you didnt really expect reed to tag kenten as gay but you saw his eyes thats what he was thinking no interesting fellow ol eddie either hes in serious denial or he really does have a thing for pastels i made a few calls last night and the socalled gay community has nothing to say about him except they appreciate the aids money socalled community like were a powderblue monolith his next call was thirty hours later as i finished some court reports at home surveillance at kentens xanadu and the mendoza household has been as useful as a congressional subcommittee same for drivebys of gisellas place but as of twenty minutes ago i am the proud recipient of my first bona fide tip on elise anonymous no callback number the clerk who wrote out the slip thinks the caller mightve been male but shes not sure for all i know she screwed up the message but here it is for the murdered teacher think may third october eighth november fifth i said nothing like a little numerology to brighten the day i already tried a bunch of historical websites and came up with zilch i copied down the dates freeman hasnt been publicized so this has to be someone familiar with the school and please dont remind me that could include a prank by a preppie i said do you find it interesting that it came in two days after you met with kenten pastel eddie trying to divert me yeah i thought about that and it would take his interest way past obsession one of my plainclothesers did get a little excited when a kid around martys age drove up to kentens gates this morning in a bmw ragtop unfortunately the tags traced to garret kenten nineteen address in trancas beach probably a grandson but that got me thinking kinda risky not to mention sick for kenten to be shacking up with marty when his young descendants have access to the property on the other hand garret was in and out fast left with the top down on the beemer and a surfboard in back picking up gear at grandpas i said well keep watching both sites maybe try to interview the mendozas in a day or so ive also got one borderlineinteresting finding from the arson techs even accounting for incompetence with the baseball cap found near the highest concentration of accelerant it shoulda been totally toasted not partially baked fire guys consider the fire wimpy if youre gonna use accelerant why not squirt rather than trickle toss in the open dump site and its thoughtprovoking the car was meant to be found maybe with the hat in it marty mendozas being set up eddie the k would sure love like that scenario but it doesnt obscure the facts elise was scared of the kid hes got psychological issues and he rabbited i need those two girls but chavez got kicked out of custody chavez lives for weed i said hes probably smoking up right now in that same apartment that makes him arrestable at your convenience such faith in the goodness of human nature from a scientist of the mind no less no comment i said you just made one madame internets a seductress but she parcels out more tease than fun instead of logging on i did it the oldfashioned way staring at the dates on the phone tip until a headache came on and my blood screamed for coffee may october november i finished a tall mug and half of another brought the slip back to robins studio explained what was going on she put down her chisel studied sorry hon blanche sighed i returned to my desk wondering if the tip really would boil down to a prank and i was wrestling with random numbers for arguments sake assume a pattern ignoring the dates i studied the text that teacher something related to elise freemans job finals at prepsomeones psychotic anger over a poor grade no as a sub she wouldnt be administering any exams at all but her side job was preparing for a different type of test two dates in the fall one in late spring i logged onto the educational testing service website october was one of several scheduled dates for this years sat but may and november werent those who forget history are condemned to repeat it i pounded the keyboard like a chimp with a toy both dates showed up on the previous years calendar a secondgrade teachers voice sounded in my head youre such a thorough boy alex chapter milo loosened his tie finished his fifth cup of coffee kept staring at the printout id brought him finally what elise failed to boost one preppies scores three separate times or a trio of preppies formed the we hate ms freeman club and banded together to ice her or she didnt fail i said she succeeded but did it in an unorthodox manner such as saving her client the hassle of actually taking the test sending in a ringer what led you there because that would be worth covering up i searched for scandals involving standins and found plenty and those are the ones who got caught the testing services are supposed to check handwriting samples and ids are inspected at the door but with a big crowd of testtakers and a ringer with a decent physical resemblance you could pull it off also sometimes the sats administered at prep but not on any of those dates at prep no way a ringer could pass well well well a test scam also fits with elises flexible moral boundaries and it could clarify the motive assuming the rape dvd was a hoax never put into action sheprobably in concert with fidellawas no stranger to the concept of extortion if the tips righteous it might also narrow your suspect profile a rich kid pressured to get into a selective college whod failed to improve significantly with tutoring that could be why her computerand fidellaswas taken her student records were in there rich kid with a gonzo bank account or his parents he said mr and mrs deep pockets pony up for tutoring then toss in a whole bunch more for someone to take the test for junior because its all about getting junior into harvard and junior cant hack it on his own the ringer aces the test junior buys himself a crimson sweater everyones over the moon then elise hits em up for a serious surcharge but if its only one kid why three dates once couldve been the general sat i said the others the sat iisachievement tests on specific subjects we cover all your needs at the academy of scam if were talking bigtime extortion that could explain abandoning the rape plot this was so much easier and elise would keep her job he got up stretched sat down with the stakes so high howd our tipster find out and why be so cryptic maybe a hardworking kid picked up on an unlikely score by another student and got resentful peer pressure would frown on snitching publicly youd be sentencing yourself to high school hell and by exposing a scandal youd be putting everyone at prep at risk of taint including yourself im not really a rat im just giving the cops a hint they dont figure it out its their fault wonder what those ethical seminars they run at prep would say about that he laughed turned serious maybe marty mendozas our tipster hed sure be pod watching some rich brat pay for a high score maybe i said though id think marty would have less trouble being explicit and something else the basics of the scam could be right but the murder motive could be different not protection from blackmail snuffing out the competition because the drive from fidellas house to sierra madre runs right through pasadena and someone lives there whod be a perfect ringer he stared at me trey franck brilliant prep alumnus looks young enough to pass for a high school student changes his hair color regularly not a hipster thing a goddamn disguise does the grunt work and takes all the risk gets tired of elise and fidella pocketing the big bucks hes the one who directed you to marty we have only his word that elise was scared of marty if that was a diversionary tactic it worked oh man he shot up again stomped into the hall returned flushed im getting that itchy feeling like ive been played the whole marty thing steered us away from francks relationship with elise all along youve been saying elises murder stank of calculation and brains francks a chemical engineer claims he hasnt worked with dry ice since he was a little kid but so what nothing adds fun to homicide better than a little nostalgia right franck as our bad guy also explains why fidella got his brains bashed in franck had to finish both of them maybe he showed up at fidellas house for a business discussionnow that elise was gone how would the scam continue he didnt bring a weapon because hed been there knew fidella had a pool cue there is the matter of that alibi but he was up north for four days couldve had enough time by himself to fly down do elise fly back he was sleeping with her may very well have a key to her house and his presence wouldnt have alarmed her shed feel comfortable drinking in front of him then in goes the oxy so who are the two girls a couple of kids whod do anything for a cute older guy for all we know theyre undergrads at caltech they couldve even thought it was a prank theyre big on that there taking apart cars and reassembling them in dorm rooms hacking into the rose bowl scoreboard he said the young guy driving away in the vette could easily be franck and who better than a chemical engineer to orchestrate a controlled arson after ordering a south el monte baseball cap that he leaves behind to set up favorite patsy marty mendoza evil he said if theres something to the tip okay lets try to connect some dots see if they lead to young master franck he phoned south el monte high talked to jane virgilio hi its lieutenant sturgis again no not yet but could you please check your student store and find out who bought an eagles baseball cap within the last two months anyone whos not a team member its too complicated to explain right now maam and im really busy looking for martin so please check yes i know its online but you must have access yes ill be happy to wait after three minutes of toetapping he gave a rocketfueled thumbsup thank you so much ms virgilio ill be sure to tell the family you helped grinning he logged onto his pc apart from players who lose theirs and the occasional alumnus eagle caps are a lowvolume item only one moved during the last sixty days and get this amigo october twentieth twelve days after this years sat franck bought it himself i should be so lucky but at least ive got a name brianna blevins address in north hollywood which aint that far from the ice place if she turns out to be a voluptuous white girl im gonna make her feel real uncomfortable yo facebook brianna blevins was nineteen years old fullfaced and prone to grinning vacantly with gleaming black hair that hung past her waist and a pneumatic body showcased by a bikini shot that proclaimed less is not more not a student at caltech shed graduated last year from north hollywood high was looking for my place in the world easy mark for someone with half trey francks iq i wondered how the two of them had met if she did value the relationship with a caltech genius she wasnt advertising the fact no shot or mention of franck but one of her frequently pictured friends was a pretty slender girl with blondtipped hair and overenthusiastic eye shadow briannas bff for sure and always we party with our souls and dance to the same beat selma arredondo milo said got to be la flaca love this social networking arredondos page bore no reference to franck either he turned to the phone directories no listings for either girl maybe they still live at home cant be too many blevinses in north hollywood lucky me only one harvey p no answer canned voicemail recording he left no message searched for arredondos in the valley found several connected to most no one knew selma dmv coughed up drivers licenses for both girls obtained three years ago when they were freshfaced brianna had racked up several moving violations in a ford truck registered to harvey blevins milo sang til her daddy takes the tbird away found selmas wheels fiveyearold black honda chavez actually told the truth he said it aint quite enough to restore my faith in human nature but maybe one tiny step forward arredondos address conformed to one of the noanswer numbers milo had tried he phoned it again the only one without voice mail thats why i dont play games of chance bucko sal scored a jackpot and look what happened to him i said lets pay franck another visit dont wanna make him nervous so the cover story will be we found new evidence that implicates marty mendoza eg the corvette is there anything else he can tell us about the kid i wouldnt mention fidellas murder thered be no reason for you to tell him makes sense same goes for bringing up brianna and selma if franck is connected to them no sense giving them a headsup any other suggestions just be your usual masterthespian self he twirled the end of a nonexistent mustache punched the air again and clapped his hands trey my boy i may be dumb but i can still nab your einsteinian ass chapter no answer at trey francks apartment the hallways of the dingy building echoed probably in the lab said milo mixing up his potions or whatever chemical engineers do we made the drive to caltech in three minutes the chemeng receptionist studied milo s card lieutenant one second she disappeared into an inner office her voice on the phone was a low buzz of anxiety moments later a thin whitebearded man in his fifties walked through the departments main door gentlemen norm moon im trey francks dissertation advisor milo held out a hand professor moon waved off the honorific as he shook youve located trey please dont tell me something unfortunate has occurred hes missing said milo moon tugged a beard hair you werent aware foolish of me to assume then i suppose youre inquiring again about that tutor he worked for elise freeman professor trey told you about that a few days ago he seemed a bit distracted in the lab and i asked him why he told me hed just had a strange experience interrogation by the police we call it interviewing moon smiled be that as it may trey felt interrogated as if you suspected him of something simply because hed known the woman contacting a victims acquaintances is pretty much routine that would make sense said moon nonetheless im sure most people dont enjoy the experience how long has trey been missing hes been absent from the lab for two days and we havent been able to reach him one of treys virtues is reliability were preparing an important paper so his participation is especially important perhaps i said the pressure got to him what pressure the paper added to his usual responsibilities hmm said moon no i dont think so trey has never been the anxious type cool under fire but the interview bothered him he seemed more disappointed than anxious that someone would think him capable of such violence he described the murder as violent moon wet his lips with his tongue i dont believe we got into detailsfrankly that kind of thing doesnt interest me i suppose he meant homicide in general isnt the malicious dispatch of another human being always violent at the core when you and trey traveled to stanford were you together most of the time that sounds as if youre confirming an alibi i smiled moon said contrary to what you might think of academics we do work hard that was a work trip our days were pretty much ninetofive milo said so trey had evenings to himself im his advisor not his babysitter i have no idea what he did at night you might try juliet harshberger she and trey appear to be a bit of an item you havent contacted her i avoid meddling in my students personal lives but i was contemplating doing just that where can we find ms harshberger most likely here lieutenant in this department here on campus shes a grad student in biology thank you professor is there anything else youd like us to know about trey moon said obviously ive enjoyed having him in my lab hes smart and an excellent longrange thinker in my field problems often take years even decades to solve some of the brightest students fade when gratification slows trey on the other hand is able to keep his eye on the core of the problem as well as the eventual goal moon stroked his beard you dont really think he was involved in murder routine questions said milo also we like talking to smart people when we were out of earshot i said nothing like a careful planner i was thinking the same thing in the biology office two students studied the bulletin board as if it were a shrine pinned to the cork were items for sale birthday greetings to a professor summer fellowship opportunities abroad and a clipping about recent advances in computer simulation of fruit fly neural transmission milo asked the receptionist where to find juliet harshberger shes not here today any idea where we can find her no sorry try her apartment said one of the students his eyes still on the board tall dark shaggyhaired with poor posture he giggled itll be a highprobability endeavor because shes there more than shes here hell maybe shell even get her own lab there never have to come in his companion bespectacled unshaven stocky raised an eyebrow the receptionist frowned brian is there something you need shaggy said no nadine just spending a rare free moment searching for a potentially interesting way to spend july financed by someone else to us my apartments five rooms less than six the walls start to close in the other student said bitch bitch bitch brian said and then you die die die the receptionist turned to us anything else milo said juliet harshbergers address please im sorry were not supposed to brian cackled and rattled off a street name and three digits maliciously helpful but unnecessary the girl on the veranda snuggling up with franck nadine said brian brian slapped his mouth oops silly me guess that slipped out because my prefrontal lobes are clogged from long nights of actually doing work youre a prince said his friend the receptionist said that was totally inappropriate brian said so is coasting through grad school in the comfort of your sixroom apartment with no serious obligations other than showing up to seminars while everyone else has to ra and ta and do minderoding scut nadine flushed brian please he stomped out muttering yeah yeah reality bites big shocker his friend looked at us shrugged followed milo said grumpy fellow nadine said he just failed his orals when we caught up with brian he was smoking a cigarette under an oak tree the stocky boy had departed he sucked in a lungful of poison once again the gendarmerie milo said thanks for the info brian lucky for you im an asshole shes a rich girl huh her old mans harshberger petroleum exploration nice texas girl not smart enough to get in on her own brian ran a tongue inside his mouth should i be fair or just spiteful fair would be better how about first telling me why the police are interested in her its in regard to her boyfriend sir coiffure pardon her squeeze the chemist changes his hairstyle every month i figure hes researching dyes dry chuckle whatd he do hes a potential witness to what brian said milo showing teeth i really need to be asking questions not answering them juliets not smart huh shes plenty smart but that isnt the point dr changmy advisorhas never accepted more than one student a year and sometimes not even that this year he took two you and juliet after she applied months past the deadline im on fellowship she doesnt need one are you conceptualizing a causal thread so now youve got to carry her its not that shes increased my workload chang would be a slave driver anyway but shes apparently exempt from everything the rest of us have to hassle with like i said reality gnaws out huge chunks of raw flesh on a regular basis but if she had a modicum of class shed try to pull at least some of her damn weight sixroom crib said milo nice never been invited but chang was much impressed the spanishstyle building was even lovelier in daylight trees perfectly barbered shrubs glowing sparkling beds of flowers a fauvist delight a couple exited arm in arm whitehaired immaculately dressed didnt stop to greet the petite girl on the veranda she wore the same brown sweatshirt as when shed put her head on trey francks shoulder the bench beneath her was stationary but she rocked back and forth staring into the distance like a whalers wife waiting for a storm to disgorge her man she saw us coming kept rocking milos card caused her to burst out in tears juliet harshbergers apartment was done up in authentic decomoderne and fragrant with scented candles signed cartierbresson prints hung on the wall along with an unsigned cubist painting a longhaired white cat so inert its occasional eyeblink seemed batterydriven perched on a divan and ignored the proceedings its mistress perched on the edge of a cream velvet chair trimmed in macassar ebony and continued to weep milos third tissue finally dried up the well ms harshberger i knew it would come to this trey was so scared now youre going to tell me something horrid and nightmarishly permanent has taken place and ill never be able to erase this terrible moment from my consciousness were not here to tell you anything bad wed just like to know where trey is juliet harshbergers enormous pale green eyes stretched the limits of their sockets she was five feet tall probably less than a hundred pounds with a pixie face dusted with buttermilk freckles under a mop of carefully layered mocha hair tiny pointy breasts fell short of filling her white cashmere sweater boyish hips were no more successful with razorcreased designer jeans petite young woman easily able to pass as a high school student i wondered if her bond with franck extended to fraud she said you really dont know where he is well neither do i and im worried sick its not like him to disappear milo said what was he scared about her answer came too quickly i dont know we waited juliet harshberger said i dont know milo said whered you do your undergrad work that threw her but she murmured brown so much for that rule you went from there straight to caltech i took a year off lab work i traveled why would you care i love to travel milo lied whered you go europe southeast asia a beat africa world tour silence sounds nice i needed to do it she said before the grind grad schools tough grad school at this place is her eyes moistened again everyones a genius except me milo said im betting you made summa at brown juliet harshberger ground her teeth at brown i was smart at caltech im an inanimate object glance to the side treys a genius hes been my lifeline and now hes frightened and missing she cried he passed her another tissue whats going on juliet just julie tell me about trey julie she shook her head i cant what if hes in danger julie please dont say that im sure trey told you about the murder julie harshberger reached for her cat the animal rolled away continued to feign sleep omarine you are so lazy what did trey tell you about the murder julie that you came to his place and interrogated him whens the last time you saw him then she said right after you left he came here the next day i didnt hear from him but sometimes he works late in the lab it was only last night when i went by and he wasnt there for our dinner date i was taking him to the parkside grill its my favorite he hasnt been back since nor has he come into the lab and his cells not responding whats he scared about julie ii cant we know about the sat scam her mouth dropped open milo said yeah that was wrong but think about it trey was frightened enough to leave so covering up and slowing us down could be hazardous to his health when did he tell you about it julie a few months ago she said it bothered him she convinced him to go along with it elise freeman he said she would do anything for a quick buck she hired trey because he could pass for a high school student also he was an alumnus of windsor prep nod that was important because all the students he sat in for were from there elise freeman limited herself to windsor prep students she told trey it kept things simple and she had plenty of business just from there lots of pressure to excel she grimaced i went to a place like that in houston until i could no longer tolerate it and insisted i be sent to public school tough environment brutal uncaring selfish elise and some guy she hung out with exploited that some guy trey said he was pure sleaze shake his hand and count your fingers i said how many sats did trey take for prep students how would i know i dont want to talk about it trey was okay talking about it no not really she said we were discussing how insubstantial the world has become and he brought it up as an example of something stupid and pointless the test is a joke there are tricks its really something you can figure out if you just pay attention if youre as smart as trey my parents forced tutors on me from ninth grade on and they were useless i understood that i needed to study specifically for the test got on the ap bio on the ap chem on the sat i back then it was out of impressive you think her smile was unsettling my brother refused tutoring and got i said trey was a man of course how much did elise freeman pay him i dont knoh why not she gave him five thousand per administration she took more while he did all the work how much more shed never say so he figured it was a lot i hope hes okay grabbing the cat she stroked the animal hard enough to raise a startled mew omarine youre so warm do you promise to help him if you find him milo said of course then ill tell you its not her hes afraid of hes running from some kids kids he took the test for hes convinced they killed her to cover their tracks why he just said theyre scary kids what are their names julie he didnt say i wish he did so i could tell you i begged him lets go to the police my father knows people i can make sure they do their job he said the less you know the better julie and now hes gone the cat jumped off her lap curled in a far corner and pretended to sleep milo said did he give you any details at all julie rich kids she said as if it were a disease no surprise there i said is there someplace trey likes to go when he needs to think here i hold him we listen to music we both unwind did he ever mention the name martin mendoza no whos that someone trey talked about to us the first time that name never came up no names came up he was trying to protect me a small hand settled on a concave belly im feeling sick ill never be able to concentrate on my research whats your topic dont know yet im somewhat of a searcher chapter we made a second pass at trey francks apartment found the livein managers quarters on the top floor the custodian of dinge was a fortyyearold physics student named mario scuzetti who didnt balk at unlocking francks flat sketchy tenant i said weve had better said scuzetti as in paying rent in a timely fashion he stood outside the room as milo scanned milo entered the bathroom closed the door emerged moments later not here and nothing iffy thanks scuzetti said you find him tell him to cough up last months in the car milo removed a toiletpaperwrapped wad from his pocket left his toothbrush and toothpaste and hairbrush which is kind of impulsive for a good planner he probably wasnt thinking in terms of dna analysis i said youre not concerned about a warrantless search what search i went in there concerned about the poor boys safety because of what lil julie said plus everyone associated with the test scam dying unnaturally saw this material in plain sight and believed it might help us locate mr franck all in the interests of his personal safety he started the car not to say dna wouldnt be peachy but all im after now is a print i can match to the palm on fidellas garage francks smart and amoral and you heard moon franck had his evenings to himself had plenty of time to fly in and out and do elise he knew wed trace him through her phone records so he prepares himself sics me on marty mendoza that leaves him grace time to bash in sals head after which he drives off in sals car leaves it in plain sight with a hat that can be traced to marty on the seat and julie just gave us the motive for all this mayhem francks tired of doing all the work and being a junior partner in the scam ergo eliminate the middlemen everything fits including his disappearance he leaves personal things behind but skips out on the rent because hes known for a while that hes gonna rabbit i said the cap being ordered soon after the october sat test fits with serious premeditation but since im your pal im going to point out a problem if francks motive is to continue the scam hell need to be around so he lays low figures out a cover story returns in time for the next round of sats or he got antsy because he felt we were getting too close given his skills he can always find another prep school which leads me to another problem even if francks a psychopath the smartest psychopaths avoid violence not because theyre repelled by it but because its an inefficient strategy francks skills are portable so why murder two people in order to eliminate them as business partners when he could set up shop elsewhere what a pal so give me an alternative two murderous preppies covering their tracks given francks history why would that be anything but another diversion it fits with both murders elises was calculated meanspirited a hahhah lookatme piece of theater because she was in no position to resist sal on the other hand posed a great challenge easier for two people to overpower him and bash him with a found object why wouldnt two homicidal kids bring a weapon alex and covering up for someone taking your sat is a better motive if elise and saland franckwent public theyd be putting themselves in the crosshairs it could be an excellent motive if youre a couple of indulged but intensely pressured brats waiting for the crucial letter when elise freeman lets you know she wants more dough or your futures blown to smithereens same problem alex the scam comes to light shes screwing herself the fact that she considered the rape scam says she was willing to trade a bit of misery and exposure for the chance of big money in both cases she and sal would figure the victims would settle quietly like any good cons they timed the extortion to their preys maximum vulnerability and one more thing the kids franck sat in for didnt show up on elises doorstep randomly most likely she was already tutoring them but their scores just werent edging high enough and they started freaking out at the height of their anxiety elise says you know ive got a solution and thats relevant because if theyd spent time at elises house they could be aware of her vulnerabilities bingedrinking and poor judgment when it came to younger men party with teach spike her vodka with oxy then ice her lovely for all we know fidella figured it out was too greedy to refrain from putting on an additional squeeze unfortunately he underestimated his victims and trey franck misdirects us to martin because anything that keeps us away from the scam is in his best interest then lil julie blows it by being honest ill keep an open mind but my gut tells me francks an emotionally shallow little prick and he could still be the young guy seen driving away in fidellas vette and need i remind you that nosy neighbor was pretty certain there was only one person in the car not some deadly duo rich kids have their own cars i said he rewrapped francks brushes i get a match to that palm print its no longer theoretical same for some juicy info from juicy brianna blevins who i will locate even if it means an unprecedented level of sleep deprivation onward to north hollywood jeeves youre driving i was speaking symbolically he said side effect of all the clever types ive had to contend with chapter the blevins residence was a pebbleroofed ranch house on a culdesac north of chandler boulevard train tracks bisected the neighborhood foisted on unwilling residents by transportation nannies on another futile quest to clear the freeways the house was neatly kept as were its neighbors but the lack of curbside trees gave the street a tentative feel a spotless green buick lesabre sat in the driveway a couple of sago palms sprouted from a lava rock bed below the picture window the man who came to the door wore a white shirt and gray tie held a palm pilot in one hand a stylus in the other the furnishings behind him ran the gamut of green the aroma of bacon had settled comfortably he poked the palm gave a befuddled look fifty or so with the kind of bluish beard that never looks completely shaved and a saltandpepper brush cut he screwed up his mouth as if yet another load of confusion had just been foisted onto his weary shoulders milo s id elicited a onesecond examination police there was a burglary since the trains started running were getting more unsavories just like we worried about but no serious problems yet youre mr blevins harvey whats up wed like to talk to brianna now what youve had problems with brianna maybe one day shell settle down get married pump out a grandchild and ill understand why i became a parent in the first place blevins laughed as if to scour bitterness from his voice yes shes given me problems what the heck has she gone and done milo said were looking at brianna as a witness not a suspect mr blevins so if you could tell us where she is dont know where she is thats part of the problem shes just like her mother talk about geneticshere come on in while i get my laptop we sat on a stiff green sofa as blevins tucked his computer under his arm excuse the mess the house was neater than a marine barracks at inspection despite the bacon perfume the kitchen was spotless and a dishwasher hummed looks fine to me said milo thats always bris excuse said blevins looks fine to me dad you want better do it yourself youre divorced from her mom ten years ago but gloriettas six feet under eight years driving drunk luckily no one else got hurt i said by just like her mother did you mean brianna has a drinking problem she doesnt have one yet said blevins no teetotaler but she seems able to hold it like i can due to my exs issues i did a lot of reading on the subject and its a brain chemistry thing luck of the draw so her problems are shes got slut problems said blevins i know that sounds bad a father shouldnt talk about his kid that way but facts are facts even there i cant blame her totally its also in the brain glorietta was a total roundheels i didnt find out the extent until all these idiots show up at the funeral and start confessing to me classy huh his lower jaw swung from side to side it didnt bother me wed been divorced two years but it did make me resolve to raise bri the right way church girl scouts the works for a while it worked she loved sunday school all the stories they told her then when she got to high school she fell in with the wrong crowd started getting ds and fs i took her to a bunch of therapists they said it was a selfesteem issue i had her tested no learning disability shes just one of those the best she can do is a c so i guess she gave up started hanging with slackers slackers sluts kids bused in from the barrio or wherever you name it was selma arredondo part of that crowd harvey blevinss bushy eyebrows jiggled you know that one huh she get bri in trouble milo said her name came up as a friend of briannas some friend said blevins she comes in here dressed in next to nothing everythings bouncing and jiggling even bri knows better than that but what can you expect when they dance for a living where do they dance harvey blevins sat lower i dont like talking about it but every therapist said i need to be realistic distance myself finally let her take responsibility but he just sat there milo repeated the question what do you think guys im not talking ballet were talking a pole okay he winced you wouldnt be asking all this if she didnt get herself into trouble whats going on so far nothing said milo blevins peered at him skeptically thats the truth mr blevins and im sure it can all be cleared up once we talk to bri where do she and selma dance dont know dont want to know they started doing it the second they turned eighteen and were legal i tried to talk bri into junior college she said shed never make as much money as she could doing that everything nowadays is about money right blevins checked his palm pilot due at work soon wheres that sir refgem motorworks in westchester we build highperformance components for custom cars and boats im on the paper end assistant controller reason im home at this time of day is with the economy they asked us to voluntarily cut our hours so im down to thirty per week and they give me flextime makes it harder on bri cause im here more she likes to be around when im not so she lives here when she chooses the rest of the time no idea whens the last time you saw her that would have to be twono three days ago she showed up at eight in the morning just as i was leaving big coincidence hello goodbye she usually comes in for food and clothes where does she work you call that work said blevins all shed tell me is gentlemans clubs like any gentleman would go there was selma with her selma dropped her off but didnt stick around probably cause i was there selma knows how i feel about her bri doesnt drive she had a car but it got repod tight smile guess gentlemen dont pay the bills do you have any idea where selma lives dont know dont care who are bris other friends her line of work you dont have friends you have oglersoh excuse me regulars that was a big deal to her she kept trying to impress me with the fact she had regulars im thinking great some pervert has enough money to waste it on you but i kept my mouth shut whats the point did she tell you anything about her regulars rich theyre always rich right with the private jets and the platinum cards i wanted to say what you found an old cassette of pretty woman what else besides rich blevins ticked off his fingers rich handsome young smartgoes to stanford does that make sense stanfords up north why would a smart personany person fly down here regularly to watch pole dancing like theres no poles in palo alto so were talking one guy in particular two stanford guys one for her one for selma guess if youre going to fantasize make it good what else did she say about them its actually relevant to something said blevins at this point thats hard to say sir we collect as much information as we can sift through doesnt sound too efficient sometimes its the only way mr blevins so what else did bri tell you two rich guys come in to watch her and selma dance soon theyre taking her and selma to aspen vail i forget which some ski place on a private jet no less this was months ago it was summer she tried to get money out of me for ski clothes see what i mean she cant even put together a logical fantasy milo said two guys one jet maybe one owns it the other gets to use it maybe theyre partnershey maybe you and i can split a private jet what brand do you like im a buick guy myselfguys i really need to get to work we walked him to his car milo said did brianna ever put a name on these fantasy guys im glad youre getting it fantasy like when after her mother died and she started wanting to be a princess i told her look what happened to diana so no names actually there was something with a t trevor turner tristan yeah tristan like thats a real name right out of one of those trash paperbacks her mother used to read not tremaine or trey blevins thought nope tristan like that operatristan and isabel what about tristans friend if she told me his name i wasnt listening when you see bri dont tell her i finked on her its tense enough he drove away and we got back in the unmarked milo put his cell on speaker and reached moe reed martin mendozas status as prime suspect has dropped moses so no need for the watch on his parents same for the kenten estate unless youve picked up something interesting reed said early this morning officer ramirez spotted kentens grandson entering again another short visit no surfboard this time he had a passenger but a white kid not mendoza two white boys in a nice car said milo ive got a lead on a couple of stripjoint enthusiasts claiming to be stanford students milo filled in the details sure garret kenten could fit what did garrets passenger look like they drove in and out fast she couldnt even get a fix on hair color because he wore a baseball cap but she says definitely anglo blue cap with an s insignia she didnt specify want to hold sure moments later tan too far for any insignia loo brown shirt is the only other thing she can swear to in my office is a windsor prep yearbook moses blue leather fancy gold seal its right below the murder book go through it right now and look for any tristans starting with seniors ill wait on the way loo a train whistle broke the silence then faded west a couple of ravens settled atop harvey blevinss house pecked at gravel dislodged a few pebbles and cackled in triumph reed came back on okay got the book heres the senior class no tristans heres a tristram big darkhaired kid kinda got that actor thing going onthe fake smile you know could he pass for twentyone oh sure easy want me to check tristans in the junior class go moments later nope just one tristram last name wydette reed spelled the surname milo and i looked at each other the morning wed met up with president helfgott hed flown in on a gulfstream borrowed from a myron wydette milo said fantasy springs to life pardon loo what does the book say about young master tristram his extracurricular activities said reed business club foreign policy club model un mock trial varsity baseball varsity golftheyve got a golf course nine holes im more interested in the great american pastime sir said reed oh the hat in the car maybe he played baseball with mendoza developed a grudge or he just knows a good scapegoat when he sees one moses run him through every damn database you can find then do a search pairing his name with garret kentens that comes up empty go through the yearbook page by page to see if theres another male hes been photographed with consistently if so search that name alsoand pair it with garret just to be safe sean in the shop today still at the mendoza house at this hour plainclotheser called in sick sean said hed doubleshift guys got a bladder the size of australia milo said dont rub it in lad one more thing when you look into tristram dont just count parking violations look for consistent addresses on the citations maybe itll lead us to a strip joint or two or three i need those girls done loo he got hold of binchy told him to get over to harvey blevinss house immediately do his usual eagleeye thanks for the compliment loot thank me by producing we sped back to my house where milo commandeered the computer sometimes money intersects with fame at a higher level it can also purchase obscurity keywording myron wydette produced only five hits and a single image the citations were a quintet of charity benefits with myron and annette wydettes names embedded in lists of major donors american cancer society the eye clinic at the u planned parenthood a pair of galas for windsor preparatory academy only the ophthalmology reference hinted at the source of wydettes income mr and mrs m wydette and the wydette orchard foundation muttering peaches milo found a handful of references to a family fruitgrowing concern founded by myrons greatgrandfather during gold rush days and sold a decade ago to trident agriculture a publicly traded corporation myron wydettes name remained on the board of directors but he didnt seem to be involved in daytoday activities the solitary image was of a broad ungainlylooking whitehaired man with a benevolent somewhat blearyeyed frogface arm in arm with a tightly coiffed tightly toned tightly tucked brunette half a head taller milo said sounds like tristram got his looks from mommy pairing wydette and stanford pulled up a threeyearold article in the universitys magazine about a trio of incoming freshman ostensibly picked at random annie tranh was the granddaughter of vietnamese boat people and a westinghouse science award winner eric roblesscott was a biracial kid from harlem whod won a national competition in foreign languages by demonstrating proficiency in french swedish and gullah dialect aidan wydette of la was the tenth member and fourth generation of his family to grace the palo alto campus aidans headshot revealed a darkhaired thicknecked boy with an open confident smile note was made of the wydette clans long history of contribution to higher education but no dollar amounts were mentioned and care was taken to list aidans qualifications outstanding scholar and athlete at windsor preparatory academy in brentwood national merit scholar summer internship at a washington dc think tank where hed coauthored a paper on fiscal policy in emerging democracies followed by a summer at the sports section of the new york times achievements at prep included a full academic load varsity letters in golf hockey and soccer captain of the model un team and mock trial cocaptain of the business club cofounder of a program donating unused restaurant food to the homeless milo said guess the nobel comes in his sophomore year i said three sports for him only two for tristram tristram serves on model un and mock trial but aidans the captain of both teams if lil bro doesnt make national merit hes reduced to peasant status yeah that would kick up the pressure merit scholarships are based on psat scores your percentiles high enough you write a legible essay youre in fake a score get an award he said hell maybe were not just talking tristram for all we know aidans resume got pumped up the oldfashioned way cheating as a way of life you read the papers his pocket jumped as his phone played a toofast bach prelude no more fur elise did that mean something moe reed broke in cant find a single link between tristram wydette and garret kenten though garret did graduate from prep four years ago he goes to college somewhere local theres no record he goes anywhere the only thing that comes up under his name is a band youll love this the slackers but there is a kid in the yearbook whos with tristram in ten photos seven are from the baseball team but therere also shots of the two of them horsing around on campus to me they look like buds loo whats this princes name quinn glover he doesnt have a record and neither does tristram but your idea about parking was good because tristram has piled up a lot of paper on or near los angeles street downtown thats industrial but there used to be rave clubs in vacant buildings so maybe therere strip clubs they bother enforcing parking there a while back there were complaints about drug deals so central blocks off the area after six pm i guess once in a while they do enforce he read off the addresses on the citations one more thing loo quinn glovers daddy is ceo of trident agriculturethats the outfit tristrams daddy sold his orchards to multigenerational ties that bind said milo make up sixpacks with each of these kids faces im gonna troll for a couple of pole dancers the block was grubby dim lined with warehouses and industrial buildings a good half of them vacant loose garbage specked the sidewalk the air smelled oddly of raw pork and rubber cement signs every ten yards warned no parking pm to am no one in sight but for a few homeless men lolling or driving carts some of the drivers managed a straight line the hungry lion gentlemans lounge occupied a windowless maroon cube a stretch of dirt and broken asphalt running behind the buildings served as parking the space behind the club was empty posted hours on the gunmetal door out front said the merriment wouldnt start for another two hours a sign above the building featured a leering simba wearing a red paisley shirt and mirrored sunglasses and sporting a slickedback mulletmane one manicured paw clutched a glass of something fizzy the other held a wildeyed grinning unclad blonde the girls expression said her ultimate life goal had been achieved milo said king kong was ambivalent this critters licking his chops hungry indeed he rapped the metal door evoked a barely audible thud one of the cartpushers rounded a corner spotted us and nearly overturned as he attempted a sharp uturn contents shot out of the cart we caught up as he stooped to reload cardboard boxes newspapers cans bottles milo bent to help him with the last few treasures thats okay officer im fine know anything about that club friend i know to stay away officer bad influence huh bouncer getting upside your head is a bad influence officer used to be quiet around here nice place to spend the night then that place opened and its like they own the whole street ever get close

produced brianna blevinss and selma arredondos dmv photos that include these two these two the homeless man echoed big and little massaging his chest yeah theyre always together whens the last time

feeling they like each other three rapid winks caused the opposite side of his face to contract like a harried sea anemone wonder which one gives and which one gets the twenty remained in his outstretched palm filthy palm but when he closed it over the money he exposed trimmed nails go know twenty more i could have three four breakfasts officer milo peeled off an additional ten another twenty would be nicer but thank you officer you lie to me were going out for a fourcourse dinner and youre picking up the tab la whoa laughter that could clean out my k as we edged out of the downtown

oversized hoop earrings goldplated bangles cuffing their right wrists both girls had eyebrow pierces tongue studs multiple holes in their ears selma sported a diamond between a perky mouth and a cute chin briannas visible tattoos were a left forearm sleeve filled with roses and thorns a barbedwire biceps ring a female devils face in the hollow beneath her neck love inked in black gothic across one collarbone devotion stretching the length of the other selma s neck was circled by a blueandredink necklace of yellow diamonds and red links supporting a pearshaped black pearl that was a masterpiece of trompe loeil both of her arms were slavebraceleted three times chinese characters rose up from where cleavage would be if her breasts could produce such milo asked her what does that say something about life cell phones confiscated and purses searched the girls were placed in separate interview rooms and left to contemplate fueled by adrenaline detective room coffee and a vendingmachine roast beef sandwich that made him grumble about turf that didnt deserve surf milo started with brianna the girl looking older than nineteen eyes already running to crowsfeet kept her eyes on the table hi bri me again and this is alex uhhuh we sat down crowding her tell us about tristram and quinn bri dont know em actually you do bri i dont milo showed her pictures tristram wydette and quinn glover hot

bri we already know a lot so you might as well help yourself lets start with you and selma meeting tristram and quinn at the hungry lion then partying together for months weve got their credit card records so we know when they started coming in how much money they spent on you weve got other sources so we also know about the promises they made pausing to give her a chance bri blevins shook her head promises of amazing stuff he went on like taking you guys on a private jet to aspen and all you had to do was be nice he let the last word sink in the taut flesh sheathing bri blevinss scapulae turned rosy bottoming the lovedevotion message in rose she still had the capacity to blush milo said we dont care about that kind of nice bri the only nice that interests us is a favor you did for them on a certain night something you worked out with gilberto chavez know who that is no emphatic hes a spanish guy you paid to buy dry ice out in van nuys false eyelashes quaked the blush across her chest seeped out as if liposuctioned remember that bri no answer different kind of ice from what youre used to said milo we found that nice little chunk of meth in your purse selma said youre the one always bought she just shared thats a lie your word against selmas bri and selmas being helpful but honestly bri the dopes no big deal i couldnt care less about that kind of ice what i do care about is dry ice cause that was used for something bad bri you know what im talking about the girl blinked crossed her arms across her torso and dropped her head uhuh actually you do bri and unfortunately for you and selma you also knew the dry ice was going to be used for something really bad and guess how we know that shrug we know because selma told us bri how else would we know you buy ice for some rich dudes no problem you buy ice knowing its going to be used to kill someone big problem thats called accomplices before the fact according to the law thats the same as committing murder bri blevins looked up tried to match his stare couldnt handle five seconds before she dropped her head to the table selmas already cooperating bri and thats buying her a lot of goodwill she may be your homegirl bri but shes smart enough to realize that a life sentence for murder changes everything the girls head shook from side to side id heard moans like hers on the cancer ward milo said it doesnt need to be bad bri youve got one chance to tell us your side after that its selma being smart and you being stupid and ending up in the same situation as tristram and quinn up to you the head shaking rotated

were doing inside the house they told us later you knew they were gonna kill her bri maybe they were kidding milo smiled like i said sir i didnt know her selma arredondo sat with her arms folded across her flat chest exceptionally pretty girl even in station light but hardeyed and tightmouthed and hostile the sinew and bone and sharp angles of a carnivore that needs to consume its weight daily she said im not saying anything suit yourself selma he headed for the door by the way ive got a message from bri homegirl youre on your own stab of fear she covered with a smirk thats not bri hows this for a reality check selma tris and q took you and bri to fashion square before they killed elise bought you dresses shoes and jewelry then you got pizza at pizza hut then you looked for a mexican to buy ice you knew what the ice was for and while it was happening you and bri smoke up in your wait black eyes flashed what do you want me to say the truth like what part of it all of it she stared smiled girlishly and tossed her hair sure why not milo said lets talk about hats dont wear em a baseball hat selma oh that she said that was bris idea she said if it got left in the car they could blame everything on the annoying kid because he was annoying yeah you and bri never met him nope what did tris and q find so annoying about him better than them at baseball both of them yup it pissed them off so why not frame him for a couple of murders it sounded she said like a real good idea chapter deputy da john nguyen left the observation room smiling why cant you do this all the time do what make my life easy okay xerox the murder book for me and ill have phone subpoenas on everyone activated within two hours same for broadbased warrants for both families houses in bel air as well the little monsters desks and lockers at prep ill also suggest to the feds that wydette seniors plane was used to transport dope across state borders to arizona they can smooth it with the aspen police for search of the mountain home anything else on your wish list sounds good john milo phoned moe reed and told him to copy the file nguyen said you should be able to execute those warrants by tomorrow am there may be a time lag between authorization and execution what this from mr iwantityesterday its complicated john seemed to me those bimbos just made it simple on the contrary john milo carried the taped confessions back to his office moe reed was just leaving with the murder book his free hand waved a message slip i was just going to look for you loo this came in while i was copying milo scanned the note you took this personally came in on your cell loo i copied pretty much verbatim reeds meticulous cursive read i gave you sat dates why didnt you do anything go after tristram wydette and quinn glover everyone already knows reed said young male i tried to keep him on the line but he cut the connection everyone already knows i took that to mean at the school loo its like those school shootings right doc kids brag i nodded milo said nothing like being outside the goddamn loop okay get the copy to john you might still be able to catch him in the lot then stay on call reed rotated his neck its happening something is moses chapter the chief listened milo finished the chief said nothing sir do you feel physically confident sturgis youre not exactly a gym rat confident of your ability to kick two young bucks asses if necessary depends on what im getting at sturgis is do you feel secure enough to go in there without a fucking army id like to avoid some threepenny swat opera if the school cooperates and doesnt alert them i think i can handle that the school wont alert anyone because the school wont know you want me to go in cold interesting choice of words yes sir it is this has been a tough one sturgis lingered in all our minds it has sir fuck it said the chief just do what you need to do but if theres a way to minimize disruption that would be preferable thank you sir just get it over with we sped past the allee of chinese elms herb walkowicz was out of his booth before we rolled to a stop he tipped his hat now what guys milo showed him the warrants whoa and here i was gonna give you the song and dance about calling rollins before i can unlock the gates laughing he fetched his key from the booth the first of windsor preps sixteen acres was an immaculate concreteandbrick lot stackparked with gleaming vehicles milo and i searched for tristram wydettes jaguar and quinn glovers hummer found neither means nothing he said kids like that can have access to all kinds of wheels but he called reed and binchy anyway to make sure they stayed close to the wydette estate on bellagio drive and the even larger glover spread a few blocks away on nimes road reed said theres a guardhouse in front first i thought it was a dummy inside guy was so still then he moved his head once in ninety minutes talk about a fascinating job i dont like surveillance either moses pardonno i dont mind it then keep enjoying beyond the parking area a cluster of duncolored redroofed monterey colonial buildings stood like chess pieces on a board of precisionmowed bluegrass monumental perfectly positioned pines floss trees liquidambars and redwoods were sculpted to symmetry an adult female passed from one building to another then a male teacher in a tweed coat and khakis a scatter of students studied on the lawn no sound beyond breeze kissing leaves off to the left flags stood in barbered turf ringed by low white fencing the ninehole golf course poor darlings said milo they go to college its a step down all the buildings bore brass plaques the largest was fronted by a cool dim loggia and merited a doublewide slab administration dr mary jane rollinss office was the prize beyond a hushed greencarpeted oakpaneled reception room overseen by a black woman in a red silk dress sheila mcbough was stamped on her personal chunk of brass the foundry loved this place milos card didnt impress her you dont have an appointment he said we have something better and held out the warrant before she finished scanning he continued past her desk you cant do that that madam is an obvious misstatement mary jane rollinss personal space was her secretarys office on steroids the same honeycolored oak green carpeting enough carving and moldings to spell out authority she was on the phone said ill have to call you back and slammed down the receiver now what milo told her her initial reaction was the expected panic then she smirked well unfortunately for you theyre not here doctor its a senior cutday lieutenant we have several throughout the semester prefer to bleed off tension on a regular basis rather than where are their lockers doctor in the locker area show me and bring your master key what makes you think i have one you dont your warrant says i need to answer personal questions he showed her his badge this says if you dont cooperate ill cuff you and haul your educated but morally unschooled derriere off to jail she blanched i never neither have i show me their lockers now this will not go unreported mercy me pass the defibrillator as we left rollins told mcbough sheila phone dr helfgott immediately theres a situation milo said sheila dont phone anyone theres a situation the lockers lined two walls of a cavernous building labeled repository oak brassfitted milo said open wydettes and glovers rollins sniffed as she checked a list calling me morally unschooled was unnecessary im looking for two vicious murderers and all you care about is semantics not semantics said rollins im a good person one day you may find yourself in special circumstances and react in a way that surprises you gee he said that could never happen to me both lockers were empty rollins said so much for your evidence do you have any idea where i can find tristram wydette and quinn glover silence doctor if you know where they are and you withhold that information youll go to jail on obstruction charges right now i may go but i wont stay long trust me dr rollins you wont enjoy a single minute behind bars her lips pursed milo said a jobs that important its not a job its a calling so was the nazi ss that is outrageousoh all right seeing as cutday leads into the weekend theyre where youd expect them to be embarking on a family holiday her voice rose as the briticism rolled off her tongue creepy ebullience both families i believe so where are they going i dont know how do you know the families are traveling together i chitchatted with the boys yesterday they were in excellent spirits and i find it difficult to believe what exactly did they tell you tristram told me they were going to use the plane that it would be wonderful i believe his term was awesome the plane mr wydettes gulfstream five she said its a marvel chapter as i sped to santa monica airport milo celled reed nothing loo thats cause we may be too late both families are scheduled to leave for the weekend check with the mannequin in the booth and dont take any bullshit tell sean to find out whats happening at wydettes place if everyones gone well go ahead and search the houses and given the size ill need a small army so get in touch with the lab and the duty sergeant and start recruiting moments later reed phoned back mannequins cooperative exrampart division hates the family cause they treat him like dirt hes absolutely certain no one left today except tristram after quinn glover picked him up in his hummer that was an hour and a quarter ago right before i arrived they took luggage loo a lot of it the search warrant was extended to the gulfstream by the time i reached bundy drive takeoff to aspen aborted by the tower at lax as i turned onto ocean park as far as the crew was aware unanticipated airtraffic buildup was the reason i got buzzed through the gate at diamond aviation by mentioning milo s name drove onto the landing field followed a porter in a golf cart to the gv the planes engines were running as were those of two smaller jets the noise level was at brainpuree when i reached the planes left wing and stopped the pilot looked down from the cockpit curious but not alarmed milo s badgeflash didnt change that people who loft tons of metal in the air should take a lowkey approach to life milo motioned him out the engines switched off when theyd quieted to merely deafening the door opened and the pilot lowered the foldout steps descended two rungs turned and shut the door rockjawed the same man whod flown edgar helfgott halfway around the globe and back on high school business rawboned grayhaired built like a runner milo introduced himself shouting to be heard the captain pointed several yards away and the three of us walked until we could hear our own voices the pilot said rod brewer what can i do for you sir ive got a search warrant for your plane and arrest warrants for tristram wydette and quinn glover they inside yes sir who else is in there captain susan curtis is she in danger anything in the boys demeanor worrying you not really said brewer theyre spoiled little bastards all caught up with their ipods and the shades are down but with too much delay they might get curious mind if i tell sue to lock the cockpit good idea brewer made the call ended by instructing the copilot to answer any questions from the boys with mechanical problems to us okay what do i need to do milo said where are they sitting first row on either side said brewer its always that way i can be flying over the grand canyon theyre into their own thing the boys or the entire family seems to be a genetic thing did you notice anything that can be construed as a weapon weve got silverware smiling mrs wydette just upgraded to christofle nothing else everythings in the hold said brewer except their ipods hustler magazine and silver patron theyre already half stoned dont know if that works in your favor or the opposite they get nasty when theyre drunk not really mostly they sleep parents allow them to drink when theyre with their parents they drink red bull how many times have they flown without their parents this is the first but daddy authorized the trip mommy she say why the boys were flying to aspen by themselves no one explains anything to me said brewer im furniture furniture who holds their lives in the balance lieutenant people in their circumstances see the world differently theres them then theres everyone else okay thanks pop that door please no prob said brewer before you go in you might want to check the hold this is the first time they insisted on loading their own stuff the two duffels lay on the tarmac black nylon allweather sturdy stainlesssteel fittings glinting in the untrammeled sun milo had gloved up and unloaded them by himself continued to sweat and pant captain rod brewer watched him the way an anesthesiologist watches oxygen levels milo touched one of the duffels patted it along the length repeated the same for the other arching his eyebrows he unzipped inside were layers of thick plastic sheeting milky and opaque kneeling he peered closely took out a pocketknife that he wiped with a sterile cloth slicing carefully he peeled back each layer captain rod brewer said my god a face stared up at us young male greenishgray slackjawed flat clouded cellophane disks where eyes had once functioned what the techies call a defect was visible in the center of the corpses unlined forehead entry wound small and neat probably a the body nested in a cloud of white pellets that began vaporizing the moment they impacted with warm air what the hell is that dry ice said brewer it sublimates said milo wielding his blade and lengthening the slit the pilot blinked looked away an unflappable man but something had finally perturbed him and i knew what it was no normalsized human being could fit into either of the duffels milo finished peeling back the plastic stared rod brewer crossed himself the body had been severed just above the hips not a clean job the edges of the separation were ragged bone ends had shredded like used firecrackers exposed muscle resembled marbled steak viscera had been frozen midaction as they tumbled out of the torso coalescing as horrid olivegreen sausage something serrated and highpowered my guess was a chain saw milo stared marched to the second duffel solved the jigsaw puzzle that had once been trey franck chapter the gulfstreams cabin smelled of fresh flowers apples and tequila tristram wydettes long frame stretched the length of a brocade sofa on the planes port side a copy of hustler tented over his face breathing slowly evenly one manicured hand brushed the carpet near his fingers sat a chromeplated ipod quinn glover larger and heavier in real life with the bland good looks of a budding politico sat with his feet up wearing eyeshades sucking from a bottle of silver patron and bopping in time to whatever tunebuzz his goldplated ipod was offering both boys wore camouflage cargo pants and tight black tshirts that showcased muscular builds combat boots and dirty white socks littered the aisle uniformed for a mission milo yanked quinn up first had him cuffed belted into his chair eyes and ears exposed before his mouth could close tristram remained asleep milo flipped him like a pancake yanked out his earbuds both boys gaped milo said you guys watch a lot of tv blank stares im sure you know the drill but here goes tristram wydette you are under arrest for murder you have the right to keep your stupid mouth shut whether or not you talk really doesnt matter squat to me the evolution of each boys facial expression was as uniform as their getup drowsy surprise morphing to corneredanimal shock upgrading to terror then tears milo called for backup and we watched them sob worth the price of admission chapter battalion one highpriced lawyers battalion two highpriced publicists an attempt to curry favor at the times because myron wydette played golf with the publisher backfired and the resulting selfrighteous indignation was borderline slapstick wags insisted the real problem was wydette cheated at the game and his greens buddy finally had enough the palm print found on sal fidellas garage matched quinn glovers hand faced with that addition to the mountain of eyewitness and forensic evidence quinns legal commandos tried selling out tristram wydette in return for a lighter sentence pushing the notion that quinn was a weakwilled follower caught in the spell of tristram wydettes evil charisma tristram his former best friend claimed had masterminded the whole thing because getting into stanford was the most important thing in the world to him he felt like the stupid kid in the family aidan was the brainiac when told that aidan had also used trey franck as an sat surrogate the boy was genuinely surprised no shit what was his problem you tell me quinn said milo he always seemed smart to me maybe he just wasnt smart enough yeah sir youre right laughter something funny quinn i guess he just fucked up sir i guess we all did thats a fair assessment assessment said quinn thats an sat vocab word the act or instance of evaluating how do you assess your situation quinn it was ts idea sir i didnt like it what could i do no choice at all exactly sir t thought of the deeice t put herms freemanin it he also bashed in that losers headwe were gonna shoot himt was gonna shoot him but we forgot the gun at ts house and we already drove all the way there so t said lets just do it howd it go down loser came to the door wet pushed him in saw the pool cue and bashed him milo said there was no sign of a serious struggle quinn that means mr fidella was restrained if you say so sir be a lot easier for two big guys to restrain one middleaged loser the boys lawyer silent and working his iphone till now said id prefer he doesnt answer that milo didnt protest so t bashed in the losers head then what then t got into the jag and you drove away in the losers corvette the lawyer said id prefer if and id prefer not to waste my time mr neal grand theft auto is not your clients problem its not a matter of that its a matter of milo stood motioned to me to do the same thats it said quinn according to mr neal it is son to the attorney so far i havent heard anything of a forthcoming nature and john nguyen wont take kindly to that particularly in light of multiple victims murder for gain extreme depravity lying in wait fine said neal he drove the car we sat back down milo said you drove off in mr fidellas corvette pieceofshit wheels said quinn made all sorts of noises smiling and hoping it caught on then what happened client glanced at counsel counsel nodded we went to tristrams house and stored it in the garage his dads got a huge garage twenty cars in there then what nothing until the next day then tristram took the jag and i took the piece of shit i almost thought it wouldnt make it make it where pasadena whats in pasadena his place whose place him the nerd who took the test trey franck yeahyes sir whyd you go there t said it was like his mom shes crazy about being neat doesnt matter if you leave a speck of cookie on the couch or you take a dump on it shes going to freak out so we had to go all the way no sense leaving a speck of mess said milo exactly sir we had to be thorough howd it go down with trey franck the plan was we were going to knock on the door say it was a friend or something but right after we got there he came out of the building and started walking we drove up to him it was dark no one was around so we jumped out and held him and coldcocked him he wimped out totally like out we t did the shooting who did the coldcocking pause i guess that was me but t held him and kicked him in the balls by the time i hit him he was pretty much out of it i didnt hit him that hard what happened next t drove him and i followed in the corvette where was mr franck in the trunk of the jag t had him tied up with these plastic thingies a fact verified by traces of trey francks saliva and blood in the rear compartment of the freshly vacuumed and detailed car you were following in sal fidellas corvette yes sir whered you go we drove to this place t knew it cause his cousin has a ranch near there and his dad took him hiking and shooting up in the mountains there when he was little not recently no way said quinn glover he doesnt talk to his dad hates his dad thinks his dad hates him so youre at a spot t knew said milo t pulls him out of the trunk was franck conscious guess so said quinn glover he was making these whimpery sounds all curled up t rolls him on his back says guess youre not so smart motherfucker and shoots him right here touching the center of a tan unlined brow we tried to push the vette down into the hole but it doesnt go so t set it on fire and we booked after putting a baseball cap on the seat ts idea sir what was the reason blame it on someone else who mexican dude everyone knew he hated her hated who the bims freeman howd everyone know dude told anyone whod listen she didnt like him either elise freeman complained about martin mendoza yeah to you specifically when we came for tutoring yeah said quinn glover howd the topic of martin mendoza come up he was leaving and we were coming in we said you tutor him cause she was expensive you know and the dude didnt have money she said unfortunately apparently my job description includes those people or something like that sir which you took to mean she didnt like mexicans whatd you say to that nothing said the boy but you thought of it later when you and t decided to blame the murders on martin ts idea whatd you do with francks body wiped it off with some rags from the jag then put him back in the jag then what you know i know what you saw him sir what t did t cut him up yes sir but the place you did it was your fathers workshop quinn all those tools he keeps back of your property for his woodworking he makes birdhouses muttering whats that quinn nothing whatd you just say son lame making those stupid birdcages what use would a chain saw be for making birdcages thats for the trees said quinn glover we have some land in washington lots of trees he likes to run around with the chain saw and saw them down says its his release then he turns them into birdcages guess your dad will need a new chain saw guess so neal looked up is this going to take a whole lot longer milo ignored him back to something you just said quinn when you saw martin mendoza we were coming in for tutoring are you telling me you and t had joint tutoring sessions with ms freeman cause the records recovered from the laptop we found in ts bedroom at home dont back that up same for mr fidellas computer recovered from your roomhe had copies of all ms freemans files quinn glover licked his lips milo said you had individual sessions yes sir so maybe it was you who had that conversation with ms freeman about martin not both of you the lawyer said dont answer that we stood again oh cmon lieutenant you need to balance what hes given you with what he hasnt i need to said milo you know what i mean lieutenant youre a lawyer mr neal that means no oneincluding yourselfknows what you mean bye this is inappropriate and impetuous there you go said milo two sat words for the price of one as details of the cheating scandal hit the national news the educational testing service announced a comprehensive review of all exams administered to windsor prep students over the past five years sal fidellas computer files showed hed contemplated finding additional blackmail victims after elises death the files tristram and quinn had added concentrated on porn tunes photos from exotic car and motorcycle sites email correspondence between the boys indicated they viewed their murder spree with hilarity wondered what it would feel like to do a girl like bri and selma yeah theyd be softer but youd probably need a new blade anyway john nguyen said no deal no way ive got a bisected corpse if anythings a death penalty case this is it no one gets executed in california but prosecutors collect lethalinjection sentences like baseball cards in the end a deal was cut guilty pleas to firstdegree murder and life sentences but with the possibility of parole because both killers were young had no prior criminal record and were potentially redeemable milo said coupons are redeemable one file that didnt show up on either elises computer or fidellas was an indication of where four years of sat scam money had gone with fees of fifteen thousand a pop and the possibility that trey franck wearing a variety of wigs had gamed the system over two dozen times during a threeyear period the total was significant one day after the plea bargain hit the news dr will kham called milo from cottage hospital in santa barbara and asked for an appointment we met him at cafe moghul where milo was making up for lost time with a mountain of lamb kham wore a dark blue suit and a matching shirt and tie entered the restaurant furtively a physician but his black bag today was a wheeled carryon out of it came a sheaf of papers eighteen months of investment records from a citibank subsidiary in santa barbara nine hundred and eighteen thousand dollars jointaccounted to kham and elise freemans sister sandra stuehr milo kept eating as he read when he turned the last page he said value stocks and corporate bonds you guys havent done too badly considering i want out said kham i can tell you exactly whats mine and whats hers tell me about it doc the figures will speak for themselves tell me anyway not a talkative man but after some struggle kham got the story out he and sandra had planned to be married though the scandal had changed everything no way would his family tolerate that kind of thing and hed been having doubts himself too rushed the fact that she was so eager was starting to concern me a year ago sandra had insisted on a joint account to prove the strength of their relationship kham had contributed five hundred and twenty thousand sandra a bit over three hundred thousand investments purchased at the bottom of the meltdown by kham had added nearly a hundred in profit looking back said kham i know she used me to launder the money because prior to that shed been claiming financial hardship her ex was withholding all sorts of assets from her all of a sudden she presented me with a cashiers check for three oh nine when i asked her where it came from she said savings and changed the subject back then i was lovestupid so i let it go but i held on to the receiptits in here drawn on a bank in studio city when i heard about what her sister had done i figured you should know we should doc thanks very much thank me said kham by helping me get my five twenty back she can keep the interest its dirty money i dont want any part of it sounds like your parents raised you right so theyd say lieutenant chapter a week after tristram wydette and quinn glover bargained for their lives the police chief gave a press conference describing the arrest as the product of meticulous investigation and precisely the type of corruption im committed to eradicating among the cadre of suits surrounding him was captain stanley creighton milo was nowhere to be seen i called and asked him about it if i wanted to be an actor i wouldve learned to wait tables the following morning at eight am an aide to the chief got through to my private line and asked me to confer with her boss in three hours at his house dr delaware if you dont mind not at all great ill give you the address i already had it but no sense editing her script when she hung up i gave milo another call he said rick and i are going over travel stuff we were thinking hawaii but maybe the atlantic deserves us ever been to the bahamas never my travel plans extend to agoura want to drive together i would if i was invited alex oh guess im the lucky one i wonder what he wants maybe hell sweeten the job offer there aint enough sugar in hawaii i said same goes for whatever they grow in the bahamas okay keep you posted heres my post john says tristrams lawyers are panicking for a quick transfer to corcoran thats a tough place county jail decor doesnt cut it getting the shit beat out of you by some resident county gangbangers doesnt fit young ts lifestyle the fervent hope is isolation with the snitches and the child molesters and the whitecollar mopes will help there you go i said everythings about connections in the daylight the chiefs spread was scragglier but more appealing like the set of an old western movie hot day in agoura despite impending autumn he sat in the same rocker wearing a black suit white shirt and red tie that had to be cooking him the three metal folding chairs to his left soaked up full punishing sun three young men occupied the chairs a husky latino kid with his arm in a sling wearing a south el monte high lettermans jacket a smallish but muscular guy slightly older in cutoffs and a zuma jay tshirt and a beanpole with a humongous adams apple awkward mannerisms and fuzzy red hair protruding from a beige huntington gardens cap i bypassed the chief and walked up to cutoff youre garret kenten yes sir good to meet you same here impressive and entertaining doctor said the chief one day you can take the show to vegas charlie removed his cap daad sorry son different voice subdued embarrassed unsure id heard it from countless parents of adolescents forgive me dr delaware as you can imagine its been a bit challenging around here shouldnt be dad said charlie seeing as we did the allegedly right thing garret kenten highfived him martin mendoza smiled i shook his left hand continued to charlie the chief said please sit down dr delaware no sense drawing this out garret and charlie have been hiding martin mendoza since shortly after elise freemans murder technically when marty was a fugitive that was illegal but given how things have unfolded im sure you recognize the need for discretion of course i said to the trio good work guys no big deal said garret kenten marty mendoza said to me it was dude the fugitive said garret we shouldve filmed it charlie hadnt taken his eyes off me it was a clear matter of right and wrong unsullied by those inane moral dilemmas they keep tossing at us so they can feel good about themselves as if theoretical situations are relevant garret kenten said what matters to me is my grandfather doesnt get hassled talking to me but looking sidelong at the chief the chief said thatll be no problem i know you cant stand him sir but you need to forget about that your grandfather and iweve had our differences hes obviously a good man but there are differences i dont care about that sir i just dont want you to hassle him no problem charlie said no reason for there to be dad his father glared pulled at his mustache not a single hair on your grampas head will be touched garret grinned good he doesnt have too many left marty laughed charlie remained serious we had to do it he said we dont deserve credit because there was no other logical choice they made explicit threats against him the chief said son theres no need to get into they hated marty because theyre insubstantial posers and his abilities threatened them it was a matter of life and death marty said maybe not that bad at least i got to learn surfing garret said you learned to flop on your ass i said so you stayed in malibu yes but not at my grandfathers estate because we knew we just figured it wasnt a good idea my grandfather rents me my own place in trancas im taking a couple of years off to do a documentary on surfing probably come to nothing but ill give it a try then maybe head to uc santa cruz to marty at least youre neat dude like youd know the difference i said nice setup you even got him his own surfboard all three boys stared your grandfathers house was under surveillance garret you were seen bringing a board out and the following day you left with a guy in a beige cap garret kenten said whoa charlie shrugged the chief said okay everyone got to share feelings now go inside guys i need to talk to the doctor alone martin mendoza stood but the other two hesitated dont push it said the chief garret and charlie flanked marty as they turned to leave i walked up to him im glad youre okay he said history class there was all that talk about good germans saving jews i wasnt sure i believed it the three of them trudged to the house the chief said you know what im going to ask you now not really this mess every single application from prep is being looked at like a slice of freezedried dogshit charlie earned his way into yale i want you to write him a letter of recommendation and make it good how does he feel about that look doctor anything from his teachers and that asshole helfgotts gonna be poison you on the other hand still stand for truth justice and all that good stuff and youve got that professorship at the med school they like that kind of thing be happy to do it i said after i talk to charlie about what for me to write a good letter i need to know him ill tell you what you need to know gpa and he takes the hardest classeshonors aps his extracurricular activities are off the chart im talking a broad range of not that i said then what he barked i want to know him not his circus tricks chapter charlie slouched out of the house with the look of every other teenager pushed into doing something he despised i said lets walk why i feel like it and youre too young to have sore feet whatever we began circling the motor court he jammed spidery hands into his pockets stared at the ground you know what your dad wants emphasis on your dad as opposed to what i want thats why im talking to you hes utterly obsessed with you with me getting into some weenie emporium he said you chose yale thats like saying i hate cheese and someone says your choice is gruyere or cheddar you couldnt care less no he said if i said that id be just another phony cretin sure i care ive been conditioned to care two steps sometimes i think about going to junior college just to show them how stupid the whole thing is that would be something i said whered you go to school the u no pressure from your parents the ivies werent in my universe i was just glad to get the hell away from missouri whats wrong with missouri absolutely nothing he stared at me oh anyway dont feel you have to do anything that contradicts your principles writing a letter for you doesnt i said on the contrary you dont even know me i know enough whateverif i say dont write it you wont not a comma he doesnt take well to being told no ive told him no before brown eyes widened in what context i said hes been bugging me for years to give up my practice and work for the department keeps tossing more money and better titles my way yeah thats his style so what you shine him on because you dont like him i could deal with him charlie but the money still sucks and always will and more important i prize my independence you can relate to that his look turned sour dont patronize me i said dont get all sensitive im stating a fact no need for me to kiss your ass the followup look saucereyed and confused said who is this space alien we walked a bit more before he said its utterly absurd his thinking i deserve a prize i just did what was necessary were you and marty friends i dont have any friends he said neither did he at prep common enemys as good a reason as any for rapport first smile of the day true he used to sit by himself a couple of times i went over and talked to him he was polite but didnt have much to say after he hurt his shoulder he wasnt much for any kind of sociability i could see he wanted to be alone so i stayed away but then i heard some of their clique trashtalking about marty killing ms f i knew i had to do something planting lies is so typical they live to deceive t and q i said they take no responsibility and the system feeds their narcissism finding scapegoats finding and tossing them over cliffs thats the original concept of scapegoat i mean its from the old testament used to be literal when the community deteriorated to utter corruption they picked two goats one was designated godly the other was the azazel and they tossed it over to atone for everyones sins huffing as if they teach bible at prep oh sure he snickered between agonizing analysis of malcolm x and catcher in the rye there isnt much time left for ancient texts no ive been known to read on my own even when i should be studying for the sat i said you like the old testament old new the prophets the gospels the quran the bhagavad gita the truth is all religions promote kindness as well as incredible brutality i said so t and qs clique had pinned ms freeman on martin think they believed it who knows are they even capable of belief they talked about it openly no way he said but one time i was being my usual asocial loser self and walking near the back of the campusright at the back theres a dense kind of foresty area where no one goes which is precisely why i do i need peace and quiet so i can read what i want to cut myself off from all theanyway i was back there reading job actually and for the first time i heard someone else it was t smoking weed then q joined him and he lit up i said great there goes my last refuge i thought of leaving but didnt want them to see myi just didnt want to deal with them so i stayed i was behind some thick bushes its a place i always go just me and the beetles once in a while theres a squirrel they had no idea i had no interest whatsoever in anything they had to say but they were close by and talking loud enough for me to hear then some of their clique joined them and they all started talking about it ms freeman yes no one was exactly grieving mostly because theyre superficial but in ts case and qs there was anger ding dong the bitch is dead that kind of thing then t started going off on marty blaming him for it saying he was going to call in an anonymous tip to the police and name marty everyone thought that was a great idea then everyone lit up and the air started stinking of weed and i wanted out of there but i waited until they were gone then took out my cell and texted garret and he called his grandfather and he called the mendozas they decided they needed to keep marty safe until it became clear if those threats were real mrs mendoza packed up a suitcase and drove marty to garrets you texted garret first because you and he are friends i already told you the concept of friendship is alien to me i knew him from surfing he surfs at county line and i do too because the waves are usually good and i can just drive over the canyon from here second smile of the day bet you didnt see me as a surfer i cant play ball worth shit and i spaz out in basketball but on a board my balance is pretty good youre full of surprises charlie going to put that in your letter am i writing a letter far as im concerned theres no need the entire process is utterly absurd not to mention corrupt and despicable look where it led bad people can turn anything rotten the systems rotten he said the haves keep getting more the havenots keep getting ripped off dont think im a socialist or an anarchistany kind of ist those systems inevitably sink into corruption as well i just work at seeing things the way they are we walked some more i said what made you decide t and q might be guilty themselves my longterm analysis of their personalities plus the angerrage reallythat i heard in their voices when they were discussing ms freeman it all made sense when you knew about the sat scam did everyone at prep know i cant speak for everyone but anyone with a brain in their head had to know t getting a q pulling thats about as likely as me dating a supermodel so you suspected them but didnt want to go to your father hes the last person id go to all hed care about is how it impacted my application instead you called in those anonymous tips silence that was cowardly wasnt it the first one was kind of abstract charlie three dates abstract as in useless he said no one figured it out we did i said and it led to everything else that followed your spelling it out on the second tip was a nice boost we couldnt hide marty forever and no one was getting anywhere i knew id been too oblique the first time howd you know it was me the second time you phoned lieutenant sturgiss cell directly only insiders have that as in your dad more important that phone registers caller id he slapped his forehead oh brilliant put that in the letter charlie has trouble with basic logic if you feel like flogging yourself thats fine but the truth is you did the right thing and you were the only one at prep who did big deal it was too little too late he rotated a finger whoopeedoo okay i said good luck thats it unless theres something else you want to say no i guess not are you going to write the letter if you want me to can i think about that whens the application deadline couple of weeks give me a day or twos notice okay shooting out a spindly dry hand sorry if im being a butt things are just weird and all the merest hint of shrinktalk would necessitate teenage sarcasm i said youll get over it chapter one week later i received an email posted at two am dr delaware its me you probably wont see this until tomorrow if you still think its appropriate you can do it either way its okay thanks in late december i received a followup also sent during the earlymorning hours dr delaware its me due to profound and alarming lack of judgment on the part of the yale admissions committee i got in im
