axis robert charles wilson it is necessary that things should pass away into that from which they are born for things must pay one another the penalty and compensation for their injustice according to the ordinance of time anaximander part one the th of august chapter one in the summer of his twelfth yearthe summer the stars began to fall from the skythe boy isaac discovered that he could tell east from west with his eyes closed isaac lived at the edge of the great inland desert on the continent of equatoria on the planet that had been appended to the earth by the inscrutable beings called the hypotheticals people had given the planet a whole panoply of grandiose or mythological or coolly scientific names but most simply called it the new world in any of a hundred or more languages or equatoria after its most widely settled continent these were things isaac had learned in what passed for school he lived in a compound of brick and adobe far from the nearest town he was the only child at the settlement the adults with whom he lived preferred to keep a careful distance between themselves and the rest of the world they were special in ways they were reluctant to discuss isaac too was special they had told him so many times but he wasnt sure he believed them he didnt feel special often he felt much less than special occasionally the adults especially dr dvali or mrs rebka asked isaac whether he was lonely he wasnt he had books he had the video library to fill his time he was a student and he learned at his own pacesteadily if not quickly in this isaac suspected he was a disappointment to his keepers but the books and videos and lessons filled his time and when they were unavailable there was the natural world around him which had become a kind of mute indifferent friend the mountains gray and green and brown sloping down to this arid plain the edge of the desert hinterland a curdled landscape of rock and sand few things grew here since the rain came only in the first months of spring and sparsely even then in the dry washes there were lumpish plants with prosaic names barrel cucumbers leather vines in the courtyard of the compound a native garden had been planted cactus feathery with purple flowers tall nevergreens with weblike blossoms that extracted moisture from the air sometimes a man named raj irrigated the garden from a pump that ran deep into the earth and on those mornings the air smelled of mineralrich water a steely scent that carried for kilometers on watering day rock shrews would burrow under the fence and tumble comically across the tiled courtyard isaacs days passed in gentle sameness early in the summer of his twelfth year as his days had always passed but that sleepy peace came to an end the day the old woman arrived she came remarkably on foot isaac had left the compound that afternoon and climbed a small distance up the foothills to a granite shelf that jutted from the slope of a ridge like a ships prow from a pebbly sea the afternoon sun had warmed the rock to a fine fierce heat isaac with his widebrimmed hat and white cotton shirt to protect him from the burning light sat under the lip of the ridge where there was still shade watching the horizon the desert rippled in rising waves of furnace air he was alone and motionlessafloat in heat a castaway on a sere raft of stonewhen the woman appeared at first she was just a dot down the unpaved road that led from the distant towns where isaacs keepers went to buy food and supplies she moved slowly or seemed to nearly an hour passed before he could identify her as a womanthen an old womanthen an old woman with a pack on her back a bowlegged posture and a dogged determined stride she wore a white robe and a white sun hat the road passed close to this rock almost directly beneath it and isaac who didnt want to be seen though he could not say why scooted behind a boulder and crouched there as she approached he closed his eyes and imagined he felt the bulk and weight of the land beneath him the old womans two feet tickling the skin of the desert like a beetle on the body of a slumbering giant and he felt another presence deep in that earth a quiescent behemoth stirring in its long sleep far to the west the old woman paused beneath the shelf of rock as if she could see him in his hiding place isaac was aware of the break in the rhythm of her shuffling steps or maybe she had innocently paused to sip water from a canteen she said nothing isaac held himself very still something he was good at then her steps resumed she walked on leaving the road where a trail bent toward the compound isaac lifted his head and looked after her she was many meters away now the long light of the afternoon drawing her shadow alongside her like a leggy caricature as soon as he saw her she paused and turned back and for a moment it seemed as if their eyes met and isaac hastily ducked away uncertain whether he had been seen he was startled by the accuracy of her gaze and he remained hidden for a long time until the sunlight angled deep into the mountain passes he hid even from himself quiet as a fish in a pool of memory and thought the old woman reached the compounds gates and went inside and stayed there before the sky grew wholly dark isaac followed her he wondered if he would be introduced to the woman perhaps at dinner very few outsiders came to the compound of those who came most came to stay after isaac had bathed and put on clean clothes he went to the dining room this was where the entire community all thirty of the adults gathered every evening morning and afternoon meals were impromptu could be taken at any time as long as you were willing to do your own work in the kitchen but dinner was a collective effort always crowded inevitably noisy usually isaac enjoyed hearing the adults talk among themselves though he seldom understood what they said unless it was trivial whose turn it was to go to town for provisions how a roof might be repaired or a well improved more often since the adults were mainly scientists and theoreticians their talk turned to abstract matters listening isaac had retained few of the details of their work but something of its general content there was always talk of time and stars and the hypotheticals of technology and biology of evolution and transformation although these conversations usually pivoted on words he couldnt understand they had a fine and lofty sound about them the debateswere the hypotheticals properly called beings conscious entities or were they some vast and mindless processoften grew heated philosophies defended and attacked like military objectives it was as if in some nearby but inaccessible room the universe itself was being taken apart and reassembled tonight the murmur was subdued there was a newcomer present the old woman from the road isaac bashfully taking a seat between dr dvali and mrs rebka cast furtive glances at her she did not return them in fact she seemed indifferent to his presence at the table when the opportunity arose isaac studied her face she was even older than he had guessed her skin was dark and skeined with wrinkles her eyes bright and liquid peered out from skully chambers she held her knife and fork in long fragile fingers her palms were pale she had changed out of her desert garb into clothing more like what the other adults wore jeans and a pale yellow cotton shirt her hair was thin and cut close to the scalp she wore no rings or necklaces in the crook of one elbow was a patch of cotton held down with surgical tape mrs rebka the community physician must already have taken a blood sample from her but that happened to every newcomer isaac wondered if mrs rebka had had a hard time finding a vein in that small sinewy arm he wondered what the blood test had been meant to detect and whether mrs rebka had found what she was looking for no special attention was paid to the newcomer at dinner she joined in conversation but the talk remained superficial as if no one wanted to give away any secrets before the stranger was fully approved absorbed understood it was not until the dishes had been cleared and several pots of coffee placed on the long table that dr dvali introduced isaac to her isaac he began and the boy gazed at the tabletop uncomfortably this is sulean moishes come a long way to meet you a long way what did that mean andto meet him hello isaac the newcomer said her voice was not the harsh croak he had expected in fact her voice was mellifluous despite a certain grit and in some way he could not pin down familiar hello he said still avoiding her eyes please call me sulean she said he nodded cautiously i hope well be friends she said he did not of course tell her immediately about his newfound ability to distinguish the points of the compass with his eyes closed he hadnt told anyone about that not even stern dr dvali or the more sympathetic mrs rebka he was afraid of the scrutiny it would bring sulean moi who moved into the compound made a point of visiting him every morning after classes and before lunch at first isaac dreaded these visits he was shy and not a little frightened of suleans great age and apparent frailty but she was steadily courteously friendly she respected his silences and the questions she asked were seldom awkward or intrusive do you like your room she asked one day because he preferred to be alone he had been given this room to himself a small but uncluttered chamber on the second story of the easternmost wing of the largest house there was a window overlooking the desert and isaac had put his desk and chair in front of that window his bed against the farther wall he liked to keep the shutters open at night to let the dry wind touch the bedsheets his skin he liked the smell of the desert i grew up in a desert sulean told him a slant of sunlight through the window illuminated her left side one arm and the parchment of her cheek and ear her voice was almost a whisper this desert no not this one but one not very different why did you leave she smiled i had places to go or at least i thought i did and this is where you came ultimately yes because he liked her and because he could not help being aware of what was unspoken between them isaac said i dont have anything to give you i dont expect anything she said the others do do they dr dvali and the rest they used to ask me a lot of questionshow i felt and what ideas i had and what things in books meant but they didnt like my answers eventually they had stopped asking just as they had stopped giving him blood tests psychological tests perception tests im perfectly satisfied with you the way you are the old woman said he wanted to believe her but she was new she had walked through the desert with the nonchalance of an insect on a sunny rock her purposes were vague and isaac was still reluctant to share his most troublesome secrets all the adults were his teachers though some were more patient or attentive than others mrs rebka taught him basic biology ms fischer taught him the geography of earth and the new world mr nowotny told him about the sky and the stars and the relationship of suns and planets dr dvali taught him physics inclined planes the inverse square electromagnetism isaac remembered his astonishment the first time he saw a magnet lift a spoon from a tabletop an entire planet pulling downward and what was this bit of stone in its power to reverse that universal flow he had only begun to make sense of dr dvalis answers last year dr dvali had shown him a compass the planet too was a magnet dr dvali said it had a rotating iron core hence lines of force a shield against charged particles arriving from the sun a polarity that distinguished north from south isaac had asked to borrow the compass a hefty military model made on earth and dr dvali had generously allowed him to keep it late in the evening alone in his room isaac placed the compass on his desk so that the red point of the needle aligned with the letter n then he closed his eyes and spun himself around stopped and waited for his dizziness to subside eyes still closed he felt what the world told him intuited his place in it found the direction that eased some inner tension then he put out his right hand and opened his eyes to see which way he was pointing he found out a lot of things mostly irrelevant he performed the experiment on three successive nights each night he discovered himself aligned almost perfectly with the w on the face of the compass then he did it again and again and again it was shortly before the annual meteor shower that he resolved at last to share this unsettling discovery with sulean moi the meteor shower came at the end of every augustthis year on the th months in the new world were named after terrestrial months though each one lasted a few days longer than its namesake on the eastern coast of equatoria august signalled the beginning of the end of the mild summer boats left the rich northern fisheries with their last harvests in order to arrive back at port magellan before the autumn storms began here in the desert it signified little more than the steady subtle cooling of the nights desert seasons were nocturnal it seemed to isaac the days were mostly alike but winter nights could be bitingly painfully cold slowly isaac had allowed sulean moi to become his friend it wasnt that they talked much or about anything especially important sulean seemed almost as wordless as isaac often was but she accompanied him on his walks through the hills and she was more agile than seemed possible for her age she was slow but she could climb as well as isaac and she could sit motionless for an hour or more when isaac did she never gave him the impression that this was a duty or a strategy or anything more or less than her way of sharing certain pleasures he had always suspected were his alone sulean must not have seen the annual meteor shower before since she told isaac she had arrived in equatoria only months ago isaac was a fan of the event and declared that she ought to see it from a good vantage point sowith the uneasy permission of dr dvali who didnt seem to entirely approve of sulean moion the evening of the th he escorted her to the flat rock in the hills the rock from which he had first seen her appear on the sunquivering horizon that had been daylight but now it was dark the new worlds moon was smaller and faster than earths and it had traversed the sky completely by the time sulean and isaac arrived at their destination both carried hand lanterns to light their way and both wore high boots and thick leggings to protect them from the sandfish that often basked on these granite ledges while the stone was still breathing out the heat of the day isaac scanned the location carefully and found no wildlife present he sat crosslegged on the stone sulean bent slowly but without complaint into the same posture her face was serene calmly expectant they turned off their lanterns and allowed the darkness to swallow them up the desert was blacker than the sky the sky was salted with stars no one had officially named these stars though astronomers had given them catalog numbers the stars were as dense in the heavens as swarming insects each star was a sun isaac knew and many of them cast their light on inaccessible unknowable landscapesperhaps on deserts like this one things lived among the stars he knew things that lived vast slow cold lives in which the passage of a century was no more than the blink of a distant eye i know why you came here isaac said he couldnt see the old womans face in this darkness which made the conversation easier eased the embarrassing clumsiness of words like bricks in his mouth do you to study me no not to study you isaac im more a student of the sky than i am of you in particular like the others at the compound she was interested in the hypotheticalthe unseen beings who had rearranged the heavens and the earth you came because of what i am she cocked her head and said well yes that he began to tell her about his sense of direction he spoke haltingly at first and more confidently when she listened without questioning him he tried to anticipate the questions she might want to ask when had he first noticed this special talent he couldnt remember only that it had been this year a few months ago just a glimmering at first for instance he had liked to work in the compounds library because his desk there faced the same direction as the desk in his room though there was no window to look through in the dining room he always sat at the side of the table nearest the door even when there was no one else present he had moved his bed so that he could sleep more comfortably aligned withwith well what but he couldnt say everywhere he went always when he stood still there was a direction he preferred to face this was not a compulsion only a gentle urge easily ignored there was a good way to face and a less good way to face and are you facing the good way now sulean asked in fact he was he hadnt been aware of it before she asked but he was comfortable on this rock looking away from the mountains into the lightless hinterland west sulean said you like to face west a little north of west there the secret was out there was nothing more to say and he heard sulean moi adjust her posture in the silence adapting to the pressure of the rock he wondered if it was painful or uncomfortable to be so old and to sit on solid stone if so she gave no indication of it she looked up at the sky you were right about the falling stars she said after a long time theyre quite lovely the meteor shower had begun isaac was fascinated by it dr dvali had told him about meteors which were not really stars at all but burning fragments of rock or dust the remains of ancient comets circling for millennia around the new worlds sun but that explanation had only added to isaacs fascination he sensed in these evanescent lights the enacting of ancient geometries vectors set in motion long before the planet was formed or before it had been constructed by the hypotheticals rhythms elaborated over a lifetime or several lifetimes or even the lifetime of a species sparks flew across the zenith east to west while isaac listened inwardly to the murmurings of the night he was content that way until sulean suddenly stood and peered back toward the mountains and said lookwhats that it looks like something falling like luminous rainfall as if a storm had come down through the high passes of the divideas they sometimes did but this glow wasnt lightning it was diffuse persistent she said is that normal no isaac said no it wasnt normal at all then perhaps we ought to go back isaac nodded uneasily he wasnt afraid of the approachingwell storm if thats what it wasbut it carried a significance he couldnt explain to sulean a relationship to the silent presence that lived under the rub alkhali the empty quarter of the far west and to which his private compass was attuned they walked back to the compound at a brisk pace not quite running because isaac wasnt sure that someone as fragileseeming as sulean could run while the mountain peaks to the east were first revealed and then obscured by fresh waves of this peculiar cloudy light by the time they reached the gate the meteor shower was entirely hidden by this new phenomenon a sort of dust had begun to fall from the sky and isaacs lantern carved out an increasingly smaller swath of visibility isaac thought this falling substance might be snowhe had seen snow in videosbut sulean said no it wasnt snow at all it was more like ash the smell of it was rank sulfurous like dead stars isaac thought falling mrs rebka was waiting at the compounds main door and she pulled isaac inside with a grip so intense it was painful he gave her a shocked reproving look mrs rebka had never hurt him before none of the adults had hurt him she ignored his expression and held him possessively told him she had been afraid he would be lost in this this words failed her in the common room dr dvali was listening to an audio feed from port magellan the great city on the eastern coast of equatoria the signal was relayed across the mountains by aerostats and was intermittent dr dvali told the gathered adults but he had learned that the port was experiencing the same phenomenon a blanketing fall of something like ash and that there was no immediate explanation some people in the city had begun to panic then the broadcast or the aerostat relaying the signal failed entirely isaac at mrs rebkas urging went to his room while the adults talked he didnt sleep couldnt imagine sleeping instead he sat at the window where there was nothing to see but a tunneled grayness where the overhead light bled into the ashfall and he listened to the sound of nothing at alla silence that nevertheless seemed to speak to him a silence steeped in meaning chapter two lise adams drove toward the little rural airstrip on the afternoon of the th of august feeling lost feeling free it was a feeling she couldnt explain even to herself maybe the weather she thought late august along the coast of equatoria was inevitably warm often unbearable but today the breeze from the sea was gentle and the sky was that indigo blue she had come to associate with the new world deeper and truer than the smudgy pastel skies of earth but the weather had been fine for weeks nice but not all that remarkable free she thought yes absolutely a marriage behind her the decree nisi freshlyissued an unwise thing undone and ahead of her the man who had been a factor in that undoing but so much more than that a future severed from her past a painful question hovering on the brink of an answer and lost almost literally she had only come out this way a couple of times before south of port magellan where she had rented an apartment the coast flattened into an alluvial plain that had been given over to farms and light industry much of it was still wild a sort of rolling prairie grown over with feathery grasses meadows that broke like waves against the peaks of the coastal range before long she began to see small aircraft coming and going from arundjis airfield which was her destination these were little prop planes bush planes the runways at arundjis werent long enough for anything big the planes that alighted there were either rich mens hobbies or poor mens businesses if you wanted to rent a hangar join a tourist excursion into the glacial passes or get to bone creek or kubelicks grave in a hurry you came to arundjis and if you were smart you talked to turk findley who flew discount charters for a living before you did any of those things lise had flown with turk once before but she wasnt here to hire a pilot turks name had come up in connection with the photograph lise carried in a brown envelope currently tucked into the glove compartment of her car she parked in the gravel lot at arundjis climbed out of the car and stood listening to the sound of insects buzzing in the afternoon heat then she walked through the door at the back of the cavernous tinroofed shedit looked like a converted cow barnthat served as arundjis passenger terminal turks charter business operated out of a corner of this building with the consent of mike arundji the airfields owner who took a share of turks profits in return turk had told her this back when they had had time to talk there was no security barrier to pass through turk findley worked out of a threesided cubicle tucked into the north end of the building and she simply walked into it and cleared her throat in lieu of knocking he was behind his desk filling out what looked like un provisional government papersshe could see the blue logo at the top of the page he inked his signature a final time and looked up lise his grin was genuine and disarming no recrimination no whydidntyoureturnmycalls she said uh are you busy do i look busy looks like you have work to do anyhow she was fairly certain he would be willing to put aside anything nonessential for a chance to see her a chance she hadnt offered him in a long time he came around the desk and hugged her chastely but sincerely she was briefly flustered by the smell of him in close proximity turk was thirtyfive years old eight years older than lise and a foot taller she tried not to let that be intimidating paperwork he said give me an excuse to ignore it please well she said at least tell me if its business or pleasure business he nodded okay sure name a destination no i meanmy business not your business theres something id like to talk to you about if youre willing maybe over dinner my treat id be happy to go to dinner but its on me i cant imagine how i can help you write your book she was pleased that he remembered what she had told him about her book even though there was no book an aircraft taxied up to a hangar some yards away and the noise came through the thin walls of turks office as if through an open door lise looked at the ceramic cup on turks desk and saw the oily surface of what must have been hoursold coffee break into concentric ripples when the roar faded she said actually you can help a lot especially if we can go somewhere quieter sure thing ill leave my keys with paul just like that she never ceased to marvel at the way people on the frontier did business youre not afraid of missing a customer customer can leave a message ill get back sooner or later anyhow its been slow this week you came at the right time what do you say to harleys harleys was one of the more upscale americanstyle restaurants in the port you cant afford harleys business expense i have a question for you come to think of it call it quid pro quo whatever that meant all she could say was okay dinner at harleys was both more and less than she had expected she had driven out to arundjis on the assumption that a personal appearance would be more meaningful than a phone call after the time that had elapsed since their last conversation a sort of unspoken apology but if he resented the gap in their relationship and it wasnt even a relationship anymore perhaps not even a friendship he showed no sign of it she reminded herself to focus on the work on the real reason she was here the unexplained loss that had opened a chasm in her life twelve years ago turk had a car of his own at the airfield so they arranged to meet at the restaurant in three hours about dusk traffic permitting prosperity in port magellan had meant more cars and not just the little south asian utility vehicles or scooters everyone used to drive traffic was thick through the docklandsshe was sandwiched between a pair of eighteenwheelers much of the waybut she made it to the restaurant on time the parking lot at harleys was crowded unusually for a wednesday night the food here was reasonably good but what people paid a premium for was the view the restaurant occupied a hilltop overlooking port magellan the port had been established for obvious reasons on what was the largest natural harbor on the coast close to the arch that joined this planet to earth but its easy lowlands had been overbuilt and the city had expanded up the terraced hillsides much of it had been constructed hastily without reference to whatever building codes the provisional government was attempting to enforce harleys all native wood and glass panels was an exception she left her name and waited in the bar for half an hour until turks elderly car chugged into the lot she watched through the window as he locked the vehicle and strode toward the entrance through a deepening dusk he was clearly not as welldressed as the average customer at harleys but the staff recognized and welcomed him he often met clients here lise knew and as soon as he joined her the waiter escorted them to a ushaped booth with a window view all the other window tables were occupied popular place she said tonight yeah he said and when lise stared at him blankly he added the meteor shower oh right she had forgotten lise had been in port magellan less than eleven months local time which meant she had missed last years meteor shower she knew it was a big deal that a kind of informal mardi gras had evolved around the occasion and she remembered the event from the part of her childhood she had spent herea spectacular celestial display that happened with clockwork regularity a perfect excuse for a party but the shower didnt peak until the third night tonight was just the beginning but were at the right place to see it start turk said in a couple of hours when its full dark theyll turn down the lights and open those big patio doors so everybody gets an unobstructed view the sky was a radiant indigo clear as glacial water no sign of meteors yet and the city was arrayed below the restaurant in a gracefully concealing sunset glow she could see the fires flaring from the refinery stacks in the industrial sector the silhouettes of mosques and churches the illuminated billboards along the rue de madagascar advertising hindi movies herbal toothpaste in farsi and chain hotels cruise ships in the harbor began to light up for the night it was if you squinted and thought nice thoughts pretty she might once have said exotic but it no longer struck her that way she asked turk how his business was doing he shrugged i pay the rent i fly i meet people theres not much more to it than that lise i dont have a mission in life unlike you he seemed to imply which led directly to the reason she had gotten in touch with him she was reaching for her bag when the waiter showed up with ice water she had barely glanced at the menu but she ordered paella made with local seafood and seasoned with imported saffron turk asked for a steak mediumwell until fifteen years ago the most common terrestrial animal on equatoria had been the water buffalo now you could buy fresh beef the waiter sauntered away and turk said you could have called you know since the last time they had been togethersince her expedition into the mountains and a few uneasy arranged meetings afterwardhe had phoned her a few times lise had returned his calls eagerly at first then perfunctorily then when the guilt set in not at all i know and im sorry but the last couple of months have been busy for me i mean today you didnt have to drive all the way out to arundjis just to make a date for dinner you could have called i thought if i called it might be too you know impersonal he said nothing she added more honestly i guess i wanted to see you first make sure things were still okay different rules out there in the wilderness i know that lise there are home things and there are away things i figured we must have been an away thing well i figured thats how you wanted it theres a difference between what you want and whats practical tell me about it he smiled ruefully how are things with you and brian over really officially finally and that book youre working on its the research thats slow not the writing she hadnt written a word never would write a word but its why you decided to stay in the new world he meant she nodded and what happens when youre done you go back to the states possibly its funny he said people come to the port for all kinds of reasons some of them find reasons to stay some dont i think people just cross a certain line you get off the boat for the first time and you realize youre literally on another planetthe air smells different the water tastes different the moons the wrong size and it rises too fast the days still divided into twelve hours but the hours run long after a few weeks or a few months people get disoriented on some deep level so they turn around and go home or else it snaps into place and starts to feel normal thats when they have second thoughts about going back to the anthill cities and bad air and septic oceans and all that stuff they used to take for granted is that why youre here in part i guess he said sure their meals arrived and they ate and talked about nothing in particular for a while the sky darkened the city glittered the waiter came back to clear the table turk ordered coffee lise summoned her courage and said will you look at a photograph for me before they dim the lights sure what kind of photograph a picture of someone who might have chartered a flight with you this would have been a few months ago youve been looking at my passenger manifests no i mean not me you file manifests with the pg right whats this about lise theres a lot i cant explain right now will you look at the picture first he was frowning show me lise took her bag into her lap and withdrew the envelope but you said you had a favor to ask too you first she passed the envelope across the linen tablecloth he pulled out the picture his expression didnt change finally he said i assume theres a story goes with this it was taken by a security camera at the docks late last year the image has been enlarged and enhanced you have access to security camera downloads too no but so you got these from someone else one of your friends at the consulate brian or one of his buddies i cant go into that can you at least tell me why youre curious about he gestured at the image an old lady you know ive been trying to interview people who were connected with my father shes one of them ideally id like to make contact with her any particular reason i mean why this woman well i cant go into that the conclusion im drawing here is that all roads lead back to brian whats his interest in this woman brian works for the department of genomic security i dont but someone there is doing you favors turk i no never mind dont ask dont tell right obviously somebody knows i flew with this person which means somebody besides yourself would like to find her thats a reasonable inference but im not asking you on behalf of anyone else what you choose to say or not say to anyone at the consulate is your own business what you say to me stays with me he looked at her as if he were evaluating this statement but lise thought why should he trust her what had she ever done to instill trust in him besides sleep with him during the course of one exceptional weekend yeah he said finally i flew with her okay can you tell me anything about her where she is what she talked about he sat back in his chair true to his prediction the lights in the restaurant began to dim a couple of waiters rolled back the glass wall that separated the indoor dining room from the patio the sky was starry and deep slightly washed out by the lights of the port but still crisper than any sky lise had known back in california had the meteor shower begun she saw what looked like a few bright flashes across the meridian turk hadnt spared it a glance ill have to think about this im not asking you to violate any confidences just i know what youre asking and its probably not unreasonable but id like to think it over if thats okay with you all right she couldnt push it any farther but you mentioned a quid pro quo just something im curious abouti thought you might have picked up a word or two from one of those sources you dont like to discuss arundji got a memo this morning from the air regs department of the provisional government i filed a flight plan for the far west and all else being equal i probably would have been in the air by the time you drove up this afternoon but they disallowed the flight so i called around to find out whats happening seems like nobodys being allowed to fly into the rub alkhali how come they wont say this flight ban is it temporary also a question i cant get an answer to who imposed it under what authorization nobody at the pg will own up to anything ive been shuffled between a dozen departments and so has every other pilot whos affected by this im not saying theres anything sinister about it but its kinda surprising why turn the western half of the continent into a nofly zone there are still regular flights to and from the oil allotments and past that theres nothing but rocks and sand hikers and wilderness types go therethats who had my charter i dont understand it lise desperately wished she had a factoid or two to barter with but this was the first shed heard of the flight ban it was true she had contacts at the us consulate her exhusband chief among them but the americans were only advisory members of the provisional government and brian wasnt even a diplomat just a dgs functionary all i can do is ask she said appreciate it if you would so business attended to at least for now for now she said reluctantly then what do you say we take our coffee out on the patio while we can still find a table three months ago she had hired turk to fly her across the mohindar range to a pipeline outpost called kubelicks grave strictly a business arrangement she had been trying to track down an old colleague of her fathers a man named dvali but she never reached kubelicks grave a squall had forced the plane down in one of the high mountain passes turk had landed his aircraft on a nameless lake while clouds like cannon smoke billowed between granite peaks north and south of them he had moored the plane on a pebbly beach and set up a surprisingly comfortable camp under a stand of trees that looked to lise like bulbous mutant pines the wind had whistled down that pass for three days while visibility declined to nothing set foot outside the canvas tent and youd be lost within a couple of meters but turk was a passable woodsman and had packed for emergencies and even canned food was delicious when you were barricaded against nature and equipped with a camp stove and a hurricane lantern under other circumstances it might have been a threeday endurance contest but turk turned out to be good company she had not meant to seduce him and she believed he had not set out to seduce her the attraction had been sudden and mutual and utterly explicable they had exchanged stories and warmed each other when the wind turned cold at the time it had seemed to lise that she would be happy to wrap turk findley around herself like a blanket and shut out the rest of the world forever and if you had asked her whether she was on the verge of something more meaningful than an unexpected tryst she might have said yes maybe she had meant to keep up the relationship when they arrived back in the port but the port had a way of subverting your best intentions problems that had seemed featherweight from the inside of a tent in the mohindar range regained their customary mass and inertia her separation from brian was an established fact by that time at least in her mind though brian was still liable to spasms of letsworkitout well meant she supposed but humiliating for both of them she had told him about turk and while that stonewalled brians attempts at reconciliation it introduced a whole new vector of guilt she began to suspect herself of using turk as a levera sort of emotional crowbar against brians attempts to rekindle a dead fire so after a few uneasy meetings she had let the relationship lapse better not to complicate what was already a complicated situation but now there was a decree nisi in the glove compartment of her car her future was a blank page and she was tempted to write on it the crowd on the patio began to react to the meteor shower she looked up as three scaldinglybright white lines scribed across the meridian the meteors emanated from a point well above the horizon and almost directly due east and before she could look away there were more of themtwo then one then a spectacular cluster of five she was reminded of a summer in idaho when she had gone stargazing with her fathershe couldnt have been more than ten years old her father had grown up before the spin and he had talked to her about the stars the way they used to be before the hypotheticals dragged the earth a few billion years down the river of time he missed the old constellations he said the old star names but there had been meteors that night dozens of them the largest intercepted by the invisible barrier that protected the earth from the swollen sun the smallest incinerated in the atmosphere she had watched them arc across the heavens with a speed and brilliance that left her breathless as now the fireworks of god wow she said lamely turk pulled his chair around to her side of the table so they were both facing the sea he didnt make any kind of an overt move and she guessed he probably wouldnt navigating the high mountain passes must have been simple compared to this she didnt make any moves either was careful not to but she couldnt help feeling the heat of his body inches from hers she sipped her coffee without tasting it there was another flurry of falling stars she wondered aloud whether any of them ever reached the ground its just dust turk said or thats what the astronomers say whats left of some old comet but something new had caught her attention so what about that she asked pointing east lower on the horizon where the dark sky met the darker sea it looked to lise like something was actually falling out therenot meteors but bright dots that hung in the air like flares or what she imagined flares would look like the reflected light of them colored the ocean a streaky orange she didnt remember anything like that from her previous time in equatoria is that part of it turk stood up so did a few others among the crowd on the patio a puzzled hush displaced the talk and laughter here and there phones began to buzz or chatter no turk said thats not part of it chapter three it was like nothing turk had seen during his ten years in the new world but in a way that was exactly typical the new world had a habit of reminding you it wasnt earth things happened differently here it aint kansas as people liked to say and they probably said the same thing in a dozen different languages it aint the steppes it aint kandahar it aint mombassa do you think its dangerous lise asked some of the restaurants clientele evidently thought so they settled their bills with barelydisguised haste and made for their cars within a few minutes there were only a few stalwarts left on the broad wooden patio you want to leave turk asked not if you dont i guess were as safe here as anywhere turk said and the view is better the phenomenon was still hanging out at sea though it seemed to move steadily closer what it looked like was luminous rain a rolling gray cloud shot with lightthe way a thunderstorm looked when you saw it from a long way off except that the glow wasnt fitful like lightning but seemed to hang below the billowing darkness and illuminate it from beneath turk had seen storms roll in from sea often enough and he estimated that this one was approaching at roughly the local wind speed the brightness falling from it appeared to be composed of discrete luminous or burning particles maybe as dense as snow but he could be wrong about thatit didnt snow in this part of equatoria and the last snow he had seen was off the coast of maine many years back his first concern was fire port magellan was a tinderbox crowded with subcode housing and shacks the docklands housed countless storage and transport facilities and the bay was thick with oil and lng tankers funneling fuel to the insatiable earth what looked like a dense squall of lit matches was blowing in from the east and he didnt want to think about the potential consequences of that he said nothing to lise he imagined she had drawn many of the same conclusions but she didnt suggest runningwas smart enough he guessed to know there was no logical place to run to not at the speed this thing was coming but she tensed up as the phenomenon visibly approached the point of land at the southern extremity of the bay its not bright all the way down she said the staff at harleys started dragging in tables from the patio as if that was going to protect anything from anything and urged the remaining diners to stay indoors until someone had some idea what was going on but the waiters knew turk well enough to let him alone so he stayed out a while longer with lise and they watched the light of the flares or whatever they were dancing on the distant sea not bright all the way down he saw what she meant the shifting glittering curtains tailed into darkness well before they reached the surface of the ocean burned out maybe that was a hopeful sign lise took out her phone and punched up a local news broadcast relaying bits of it to turk they were talking about a storm she said or what looked on radar like a storm the fringes of it extending north and south for hundreds of miles the heart of it more or less centered on the port and now the bright rain fell over the headlands and the inner harbor illuminating the decks and superstructures of cruise ships and cargo vessels at anchor then the silhouettes of the cargo cranes grew misty and obscure the tall hotels in the city dimmed in the distance the souks and markets vanished as the shining rain moved up the hillsides and seemed to grow taller as it came a canyon wall of murky light but nothing burst into flame that was good turk thought then he thought but it could be toxic it could be any fucking thing about time to move indoors he said tyrell the headwaiter at harleys was a guy turk had briefly worked with on the pipelines out in the rub alkhali they werent big buddies or anything but they were friendly and tyrell looked relieved when turk and lise finally abandoned the patio tyrell slid the glass doors shut and said you got any idea no turk said i dont know whether to run or just enjoy the show i called my wife we live down in the flats a lowrent neighborhood some few miles along the coast she says its happening there too she says theres stuff falling on the house it looks like ash but nothings burning she said not it could be volcanic ash lise said and turk had to admire how she was handling all this she was tense but not visibly afraid not too scared to venture a theory it would have to have been some kind of tectonic event way out over the horizon something at sea like a sea volcano tyrell said nodding but we would have felt something before the ash got to us if it was anywhere closean earthquake a tsunami been no report of any such thing turk said far as i know ash tyrell added like gray and powdery turk asked tyrell if there was any coffee back in the kitchen and tyrell said yeah not a bad idea and went to check there were still a few diners in the restaurant people with nowhere better to go though nobody was eating or celebrating they sat at the innermost tables and talked nervously with the waitstaff the coffee came and it was good and dense and turk added cream to his cup just as if the sky werent falling lises phone buzzed repeatedly and she fended off a couple of friendly calls before shunting everything to her voice mail turk didnt get any calls though his phone was in his shirt pocket now the ash began to fall on harleys patio and turk and lise moved closer to the window to watch gray and powdery tyrells description was on the money turk had never seen volcanic ash but he imagined this was what it might look like it sifted down over the wooden slats and boards of the patio and drifted against the window glass it was like snow the color of an old wool suit but here and there were flecks of something shiny something still luminous which dimmed as he watched lise pressed up against his shoulder wideeyed he thought again of their weekend up in the mohindar range marooned by weather on that nameless lake she had been just as selfpossessed back then just as balanced braced for whatever the situation might throw at her at least he said nothings burning no but you can smell it he could now that she mentioned ita mineral smell slightly acrid a little sulfuric tyrell said you think its dangerous nothing we can do about it if it is except stay indoors lise said but turk doubted that was practical even now through the glittering ashfall he could make out traffic on rue madagascar pedestrians scurrying down the sidewalks covering their heads with jackets or handkerchiefs or newspapers unless unless what unless she said this goes on too long theres not a roof in port magellan built to bear much weight and it isnt just dust tyrell said what well look he gestured at the window absurdly impossibly something the shape of a starfish drifted past the glass it was gray but speckled with light it must have weighed nearly nothing because it floated in the weak breeze like a balloon and when it reached the deck of the patio it crumbled into powder and a few larger fragments turk gave lise a glance she shrugged incredulous get me a tablecloth turk said tyrell said what do you want with a tablecloth and one of those linen napkins you dont want to mess with the linen tyrell said managements very strict about that go get the manager then mr darnells off tonight i guess that makes me the manager then get a tablecloth tyrell i want to check this out dont mess up my place ill be careful tyrell went to undress a table lise said youre going out there just long enough to retrieve a little of whatevers coming down what if its toxic then i guess were all fucked she flinched and he added but wed probably know by now if it was cant be good for your lungs whatever it is so help me tie that napkin over my face the remaining diners and waiters watched curiously but made no effort to help turk took the tablecloth to the nearest exit to the patio and gestured to tyrell to slide open the glass door the smell immediately intensifiedit was something like wet singed animal hairand turk hurriedly spread the tablecloth on the patio floor and backed inside now what tyrell said now we let it sit a few minutes he rejoined lise and bereft of conversation they watched the dust come down for a quarter of an hour more lise asked him how he planned to get home he shrugged he lived in what was essentially a trailer a few miles downcoast from the airfield there was already a good half inch of ash on the ground and traffic was crawling im only a couple of blocks from here she said the new building on rue abbas by the territorial authority compound it ought to be fairly sturdy it was the first time she had invited him home he nodded but he was still curious he waved down tyrell who had been serving coffee to everyone still present and tyrell slid open the patio door one more time turk gripped the open tablecloth now burdened with a layer of ash and pulled it gently trying not to disturb whatever fragile structures it might have captured tyrell closed the door promptly phew stinks turk brushed off the few flakes of gray ash that clung to his shirt and hair lise joined him as he squatted to examine the debriscovered tablecloth a couple of curious diners pulled their chairs a little closer though they wrinkled their noses at the smell turk said you have a pen or a pencil on you lise rummaged in her purse and came up with a pen turk took it from her and used it to probe the layer of dust that had collected on the tablecloth whats that lise asked over his shoulder to your left looks like i dont know an acorn turk hadnt seen an acorn in years oaks didnt grow in equatoria the object in the ashfall was about the size of his thumb it was saucershaped at one end and tapered to a blunt point at the otheran acorn or maybe a tiny egg wearing a minuscule sombrero it appeared to be made of the same stuff as the fallen ash and when he touched it with the tip of the pen it dissolved as if it possessed no particular substance at all and over there lise said pointing another shaped object this one resembling a gear out of an old mechanical clock it too crumbled when he touched it tyrell went to the staff room and came back with a flashlight when he played the beam over the tablecloth at a raking angle it showed up a number of these objects if you could call them objectsthe faintly structured remains of things that appeared to have been manufactured there was a tube about a centimeter long perfectly smooth another about the same size but knobbed like a length of spine from some small animal a mouse say there was a sixpronged thorn there was a disk with miniature crumbling spokes like a bicycle wheel there was a beveled ring some of these things glinted with a faint remnant light all burned lise observed burned or otherwise decomposed but how could something so completely cremated remain even partially intact after falling from the sky what had these things been made of also present in the ashfall were a few luminous specks turk hovered his hand over one of them careful lise said its not hot its not even warm could be i dont know radioactive could be if so it was another doomsday scenario everyone outside was inhaling this stuff everyone inside soon would be none of these buildings was airtight none of them filtered its air you learning anything from this tyrell asked turk stood up and brushed his hands yeah im learning that i know even less than i thought i did he accepted lises offer of temporary shelter they borrowed spare kitchen clothing from tyrell chefs jackets to protect their clothes from the falling ash and they shuffled as fast as they could across the gray dunes in the parking lot to lises car the ash cloud had turned the sky dark obscured the meteor shower dimmed the streetlights lise drove a chinese car smaller than turks vehicle but newer and probably more reliable he shook himself off as he climbed into the shotgun seat she steered the vehicle out the back exit from the parking lot onto a narrow but less crowded avenue that connected rue de madagascar to rue abbas she maneuvered the car with a kind of cautious grace nursing it over the accumulations of dust and turk let her concentrate on her driving but as the traffic slowed she said you think this is connected with the meteor shower it seems like more than a coincidence but who knows this is definitely not volcanic ash guess not it could have come from outside the atmosphere could have i guess so it might be connected to the hypothetical during the spin people had speculated endlessly about the hypothetical the stillmysterious entities that had bounced the earth a few billion years into the galactic future and opened a gateway between the indian ocean and the new world without reaching any reliable conclusions as far as turk could tell could be but that doesnt explain anything my father used to talk about the hypothetical a lot one of the things he said was we tend to forget how much older the universe is now than it was before the spin it might have changed in ways we dont understand any textbook you pick says comets and meteors are junk falling in from the far edge of the solar systemhere or on earth or anywhere in the galaxy but that was never more than a local observation and its four billion years out of date theres a theory that the hypotheticals arent biological organisms and never were he waited while she turned a corner the cars tires fighting for traction lises father had been a college professor before he disappeared that theyre a system of selfreplicating machines living out in the cold parts of the galaxy at the fringes of planetary systems with this really slow metabolism that eats ice and generates information like those replicators we sent out during the spin right selfreplicating machines but with billions of years of evolution behind them was this how college profs talked to their daughters or was she just talking to ward off panic so what are you saying maybe whatever falls into the atmosphere this time every year isnt just comet dust maybe its she shrugged dead hypothetical he finished well it sounds inane when you put it that way its as good a theory as any i dont mean to be skeptical but we dont have any evidence that whatevers falling out of the sky is from space cogs and tubes made of ash where would it be from look at it another way people have only been on this planet for three decades we tell ourselves its all surveyed and reasonably well understood but thats bullshit it would be wrong to jump to a conclusionany conclusion even if this is caused by the hypothetical that doesnt really explain anything weve had a meteor shower every summer for thirty years and never anything like this the wipers piled dust at the margins of the windshield turk saw people on the sidewalks some of them running others sheltering in doorways faces peering anxiously from windows a provisional government police car passed them with its lights and siren on might be something unusuals happening out where we cant see it might be the celestial dog shaking off fleas too soon to say lise she nodded unhappily and pulled into the parking garage of the building where she lived a concrete tower that looked as if it had been transplanted from dade county in the underground parking shelter there was no evidence of what was going on outside only a mote or two hanging in the motionless air lise slid her security card through the elevator call slot we made it so far turk thought yeah chapter four lise found turk a robe big enough to decently fit him and told him to put his clothes in the washer in case the dust clinging to them was in any way toxic while he did that she took a turn in the shower when she rinsed her hair gray water pooled around the drain an omen she thought a portent maybe the ashfall wouldnt stop until port magellan was entombed like pompeii she stood under the shower until the water ran clear the lights flickered twice before she was done the electrical grid in port magellan was still fairly crude probably it wouldnt take much to put a local transformer out of commission she tried to imagine what would happen if this storm if you could call it that went on for another day or two or more a whole population trapped in the dark un relief ships arriving in the harbor soldiers evacuating the survivors no better not to imagine it she changed into fresh jeans and a cotton shirt and the lights were still on when she joined turk in the living room in her old flannel robe he looked deeply embarrassed but dangerously sexy those ridiculously long legs scarred in places by the life he had led before he started flying passengers over the mountains he had told her he was a merchant seaman when he arrived here that his first work in the new world had been on the saudiaramco pipeline big blunt hands wellused he gazed around in a way that made her conscious of her apartment the wide eastfacing window the video panel and her small library of books and recordings she wondered how it seemed to him a little upscale probably compared to what he called his trailer a little too backhome too obviously an imported fragment of north america though it was still new to her still slightly uninhabitedthe place she had brought her stuff after she split from brian not that he showed any sign of such thoughts he was watching the local news channel there were three daily papers in port magellan but only one news channel overseen by a bland and complexly multicultural board of advisors it broadcast in fifteen languages and was as a rule interesting in none of them but now there was something substantial to talk about a camera crew had gone out in the ashfall to get views from street level while two commentators read advisories from various departments of the provisional government turn it up lise said the big intersection at portugal and tenth was shut down stranding a busful of tourists desperate to get back to their cruise ship radio transmission had been compromised by the gunk in the atmosphere and communication with vessels at sea was intermittent a government lab was doing hasty chemical analysis of the fallen ash but no results had been announced some respiratory problems had been reported but nothing to suggest that the ash was immediately harmful to human health loose talk suggested a link between the ashfall and the annual meteor shower but that was impossible to confirm best advice from local authorities was to hunker down keep doors and windows closed wait it out everything after that was more of the same lise didnt need a reporter to tell her the city was shutting down the usual night noises had gone silent apart from the periodic wail of emergencyvehicle sirens turk muted the display and said my clothes are probably clean by now he walked to the laundry alcove and took his tshirt and jeans into the bathroom to dress he had been more brazen out in the lake country but then so had she lise made up the sofa as a bed for him then she said how about a nightcap he nodded in the kitchen she drained what was left of her last bottle of white wine into two glasses when she came back to the living room turk had opened the blinds and was peering out into the darkness a deepening wind swept falling ash past the window she could smell it faintly that sulfurous reek reminds me of diatoms turk said accepting a glass excuse me you know out in the ocean theres plankton microscopic animals they grow a shell then the plankton dies and the shells drift down through the sea and make a kind of silt and if you dredge it up and look at it under a microscope you see all these plankton skeletonsdiatoms little stars and spikes and so forth lise watched the ash drift and thought about turks analogy the remains of things once living settling through the turbulent atmosphere the shells of dead hypotheticals it would not have surprised her father she thought she was still contemplating that when her phone buzzed again this time she picked up she couldnt exclude the exterior world forevershed have to reassure friends that she was all right she briefly and guiltily hoped that it wouldnt be brian on the other end but of course it was lise he said i was worried sick about you where are you she walked to the kitchen as if to put some symbolic space between brian and turk im fine she said im home well good lot of people arent how about you im in the consulate compound theres a lot of us here we thought wed stick it out sleep on cots the building has a generator if the power goes down you have power at the moment about half the chinese district is in the dark the citys having trouble getting repair crews out anybody there know whats going on brians voice came through the phone with a stressed reediness the way he sounded when he was nervous or upset no not really or when its going to stop no it cant go on forever though that was a nice thought but lise doubted she could convince herself of the truth of it at least not tonight okay brian appreciate the call but im fine there was a pause he wanted to say more which was what he always seemed to want these days a conversation if not a marriage let me know if you have a problem there she thanked him and cut the connection left the phone on the kitchen counter and walked back into the living room was that your ex turk asked turk knew about her problems with brian in the mountains by the side of a stormy lake she had shared a number of difficult truths about herself and her life she nodded am i creating a problem for you here no she said no problem she sat up with turk watching more sporadic news but fatigue caught up with her around three in the morning and she finally staggered off to bed even so she was awake for a while in the dark curled under a cotton sheet as if it could protect her from whatever was falling out of the sky it isnt doomsday she told herself its just something inconvenient and unexpected diatoms she thought sea shells ancient life another reminder that the universe had shifted radically during and after the spin that the kind of world she had been born into was not the world her parents or her grandparents had ever expected to see she remembered an old astronomy book of her grandfathers that had fascinated her as a child the last chapter was called are we alone and it had been full of what seemed like naive silly speculation because that question had been answered no we are not alone no we can never again think of the universe as our private property life or something like life had been here long before the evolution of human beings were on their turf lise thought and because we dont understand them we cant predict their behavior even today no one knew with any certainty why the earth had been preserved down four billion years of galactic history like a tulip bulb wintering in a dark cellar or why a seaway to this new planet had been installed in the indian ocean what was falling outside the window was just more evidence of humanitys gross ignorance she slept longer than she meant to and woke with daylight in her eyesnot sunlight exactly but a welcome ambient brightness by the time she dressed turk was already awake she found him at the living room window gazing out looks a little better she said at least not as bad there was still a flat glittery dust in the outside air but it wasnt falling as thickly as it had last night and the sky was relatively clear according to the news turk said the precipitationthats what theyre calling itis tapering off the ash cloud is still there but its moving inland what they can see on radar and satellite images suggests the whole thing might be finished late tonight early tomorrow at least as far as the coast is concerned good lise said but thats not the end of the problem the streets need to be cleared theres still trouble with the electrical grid a few roofs collapsed mostly those flatroofed tourist rentals down along the headland just cleaning up the docks is going to be a huge project the provisional government contracted a bunch of earthmovers to clean the roads and once some mobility is established they can start pumping seawater and sluice it all into the bay assuming the storm sewers accommodate the runoff all this is complicated by dust in motors stalled cars and so forth any word on toxicity according to the news guys the ash is mostly carbon sulfur silicates and metals some of it arranged in unusual molecules whatever that means but breaking down pretty quick into simpler elements shortterm its not dangerous unless youve got asthma or emphysema longterm who knows they still want people to stay indoors and theyre advising a face mask if you really need to go out anybody making any guesses about where it all came from no were getting a lot of speculation mostly bullshit but somebody at the geophysical survey had the same idea we didthat its spaceborne material thats been modified by the hypotheticals in other words nobody really knew anything did you sleep last night not much had any breakfast didnt want to mess up your kitchen im not much of a cook but i can do omelettes and coffee when he offered to help she said youd just be in the way give me twenty minutes there was a window in the kitchen and lise was able to survey the port while butter sizzled in the frying panthis big polyglot kaleidoscopically multicultural city that had grown so quickly on the edge of a new continent now blanketed in ominous gray the wind had stiffened overnight the ash had duned in the empty streets and it shivered down from the crowns of the trees that had been planted along rue abbas she sprinkled fresh cheddar onto the omelette and folded it for once it didnt break and spill off the spatula in a gooey lump she put together two plates and carried them into the living room she found turk standing in the space she used for an office a desk her keyboard and file holders a small library of paper books this where you write he asked yes no she put the plates on the coffee table turk joined her on the sofa folding his long legs and taking the plate onto his lap good he said sampling the omelette thank you so that book youre working on he said hows that going she winced the book the notional book her excuse for prolonging her stay in equatoria didnt exist she told people she was writing a book because she was a journalism graduate and because it seemed a plausible thing for her to do in the aftermath of a failed marriagea book about her father who had vanished without explanation when the family lived here a dozen years ago when she was fifteen slowly she said no progress a few interviews some good conversations with my fathers old colleagues at the american university all this was true she had immersed herself in her familys fractured history but she hadnt written more than notes to herself i remember you said your father was interested in fourths he was interested in all kinds of things robert adams had come to equatoria as part of the geophysical surveys deal with the fledgling american university the course he taught was new world geology and he had done fieldwork in the far west the book he had been working ona real bookhad been called planet as artifact a study of the new world as a place where geological history had been deeply influenced by the hypotheticals and yes he had also been fascinated by the community of fourthsprivately not professionally the woman in the photograph you showed me turk said is she a fourth maybe probably how much of this did she really want to discuss how can you tell because ive seen her before lise said putting down her fork and turning to face him do you want the whole story if you want to tell it lise had heard the word disappeared applied to her father for the first time three days after he failed to come home from the university a month after her fifteenth birthday the local police had come to discuss the case with lises mother while lise listened from the corridor outside the kitchen her father had disappearedthat is he had left work as usual had driven away in the customary direction and somewhere between the american university and their rented house in the hills above port magellan he had vanished there was no obvious explanation no pertinent evidence but the investigation went on the issue of his fascination with fourths had come up lises mother was interviewed again this time by men who wore business suits rather than uniforms men from the department of genomic security mr adams had expressed an interest in fourths was the interest personal had he for instance repeatedly mentioned the subject of longevity did he suffer from any degenerative disease that might have been reversed by the martian longevity treatment was he unusually concerned with death unhappy at home no lises mother had said actually what she said most often was no goddammit lise remembered her mother at the kitchen table interrogated drinking endless cups of rustbrown roiboos tea and saying no goddammit no nevertheless a theory had emerged a family man in the new world often apart from his family seduced by the anythinggoes atmosphere of the frontier and by the idea of the fourth age an extra thirty years or so tacked onto his expected span of life lise had to admit there was a certain logic to it he wouldnt have been the first man to be lured from his family by the promise of longevity three decades ago the martian wun ngo wen had brought to earth a technique for extending human lifea treatment that changed behavior in other and subtler ways as well proscribed by virtually every government on earth the treatment circulated in the underground community of terrestrial fourths would robert adams have abandoned his career and family to join that community lises instinctive answer was the same as her mothers no he wouldnt have done that to them no no matter how tempted he might have been but evidence had emerged to subvert that faith he had been associating with strangers offcampus people had been coming to the house people not associated with the university people he had not introduced to his family and whose purposes he had been reluctant to explain and the fourth cults held a special appeal in the academic communitythe treatment had first been circulated by the scientist jason lawton among friends he considered trustworthy and it had spread primarily among intellectuals and scholars no goddammitbut did mrs adams have a better explanation mrs adams did not nor did lise the investigation remained inconclusive after a year of this lises mother had booked passage to california for herself and her daughter bent by the insult to her wellplanned life but not at least outwardly broken the disappearancethe new world in generalbecame a subject one didnt mention in her presence silence was better than speculation lise had learned that lesson well like her mother lise had secured her pain and curiosity in the dark internal attic where unthinkable thoughts were stored at least until her marriage to brian and his transfer to port magellan suddenly those memories were refreshed the wound reopened as if it had never healed and her curiosity she discovered had been distilled in its enclosure had become an adults curiosity rather than a childs so she had begun to ask questions of her fathers colleagues and friends the few still living in the city and inevitably these questions had involved the community of fourths in the new world brian at first tried to be helpful he hadnt much liked her ad hoc investigation into what he considered potentially dangerous mattersand lise supposed it had been one more in a growing number of emotional disconnects between thembut he had tolerated it and even used his dgs credentials to follow up on some of her queries like the woman in the photograph two photographs actually she told turk when she moved out of her mothers house lise had salvaged a number of items her mother was forever threatening to throw away in this case a disk of photographs from her parents port magellan years a few of the pictures had been taken at faculty parties at the adams house lise had selected a few of these photos and shown them to old family friends hoping to track down those she didnt recognize she managed to put names at least to most of them but one stood out a darkskinned elderly woman in jeans caught standing in the doorway beyond a crowd of far more expensivelydressed faculty members as if she had arrived unexpectedly she seemed disconcerted nervous no one had been able to identify her brian had offered to run the picture through dgs imagerecognition software and see if anything turned up this had been the latest of what lise had come to think of as brians charity bombsacts of generosity he threw in front of her as if to divert her from the path to separationand she had accepted the offer with a warning that it wouldnt change anything but the search had turned up a pertinent match the same woman had passed through the docks at port magellan just months ago she had been listed on a passengership manifest as sulean moi the name turned up again in connection with turk findley who had piloted the charter flight that carried sulean moi over the mountains to the desert town of kubelicks gravethe same town to which lise had been attempting to fly a few months before following a different lead turk listened to all this patiently then he said she wasnt talkative she paid cash i put her down at the airstrip in kubelicks grave and that was that she never said anything about her past or why she was flying west you think shes a fourth she hasnt changed much in fifteen years that suggests she might be so maybe the simplest explanation is true your father took the illegal treatment and started a new life under a new name maybe but i dont want another hypothesis i want to know what really happened so you find out the truth what then does that make your life better maybe youll learn something you dont like maybe you have to start mourning all over again at least she said ill know what im mourning for as often happened when she talked about her father she dreamed of him that night more memory than dream at first she was with him on the veranda of their house on the hill in port magellan and he was talking to her about the hypotheticals he talked to her on the veranda because lises mother didnt care for these conversations this was the starkest contrast lise could draw between her parents both were spin survivors but they had emerged from the crisis with polarized sensibilities her father had thrown himself headlong into the mystery had fallen in love with the heightened strangeness of the universe her mother pretended that none of it had happenedthat the garden fence and the back wall were barricades strong enough to repulse the tide of time lise had not quite known where to place herself on that divide she loved the sense of safety she felt in her mothers home but she loved to hear her father talk in the dream he talked about the hypotheticals the hypotheticals arent people lise you must not make that mistake as the unnamed equatorian stars turned in the slateblack sky they are a network of more or less mindless machines we suspect but is that network aware of itself does it have a mind lise the way you and i do if it does every element of its thought must be propagated over hundreds or thousands of lightyears it would see time and space very differently than we do it might not perceive us at all except as a passing phenomenon and if it manipulates us it might do so at an entirely unconscious level like god lise in her dream suggested a blind god her father said but he was wrong because in the dream while she was entranced in the grandeur of his vision and safe in the boundary of her mothers sensibility the hypothetical had reached down from the sky opened a steel fist that glittered in the starlight and snatched him away before she could summon the courage to scream chaptfr five the dust fell more sparsely for another few hours yielded to a gray daylight and stopped altogether by dark the city remained eerily quiet apart from the intermittent growl of earthmovers ceaselessly shifting the ash turk could tell where the earthmovers were working by the billows of fine dust that rose around and above them gray pillars lofting over the corduroy of shops shanties office buildings billboards commingling with saltwater plumes where pump lines laid from the harbor to the hills had begun to sluice the streets a wasteland but even at this hour there were people in the street masked or with bandannas tied over their faces kicking through the drifts on their way somewhere or just assessing the damage gazing around like bit players in a disaster drama a man in a grimy dishdasha stood for half an hour outside the locked arabic grocery across the street smoking cigarettes and staring at the sky you think its over lise asked obviously a question he couldnt answer but he guessed she didnt want a real answer as much as she wanted reassurance for now anyway they were both too wired to sleep he switched on the video display and they settled back on the sofa trawling for new information a newsreader announced that the dust cloud had moved inland and no more precipitation was expectedthere had been sporadic reports of ashfall from every community between ayers point and haixi on the coast but port magellan seemed to have been hit harder than most which was in a way a good thing turk supposed because while this dump of particulate matter had been troublesome for the city it might have been a catastrophe for the local ecosystem smothering forests and killing crops and maybe even poisoning the soil though the newscaster said there was nothing terribly toxic in it according to the latest analyses the fossil or machinelike structures in the ashfall had attracted attention of course microphotographs of the dust revealed even more latent structure degraded cogs and wheels scalloped cones like tiny conch shells inorganic molecules hooked together in complex and unnatural waysas if some vast machine had eroded in orbit and only its finer elements had survived the fiery descent through the atmosphere they had spent the day in the apartment turk mostly sitting at the window lise making calls and sending messages to family back home itemizing the food in the kitchen in case the city was shut down longterm and in the process they had reestablished a kind of intimacythe mountaincampinathunderstorm intimacy they had shared before brought down to the cityand when she put her head against his shoulder turk raised his hand to stroke her hair hesitated when he remembered the nature of their situation here its all right she said her hair smelled fresh and somehow golden and it felt like silk under the palm of his hand turk she said im sorry nothing to apologize for for thinking i needed an excuse to see you missed you too he said justit was confusing i know do you want to go to bed she took his hand and rubbed her cheek against it i mean he knew what she meant he spent that night with her and he spent another not because he had tothe coast road had been mostly cleared by that timebut because he could but he couldnt stay forever he lazed around one morning more picking over breakfast while lise made more calls amazing how many friends and acquaintances and homefolks she had it made him feel a little unpopular the only calls he made that morning were to customers whose flights would have to be rescheduled or canceledcancellations he couldnt afford right nowand to a couple of buddies mechanics from the airport who might wonder why he wasnt around to go drinking with them he didnt have much of a social life he didnt even own a dog she recorded a long message to her mother back in the states you couldnt make a direct call across the arch since the only things the hypothetical allowed to travel between this world and the one next door were manned ocean vessels but there was a fleet of telecomequipped commercial ships that shuttled back and forth to relay recorded data you could watch video news from home that was only a few hours stale and you could send voice or text the other direction lises message what he overheard of it was a careful reassurance that the ashfall had done no lasting harm and looked like it would be cleared up before long although it was a mystery why it had happened very confusingno shit turk thought turk had family in austin texas but they hadnt heard from him lately and wouldnt expect to on the bookshelf by lises desk was a threevolume bound copy of the martian archives sometimes called the martian encyclopedia the compendium of history and science brought to earth by wun ngo wen thirty years ago the blue dust jackets were tattered at their spine ends he took down the first volume and leafed through it when she finally put down the phone he said do you believe in this its not a religion its not something you have to believe in it back during the freakish years of the spin the technologically advanced nations of the earth had assembled the necessary resources to terraform and colonize the planet mars the most useful resource had already been put in place by the hypotheticals and that was time for every year on earth under the spin membrane thousands of years had passed in the universe at large the biological transformation of marsscientists called it the ecopoiesishad been relatively easy to accomplish given that generous temporal disconnect the human colonization of the planet had been an altogether riskier venture isolated from earth for millennia the martian colonists had created a technology suited to their waterpoor and nitrogenstarved environment they were masters of biological manipulation but chronically wary of largescale mechanical engineering sending a manned expedition to earth had been a last desperate strategy when the hypotheticals appeared to be about to enclose mars in a spin membrane of its own wun ngo wen the socalled martian ambassadorturk found a photograph of him as he leafed through an appendix to the book a small wrinkled darkskinned manhad arrived during the last years of the spin he had been feted by earthly governments until it became clear that he possessed no magic solution to their problems but wun had advocated and helped set in motion the launch of martiandesigned quasibiological probes into the outer solar systemselfreplicating robotic devices that were supposed to broadcast back information that might shed useful light on the nature of the hypotheticals and in a way they had succeededthe network of probes had been absorbed into a preexisting previously unsuspected ecology of selfreplicating devices living in deep space which was the physical body of the hypotheticals or so some people believed but turk had no opinion about that the version of the archives lise possessed was an authorized redaction published in the states it had been vetted and organized by a panel of scientists and government officials and it was acknowledged to be incomplete before his death wun had arranged for unedited copies of the text to be privately circulated along with something even more valuablemartian pharmaceuticals including the drug that would add some thirty or more years to an average human life span the socalled fourth treatment by which lises father had presumably been tempted there were supposedly lots of native fourths on earth now though they lacked the elaborate social structures that constrained the lives of their martian cousins taking the treatment was illegal under a un accord signed by virtually every member nation most of what the department of genomic security did back in the states was shutting down fourth cults both genuine and fraudulentthat and policing the booming trade in human and animal genetic enhancements these were the folks lises exhusband worked for you know she said we havent talked much about this we havent talked nearly enough about anything at all seems to me her smile though brief was pleasing she said do you know any fourths wouldnt recognize one if i saw one and if that was an evasion she didnt appear to notice because its different here in the port she said here in the new world the laws arent enforced the way they are back on earth thats changing i hear which is why i want to look at what my father was interested in before it all gets erased people say theres a fourth underground in the city maybe more than one yeah ive heard that ive heard a lot of things not all true i can do all the secondhand research i want but what i really need is to talk to someone whos had direct experience with the fourth community here right maybe brian can arrange it for you next time dgs arrests somebody he was immediately sorry hed said it or said it so bluntly she tightened up brian and i are divorced and im not responsible for what genomic security does but hes looking for the same people youre looking for for different reasons do you ever wonder about that whether he might be using you as some kind of cats paw riding on your research i dont show my work to brianto anyone not even when hes baiting you with the woman who maybe took away your father im not sure you have the right forget it im just you know concerned she was obviously on the verge of handing that right back to him but she cocked her head and thought about it first that was one of the things turk had noticed about her right away the habit she had of stepping outside the moment before she rendered a verdict she said dont make assumptions about me and brian just because were still on speaking terms doesnt mean im doing him favors just so we know where we are he said the sky was gray again by noon but the clouds were rain clouds nothing exotic and they brought a drenching unseasonable downpour turk guessed the rain might ultimately be a boonit would wash some of this ash into the soil or out to sea maybe help salvage the seasons crops if that was possible but it did nothing to ease the drive south from the port once he recovered his car from the parking lot at harleys glistening washes of gray ash made the pavement treacherous creeks and rivers had turned the color of clay and ran turgidly in their beds when the road crossed the high ridges turk could see a bloom of silt tailing into the sea from a dozen muddy deltas he left the coast road at an unmarked exit toward a place most englishspeakers called new delhi flats a shanty settlement on a plateau between two creeks under a sheer bluff that crumbled a little every rainy season the alleys between the rows of cheap chinesebranded prefab housing were unpaved and the fairweather huts had been improved with tarpaper roofing and sheets of insulation hauled in from cheapjack factories upcoast there were no police in the flats no real authority beyond what could be leveraged by the churches temples and mosques the earthmovers hadnt been anywhere near the flats and the narrower alleys were congested with sloggy wet dunes but a passage had been shoveled along the main avenue and it took turk only a few extra minutes to reach tomas ginns undistinguished homean arsenicgreen hovel squeezed between two just like it he parked and waded through a thin gruel of wet ash to tomass door he knocked when there was no answer he knocked again a lined face appeared briefly at the small curtained window to his left then the door swung open turk tomas ginn had a voice that sounded as if it had been filtered through bedrock an old mans voice but firmer than it had been when turk first encountered him didnt expect to see you specially in the middle of all this trouble come on in place is a fuckin mess but i can pour you a drink anyhow turk stepped inside tomass home was little more than a single thinwalled room with a raggedy sofa and table at one end and a miniature kitchen at the other all dimly lit the port magellan power authority hadnt strung any cables out this way the only electricity came from an array of sinotec photovoltaics on the roof and their efficiency had been slashed by the dustfall the place had a lingering aroma of sulfur and talc but that was mostly the ash turk had tracked in with him tomas was a fastidious housekeeper in his own way a fuckin mess in tomass vocabulary meant there were a couple of empty beer bottles undisposedof on a narrow counter sit on down tomas said settling himself on a chair with a dent in the seat that had been worn into a mirror image of his bony ass turk selected the leasttattered cushion on his friends ancient sofa can you believe this shit falling out of the sky i mean who asked for that i had to shovel my way out of the house yesterday just to go out and get groceries pretty unbelievable turk acknowledged so what brings you here something more than neighborliness i expect given the weather if you can call it weather got a question to ask turk said a question or a favor wellstarts with a question anyway serious it might be so you want a beer get the dust out of your throat not a bad idea turk said turk had met tomas aboard an ancient singlehulled tanker bound for breaker beach on its final voyage the ship called kestrel had been turks ticket to the new world turk had signed on as an ablebodied seaman at negligible wages all the crew had because it was a oneway trip across the arch in equatoria the market for scrap iron and steel was booming on earth a leviathan like the kestrel was a liability too old to meet international standards and useless for anything but the poorest kind of coastal trade prohibitively expensive to scrap but in the new world the same rusty hulk would be a source of valuable raw material stripped and diced by the acetylenewielding armies of thai and indian laborers who made their living unrestrained by environmental regulationsthe professional breakers of breaker beach located some hundred miles north of port magellan turk and tomas had shared a mess on that voyage and learned a few things about each other tomas claimed to have been born in bolivia but he had been raised he said in biloxi and had worked the docks in that city and then new orleans as a boy and young man he had been at sea off and on for decades during the tumultuous years of the spin when the us government had revived the old merchant marine as a gesture toward national security and afterward when trade across the arch created fresh demand for new shipping tomas had joined kestrel for the same reason turk had signed on it was a oneway ticket to the promised land or what they both liked to imagine was a promised land tomas wasnt naive he had crossed the arch five times before had spent months in port magellan knew the towns vices firsthand and had seen how cruelly the town could treat newcomers but it was a freer more open more casually polyglot city than any on eartha seamans town much of it built by expatriate sailors and it was where he wanted to spend the last years of his life looking at a landscape on which human hands had only recently been laid turk had signed on for much the same reason though it would be his first trip crossarch he had wanted to get as far from texas as it was practical to get for reasons he didnt care to dwell on the trouble with kestrel was that because it had no future it had been poorly maintained and was barely seaworthy everyone aboard was aware of that fact from the filipino captain down to the illiterate syrian teenager who stewarded the crew mess it made for a dangerous transit bad weather had scuttled many a vessel bound for breaker beach and more than one rusty keel had gone to rest under the arch of the hypotheticals but the weather in the indian ocean had been reassuringly benign and because this was turks first passage he had risked the derision of his shipmates by arranging to be on deck when the crossing happened a night crossing of the arch he staked out a place aft of the forecastle out of the breeze made a pillow from a hank of rag stiff with dried paint stretched out and gazed at the stars the stars had been scattered by the four billion years of galactic evolution that had transpired while the earth was enclosed in its spin membrane and they remained nameless after thirty years but they were the only stars turk had ever known he had been barely five years old when the spin ended his generation had grown up in the postspin world accustomed to the idea that a person could ride an ocean vessel from one planet to another unlike some however turk had never been able to make that fact seem prosaic it was still a wonder to him the arch of the hypotheticals was a structure vastly larger than anything human engineering could have produced by the scale of stars and planets the scale on which the hypotheticals were assumed to operate it was a relatively small thing but it was the biggest made thing turk imagined he would ever encounter he had seen it often enough in photographs on video in representative diagrams in schoolbooks but none of those did justice to the real item he had first seen it with his own eyes from the sumatran port where he joined the kestrel the archs eastern leg had been visible on clear days and especially at sunset when the last light climbed that pale thread and burnished it to a fine golden line but now he was almost directly beneath the apex a different view entirely the arch had been compared to a thousandmilewide wedding ring dropped into the indian ocean half of it embedded in the bedrock of the planet and the other half projecting above the atmosphere into naked space from the deck of the kestrel he couldnt see either leg where it entered the sea but he could see the peak of the arch reflecting the last light of the sun a brushstroke of silveryblue fading to dusky red at its eastern and western extremities it quivered in the heat of the evening air up close people said if you sailed within hailing proximity of either leg it looked as plain as a pillar of concrete rising from the surface of the sea except that the enormously wide pillar didnt stop rising simply vanished from sight but the arch wasnt an inert object no matter how static it appeared it was a machine it communicated with a copy of itselfor the other half of itself perhapsset in the compatible ocean of the new world many lightyears distant maybe it orbited one of the stars turk could see from the deck of the kestrel there was a shivery thought the arch might appear to be inanimate but in fact it was watching the near surface of both worlds conducting twoway traffic because that was what it did that was its function if a bird a stormtossed tree limb or an ocean current passed beneath the arch it would continue on its way unmolested the waters of earth and the new world never mingled but if a manned ocean vessel crossed under the arch it would be picked up and translated across an unimaginable distance by all reports the transition was so easy as to be almost anticlimactic but turk wanted to experience it out here in the open not down in crew quarters where he wouldnt even know it had happened until the ship sounded its ritual horn he checked his watch almost time he was still waiting when tomas stepped out of the shadows into the glare of a deck light grinning at him first time yeah turk said forestalling the inevitable comment fuck tomas said you dont need to explain i come out every time i pass day or night like paying respects respects to whom the hypothetical but turk didnt ask and oh my tomas said aiming his old face at the sky here it comes so turk braced himselfunnecessarilyand watched the stars dim and swirl around the peak of the arch like watery reflections stirred by the prow of a boat then suddenly there was fog all around the kestrel or a mistiness that reminded him of fog although it had no scent or taste of moisture to ita transient dizziness a pressure in his ears then the stars came back but they were different stars thicker and brighter in what seemed like a blacker sky and now the air did taste and smell subtly different and a gust of it swirled around the hard steel angles of the topdeck as if to introduce itself air warm and saltscented and bracingly fresh and up on the high bridge of the kestrel the compass needle must have swung on its pivot as compasses did at every crossing of the arch because the ships horn sounded one long wailpunishingly loud but sounding almost tentative across an ocean only lately acquainted with human beings the new world turk said thinking thats it as easy as that equatoria tomas said confusing the continent with the planet as most people did hows it feel to be a spaceman turk but turk couldnt answer because two crewmen who had been stealthily pacing the topdeck rounded on turk with a bucket of saltwater and doused him laughing another rite of passage a christening for the virgin sailor he had crossed at last the worlds strangest meridian and he had no intention of going back no real home to go back to tomas had been frail with age when he boarded the kestrel and he was injured when the beaching of the vessel went bad there were no docks or quays at breaker beach turk had seen it from the deck rail his first real look at the coast of equatoria the continent loomed out of the horizon like a mirage pink with morning light though hardly untouched by human hands the three decades since the end of the spin had transformed the western fringe of equatoria from a wilderness into a chaos of fishing villages lumber camps primitive industry slashandburn farmland hasty roads a dozen booming towns and one city through which most of the hinterlands rich resources were channeled breaker beach almost a hundred nautical miles north of port magellan was possibly the ugliest occupied territory on the coastturk could hardly say but the filipino cargomaster insisted it was and the argument was plausible the broad white beach protected from the surf by a pebbly headland was littered with the corpses of broken vessels and smudged with the smoke and ash of a thousand fires turk spotted a doublehulled tanker not unlike the kestrel a score of coastal tankers even a military vessel stripped of all identifying flags and markings these were recent arrivals the work of their deconstruction hardly begun for many miles more the beach was crowded with steel frames denuded of hull plating cavernous halfships in which the acetylene glare of the breakers torches made a fitful light beyond that lay the scrapmetal huts and forges and toolsheds and machine shops of the breakers mostly indian and malaysian men working out the contracts that had bought them passage under the arch farther on hazy in the morning air forested hills unrolled into the bluegray foothills of the mountains he couldnt stay on deck during the beaching the standard way to deliver a large vessel to breaker beach was simply to run it up the littoral and strand it there the breakers would do the rest swarming over the ship once the crew had been evacuated the ships steel would end up in rerolling mills downcoast the ships miles of wiring and aluminum piping would be extracted and sold in bulk lots even the ships bells turk had heard would be marketed to local buddhist temples this was equatoria and any manmade thing would find a use it didnt matter that beaching a vessel as enormous as the kestrel could be a violent destructive process none of these ships would ever float again he went belowdecks when the signal sounded and found tomas waiting in the crew mess grinning turk had grown fond of tomass bony grindementedlooking but genuine end of the road for kestrel tomas said and the end of the road for me too every chicken comes home to roost i guess were positioned off the beach turk said soon the captain would start the engines and engage the screws and send the ship dead for shore the engines would be shut down at the last practical moment and the prow of the ship would gully into the sand while the tide was high then the crew would drop rope ladders and scurry down the hull their kit bags would be lowered turk would take his first steps in the grit and wash of breaker beach within a month kestrel would be little more than a memory and a few thousand tons of recycled iron steel and aluminum every death is a birth said tomas who was old enough to get away with such pronouncements i wouldnt know about that no you strike me as somebody who knows more than he lets on end of kestrel but your first time in the new world thats a death and a birth right there if you say so tomas turk felt the ships elderly engines begin to throb the beaching would be violent inevitably all the loose gear in the ship had already been stowed or dismounted and sent ashore along with the lifeboats half the crew was already ashore whoa tomas exclaimed as the vibration came up through the deck plating and the chair legs making some speed now you bet the prow of the ship would be cutting a knifeedge through the water turk thought as it did whenever the vessel began to throb and surge like this except they werent in open water anymore their slot on the beach was dead ahead the continent rising beneath them the captain was in radio contact with a shore pilot who would call in minor course corrections and tell him when to cut the engines soon turk hoped he liked being at sea and he didnt mind being belowdecks but he found he very much disliked being in a windowless room when a deliberatelyengineered disaster was only moments away you done this before well no tomas said not from this end but i was at a wreckers beach near goa a few years ago and i watched an old container ship ground itself ship not much smaller than this one kind of a poetry to it actually it rode up the tideline like one of those turtles trying to lay an egg i mean i guess you want to brace yourself for it but it wasnt violent a few minutes later tomas looked at the watch that hung like a bracelet on his skinny wrist and said about time to cut engines you got it timed i got eyes and ears i know where we were anchored and i can tell by listening what kind of speed were making this sounded to turk like one of tomass boasts but it might be true turk wiped his palms on the knees of his jeans he was nervous but what could go wrong at this point it was all ballistics what did go wrongas he sorted it out afterwardwas that at a critical moment kestrels bridge lost electrical power due to some short or component failure in the antique circuitry so that the captain could neither hear the shore pilots instructions nor relay his orders to the engine room kestrel should have come in coasting but she beached under power instead turk was thrown from his chair as the ship ground into the littoral and listed grotesquely to starboard he was alert enough to see the brushedsteel cutlery locker break loose from the near wall and tumble toward him the locker was the size of a coffin and about as heavy and he tried to crawl away from it but there wasnt time to pull himself out of the way but here was tomas somehow still upright grabbing for the screeching metal box and managing to snag the corner of it as it slid by giving turk enough time to scramble aside he fetched up against a chair as kestrel stopped moving and the ships engines finally mercifully died the old tankers hull gave a ratcheting prehistoric groan and fell silent beached no harm done except to tomas who had briefly taken the full weight of the locker and whose left arm had been sliced open below the elbow deep enough to show bone tomas cradled the injury in his bloodsoaked lap looking startled turk applied a handkerchief as a tourniquet and told his friend to stop cursing and keep still while he went for help it took him ten minutes to find an officer who would listen to him the ships doctor had already gone ashore and the infirmary had been stripped of drugs so tomas had to be lowered from the deck in an improvised ropeandbasket litter with only a couple of aspirin to dull the pain the kestrels captain in the end refused to admit liability collected his pay from the breaker boss and caught a bus for port magellan before sunset so turk was left to look after tomas until an offshift malay welder could be convinced to summon a genuine doctor or what passed for a doctor in this part of the new world a woman the skinny malay said in broken english a good doctor a western doctor very kind to the breakers she was white but had lived for years in a minang fishing village not far upcoast her name he said was diane chapter six turk told tomas ginn about lisea little bit about her how they had connected when they were stranded in the mountains how he couldnt get her out of his mind even when they were back in civilization even when she stopped returning his calls how they got back together during the ashfall tomas listened from his tattered easy chair sipping beer from a green glass bottle and smiling placidly as if he had discovered some kind of windless place inside his head sounds like you hardly know this lady i know as much as i need to some people it isnt that hard to tell whether you trust them or not trust her do you yeah tomas cupped the crotch of his baggy jeans this is what you trust every inch a sailor its not like that it never is but it always is so why you want to drive up here and tell me about this woman actually i was thinking maybe i could introduce her to you to me i aint your daddy turk no and youre not what you used to be either dont see what thats got to do with it turk had to tread carefully here with the utmost delicacy insofar as he was capable of it well shes curious about fourths oh my christ tomas rolled his eyes curious shes got reasons to be so you want to serve me up to her exhibit a or whatever no what i really want to do is let her talk to diane but i want your opinion first dianethe western doctor or nurse as she insisted on calling herselfhad hiked to breaker beach from some inland village to treat tomass slashed arm at first turk was suspicious of her in equatoria especially out here in the backwoods nobody was checking anybodys medical license at least that was the impression he got if you owned a syringe and a bottle of distilled water you could call yourself a doctor and the breaker bosses would naturally endorse any selfappointed physician who worked for free regardless of results so turk sat with tomas inside a vacant hut waiting for this woman to arrive making occasional conversation until the older man fell asleep despite the blood still leaking into his makeshift bandage the hut was made of some local wood round barked branches knobbed like bamboo holding up a flat tin roof it smelled of stale cooking and tobacco and human sweat it was hot inside though the screened door admitted an occasional slow sigh of air the sun was going down when the doctor finally walked up the plank steps to the platform floor tugging aside a layer of bug netting she wore a tunic and loose pants of a cloth the color and texture of raw muslin she wasnt a young woman far from it her hair was so white it seemed almost transparent whos the patient she asked squinting and light a lamp pleasei can hardly see my names turk findley turk said are you the patient no i show me the patient so he turned up the wick of an oil lamp and escorted her through another layer of netting to the yellowed mattress where tomas slept out in the dusk insect choruses were warming up they sounded like no insects he had heard before but you could tell thats what it was that steely staccato buzzing from the beach came the sound of hammering the clatter of sheet metal the chug and whine of diesel motors tomas snored oblivious the doctordianelooked at the bandage on his arm with an expression of contempt how did this happen turk told her how it had happened so he sacrificed himself for you sacrificed a chunk of his arm anyhow youre lucky to have a friend like that wake him up first then tell me whether im lucky she nudged tomass shoulder and tomas opened his eyes and promptly cursed old curses creole curses pungent as gumbo he tried to sit up then thought better of it finally he fixed his attention on diane and who the fuck might you be im a nurse calm down who bandaged you guy on the ship he did a lousy job let me see well i guess it was his first time heow jesus turk is this a real nurse dont be an infant diane said and hold still i cant help you if i cant see whats wrong a pause ah well youre lucky you didnt cut an artery she took a syringe from her kit and filled it something for the pain before i clean and stitch tomas started to protest but that was for show he looked relieved when the needle went in turk backed away and tried to give diane room to work not that there was a whole lot of space in this little hut he wondered what it must be like to make a living as a breakerto sleep under a tin roof praying you wouldnt be hurt or killed before your contract played out before you got the payoff they promised you a years wages and a bus ticket to the port there was an official camp physician the breaker boss had explained but he only came in twice a week usually to fill out forms diane did most of the routine cutandstitch duty turk watched her as she worked a silhouette cast by lamplight on the gauzy bug screen she was skinny and she moved with the calculated caution of the very old but she was strong too she worked methodically and smoothly occasionally muttering to herself she might be around tomass age which the sailor variously gave as sixty or seventymaybe older she worked and from time to time tomas swore with fierce intent but a certain drugged lethargy there was a stink of antiseptic and turk stepped out into the rising dark his first night in the new world in the near distance there was a stand of flowering bushes he couldnt name sixfingered leaves moving in an offshore breeze the flowers were blue and smelled like cloves or cinammon or some other christmas spice farther off the lights and fires of the industrial beach guttered like lit fuses and beyond the beach the ocean rolled in faint green phosphorescence and the alien stars turned grand slow circles theres a potential complication diane said when she had finished with tomas she came and sat with turk on the edge of the wooden platform that held the floor a foot or so above the ground she had worked hard cleaning and closing tomass wound and she mopped her forehead with a handkerchief her accent was american turk thought a shade southernmaryland maybe or those parts he asked her what kind of complications those might be with luck nothing serious but equatoria is a completely novel microbial environmentdo you understand i may be dumb but im not ignorant she laughed at that i apologize mr findley but call me turk your parents named you turk no maam but the family lived in istanbul for a couple years when i was a kid i picked up a little turkish and a nickname so what are you sayingtomas might come down with some local disease there are no native human beings on this planet no hominids no primates nothing remotely like us most local diseases cant touch us but there are bacteria and fungi that thrive in moist warm environments including the human body nothing we cant adjust to mr findleyturkand nothing so dangerous or communicable that it could be carried back to earth but its still not a good idea to arrive in the new world with a challenged immune system or in mr ginns case an open wound bandaged by an idiot cant you give him some kind of antibiotic i did but the local microorganisms dont necessarily respond to standard pharmaceuticals dont misunderstand hes not ill and in all likelihood he wont become ill but theres a certain unavoidable risk are you a close friend of mr ginn not exactly but like i said he was trying to help me out when he got hurt id prefer to keep him here a few days under my observation is that all right fine by me but you might have to go some to convince tomas im not his keeper where are you headed if you dont mind me asking downcoast to the city any particular address a number where i can reach you no maam im new here but you can tell tomas ill look for him at the union hall when he makes it down to port magellan she seemed disappointed i see or maybe i can call you she turned and gazed at him for a long moment scrutinized him actually turk started to feel a little awkward under that relentless stare then she said okay let me give you a number she found a pencil in her kit bag and scribbled the number on the back of a coast urban coach lines ticket stub she was evaluating you tomas said i know that good instincts that woman yeah thats the point turk said so turk found a place to live in the port and lived on his savings for a while and dropped by the seamans union every now and then to look for tomas but tomas never showed which at first didnt worry him much tomas could be anywhere tomas could have taken it into his head to cross the mountains for all he knew so turk would have dinner or a drink and forget about his messmate but when a month had passed he dug out the ticket stub and keyed the number scribbled on it what he got was an automated message that the number had been discontinued which piqued his curiosity as well as his sense of obligation his money was running out and he was getting ready to sign up for pipeline work but he caught a ride upcoast and hiked a couple of miles to the breaker compound and started asking questions one of the breaker bosses remembered turks face and told him his friend had got sick and that was too bad but they couldnt let a sick sailor take up time and attention so ibu diane and some minang fishermen had hauled the old man back to their village turk bought dinner at a tinroofed chinese restaurant at the crossroads then hitched a ride farther upcoast to a horseshoe bay turning gaudy colors under the long equatorian dusk the driver a salesman for some west african import firm pointed turk at an unpaved road and a sign marked in a curvilinear language turk couldnt read minang village down that way he said turk walked a couple of miles through the forest and just as the stars were turning bright and the insects bothersome he found himself between a row of wooden houses with buffalohorn eaves and a lanternlit general store where men in box caps sat at cablespool tables drinking coffee he put on his best smile and asked a local for directions to doctor dianes clinic the pedestrian smiled back and nodded and called out to the coffee house two muscular young men hurried out and positioned themselves on each side of turk well take you there they said in english when turk repeated his requestand they smiled too but turk had the uneasy feeling hed been politely but firmly taken into custody i guess i was pretty fuckedup when you finally saw me tomas said you dont remember not much of it no yeah turk said you were pretty fuckedup pretty fuckedup which in this case meant tomas was bedridden emaciated gasping for breath in the back room of the big wooden building diane called her clinic turk had looked at his friend with something approaching horror jesus christ what happened to him calm down ibu diane said ibu was what the villagers called her he gathered it was some kind of honorific is he dying no appearances to the contrary hes getting well all this from a cut on his arm tomas looked as if someone had stuck a hose down his throat and siphoned out his insides turk thought he had never seen a thinner man its more complicated than that sit down and ill explain outside the window of dianes clinic the minang village was lively in the dark lanterns hung swaying from eaves and he could hear the sound of recorded music playing tinnily diane made coffee with an electric kettle and a french press and the resulting brew was hot and dense there used to be two real doctors at the clinic she said her husband and a minang woman both of whom had lately died of natural causes only diane was left and the only medicine she knew was what she had learned while acting as a nurse enough to keep the clinic going it was an indispensable resource not only for this village but for a halfdozen nearby villages and for the impoverished breakers any condition she couldnt treat she referred to the red crescent clinic up the coast or the catholic charity hospital in port magellan though that was a long trip in matters of cuts cleanly broken bones and common disorders she was perfectly competent she consulted regularly with a traveling physician from the port who understood her situation and made sure she was supplied with basic medicines sterile bandages and so forth so maybe you should have sent tomas downcoast turk said he looks seriously ill to me the cut on his arm was the least of his problems did tomas tell you he had cancer jesus no cancer does he we brought him back here because his wound was infected but the cancer showed up in simple blood tests i dont have much in the way of diagnostic equipment but i do have a portable imagerten years old but it works like a charm it confirmed the diagnosis and the prognosis was very grave cancer is hardly an untreatable disease but your friend had been avoiding doctors for far too long he was deeply metastasized so he is dying no diane paused once again she riveted him with that stare fierce and a little uncanny turk made an effort not to avert his own eyes it was like playing staredown with a cat i offered him an unconventional treatment like what radiation or something i offered to make him a fourth for a moment he was too startled to speak outside the music played on something tunelessly alien beaten out of a wooden xylophone and funneled through a cheap loudspeaker he said you can do that i can i have turk wondered what he had gotten himself into and how he could most efficiently extract himself from it well i guess its not illegal here you guess wrong its just easier to get away with and we have to be discreet an extra few decades of life isnt something you advertise turk so why tell me because tomas is going to need some help as he recovers and because i think i can trust you how could you possibly know that because you came here looking for him she startled him by smiling call it an educated guess you understand that the fourth treatment isnt just about longevity the martians were deeply ambivalent about tinkering with human biology they didnt want to create a community of powerful elders the fourth treatment gives and it takes away it gives you an extra thirty or forty years of lifeand im a case in point if you havent guessedbut it also rearranges certain human traits traits turk said drymouthed he had never to his knowledge spoken to a fourth before and that was what this woman claimed to be how old was she ninety years one hundred am i so frightening no maam not at all but not even a little still smiling well i what i mean to say turk is that as a fourth im more sensitive to certain social and behavioral cues than the majority of unmodified people i can generally tell when someones lying or being disingenuous at least when were facetoface although against sincere lies i have no defense im not omniscient im not especially wise and i cant read minds the most you might say is that my bullshit detector has been turned up a notch or two and since any group of fourths is necessarily under siegefrom the police or from criminals or boththats a useful faculty to have no i dont know you well enough to say i trust you but i perceive you clearly enough to say that im willing to trust you do you understand i suppose so i mean i dont have anything against fourths never thought much about it either way that comfortable innocence is over your friend wont die of cancer but he cant stay here and he has a lot of adjustments to make what i would like to do is discharge him into your care maamuh dianei dont know the first thing about taking care of a sick man much less a fourth he wont be sick for long but hell need an understanding friend will you be that person for him well i mean you know im willing i suppose but it might be better to make some other arrangement because im in a difficult position financially and all i wouldnt have asked you if i could think of anything better it was a blessing that you showed up when you did she added if i hadnt wanted you to find me i would have been much more difficult to find i tried calling but i had to discontinue that number she frowned but didnt offer to explain well well fuck he thought i guess i wouldnt turn out a stray dog in a rainstorm her smile returned thats what i thought i guess you learned a few things about fourths since then tomas said i dont know turk said youre the only close sample ive got not too inspiring actually did she actually say that about a bullshit detector more or less what do you think tomas is it true tomas had recovered from his illnessfrom the genetic rebuild that constituted the fourth treatmentas quickly as diane had predicted his psychological adjustment was another matter he was a man who had come to equatoria prepared to die and instead he had found himself staring down another three or more decades for which he had no plan or ambition physically though it had been a liberation after a week of recovery tomas could have passed for a man much younger his crabbed way of walking became more supple his appetite was suddenly bottomless this was almost too strange for turk to deal with as if tomas had shed his old body the way a snake sheds its skin fuck its just me tomas would proclaim whenever turk became too uncomfortably conscious of the distance between the old tomas and the new tomas clearly relished his newfound health the only drawback he said was that the treatment had erased his tattoos half his history had been written in those tattoos he said is it true that i have an improved bullshit detector well thats in the eye of the beholder its been ten years turk what do you think we never talked much about this i would of been happy to keep it that way can you tell when youre being lied to theres no drug thatll make a stupid man smart and im not a particularly smart man im no lie detector either but i can generally tell when somebodys trying to sell me something because i think lise has been lied to her business with fourths is legitimate but i think shes being used also she has some information diane might like to hear tomas was silent for a while he tipped up his beer to drain it and put the bottle on a tray table next to his chair he gave turk a look uneasily reminiscent of dianes evaluative stare youre in some difficult territory here he said i know that turk said could get dangerous i guess thats what im afraid of can you give me some time to think this over guess so turk said okay ill ask around call me in a couple of days i appreciate it turk said thank you dont thank me yet tomas said maybe ill change my mind chapter seven the node in lises car announced new mail as she was driving to the consulate from lise asked susan adams the node replied these days lise could not think of her mother without visualizing that calendarbox of pharmaceuticals on her kitchen counter assorted by day and hour the clockwork of her mortality pills for depression pills to adjust her blood cholesterol pills to avert the alzheimers for which she carried a suspect gene read she said grimly dear lise the nodes voice was male indifferent offering up the text with all the liveliness of a frozen fish thank you for your latest it is somewhat reassuring after what ive seen on the news the ashfall she meant which still clogged the side streets and had caused thousands of tourists to flee to their cruise ships begging for a quick ride home people who had come to equatoria hoping to find a landscape pleasingly strange but who had stumbled into something altogether differentreal strangeness the kind that didnt negotiate with human preconceptions precisely how her mother would have reacted lise thought all i can think of is how far away you are and how inaccessible you have made yourself no i wont start that old argument again and i wont say a word about your separation from brian susan adams had argued fiercely against the divorceironically since she had argued almost as fiercely against the marriage at first lises mother had disliked brian because he worked for genomic securitygenomic security in susan adams mind being represented by the terse and unhelpful men who had hovered around her after her husbands incomprehensible disappearance lise must not marry one of these compassionless monsters she had insisted but brian was not compassionless in fact brian had charmed lises mother had patiently dismantled her objections until he became a welcome presence brian had quickly learned the paramount rule in dealing with lises mother that one did not mention the new world the hypotheticals the spin or the disappearance of robert adams in susan adams household these subjects had acquired the power of profanity which was one reason lise had been so anxious to leave that household behind and there had been much anxiety and resistance after the wedding when brian was transferred to port magellan you must not go lises mother had said as if the new world were some ghostly otherness from which no one emerged undamaged no not even for the sake of brians career should they enter that perdition this was of course an ongoing act of denial a forcible exile of unacceptable truths a strategy her mother had devised for containing and channeling her unvented grief but that was precisely why lise resented it lise hated the dark space into which her mother had walled these memories memory was all that was left of lises father and that memory surely included his wideeyed fascination with the hypotheticals and his love of the planet into which they had opened their perplexing doorway even the ashfall would have fascinated him lise thought those cogs and seashells embedded in the dust pieces in a grand puzzle i simply hope that these events convince you of the wisdom of coming home lise if money is a problem let me book you a ticket i admit that california is not what it once was but we can still see the ocean from the kitchen window and although the summers are warm and the winter storms more intense than i remember them being surely thats a small thing compared to what you are presently enduring you dont know lise thought what im enduring you dont care to know in the afternoon sunlight the american consulate looked like a benevolent fortress set behind a moat of wroughtiron fences someone had planted a garden along the runnels of the fence but the recent ashfall hadnt been kind to the flowersnative flowers because you werent supposed to bring terrestrial plants over the arch not that the ban was especially effective the flowers that had survived the ashfall were sturdy red whoreslips in the crude taxonomy of the first settlers stems like enamelled chopsticks and leaves like victorian collars enfolding the tattered blooms there was a guard at the consulate door next to a sign that advised visitors to check all weapons personal electronics and unsealed bottles or containers this was not a new drill for lise who had regularly visited brian at the genomic security offices before the divorce and she remembered riding past the consulate as a teenager during her fathers time here remembered how reassuring and strong the building had seemed with its high white walls and narrow embrasures the guard called brians office for confirmation and issued her a visitors badge she rode the elevator to the fifth floor midbuilding a tiled windowless hallway the labyrinth of bureaucracy brian stepped into the corridor as she approached and held open the door marked simply dgs brian she thought was somehow changeless carefully dressed still trim in his midthirties tanned he took weekend hikes in the hills above the port he smiled briefly as a way of greeting her but his demeanor today was stiffsort of a wholebody frown lise thought she braced herself for whatever was coming brian bossed a staff of three people but none of them was present come on in he said sit down we have to have a little discussion im sorry but well get this out of the way as quickly as possible even at this juncture he was unfailingly nice the quality she had found most frustrating in him the marriage had been bad from the beginning not a disaster so much as a bad choice compounded by more bad choices some of which she was reluctant to admit even to herself worse because she couldnt confess her unhappiness in any way brian was liable to understand brian went to church every sunday brian believed in decency and propriety and brian despised the complexity and weirdness of the postspin world and that ultimately was what lise could not abide she had had enough of that from her mother she wanted instead the quality her father had tried so hard to communicate to her on those nights when they looked at the stars awe or failing that at least courage brian had occasional charm he had earnestness he had buried in him a deep and poignant seriousness of purpose but he was afraid of what the world had become and that in the end she could not abide she sat down he pulled a second chair across the carpet and sat facing her kneetoknee this might not be the pleasantest conversation we ever had he said but were having it for your sake lise please try to remember that turk arrived at the airport that afternoon still pondering his talk with tomas and intending to inspect his aircraft before he went home for the night turks little skyrex twinengine fixedwing prop plane was nearly five years old and needed repairs and maintenance more often than it used to it had lately been fitted with a new fuel injector and turk wanted to see for himself what the mechanics had done so he parked in his usual space behind the cargo building and crossed a patch of tarmac turned woolengray by ash and rain but when he reached the hangar he found the door padlocked tucked behind the latch was a note advising him to see mike arundji not much question what this was about turk owed two months rent on his hangar space and was in arrears for maintenance but he was friendly with mike arundjimost of the time anyhowand he walked into the owners office rehearsing his usual excuses it was a ritual dance the demand the apology the token payment though even that was going to be tight another reprieve although the padlock was a new touch this time the older man looked up from his desk with an expression of deep regret the lock he said immediately yeah im sorry about that but i dont have a choice here i have to run my business like a business its the ash turk said i lost a couple of charters to it otherwise youd be paid by now so you say and im not disputing it but what difference would a couple of charters make longterm you have to ask yourself this isnt the only small airport in the district ive got competition in the old days it was okay to be a little loose cut everybody some slack it was all semiamateurs independents like you now there are corporate charter companies bidding up hangar space even if the books balanced id be taking a loss on you thats just a fact i cant make money if i cant fly my plane mike the trouble is i cant make money whether you fly it or not seems like you do okay i have a payroll to meet i have a whole new raft of regulations coming down from the provisional government if you looked at my spreadsheets you wouldnt tell me im doing okay my accountant doesnt come in here and tell me im doing okay and you probably dont call your accountant an amateur turk thought mike arundji was an old hand he had opened up this strip when there was nothing south of port magellan but fishing villages and squatters camps even a halfdozen years ago the word spreadsheet would have been foreign to his vocabulary that was the kind of environment in which turk had arranged for the importat eyebulging expenseof his sixseater skyrex and it had made him a modest little living at least until recently he no longer owed money on it unfortunately he seemed to owe money on everything else so what do i have to do to get my plane back in the air arundji shifted in his chair and wouldnt meet turks eye come in tomorrow well talk about it worse comes to worst it wouldnt be hard to find a buyer findwhat a buyer a buyer you know people are interested sell the plane pay your debts start fresh people do that it happens all the time turk said not to me calm down we dont necessarily have conflicting interests here i can help you get a premium price i mean if it comes to that and shit turk youre the one whos always talking about hiring onto a research boat and sailing somewhere maybe this is the time who knows your confidence is inspiring think about it is what im saying talk to me in the morning i can pay what i owe you can you okay no problem bring me a certified check and well forget about it to which turk had no answer go home arundji said you look tired buddy first brian said i know you were with turk findley what the hell lise said promptly hold on let me finish what you had somebody follow me i couldnt do that if i wanted to lise what then brian took a breath his pursed lips and narrowed eyes were meant to announce that he found this as unpleasant as she did lise there are other people at work here she made an effort to control her own breathing she was already angry and in a way the anger was not unwelcome it beat feeling guilty the mood in which her encounters usually left her what people let me just remind you of the larger issues he said bear with me its easy to forget whats at stake the nature and definition of the human genome of what we are as a people all of us thats been put at risk by everything from the cloning trade to these martian longevity cults and there are people in every government in the world who spend a lot of time thinking about that his credo the same justification lise recalled that he had once offered to her mother what does that have to do with me or turk for that matter you came to me with an old snapshot taken at one of your dads faculty parties so i ran it through the database you offered to run it through the database i offered okay and we pulled an image from the dockland security cameras but when you run a check like that the query gets bumped around a little bit and i guess something rang a bell somewhere within the last week weve had people from washington show up here what do you mean dgs people dgs people right but very senior people working out of levels of the department lightyears above what we do here people who are deeply interested in finding the woman in the picture people interested enough to sail out of djakarta and knock on my door lise sat back in her chair and tried to absorb all this after a long moment she said my mother showed the same snapshot to dgs back when my father disappeared nobody made a fuss about it then that was a decade ago other information has turned up since the same face in a different context more than that i cant say id like to talk to these people if they know anything about sulean moi nothing that would help you find out what happened to your father how can you be sure of that try to put it in perspective lise these people are doing an important job they mean business i went out of my way to convince these guys not to talk to you but you gave them my name i told them everything i know about you because otherwise they might think youre involved inwell what theyre investigating which would be a waste of their time and a hardship for you honestly lise you have to keep a low profile on this one theyre watching me is that what youre trying to say theyre watching me and they know i was with turk he winced at the name but nodded they know those things yes jesus brian he raised his hands in a gesture that looked like surrender all im saying is when i stand back from all thisfrom what our relationship is and what i would like it to bewhen i ask myself what would really be best for youmy advice is to let this go stop asking questions maybe even think about heading back home back to california i dont want to go home think about it is all im saying theres only so much i can do to protect you i never asked you to protect me maybe we can talk about this again when youve given it some consideration she stood up or maybe not and maybe we can talk about turk findley and whats going on in that department in that department poor brian unfailingly prim even when he was rebuking her she thought about defending herself she could say we were having dinner when the ash fell she could say of course he came home with me what was he supposed to do sleep in his car she could lie and say were just friends or she could say i went to bed with him because hes unafraid and unpredictable and his fingernails arent impeccably clean and he doesnt work for the fucking dgs she was angry humiliated not a little guiltstricken its not your business anymore you need to figure that out brian and turned and left turk went home to fix himself dinner some shiftless meal appropriate to his mood he lived in a tworoom bungalow set among similar cabins on a barelypaved road near arundjis airfield on a bluff overlooking the sea maybe someday this would be expensive real estate currently it was offgrid the toilet fed a cesspool and his electricity came from sunlight and a generator in a back shed every summer he repaired his shingles and every winter they leaked from a new angle the sun was setting over the foothills west of him and to the east the sea had turned an inky shade of blue a few fishing boats straggled toward the harbor to the north the air was cool and there was a breeze to carry off the remnant stink of the ash the ash had settled in windrows around the foundations of the cabin but the roof seemed to have borne up under the strain his shelter was intact there wasnt much food in the kitchen cupboards however less than he remembered it was canned beans or go out for groceries or spend money he didnt have in some restaurant he couldnt afford lost my plane he thought but no not really not yet the plane was only embargoed not yet sold but there was nothing in his bank account to offer a convincing counterargument so that little mantra had been running through his head since he left mike arundjis office lost my plane he wanted to talk to lise but he didnt want to dump his problems on her it still seemed unlikely that he had hooked up with her at all his relationship with lise was something fortune had dropped in his lap fortune had done him few favors in the past and he wasnt sure he trusted it cornmeal coffee beer he decided to give tomas another call maybe he hadnt explained too well what it was he wanted there was only one real favor he could do lise and that was to help her understand why her father had gone fourthwhich turk assumed was what had happened and if anyone could explain that to her or put it in a sane perspective it might be tomas and if tomas would put in a word for him ibu diane the fourth nurse who lived with the minang upcoast he ticked tomass number into his phone but there was no answer nor was the call dumped to voice mail which was odd because tomas carried his phone everywhere it was probably his most valuable possession turk thought about what to do next he could go over his accounts and try to rig up some accommodation with mike arundji or he could drive back into town maybe see lise if she wasnt sick of himmaybe check up on tomas on the way the sensible thing he guessed would be to stay home and take care of business if he had any real business to take care of he turned off the lights as he left lise drove away from the consulate feeling scalded that was the word precisely scalded dipped in hot water burned raw she drove aimlessly for more than an hour until the car registered the sunset and switched on its lights the sky had gone red one of those long equatorian sunsets made gaudier by the fine ash still lingering in the air she drove through the arab district past souks and coffee shops under piebald awnings and strings of colored lights the crowds dense this evening making up for time lost during the ashfall then up into the foothills the pricey neighborhoods where wealthy men and women from beijing or tokyo or london or new york built fauxmediterranean palaces in pastel shades belatedly she realized she was driving down the street where she had lived with her parents during her four adolescent years in this city and here was the house where she had lived when her family was still whole she slowed the car as she passed the house was smaller than she remembered and noticeably smaller than the wouldbe palaces that had grown up around it a cloth coat among minks she dreaded to think what it must rent for nowadays the whitepainted veranda was drenched in evening shadow and had been furnished by strangers this is where well be living for the next little while her mother had told her when they moved here from california but to lise it was never my house even when she was talking to friends at the american school it was where were staying her mothers preferred formulation at thirteen lise had been a little frightened of the foreign places she had seen on television and port magellan was all those foreign places jumbled together in a single overbrimming gumbo at least at first she had longed for lost california now she longed forwhat truth memory the extraction of truth from memory the roof of the house was dark with ash lise could not help picturing herself on the veranda in the old days sitting with her father she wished she could sit there with him now not to discuss brian or her problems but to speculate about the ashfall to talk about what robert adams had liked to call inevitably smiling as he said it the very large subjects the mysteries that lay beyond the boundary of the respectable world it was dark when she finally got home the apartment was still in disarray the dishes unwashed in the sink the bed unmade a little of turks aura still lingering she poured herself a glass of red wine and tried to think coherently about what brian had said about powerful people and their interest in the woman who had perhaps in some way seduced her father away from home was brian right when he said she should leave was there really anything meaningful left to extract from the shards of her fathers life or maybe she was closer than she realized to some fundamental truth and maybe that was why she was in trouble turk guessed there was something wrong when tomas failed to answer the second and third calls he placed from the car tomas might have been drinkinghe still drank though rarely to excessbut even drunk tomas usually answered his phone so turk approached the old mans trailer with some apprehension snaking his car through the dustchoked alleys of the flats at a cautious speed tomas was a fourth hence fairly hearty but not immortal even fourths grew old even fourths died tomas might be sick or he might be in some other kind of trouble there was often trouble in the flats a couple of filipino gangs operated out of the area and there were drug houses scattered through the neighborhood unpleasant things happened from time to time he parked his car by a noisy bodega and walked the last few yards to the corner of tomass muddy little street it was only just dark and there were plenty of people around canned music yammering from every other doorway but tomass trailer was dark the windows unlit could be the old man was asleep but no the door was unlocked and ajar turk knocked before he stepped inside even though he had a sour certainty that the gesture was pointless no answer he reached to his left switched on the overhead light and blinked the room had been trashed the table next to tomass chair was lying legsup the lamp in pieces on the floor the air still smelled of stale masculine sweat he made a cursory check of the back bedroom but it was likewise empty after a moments thought he left tomass small home and knocked at the door of the trailer next door an obese woman in a gray shift answered a mrs goudy lately widowed tomas had introduced her to turk once or twice and mrs goudy had been known to share a drink with the old man no mrs goudy hadnt heard from tomas lately but she had noticed a white van parked outside his trailer a little while ago was anything wrong i hope not when exactly did you see this van mrs goudy hour ago maybe two thank you mrs goudy i wouldnt worry about it best to keep your door locked though dont i know it mrs goudy said he went back to tomass place and closed the door making sure it was secure this time a wind had come up and it rattled the makeshift streetlight where tomass short walkway met the road shadows swayed fitfully he took his phone out of his pocket and called lise praying she would answer back at the apartment lise had her home node read aloud the remainder of her mothers letter the home unit at least had a female voice slightly if unconvincingly modulated please dont misunderstand lise im just worried about you in the usual motherly way i cant help thinking of you alone in that city alone yes trust her mother to strike at her vulnerable place alonebecause it was so hard to make anyone else understand what she wanted here and why it was so important to her putting yourself in danger a danger that seemed so much more real when you were as she said alone when you could be here at home safe or even with brian who who would show the same puzzled condescension that radiated from her mothers message would surely agree no doubt that theres no use digging up the dead past but what if the past wasnt dead what if she simply lacked the courage or callousness to put the past behind her had no choice but to pursue it until it yielded its last dividend of pain or satisfaction pause she said to the media node she couldnt take too much of this at one time not with everything else that was happening not when an alien dust had dropped out of the sky not when she was being tracked and possibly bugged by dgs for reasons not even brian would explain not when she was yes thanks mom for that little reminder alone she checked her other text messages they were junk except for one which turned out to be gold it was a note and an attachment sent by one scott cleland whom she had been trying to contact for months scott cleland was the only one of her fathers old university associates she hadnt yet succeeded in talking to he was an astronomer working with the geophysical survey at the observatory on mt mahdi she had just about given up on him but here at last was a response to her mail and a friendly one the node read it to her adopting a male voice to suit the given name dear lise adams im sorry to have been so slow in responding to your queries the reason far this is not just procrastination it took a little searching to find the attached document which may interest you i wasnt close to dr adams but we respected each others work as for the details of his life at that time and the other questions you asked im afraid i cant help you our connection was purely professional at the time of his disappearance however and as you probably know he had begun work on a book to be called planet as artifact he asked me to read the brief introduction he had written which i did but i found no errors and could suggest no significant improvements apart from a catchier title in case there was no copy of this among his papers i enclose the one he sent me robert adams disappearance was a great loss to all of us at the university he often spoke affectionately about his family and i hope your research brings you some comfort lise had the household node print the document contrary to what cleland suspected her father had not left a copy of the introduction with his papers or if he had lises mother had shredded it susan adams had shredded or discarded all of her husbands papers and had donated his books to the university part of what lise had come to think of as the ritual cleansing of the adams household she turned off her phone and poured a glass of wine and took the wine and the six pages of printed text out to the balcony the night was warm she had swept away the ash this morning and the indoor lamps cast enough light to read by after a few minutes she went back inside to fetch a pen came out again and began to underline certain phrases she underlined them not because they were new to her but because they were familiar many things changed during the interval we call the spin but perhaps the most farreaching change is also the most overlooked the earth was held in stasis for more than four billion years which means we now live in a universe vastly more ancientand more complexly evolvedthan the one to which we were accustomed familiar because in more polished prose these were the things he had often said to her when they sat on the veranda and looked out at the darkness and the stars any real understanding of the nature of the hypotheticals must take this into account they were ancient when we first encountered them and they are more ancient now since they cannot be observed directly we must make our deductions about them based on their work in the universe by the clues they leave behind them by their vast and abiding footprints here was the excitement she learned from him at an early age an outwardlooking curiosity that contrasted with her mothers habitual caution and timidity she could hear his voice in the words of their works one of the most immediately obvious is the indian ocean arch that links the earth to the new worldand the arch that connects the new world to another less hospitable planet and so on as far as we have been able to explore a chain of increasingly hostile environments made available to us for reasons we do not yet understand sail to the other side of this world he had told lise and youll find a second arch and beyond it a rocky stormy planet with barely breathable air and beyond thata journey that had to be undertaken on ocean vessels sealed and pressurized as if they were spaceshipsa third world its atmosphere poisoned with methane the oceans oily and acidic but the arch is not the only artifact at hand the planet next door to earth from which i write these words is also an artifact there is evidence that it was constructed or at least modified over the course of many millions of years with the objective of making it a congenial environment for human beings planet as artifact many have speculated about the purpose of this eonslong work is the new world a gift or is it a trap have we entered a maze as laboratory mice or have we been offered a new and splendid destiny does the fact that our own earth is still protected from the deadly radiation of its expanded sun mean that the hypotheticals take an interest in our survival as a species and if so why i cannot claim to have answered any of these questions but i mean to give the reader an overview of the work that has already been done and of the thoughts and speculations oj the men and women who are devoting their professional lives to that work and later in the piece this we are in the position of a coma patient waking from a sleep as long as the lifetime of a star what we cannot remember we must rediscover she underlined that twice she wished she could text it to her mother wished she could write it on a banner and wave it in brians face this was all she had ever meant to say to them an answer to their genteel silences to the almost surgical elision of robert adams from the lives of his survivors to the gently troubled poorlise expressions they wore on their faces whenever she insisted on mentioning her vanished father it was as if robert adams himself had stepped out of obscurity to whisper a reassuring word what we cannot remember we must rediscover she had put the pages aside and was heading for bed when she checked her phone one last time three messages were stacked there all tagged urgent all from turk a fourth came in while the phone was still in her hand part two the ocular rose chapter eight after the fall of the luminous dustafter the skies had cleared and the courtyard had been swept and the desert or the wind had absorbed what was left behindnews of another mystery came to the compound where the boy isaac lived the ash had been terrifying when it fell and had been a topic for endless talk and speculation when it stopped the newer mystery arrived more prosaically as a news report relayed from the city across the mountains it was less immediately frightening but it touched uneasily on one of isaacs secrets he had overheard two of the adults mr nowotny and mr fisk discussing it in the corridor outside the dining hall commercial flights to the oil wastes of the rub alkhali had been canceled or rerouted for days even before the ashfall and now the provisional government and the oil powers had issued an explanation there had been an earthquake this was a mystery mr nowotny went on to say because there were no known faults beneath that part of the rub alkhali it was a geologically stable desert craton that had persisted unchanged for millions of years there should never have been even a minor tremor so deep in the rub alkhali but what had happened was more than a tremor oil production had been shut down for more than a week and the wells and pipelines had been expensively damaged we know less about this planet than we thought we did mr nowotny said it was slightly less mysterious to isaac he knew though he could not say how that something was stirring under the sedate sands of the deep western desert he felt it in his mind his body something was stirring and it spoke in cadences he didnt understand and he could point to it with his eyes closed even though it was hundreds of miles away still only halfwaking from a slumber as long as the lives of mountains for two days during and after the ashfall everyone had stayed inside doors closed and windows locked until dr dvali announced that the ash wasnt particularly harmful eventually mrs rebka told isaac he could go out at least as far as the courtyard gardens as long as he wore a cloth mask the courtyard had been cleaned but there might still be remnant dust in the air and she didnt want him inhaling particulate matter he must not put himself at risk she said isaac agreed to wear the mask even though it was sweatily warm across his mouth and nose all that remained of the dust was a grainy residue silted against the brick walls and the rail fences made of nevergreen wood under a relentless afternoon sun isaac stooped over one of these small windrows and sifted the ash with his hand the ash according to dr dvali contained tiny fragments of broken machines not much remained of these machines to isaacs eyes but he liked the grittiness of the ash and the way it pooled in his palm and slipped like talc between his fingers he liked the way it compressed into a flaky lump when he squeezed it and dissolved into the air when he opened his fist the ash glittered in fact it glowed that wasnt exactly the right word isaac knew it wasnt the sort of glow you could see with your eyes and he understood that no one else in the compound could see it the way he did it was a different kind of glow differently perceived he thought perhaps sulean moi would be able to explain if he could find a way to pose the question isaac had a lot of questions he wanted to ask sulean but she had been busy since the ashfall often in conference with the adults and he had to wait his turn at dinner isaac noticed that when the adults discussed the ashfall or its origins they tended to direct their questions to sulean moi which surprised him because for years he had assumed the adults with whom he lived were more or less allknowing certainly they were wiser than average people he could not say this by direct experienceisaac had never met any average peoplebut he had seen them in videos and read about them in books average people seldom talked about anything interesting and often hurt each other savagely here in the compound the talk was occasionally intense but the arguments never drew blood everyone was wise or seemed to be everyone was calm or struggled to give that impression and except for isaac everyone was old sulean moi was apparently not an average person either somehow she knew more than the other adults she was smarter than the people to whom isaac had always deferred andeven more perplexingshe didnt seem to like them very much but she tolerated their questions politely dr dvali said of course it implicates the hypotheticals talking about the ashfall and asked sulean dont you agree its an obvious conclusion to draw the old woman probed the contents of her bowl with a fork the adults theoretically took turns cooking though a handful volunteered more often than the rest tonight mr posell had taken kitchen duty mr posell was a geologist but as a chef he was more enthusiastic than talented isaacs vegetable bowl tasted of garlic gulleyseed oil and something dreadfully burnt have you seen or heard of anything like it dr dvali asked in your own experience there was no formal hierarchy among the adults at the commune but it was usually dr dvali who took the lead when large issues arose dr dvali whose pronouncements when he made them were considered final he had always paid close attention to isaac the hair on his head was white and silkyfine his eyes were large and brown his eyebrows wild as abandoned hedges isaac had always tolerated him indifferently lately however and for reasons he didnt understand isaac had begun to dislike him sulean said nothing exactly like this but my people have had a little more experience with the postspin world than yours dr dvali unusual things do fall out of the sky from time to time and who were my people and what sky was she talking about one of these things conspicuously absent from the martian archives dr dvali said is any discussion of the nature of the hypotheticals perhaps there was nothing substantive to say you must have an opinion ms moi the selfreplicating devices that constitute the hypothetical are equivalent in many ways to living creatures they process their environment they build complicated structures out of rock and ice and perhaps even empty space and their byproducts arent immune to the process of decay their physical structures grow old and corrupt and are systematically replaced that would explain the detritus in the dust corrupt machines have fallen on us isaac thought but the sheer tonnage of it dr dvali said distributed over so many square kilometers is that so surprising given the great age of the hypotheticals its no more surprising that decomposed mechanisms should fall out of the sky than that your garden should generate organic mulch she sounded so sure of herself but how did sulean know such things isaac was determined to find out that night the quick southern winds grew even quicker and isaac lay in bed listening to his window rattle in its casement beyond the glass the stars were obscured by fine sand blown aloft from the wastelands of the rub alkhali old old old the universe was old it had generated many miracles including the hypotheticals but not least isaac himselfhis body his very thoughts who was his father who was his mother his teachers had never really answered the question dr dvali would say youre not like other children isaac you belong to all of us or mrs rebka would say were all your parents now even though it was inevitably mrs rebka who tucked him into bed who made sure he was fed and bathed it was true that everyone at the commune had taken a hand in raising him but it was dr dvali and mrs rebka he pictured when he imagined what it might be like to have a particular mother and father was that what made him feel different from the people around him yes but not just that he didnt think the way other people thought and although he had many keepers he had no friends except perhaps sulean moi isaac tried to sleep but couldnt he was restless tonight it wasnt an ordinary restlessness more like an appetite without an object and after he had lain in bed for long hours listening to the hot wind rattle and whisper he dressed and left his room midnight had come and gone the commune was quiet the corridors and wooden stairs echoing the sound of his footsteps probably there was no one awake except dr taira the historian who did her best reading he had heard her say late at night but dr taira was a pale skinny woman who kept to herself and if she happened to be awake she didnt notice when isaac shuffled past her door from the lower commons room he entered the open courtyard unobserved his shoes crunched on the windblown grit underfoot the small moon hung over the eastern mountains and cast a diffuse light through the dustobscured darkness isaac could see well enough to walk at least if he was careful and he knew the environment around the commune so completely that he could have navigated blind he opened the squeaky gate in the courtyard fence and headed west he let his wordless impulses lead him and the wind carry away his doubts there was no road here just pebbly desert and a series of shallow serpentine ridges the moon aimed his shadow like an arrow in front of him but he was headed in the right direction he felt the tightness of it in the center of himself like the sense of relief he felt when he solved some vexing mathematical problem he deliberately set aside the noise of his own thinking and gave his attention to the sounds that came out of the darknesshis feet on the sandpaper gravel and the wind and the sounds of small nocturnal creatures foraging in the creviced landscape he walked in a state of blissful emptiness he walked for a long time he could not have said how long or far he had walked when he came at last to the rose the rose startled him into a sudden awareness had he had been walking in his sleep the moon which had been above the mountains when he left home now lit the flat western horizon like a watchmans lantern although the night air was relatively cool he felt hot and exhausted he looked away from the moon and back at the rose which grew from the desert at his feet rose was his own word it was what came to mind when he saw the thick stem rooted in the dry ground the glassy crimson bulb that could pass in the moonlight for a flower of course it wasnt really a flower flowers didnt grow in isolation in arid deserts and their petals werent made of what appeared to be translucent red crystals hello isaac said his voice sounding small and foolish in the darkness what are you doing here the rose which had been leaning toward the moonlit west promptly swiveled to face him there was an eye in the middle of the bloom a small eye black as obsidian and it regarded him coolly perhaps not surprisinglyisaac wasnt surprisedit was sulean moi who eventually found him it was a still hot morning by the time she arrived and he sat on the ground as if the desert were a vast curved bowl and he had slid to the center of it he cradled his head in his hands and rested his elbows on his knees he heard the sound of her shuffling approach but he didnt look up he didnt have to he had hoped she would come for him isaac sulean moi said her voice dry but gentle he didnt answer people are worried about you she said theyve been looking everywhere im sorry she put her small hand on his shoulder what caused you to come all this way from home what were you after i dont know he gestured at the rose but i found this now sulean knelt to look at itslowly slowly her old knees crackling the rose had suffered by daylight its dark green stem had buckled at dawn the crystalline bulb was no longer radiant and the eye had lost its luster last night isaac thought it had been something like alive now it was something like dead sulean gazed at it thoughtfully a long while before she asked what is it isaac i dont know is this what you came out here for no i dont think so that was an incomplete answer the rose yes but not only the rose something the rose represented its remarkable she said shall we tell anyone about this isaac or shall we keep it secret he shrugged well we do have to go back you know i know he didnt mind leavingthe rose wouldnt last much longer will you walk with me yes isaac said if i can ask you some questions all right i hope i can answer them ill try so they turned away from the ocular rose and began to walk eastward at the old womans pace and sulean was patient while isaac began to assemble all the uncertainties that had come into his head not least the question of the rose itself although he hadnt slept he wasnt tired he was wide awakeas awake as he had ever been and more curious where are you from he finally asked there was a brief hitch in the rhythm of her footsteps he thought for a moment she might not answer then i was born on mars she said that felt like a true answer it wasnt the answer he had expected and he had the feeling it was a truth she would have preferred not to reveal isaac accepted it without comment mars he thought a moment later he asked how much do you know about the hypotheticals thats odd the old woman said smiling faintly and regarding him with what he took to be affection thats exactly what i came all this way to ask you they talked until noon when they reached the compound and isaac learned a number of new things from their conversation then before stepping past the gate he paused and looked back the way he had come the rose was out there but not just the rose the rose was onlywhat an incomplete fragment of something much larger something that interested him deeply and something that was interested in him chapter nine turk drove through one of the older parts of the city frame houses painted firetruckred by chinese settlers squat three and fourstory apartment buildings of ochre brick quarried from the cliffs above candle bay it was late enough now that the streets were empty overhead an occasional shooting star wrote lines against the dark half an hour ago he had finally gotten through to lise he couldnt say what he needed to say over the phone but she seemed to catch on after a couple of awkward questions meet me where we met he said twenty minutes where they had met was a hour barandgrill called la rive gauche located in the retail district west of the docks lise had shown up there six months ago with a crowd from the consulate a friend of turks had spotted a friend at the table and hauled him over for introductions turk noticed lise because she was unescorted and because she was attractive in the way he found women attractive at first glance based on the depth and availability of her laughter as much as anything else he was wary of women who laughed too easily and unnerved by women who never laughed at all lise laughed gently but wholeheartedly and when she joked there was nothing mean or competitive in it and he liked her eyes the way they turned up at the corners the pale aqua of the irises what they looked at and lingered on later she started talking about a trip she was planning across the mountains to kubelicks grave and turk gave her one of his business cards makes more sense than driving he said really youd have to go by way of the mahdi pass but the road isnt a hundred percent reliable this time of year theres a bus but its crowded and it slides into a gully every now and then he asked her what she wanted in a crappedout little fillingstation town like kubelicks grave and she said she was trying to locate an old colleague of her fathers a man named dvali but she wouldnt elaborate and that was probably the end of it turk thought strangers in the night passing ships et cetera but she had called a couple of days later and booked a flight he hadnt been looking for a loverno more than he ever was he just liked the way she smiled and the way he felt when he smiled back and when they were forced to wait out that offseason storm on the shore of a mountain lake it was as if they had been granted a free pass from god which had been revoked apparently karma had come calling there was only the night staff at the bar and all the tables were empty and the waitress who brought turk a menu looked irritable and eager to go offshift lise showed up a few minutes later turk immediately wanted to tell her about tomass disappearance and what that might mean the possibility that his connection with lise had led someone nasty to tomas but he hadnt started to rehearse the words when she launched into the story of her runin with her exhusband brian gatelywhich was also pertinent turk had met brian gately a couple of times that was the interesting thing about docklands places like la rive gauche you saw american businessmen sitting next to merchant sailors saudi oil executives sharing gossip with chinese salarymen or unwashed artists from the arrondissements brian gately had seemed like one of those temporary transplants common enough in this part of town a guy who could travel around the worldtwo worldswithout really leaving dubuque or wherever it was he had been raised nice enough in a bland way as long as you didnt challenge any of his preconceptions but tonight lise said brian had threatened her she described her meeting with him and finished so yes it was a threat not from brian directly but he was communicating what hed been told and it adds up to a threat so there are dgs people in town who have a particular interest in fourths especially the woman in the photo and they know where ive been and who ive talked to the implications of that are fairly obvious i mean i dont think anyone followed me here but they might have or planted a locator in my car or something i have no way of knowing all that was possible turk thought lise he said gently it might be worse worse theres a friend of mine a guy ive known a long time his name is tomas ginn hes a fourth thats not public information but hes pretty upfront about it if he trusts a person i thought you might like to talk to him but i had to clear that with him first i visited him this morning he promised to think about it but when i called him tonight i couldnt get hold of him and when i went to his place he was gone abducted apparently some people in a white van took him away she looked at him wideeyed and said oh christ she shook her head he was what arrested not formally arrested no only the provisional government has the power to make an arrest and they dont do plainclothes warrantless raidsnot to my knowledge so he was kidnapped thats a reportable crime im sure it is but the police are never going to hear about it tomas is vulnerable because of what he is a blood test would prove hes a fourth and that in itself is enough to get him shipped back to the states and put on permanent probation or worse a neighbor told me about the men in the van but shed never say any of that to a government official where my friend lives his neighbors are generally people with a lot of exposure on legal groundsa lot of what people do for a living in tomass neighborhood is prohibited under the accords and most of them are squatting on land they dont have title to you think brian knows something about this maybe or maybe not it sounds like brians pretty far down the pecking order the genomic security office at the consulate is kind of a joke compared to what they do back home they run facialrecognition software at the ports and occasionally serve a warrant on some fugitive dogcloner or blackmarket geneenhancer but thats about it at least until now she paused what he told me was that it would be smart for me to go home back to the states maybe hes right you think i should leave if youre concerned about your safety and probably you ought to be she sat up straighter obviously im concerned about my safety but im concerned about other things too im here for a reason clearly these people dont fuck around lise they followed you and it would be wise to assume theyre the people who kidnapped tomas and theyre interested in the woman in the photograph sulean moi so they might imagine youre involved in some way thats the danger thats what brian was trying to tell you i am involved turk registered her determination and decided he wouldnt press her on it at least not tonight well maybe you dont have to leave maybe you just need to lay low for a little while if i hide i cant do my work if you mean talking to people who knew your father and asking questions about fourths no you cant do that obviously but theres no disgrace in keeping quiet until we figure this out is that what youd do fuck no turk thought what i would do is pack my case and catch the next bus out of town which was what he had always done when he felt threatened no point in saying that to lise though briefly he wondered if that was why lises father had vanished maybe the idea of fourthness had seemed like a door out of whatever secret sin he couldnt endure or maybe he didnt take up the offer of artificial longevity at all maybe he just walked people did turk shrugged lise was looking at him with a sad intensity he felt in his throat so youre telling me brians right and i ought to go back to the states i regret every minute were not together but i hate the idea of you getting hurt she looked at him a while longer two more couples had just come through the doorprobably tourists but who could tell their privacy was compromised she reached across the table and touched his hand lets go for a walk she said really he thought all we know about each other is a handful of stories and thumbnail sketches the short version of everything before tonight it was all that had seemed necessary their best conversations had been wordless suddenly that wasnt enough where are you parked she asked the lot around the corner me too but i dont know if i should use my car it might be tagged with a tracking device or something more likely they bugged mine if they were following me this morning i would have led them straight to tomas and tomas an old man living handtomouth out in the flats would have been an easy target a quick blood testno doubt forcibly appliedwould have revealed him as a fourth and then all bets were off why would they do that though why take him away to interrogate him i cant think of any other reason they think he knows something if theyre serious they would have given him a hemo test as soon as they were through the door no genomic securityif were assuming thats whos responsibledoesnt work like that even here there are limits you cant steal people away and interrogate them for no reason well i guess they thought they had a reason but lise what you read about genomic security in press releases isnt the whole story that agencys bigger than brians little piece of it when they break up a cloning ring or bust some longevity scam it makes the news but they do other things that arent so public you know this for a fact its what ive heard from fourths wellfrom tomas for example unofficial kidnappings this is insane to which he had no answer i dont want to go back to my apartment she said and i guess it wouldnt be any safer at your place and i havent dusted turk said just to see a ghost of a smile pass across her lips we could rent a room that doesnt guarantee they wont find us if they want us lise they can probably have us it may be possible to change that but for now were better off assuming they know where we are but i doubt theyll do anything drastic at least not right away its not you theyre after and youre not the kind of person they can just pick up and work over so what do you want to do lise whats your next step i want to do what i should have done months ago whats that i want to find avram dvali they walked along the undulating pavement toward the harbor lights and the faint clang of cargo containers cycling through the quays the streets were empty and lonesome and the remnant dust caked on curbs and walls muffled the sound of their footsteps turk said you want to go to kubelicks grave yes all the way this time will you take me there maybe but theres someone we ought to talk to first and lise there are things you ought to do if youre serious about this let someone you trust know where you are and whats happening take out enough cash to keep you for a while and then dont touch your ecredit things like that she gave him that halfsmile again what did you do take a course in criminal behavior it comes naturally another thing i can afford the time and money it takes to go underground for a while but you have work to do you have a business to run thats not a problem im serious so am i and thats the difference between us turk thought she had a purpose she was committed to finishing this postmortem on her fathers disappearance he was just putting on his shoes and walking not for the first time and in all likelihood not for the last he wondered if she knew that about him chapter ten the senior genomic security operatives who had lately arrived from the states were named sigmund and weil and brian gatelys teeth clenched every time the two men came to the dgs offices at the consulate they came in this morning not half an hour after brian arrived for work he felt his molars grinding sigmund was tall sepulchral flinty weil was six inches shorter and stout enough that he probably bought his pants at a specialty store weil was capable of smiling sigmund was not they advanced toward brian where he stood by the water cooler mr gately sigmund said and weil said can we talk to you privately in my office brians office wasnt large but it had a window overlooking the consulates walled garden the cubicle was equipped with a filing cabinet a desk of native wood enough floating memory to accommodate the library of congress a few times over and a plastic ficus the desk was covered with correspondence between genomic security and the provisional government one small tributary of the information stream that circulated between the two domains like an eternal sludgy nile brian sat in his customary chair weil plumped down in the guest chair and sigmund stood with his back to the door like a carrion bird sinister in his patience you talked to your exwife weil said i did i told her what you asked me to tell her it doesnt seem to have done any good do i have to tell you she reconnected with turk findley no brian said flatly i dont suppose you do theyre together right now sigmund said sigmund was a man of few words all of them unwelcome in all probability her and him but the point weil said is that we cant currently locate either of them brian wasnt sure whether to believe that weil and sigmund represented the executive action committee of the department of genomic security much of what the executive action committee did was highly classified hence the stuff of legend back home they could write themselves constitutional waivers with more or less automatic judicial approval here in equatoriain the overlapping magisteria of the united nations provisional government contending national interests and monied oil powerstheir work was at least theoretically more constrained brian wasnt an idealist he knew there were levels and echelons of genomic security to which he would never be admitted realms where policy was made and rules were defined but on the scale at which he worked brian thought he performed useful if unexciting work criminals often fled from the us to equatoria criminals whose misdeeds fell under the aegis of genomic securitycloning racketeers peddlers of false or lethal longevity treatments fourth cultists of a radical stripe purveyors of enhancements to couples willing to pay for superior children brian did not pursue or apprehend those criminals but what he did doliaising with the provisional government smoothing ruffled feathers when jurisdictional disputes arosewas essential to their apprehension it was tricky the relationship between a quasipolice organization attached to a national consulate and the unsponsored local government you had to be polite you had to make certain reciprocal gestures you couldnt just wade in and offend everybody although apparently these guys could and that was disappointing because brian believed in the rule of law the inevitably imperfect confusing grindingly inefficient occasionally corrupt but absolutely essential rule of law that without which we are no better than the beasts etc he had run his office that way carefully cleanly and now here came sigmund and weil the tall one sour as angostina bitters and the short one hard but hale like a velvetwrapped bowling ball to remind him that at altitudes more vertiginous than his own the law could be tailored to suit a circumstance youve already been a big help weil said well i hope so i want to be putting us in touch with the right people at the provisional government and of course this thing with lise adams the fact that you had a personal relationship with this womani mean awkward is hardly the word for it thank you for noticing brian said stupidly grateful even though he knew he was being played and i can assure you again that we dont want to arrest her or even necessarily talk to her directly lise is definitely not the target in this case youre looking for the woman in the photograph which of course is why we dont want lise getting underfoot we hoped you could get that idea across to her i tried i know and we appreciate it but let me tell you how this works brian so you understand what our concerns are because when your image search came up on our database it definitely raised eyebrows you said lise explained to you why shes interested in sulean moi sulean moi was seen with lises father before he disappeared and she wasnt connected to the university or anyone else in the familys social circle given lises fathers interest in fourths its an obvious connection to make lise suspects the woman was a recruiter or something the truth is a little more bizarre you deal with fourths on a regular basis legally speaking no surprises for you there but the longevity treatment is only one of the medical modifications that were brought to earth by our martian cousins brian nodded were after something a little bigger than the usual fourth cultist here weil said details are scarce and im not a scientist but it involves a biologically mediated attempt at communicating with the hypothetical like many of his generation brian tended to wince at mention of the hypotheticals or for that matter the spin the spin had ended before he was old enough to attend school and the hypotheticals were simply one of the more abstruse facts of daily life an important but airy abstraction like electromagnetism or the motions of the tides but like everyone else he had been raised and educated by spin survivors people who believed they had lived through the most momentous turning point in human history and maybe they had the aftershocks of the spinwars religious movements and countermovements a generalized human insecurity and a corrosive global cynicismwere still shaping the world mars was an inhabited planet and mankind had been admitted into a labyrinth as large as the sky itself all these changes had no doubt been confounding to those who endured them and would be felt for centuries to come but they had also become a license for an entire generations lunacy and that was less easy for brian to excuse many millions of otherwise rational men and women had reacted to the spin with a shocking display of irrationality mutual distrust and outright viciousness now those same people felt entitled to the respect of anyone brians age or younger they didnt deserve it lunacy wasnt a virtue and decency didnt boast decency in fact was what brians generation had been left to rebuild decency trust and a certain decorum in human behavior the hypotheticals were the causal agent behind the spin why would anyone want to communicate with them what would that even mean and how could it be achieved by a biological modification even a martian one what this technology does sigmund said is modify a human nervous system to make it sensitive to the signals the hypotheticals use to communicate among themselves basically they create a kind of human intermediary a communicant who can translate between our species and whatever the hypothetical are they actually did this the martians wont say it may have been attempted on their planet maybe more than once but we believe the technology like the longevity treatment was carried to earth by wun ngo wen and released into the general population so why havent i heard more about it because its not something universally desirable like an extra forty years of life if our intelligence is correct its lethal if attempted on an adult human being it may be what killed jason lawton way back when so what good is it if its lethal it may not be lethal weil said if the pharmaceuticals are delivered to a human being in utero the developing embryo builds itself around the biotech the human and the alien growing together jesus brian said to do that to a child its profoundly unethical obviously you know at the department we spend a lot of time worrying about fourths about the harm that can come from cultists engineering changes in human biology and thats a real legitimate problem but this is so much more shocking really deeply evil is the only word for it has anybody actually done this on earth well thats what were looking into so far we have very little hard evidence or eyewitness testimony but where we do one person appears many names but just one person one face you want to guess who that is the woman in the photograph the woman who had been seen with lises father so sulean moi shows up on facialrecognition data from the docks at port magellan and when we arrive to investigate we find lise who has a prior connection has been going over this same ground talking to her fathers old colleagues and so forth for perfectly legitimate reasons granted shes curious its a family mystery she thinks knowing the truth would make her feel better but that leaves us with a problem do we interfere with her do we let her go on doing what shes doing and just sort of supervise do we warn her that shes in dangerous territory warning her didnt work brian said so we have to make use of her in some other way make use of her instead of physically arresting herwhich is what some of my superiors have been advocatingwe think a waitandwatch approach might be more informative in the long run shes already connected with other persons of interest one of them is turk findley turk findley the freelance pilot and general fuckup bad as it was that brian had not been able to sustain his marriage to lise how much worse that she had taken up with someone so wayward dysfunctional and generally useless to his fellow man turk findley was another variety of fallout from the spin brian thought a maladapted human being a purposeless drifter possibly something worse if sigmunds implication was correct youre saying turk findley has some connection to this elderly woman apart from the fact that she once chartered a flight with him well thats certainly suggestive right there but turk has other contacts almost as suspicious known and suspected fourths and hes a criminal did you know that he left the united states with a warrant on him warrant for what he was a person of interest in a warehouse fire what are you telling me hes an arsonist the case lapsed but he may have burned down his old mans business i thought his father was an oil man his father worked in turkey at one time and had some connections with aramco but he made most of his money on an import business some kind of bad blood between the two the old mans warehouse burns down turk skips the country you can draw your own conclusions it just gets worse brian thought so we have to get lise away from him she might be in danger we suspect shes been drawn into something she doesnt understand we doubt shes under any kind of duress shes cooperating with this man it was probably turk who told her to stop taking calls but you can find them right sooner or later but were not magicians we cant just conjure them out of the void then tell me how i can help brian couldnt help adding if youd been straight with me about this before i talked to her would you have done anything differently we cant just hand out this kind of information and neither can you brian just so you know were taking you into our confidence here none of this is to be discussed except between you me and sigmund of course not but what wed like you to do is keep trying to get in touch with her she may be aware of your calls even if she isnt answering them she might eventually feel guilty or lonely and decide to talk to you and if she does all we want right now is a clue to her location if you can talk her into meeting you with or without turk that would be even better much as he disliked the idea of handing her over to the executive action committee surely that was better than letting her get more deeply involved in some criminal enterprise ill do what i can brian said great weil grinned we appreciate that the two men shook brians hand and left him alone in his office he sat there a long time thinking chapter eleven the upcoast roads hadnt been entirely cleared of the ashfall or the muck it made when it mixed with rain so turk had to pull over at a truckstop and rent a room while the route was plowed at some critical switchback by the overworked road crews of the provisional government the motel was a cinderblock barracks cut into the boundary of the forest dwarfed by spire willows that leaned across the building like sorrowing giants it was designed to cater to truckers and loggers lise gathered not tourists she ran her finger along the sill of their rooms small window and showed turk the line of dust probably from last week he said they dont spend a lot of money on housekeeping out this way dust of the gods then the debris of ancient hypothetical constructions thats what they were saying about it now the video news was full of poorlyinterpreted facts about the ashfall fragments of things that might once have been machines fragments of things that might once have been living organisms molecular arrangements of unprecedented complexity lise could hear voices from the room next door arguing in what sounded like filipino she took out her phone wanting another fix of the local broadcast news turk watched her closely and said remember no calls in or out i know we should reach the village by this time tomorrow turk said as long as the roads cleared overnight then we might actually learn something you have a lot of faith in this womandiane you said her name was not faith exactly she needs to know about tomas she might be able to do something to help him and shes been hooked into the local fourth network for a long timeits even possible she knows something about your father she had asked him how long he had been connected with fourths not connected exactly he said but this diane woman trusted him and he had done favors for her in the past it had been diane apparently who suggested turks charter business as a way of getting sulean moi to the mountains as discreetly as possible more than that turk did not know had not wanted to know lise looked again at the windowsill the dust lately i feel like its all connected every thing weird thats been happeningthe ash tomas whatevers going on out west the news broadcasts had begun reporting on the earthquake that had temporarily shut down the oil complexes of the rub alkhali its not necessarily connected turk said its just triplestrange what something tomas used to say weirdness comes in clusters like this time we were crewing a freighter in the strait of malacca one day we had engine trouble and had to anchor for repairs next day freakish weather a monsoon nobodyd predicted day after that the sky was clear but we were hosing malay pirates off the deck once things get strange tomas used to say you can pretty much count on triplestrange how comforting lise thought they shared a bed that night but they didnt make love both of them were tired and both of them lise thought were coming to terms with the truth that this wasnt a tent by a mountain lake and they werent having a harmless weekend adventure larger forces had been engaged people had been hurt and thinking about her father she began to wonder whether he might have stumbled into some similar wonderland of triplestrangeness maybe his disappearance had not been selfish or even voluntary maybe hed been abducted like turks friend tomas by anonymous men in an unmarked van turk was asleep as soon as he hit the mattress typically nevertheless it was good to lie beside him to feel his bulk at her side he had showered before bed and the smell of soap and maleness emanated from him like a benevolent aura had brian ever smelled like that not that she could recall brian had no particular smell beyond the chemical tang of whatever deodorant he happened to be using probably took some small degree of pride in being odorfree no that wasnt fair there was more to brian than that brian believed in an ordered life that didnt make him a monster or a villain and she couldnt believe he had been personally involved in tracking her movements or abducting tomas that wasnt playing by the book brian always played by the book not necessarily a bad thing if it made him less adventurous than turk it also made him more reliable brian would never fly a plane across a mountain or hire himself out as an ablebodied seaman on some rustriddled merchant vessel nor would he break a promise or violate an oath which was why it had been so hard to negotiate the conclusion of their hasty and unwise marriage lise had met brian when she was doing a journalism degree at columbia and he was a junior functionary in the new york offices of the dgs it was his gentleness and his sympathy that had won her over and she had only belatedly understood that brian would always be at her side but never quite on her sidethat in the end he was one more in the chorus of voices advising her to ignore her own history because its lacunae might conceal some unbearable truth but he had loved her innocently doggedly claimed he still did she opened her eyes and saw her phone where she had left it on the bedside table faintly glowing it had already registered several attempted calls from brian she had answered none of them that was also unfair necessary maybe she was willing to take turks word on that but not fair and not kind brian deserved better by morning a lane had been opened and they drove north for another four hours passing buses jitneys painted like circus caravans logging trucks freight trucks tank trucks loaded with refined oil or gasoline until turk turned west on one of the poorlymaintained side roads that diced through this part of the country like the lines on an old mans palm and suddenly they were in the wilderness the equatorian forest closed on them like a mouth it was only here away from the city and the farms and refineries and busy harbors that lise felt the alienness of this world the intrinsic and ancient strangeness that had fascinated her father the towering trees and dense ferny undergrowthplants for which lise did not know the folk names much less their provisional binomialswere supposedly related to terrestrial life their dna contained evidence of terrestrial ancestry the planet had been stocked and seeded by the hypothetical supposedly to make it habitable for human beings but the plans of the hypothetical were longterm to say the least they calculated events in the billions of years evolution must be a perceptible event to them maybe they couldnt even directly experience events as brief in their eyesif they had eyesas a human life lise found that idea oddly comforting she could see and feel things that for the hypotheticals must be vanishingly evanescent things as commonplace as the swaying of these strange trees above the road and the sunlight that speckled their shadows on the forest floor that was a gift she thought our mortal genius the sun tracked through finelyfeathered or fernlike leaves the underbrush was populated with wildlife much of which had not even yet learned to fear human beings she caught glimpses of jack dogs a striped ghoti a flock of spidermice the names usually referring to some earthly animal although the resemblance was often fanciful there were insects too humming or whining in the emerald shadows worst were the carrion wasps not dangerous but big and foulsmelling gnats which looked exactly like the gnats that used to hover in shady places back home swarmed among the mossy tree trunks turk drove with close attention to the unpaved road fortunately the dustfall here had been light and the canopy of the forest had absorbed most of it when the driving was critical turk was silent on the straightaways he asked about her father she had discussed this with him before but that had been before the dustfall and the strange events of the last few days how old were you exactly when your father disappeared fifteen a young fifteen naive and clinging to american fashions as a rebuke to the world into which she had been unwillingly imported braces on her teeth for gods sake the authorities take it seriously how do you mean just you know he wouldnt be the first guy to walk out on his family no offense he wasnt the type to walk out on us i know everybody says that in cases like this it was so unexpected and i was the loyal naive daughteri couldnt imagine him doing anything bad or thoughtless but its not just me he was fully engaged in his work at the university if he was leading a double life i dont know where he found the time for it supporting his family on a teachers salary we had money from my mothers side so i guess it wasnt hard to get the attention of the provisional government when he disappeared we had exinterpol men interviewing everybody an open police file but nothing ever came of it so your family contacted genomic security no they contacted us turk nodded and looked thoughtful while he maneuvered the vehicle through a shallow washout a threewheeled motorcycle passed in the opposite directionballoon tires high carriage a basket of vegetables strapped to the rear rack the driver some skinny local glanced at them incuriously anybody find that odd turk asked that genomic security came calling my father was researching fourth activity in the new world among other things so they were aware of him hed had talks with them before researching fourths for what purpose personal interest she said cringing at how incriminating that sounded really it was part of his whole fascination with the postspin worldhow people were adapting to it and i think he was convinced the martians knew more about the hypotheticals than they included in their archives and maybe some of that knowledge had been passed around by fourths along with the chemical and biological stuff but the genomic security people didnt turn up anything either no they kept the file open for a while longer or so they claimed but in the end they didnt have any more luck than the pg had the conclusion they obviously reached was that his research had gotten the better of himthat at some point he was offered the longevity treatment and took it okay but that doesnt mean he had to disappear people do though they take the treatment and assume a new identity it means not so many awt kward questions when your peers start to die off and you still look like the picture in your grad book the idea of starting a new life is attractive for a lot of people especially if theyre in some kind of personal or financial bind but my father wasnt like that people can carry around a fear of death and never let on lise they just live with it but if you show them a way out who knows how they might behave or who they might leave behind lise was silent for a moment over the hum of the cars engine she heard a minorkey melody trilling from the high canopy of the forest some bird she couldnt identify she said when i came back here i was prepared for that possibility im far from convinced that he just walked out on us but im not omniscient i cant know for sure what was going on in his mind if thats what happened okay ill deal with it i dont want revenge and if he did take the treatmentif hes living somewhere under a new namei can deal with that too i dont need to see him i just need to know or find somebody who does like the woman in the photograph sulean moi the woman you flew to kubelicks grave or like this diane who sent her to you i dont know how much diane can tell you more than i can anyhow i made it a point not to ask questions the fourths ive met theyre easy to like they dont strike me as sinister and as far as i can tell theyre not doing anything to put the rest of us in danger contrary to all that genomic security bullshit you hear on the news theyre just people people who know how to keep secrets ill grant you that turk said moments later they passed a crude wooden sign on which the name of the village had been written in several languages desa new sarandib town in approximate english half a mile farther on a skinny kid not much more than twenty years old lise guessed if that stepped into the road and waved them down he came to turks side of the car and leaned into the window going to sarandib the kids shrill voice made him seem even younger than he looked his breath smelled like rancid cinnamon headed that way turk said you got business there yeah what kind of business personal business you want to buy ky not a good place to buy ky ky was the hallucinogenic wax produced by some kind of native hive insect lately a big deal in the port magellan clubs i dont want any ky thanks anyhow turk stepped on the gasnot hard enough to injure the kid who ducked away promptly but hard enough to win him a nasty look lise glanced back and saw the kid still standing in the road glaring after them she asked turk what that was all about lately you get townies driving around the boondocks trying to score a gram or two getting robbed getting into trouble you think he wanted to sell us some i dont know what he wanted but the kid must have had a phone on him and he must have called ahead because as soon as they passed the first few inhabited shacks along the road and before they reached the town center the local gendarmerie two big men wearing improvised uniforms and driving a yearsold utility truck forced turks vehicle to the side of the road lise sat still and let turk do the talking you have business here one of the men asked we need to see ibu diane long pause no such person here okay turk said i must have made a wrong turn well stop and have lunch and then since theres no such person well be on our way the copif you could call him that lise thought because these smalltown constabularies had no standing with the provisional governmentgave turk a long sour look you have a name turk findley you can get a tea across the road i dont know about lunch he held up a single finger one hour they were seated at a table that appeared to have been made from an enormous discarded cable spool sweating in the afternoon heat and drinking tea from chipped ceramic cups while the other patrons of the cafe avoided their eyes when the curtains parted and a woman entered the room an old old woman her hair was the color and texture of dandelion fluff her skin so pale that it seemed in danger of tearing her eyes were unusually large and blue framed inside the stark contours of her skull she came to the table and said hello turk diane you know you really shouldnt have come back here this is a bad time i know turk said tomas was arrested or kidnapped or something the woman displayed no reaction beyond a barelyperceptible flinch and we have a couple of questions to ask if thats okay since youre here we may as well talk she pulled up a chair and said introduce me to your friend this woman is a fourth lise thought maybe that was why she generated this odd fragile authority to which strong men apparently deferred turk introduced her as ibu diane dupree using the minang honorific and lise accepted the womans small brittle hand it was like handling some unexpectedly muscular small bird lise diane said and you have a question for me show her the picture turk said so lise fumbled nervously in her pack until she came up with the envelope containing the photo of sulean moi diane opened the envelope and looked at the photograph for a long moment then she handed it back her expression was mournful so can we talk turk asked i think we have to but somewhere more private than this follow me ibu diane led them away from the cafe down a lane between a makeshift grocery store and a wooden municipal building with buffalohorn eaves past a gas station where the pumps were painted carnival colors lise would have expected a slow walk given dianes age and the heat of the day but the older woman moved briskly and at one point reached out and took lises hand to urge her along it was a strange gesture and it made lise feel like a little girl she took them to a cinderblock bunker on which a multilingual sign announced in its english portion medical clinic lise said are you a doctor im not even a registered nurse but my husband was a physician and he cared for these people for years long before the red crescent showed up in any of these villages i learned basic medicine from him and the villagers wouldnt let me retire after he died i can take care of minor injuries and sicknesses administer antibiotics salve a rash bind a wound for anything more serious i send people to the clinic down the highway have a seat they sat in the reception area of dianes clinic it was fitted out like a village parlor with wicker furniture and wooden slat blinds clattering in the breeze everything was painted or upholstered in faded green there was a watercolor picture of the ocean on one wall ibu diane smoothed her plain white muslin dress may i ask how you came to possess a photograph of this woman get to the point in other words her name is sulean moi i know you know her ive met her i recommended turks charter service to her tell her about your father turk suggested and lise did and she brought the story up to date how she had come back determined to learn more about the disappearance brian gatelys connection to genomic security how he had run her old snapshot of sulean moi through the agencys facialrecognition software and learned that the woman had reentered port magellan only months earlier that must have been the trigger diane said trigger your inquiriesor your exhusbandsprobably brought ms moi to someones attention back in the states genomic security has been looking for sulean moi for a long time why whats so important about her ill tell you what i know but would you answer some questions of mine first it might clarify matters go ahead lise said how did you meet turk i hired him to fly me over the mountains one of my fathers colleagues was known to have visited kubelicks grave at the time it was the only lead i had so i hired turk but we never made it across the mountains bad weather turk said and coughed into his hand i see then lise said when brian told me sulean moi had chartered a small plane just a few weeks before how did brian know this oh i suppose he arranged a search of the air traffic manifests or something like that lise said it was a lead i intended to follow up although brian urged me not to even then he thought i was getting in too deep while turk of course was fearless thats me turk said fearless but i hadnt got around to it and then there was the ashfall and then and then turk said tomas got himself disappeared and we found out lise was being followed and her phone service was tapped and im sorry diane but all i could think of was to come here i was hoping you could what intervene on your behalf what magic do you think i possess i thought turk said you might be able to explain i also didnt rule out the possibility of some useful advice diane nodded and tapped her chin with her forefinger her sandalclad foot counted a parallel rhythm on the wooden floor you could start lise said by telling us who sulean moi really is the first relevant fact about her diane said is that shes a martian the human civilization on mars had been a great disappointment to lises father that was another thing they had discussed those nights on the veranda when the sky had opened like a book above them robert adams had been a young manan undergraduate at cal tech during the lean years of the spin facing what had looked like the inevitable destruction of the world he knewwhen wun ngo wen arrived on earth the most spectacular success story of the spin had been the terraforming and colonization of mars using the expanding sun and the passage of millions of years in the external solar system as a kind of temporal lever mars had been rendered at least marginally habitable and seed colonies of human beings had been established there while a scant few years passed on earth behind its spin membrane civilizations on mars had risen and fallen even those bare factsunmentionable in the presence of lises mother who had lost her parents to the dislocations of the spin and would brook no discussion of ithad raised the hackles on lises neck she had learned all this in school of course but without the attendant sense of awe in robert adams hushed discourse the numbers had not been just numbers when he said a million years she could hear the distant roar of mountains rising from the sea a vastly old and vastly strange human civilization had arisen on mars during the time it took on the enclosed earth for lise to walk to school and back that civilization had been wrapped by the hypotheticals in its own envelope of slow timean enclosure that brought mars into synchronization with the earth and ended when the earths enclosure ended but before that happened the martians had sent a manned spacecraft to earth its sole occupant had been wun ngo wen the socalled martian ambassador lise would askthey had this conversation on more than one starry summer nightdid you ever meet him no wun had been killed in a roadside attack during the worst years of the spin but i watched his address to the united nations he seemed likable lise had seen historical footage of wun ngo wen from an early age as a child she had imagined having him for a friend a sort of intellectual munchkin no taller than herself but the martians had been coy from the beginning her father told her they had given the earth their archives a compendium of their knowledge of the physical sciences in some areas more advanced than earthly science but it said very little about their work in human biologythe work that had produced their caste of longlived fourthsor about the hypothetical to lises father these were unforgivable omissions theyve known about the hypothetical for hundreds if not thousands of years he said they must have had something to say even if it was only speculation when the spin ended and both earth and mars were restored to the customary flow of time radio communication with the martians had flourished for a time there had even been a second martian expedition to earth more ambitious than the first and a group of martian legates had been installed in a fortresslike building attached to the old united nations complex in new yorkthe martian embassy it came to be called when their scheduled fiveyear tenure expired they were returned home aboard a terrestrial spacecraft jointly engineered by the major industrial powers and launched from xichang there was never a second delegation plans to send a reciprocal terrestrial expedition to mars broke down in multinational negotiations and in any case the martians had shown little enthusiasm for it i suspect lises father said they were a little bit appalled by us mars had never been a resourcerich world even after the ecopoeisis and its civilization had survived through a sort of meticulous collective parsimony earthwith its vast but polluted bodies of water its inefficient industries and collapsing ecosystemswould have horrified the visitors they must have been glad robert adams said to put a few million miles between them and us and they had their own postspin crises to deal with the hypothetical had also installed an arch on mars it rose above the equatorial desert and it opened on a similar small rocky planet hospitable but uninhabited orbiting a distant star communications between earth and mars had slowed to a perfunctory trickle and there were no more martians on earth they had all gone home when the diplomatic mission ended lise had never heard otherwise so how could sulean moi be a martian she doesnt even look like a martian lise said martians were four to five feet tall at most and their skin was deeply ridged and wrinkled sulean moi as she appeared in the original snapshot from her fathers house in port magellan had been only ordinarily short and not especially wrinkly sulean moi has a unique history diane said as you might imagine would you like a cold drink i think i wouldmy throats a little dry ill fetch turk said fine thank you as to sulean moi im afraid i have to tell you something about myself before i can explain she hesitated and closed her eyes briefly my husband was tyler dupree my brother was jason lawton a second passed before lise placed the names they were names out of history books spinera names jason lawton was the man who had helped seed the barren deserts of mars the man who had set the replicator launches in motion the man to whom wun ngo wen had entrusted his collection of martian pharmaceuticals it was jason lawton who had defied the us government by distributing those drugs and the techniques for reproducing them among a scattered group of academics and scientists who would become the first terrestrial fourths and tyler dupree if she recalled correctly had been jason lawtons personal physician is that possible lise whispered im not trying to impress you with my age diane said just establish my credentials im a fourth of course and ive been a part of that community since its inception thats why sulean moi came to see me a few months ago butif shes a martian how did she get here why doesnt she look like a martian she was born on mars when she was very young she nearly died in a catastrophic floodshe suffered injuries including tissue death in the brain that could only be treated by a radical reconstruction using the same drugs that extend life given at such an early age the treatment has a rather dire side effecta sort of genetic recidivism she never acquired the wrinkles most martians develop at puberty and she continued growing past the point at which they ordinarily stop which left her looking almost like an earthlinga throwback as they would have seen it to her earliest ancestors because she lost most of her immediate family and because she was considered grotesquely deformed she was raised by a community of ascetic fourths they gave her an impeccable education if nothing else no doubt because of her appearance she was fascinated by earth and devoted herself to scholarship in what we would call terrestrial studiesi have no idea what the martians called it an expert on earth lise said which was why eventually she was selected as one of the martian legates if thats true her photograph would have been everywhere she was kept away from the press her existence was a carefully guarded secret do you understand why wellif she looked so much like an earthling she could pass unnoticed in a crowd and she had taught herself to speak at least three terrestrial languages like a native so she was what a spy not exactly the martians knew there were fourths on earth sulean moi was their diplomatic mission to us turk handed out glasses of ice water lise sipped eagerlyher throat was dry and when the martians left diane said sulean moi chose to stay behind she traded places with a woman a terrestrial fourth who happened to resemble her when the legation went back to mars that woman went with themour own secret ambassador in a way why did sulean moi stay because she was shocked by what she found here on mars of course the fourths have existed for centuries constrained by laws and institutions that dont exist on earth martian fourths buy their longevity with a variety of compromises they dont reproduce for instance and they dont participate in government except as observers and adjudicators whereas all our fourths are outlawsboth endangered and potentially dangerous she hoped to bring martian formality to the chaos i gather she didnt succeed lets say her successes have been modest there are fourths and fourths those of us who are sympathetic to her goals have funded and encouraged her over the years others resent her meddling meddling in what in their efforts to create a human being who can communicate with the hypothetical i know how grotesque that must sound diane dupree said but its true she added in a more subdued voice its what killed my brother jason what made this unquestionable lise thought was the womans obvious sincerity that and the wind rattling the blinds and the human noise of the villagers going about their business a dog barking aimlessly in the distance turk sipping his ice water as if these assertions were old news that was how jason lawton died in the books lise had read jason lawton had been a casualty of the anarchic last days of the spin hundreds of thousands had died in the panic the process diane said calmly is deadly in an adult it rebuilds much of the human nervous system and it renders it vulnerable to further manipulation by the networked intelligences of the hypotheticals there iswell a sort of communication can take place but it kills the communicant theoretically the procedure might be more stable if it was applied to a human fetus in vivo an unborn child in the womb but that would be indefensible diane said morally and ethically monstrous but its been a terrible temptation for one faction of our community it holds out the possibility of a real understanding of the mystery of the hypotheticals what they want from us and why theyve done what theyve done and maybe something more not just communication but a sort of communion commingling the human and the divine if i can use those words and the martians want to stop this from happening diane looked subtly ashamed the martian fourths were the first to try it whatthey modified a human fetus the project was unsuccessful the child didnt survive past puberty the experiment was conducted by the same group of ascetic fourths who raised sulean moishe was there when the child died the martians allowed this only once sulean moi meant to prevent the same thing happening among our own fourths who are even less constrained by law and customor to interrupt the process if it had already begun the breeze was warm but lise shivered and has it begun i mean the technology and the pharmaceuticals were distributed by jason along with everything else wun ngo wen brought to earth weve had the capability for decades but there was no real interest in pursuing it except among a few you might say rogue groups i thought fourths had some kind of builtin inhibition turk said for instance tomas once he took the treatment he stopped drinking anything stronger than beer and he quit picking bar fights were inhibited against obvious aggression but not so much so that we lack the capacity for moral choiceor selfdefense and this isnt aggression exactly turk its callous its inexcusable but its also in a sense abstract pushing a needle into the vein of a pregnant volunteer isnt a perceived act of violence especially if youre convinced of the necessity of it lise said and thats why genomic security is interested in sulean moi yes genomic security and every similar agency it isnt just americans who fear fourths you know in the islamic world the prejudice is especially strong nowhere is safe for decades genomic security has been attempting to track down and secure every extant trace of forbidden martian biotechnology probably less to destroy it than to monopolize it they havent succeeded and probably never will succeed the genie is out of the bottle but theyve learned a few things in the course of their work they learned about sulean moi obviously and the idea of fourths interceding with the hypotheticals scares the hell out of them for the same reason youre afraid of it some of the same reasons diane said she drank from her glass of ice water some the village muezzin called the faithful to prayer diane ignored the sound lise said sulean was in port magellan at least once before twelve years ago yes going about the same business yes successfully i mean did she stopwhoever was involvedfrom doing this thing ibu diane looked at lise looked away no she was not successful my father knew her sulean moi knows a lot of people what was your fathers name robert adams lise said her heart beating harder diane shook her head the name isnt familiar but you said you were looking for one of his colleagues in the town of kubelicks grave a man named avram dvali avram dvali ibu dianes expression became somber lise felt her excitement peak dvali was a fourth he was he is hes also in my opinion just slightly insane chapter twelve after walking isaac back to the compound sulean moi told dr dvali about the flower the story seemed so improbable that it became necessary to mount an expedition and set out in search of the thing sulean didnt participate but she gave explicit directions dr dvali took three other men and one of the communes vehicles and drove off into the desert dvalis excitement was predictable sulean thought he was in love with the hypotheticalswith what he imagined them to be he could hardly resist the gift of an alien flower they were back by late afternoon dvali hadnt been able to find the sighted rose but the expedition wasnt fruitless there had been other unusual things growing in the dry wastes he had collected three samples in a cotton bag and he displayed them to sulean and several other observers on a table in the common room one of his prizes was a spongy green disk shaped like a miniature bicycle wheel with twiglike spokes and a gnarl of roots still attached to the hub one was a translucent tube a centimeter in diameter and as long as suleans forearm the last was a viscid knobby lump resembling a clenched fist blue veined with red none of these things looked healthy although arguably they might once have been alive the bicycle wheel was blackened and crumbling in places the hollow tube had fractured along its axis the fist was pallid and had begun to emit an unpleasant odor mrs rebka said did these things fall with the ash dvali shook his head they were all rooted they grew out there out in the desert i cant explain it i would guess theyre associated with the ashfall in some way dvali looked expectantly at sulean sulean had nothing to say in the morning sulean went to see isaac but his door was closed and mrs rebka stood outside her arms crossed hes not well she said ill speak to him briefly sulean said id prefer to let him rest hes running a fever i think you and i have to talk ms moi the two women walked out into the courtyard they kept to the shade of the main building and sat together on a stone bench with a view of the garden the air was hot and still and sunlight fell on the fenced flowerbed as if it had an immense invisible weight sulean waited for mrs rebka to speak in fact sulean had expected something hostile from mrs rebka sooner or later she was the closest thing isaac had to a mother though isaacs nature had precluded any real emotional warmth at least on his part hes never been sick before mrs rebka said not once but since you arrived hes not the same he wanders he eats less hes taken a ferocious interest in books and at first i thought that was a good thing but i wonder if it isnt just another symptom symptom of what dont be evasive mrs rebka was a large woman to sulean all these people seemed largesulean herself barely topped five foot threebut mrs rebka was especially large and seemed to want to appear intimidating i know who you are as well as anyone does everyone in the community has been aware of you for years we werent surprised when you knocked at the door only surprised that it had taken so long were prepared to let you observe isaac and even interact with him the only condition is that you dont interfere have i interfered hes changed since you got here you cant deny that that has nothing to do with me doesnt it i hope youre right but youve seen this before havent you before you came to earth sulean had never made a secret of it the story had spread among these terrestrial fourthsespecially those like dvali who were obsessed with the hypotheticals she nodded a child like isaac mrs rebka said in some ways like him a boy he was isaacs age when he when he died yes died of his condition sulean didnt answer immediately she hated calling up these memories instructive as they inevitably were he died in the desert a different desert the martian desert he was trying to find his way but he got lost she closed her eyes behind her eyelids the world was an infinite redness thanks to this insufferably bright sunlight i would have stopped you if i could you know that but i came too late and you were all very clever about concealing yourselves now im as helpless as you are mrs rebka i wont let you hurt him the fervor in mrs rebkas voice was as startling as the accusation i wouldnt do anything to harm him possibly not but i think on some level youre frightened of him mrs rebka have you misunderstood so completely of course im afraid of him arent you mrs rebka didnt answer only stood up and walked slowly back into the compound that night isaac was still feverish and was confined to his room sulean lay awake in her own room gazing past the sandscuffed windowpane at the stars at the hypotheticals to use that wonderfully ambiguous name bestowed upon them by englishspeaking people they had been called that even before their existence was wellestablished the hypothetical entities who had enclosed the earth in a strange temporal barrier so that a million years might pass while a man walked his dog or a woman brushed her hair they were a network of selfreproducing semibiological machines distributed throughout the galaxy they intervened in human affairs and perhaps the affairs of innumerable other sentient civilizations for reasons not wellunderstood or for no reason at all she was looking at them though they were of course invisible they permeated the night sky they contained worlds they were everywhere beyond that what could one say a network so vast it spanned a galaxy was indistinguishable from a natural force it could not be bargained with it could not even be spoken to it interacted with humanity over inhuman spans of time its words were decades and its conversations were indistinguishable from the process of evolution did it think in any meaningful sense did it wonder did it argue with itself did it fabricate ideas and act on them was it an entity in other words or just a huge and complex process the martians had argued over this for centuries sulean had spent much of her childhood listening to elderly fourths debate the question sulean didnt have a conclusive answerno one didbut her suspicion was that the hypotheticals had no center no operative intelligence they did complex unpredictable thingsbut so did evolution evolution had produced vastly complex and interdependent biological systems without any central direction once selfreproducing machines had been unleashed on the galaxy by some long lost ancient species perhaps long before earth or mars had condensed from stellar dust they had been subject to the same inexorable logic of competition and mutation what might that not have bred over billions of years machines of immense scale and power semiautonomous intelligent in a certain sensethe arch the temporal barrier that had surrounded the earthall that yes but a central motivating consciousness a mind sulean had come to doubt it the hypotheticals were not one entity they were just what happened when the logic of selfreproduction engulfed the vastnesses of space the dust of ancient machines had fallen on the desert and from that dust had grown strange abortive fragments a wheel a hollow tube a rose with a coaldark eye and isaac was interested in the west the far west what did that mean did it have a discernible meaning it meant sulean thought that isaac was being sacrificed to a force as mindless and indifferent as the wind in the morning mrs rebka allowed sulean to visit the boys room youll see she said grimly why were all so concerned isaac was limp under a tangle of blankets his eyes were closed sulean touched his forehead and felt the radiant heat of fever isaac she sighed as much to herself as to the boy his pale inertness provoked too many memories there had been another boy yes another fever another desert the rose isaac said startling her whats that she said i remember the rose and the rose the rose remembers as if asleep eyes still shut he pulled himself into a sitting position his pillow compressed under the small of his back and his head knocking the backboard of the bed his hair was lank with sweat how immortal human beings seem when they can walk run jump sulean thought and how fragile when they cant then the boy did something that shocked even sulean he opened his eyes and the irises were newly discolored as if their pale uniform blue had been spattered with gold paint he looked at her directly and he smiled then he spoke and he spoke a language sulean had not heard for decades a martian dialect from the sparsely inhabited southern wastes he said its you big sister where have you been then just as quickly he slept again and sulean was left shivering in the terrible echo of his words chapter thirteen the next morning a helicopter flew low over the minang village and while that might have been innocuouslogging companies had been surveying these hills for the past couple of monthsit unsettled the villagers and caused ibu diane to suggest that they move quickly staying was riskier than leaving she said where are we going lise asked over the mountains kubelicks grave turk will fly us there wont you turk he appeared to think about it i might need a crowbar he said cryptically but yeah well take one of the village cars back to the city ibu diane said something inconspicuous the car you came in is a liability ill ask one of the villagers to drive it up the coast road and leave it somewhere do i get it back when all this is finished i doubt it well that figures turk said the authorities had ways of tracking people in whom they were interested lise knew tiny rf tags could be planted on a vehicle or even in an item of clothing and there were more arcane even subtler devices available the minang villager who drove their car north also took with him their clothing and other possessions lise changed into a floralprint blouse and muslin pants from the village store turk into a pair of jeans and a white shirt both of them showered in ibu dianes clinic be especially careful of your hair diane had instructed them things can be hidden in hair feeling simultaneously purified and paranoid lise climbed into the rustspackled vehicle diane had arranged for them to drive turk took the drivers seat lise buckled in next to him and they waited while diane said goodbye to a dozen villagers who had gathered around her popular woman lise observed shes known in every village up the north coast turk said she moves between a whole bunch of these communities expat malays and tamils and minang season by season helping out they all keep a place for her and theyre all protective of her they know shes a fourth sure and shes not the only one a bunch of these village elders are more elderly than you might think the world was changing lise thought and no amount of rhetoric about the sanctity of the human genome was going to stop it she pictured herself trying to communicate that truth to brian a truth he would no doubt refuse or deny brian was adept at patching cracks in the foundation of his faith in the good works of genomic security but the cracks kept coming the edifice trembled ibu diane dupree levered herself into the car with elaborate caution and fastened her threadbare seat belt turk drove slowly and the crowd of villagers followed for a few yards filling the narrow street they dont like to see me go diane said theyre afraid i might not come back lise shrank a little every time they passed another vehicle but turk drove cheerfully once they were back on the paved roads a cloth cap pulled low over his eyes humming to himself ibu diane sat patiently watching the world scroll past lise decided to break dianes silence she turned her head and said tell me about avram dvali it might be easier if you told me what you already know wellhe taught at the american university but he was secretive and not especially wellliked by the faculty he left his teaching position without an explanation less than a year before my father vanished someone at the chancery office told me his last paycheck had been forward by letter mail to a box address in kubelicks grave according to my mother at least on the rare and emotionally difficult occasions when lise had pressed her to talk about the past he visited the house several times before he quit his job theres no listed address for him in kubelicks grave but a search on his name didnt turn up any contemporary address anywhere i meant to go to kubelicks grave and see if the box address still worked or if there was any record of who had rented it but it seemed like a long shot you were very close to something you didnt understand im not surprised genomic security took an interest in you so dvali was involved in one of these communicant cults not involved in it it was his he created it dvali she said had taken his fourth treatment in new delhi years before he emigrated to the new world i met him not long after he was hired by the university there are literally thousands of fourths in the area around port magellannot including those who choose to live out their extended lives quietly and in isolation some of us are more organized than others we dont hold conventions for obvious reasons but i meet most of the known fourths sooner or later and i can sort out the cliques and subgroups dvali had his own group so i gather likeminded people a few of them she hesitated were called fourths you know because on mars the treatment is equivalent to entering a fourth stage of life an adulthood beyond adulthood but the treatment doesnt guarantee any special maturity thats built into the institutions surrounding it as much as into the treatment itself avram dvali brought his own obsession into his fourthness what obsession with the hypothetical with the transcendent forces of the universe some people chafe at their humanity they want to be redeemed by something larger than themselves to ratify their sense of their own unique value they want to touch god the paradox of fourthness is that its a magnet for such people we try to contain them but she shrugged we dont have the tools the martians put in place so he organized around the idea of creating a a a communicant a human interface with the hypotheticals he was very serious about it he recruited his group from among our community and then did his best to seal them away from us they became much more secretive once the process was underway you couldnt stop him we tried of course dvalis project wasnt the first such attempt in the past the intervention of other fourths was enough to quell the effortabetted when necessary by sulean moi whose authority among most fourths is unquestionable but dr dvali was immune to moral suasion and by the time sulean moi arrived he and his group were in hiding weve had very sporadic contact with them sincetoo little and too late to stop them you mean theres a child yes his name im told is isaac he would be twelve years old by now my father disappeared twelve years ago you think he might have joined this group nofrom your description of him and my knowledge of dvalis recruiting no im sorry hes not among them then maybe he knew something dangerous about themmaybe they abducted him as fourths were inhibited against that kind of violence what youre suggesting isnt impossible but its extremely unlikely ive never heard even a rumor that dvali was capable of such a thing if anything like that happened to your father it was more likely the work of genomic security they were sniffing at dvalis heels even then why would dgs kidnap my father presumably to interrogate him if he resisted diane shrugged unhappily why would he resist i dont know i never met your father i cant answer that they interrogated him and then what killed him i dont know turk said they have what they call executive action committees in dgs lise they write their own legal ticket and they do what they want im pretty sure thats who took tomas ginn tomas is a fourth and fourths are notoriously hard to interrogatetheyre not especially afraid of death and they have a high tolerance to pain getting any information out of a stubborn fourth means putting him through a process thats usually in the end fatal they killed tomas i expect so or transported him to some secret prison to kill him a little more slowly could brian have known about this learned about it at work lise had a brief but horrifying vision of the dgs staff at the consulate laughing at her at her naive quest to uncover the truth about her father she had been walking over an abyss on a skin of thin ice nothing to protect her but her own ignorance butno as an institution genomic security might be capable of that brian was not unhappy as she had been in her marriage she knew brian intimately brian was many things but he was not a murderer clever as ibu diane had been about discarding cars and clothing turk seemed to lose some of his confidence as they left the wooded lands and entered the industrialized outskirts of port magellan coming past the oil refineries at dusk the ocean on the left and the refineries emitting a kind of fungal glow he said theres a couple of vehicles i keep seeing ever since we got on the main road like theyre pacing us but it could be my imagination then we shouldnt go directly to arundjis diane said in fact we should get off the highway as soon as possible im not saying were being followed its just something i noticed assume the worst take the next exit find a gas station or somewhere we can stop without arousing suspicion i know people around here turk said people i can trust if we need a place to stay overnight thank you turk but i dont think we should endanger anyone else and i doubt lise is anxious to make the acquaintance of one of your old girlfriends didnt say anything about a girlfriend turk said but he blushed he pulled into a filling station attached to a retail store this was the part of port magellan where the refinery workers lived lots of prefabricated bungalows assembled in haste during the boom years and gone shabby since he parked away from the pumps under an umbrella tree the last daylight had gone and there was only the yelloworange glare of the street lamps if you want to dump the car turk said theres a bus station a couple of blocks down we can catch the bus to rice bay and walk to arundjis wont get there till midnight though maybe thats best diane said hate to abandon another vehicle though whos paying for all this transportation friends and friends of friends diane said dont worry about it dont take anything out of the car lise begged permission to go into the small store and buy something to eatthey hadnt stopped for a meal since breakfastwhile turk and diane unscrewed and discarded the vehicles license plates she bought cheese crackers and bottled water for the bus trip at the counter she noticed a stack of disposable utility phones the kind you pick up when youve lost your personal unit also favored or so she had read by drug dealers seeking anonymity she grabbed one and added it to the groceries then she walked around the back of the store bag in one hand and phone in the other she tapped out brians home number he picked up almost immediately yes lise was briefly paralyzed by the sound of his voice she thought about clicking off then she said brian i cant talk right now but i want you to know im okay lise please tell me where you are i cant but one thing this is important theres a man named tomas ginnthats tomas ginnwho was taken into custody a couple of days ago presumably without a warrant or any legal record its possible hes being held by genomic security or somebody claiming to be dgs can you check on this i mean is it okay with you that people are being kidnapped if not is there anything you can do to get this man set free listen to me lise listen you dont know what youre involved in youre with turk findley right did he tell you hes a criminal thats why he fled the states lise he she turned and saw turk come around the corner of the store too late to hide she closed the phone but that was a useless gesture she could see the anger on his face in the stark artificial light wordlessly he took the phone from her hand and threw it into the air the phone sailed past a lamp standard and fluttered like a huge moth before disappearing down the embankment of a ravine too shocked to speak lise turned to face him turks face was livid she had never seen him like this he said you have no fucking clue do you no idea whats at stake here turk he didnt listen he grabbed her wrist and began to pull her toward the street she managed to break his grip though she dropped the bag of cheese and crackers goddamnit im not a child fucking prove it he said the bus ride wasnt exactly pleasant lise sat sullenly apart from turk watching the night roll by in the frame of the window she was determined not to think about what turk had done or what she might have done wrong or what brian had said at least until she calmed down but as the anger abated she simply felt desolate the last bus south was halfempty the only other passengers a few grimfaced men in khaki pants and blue shirts probably shift workers who lived downcoast to save the cost of city rent the man in the seat behind her was muttering in farsi possibly to himself the bus stopped periodically at concreteblock terminals and storefront depots off the highway a world populated by forlorn men and flickering lights then the city was behind them and there was only the highway and the horizonless dark of the sea diane dupree came across the aisle and took the seat next to lise turk thinks you need to take the risk more seriously the old woman said did he tell you that i surmised i do take it seriously the phone was a bad idea in all likelihood the call cant be traced but who knows what technology the police or genomic security might bring to bear its better not to make assumptions i do take it seriously lise insisted again its just but she couldnt finish couldnt find the words for the sudden awareness of exactly how much of life as she had known it was slipping away under the wheels of the bus by the time the bus reached a depot near arundjis airport turk had stopped gnashing his teeth and had begun to look a little sheepish he gave lise an apologetic sidelong glance which she ignored its a good half mile to arundjis he said you two up for the walk yes diane said lise just nodded the road from the depot was rural and sparsely lit as they walked lise listened to the crackle of her footsteps on the barelypaved verge of the road the rush of wind raking scrubby treeless lots off in the high grass some insect buzzedshe could have mistaken it for a cricket except for the mournful tone of its creaking like a disconsolate man running his thumbnail over the teeth of a comb they approached the fenced territory of arundjis at a back entrance away from the main gate turk fished a key out of his pocket and swung open a chainlink gate saying you might want to stay inconspicuous from here on in the terminal shuts down after ten oclock but weve got a maintenance crew on site and security guards out where theyre grading the new runway lise said dont you have a right to be here sort of but it would be best not to attract too much attention she followed turk and diane to an aluminumsheet hangar one of dozens lined up at the rear of the terminal its huge doors were chained shut and turk said i wasnt kidding about that crowbar ill need something to spring this youre locked out of your own hangar kind of a funny story he walked off apparently looking for a tool use was sweaty and her calves ached from the walk and she needed to pee she no longer owned a change of clothes forgive turk diane said it isnt that he distrusts you hes afraid for you he are you going to do this from now on make these gurulike pronouncements because its getting kind of tiresome diane stared wideeyed then somewhat to lises relief she laughed lise said i mean im sorry but no dont apologize youre absolutely right its one of the hazards of great age the temptation to pronounce judgments i know what turk is afraid of turk is burning his bridges behind him my bridges are still there i have a life i can go back to nevertheless diane said here you are she smiled again speaks the guru turk came back with a piece of rebar from the construction site and used it to lever off the latch which was flimsier than the padlock attached to it and came away from the door with a concussive twang he rolled open the big steel doors and switched on the interior light his plane was inside his twinengine skyrex lise remembered this aircraft from their abortive flight across the mountainsages ago it seemed lise and diane used the grimy employees restroom while turk did his preflight checks when lise came back from the rear of the hangar she found him in a heated discussion with a uniformed man the man in the uniform was short balding and conspicuously unhappy i have to call mr arundji he said you know that turk and turk said give me a few minutes thats all i askhavent i bought enough rounds over the last few years to earn me that im advising you that this is not allowed fine no problem fifteen minutes then you can call anybody you want im giving you notice here nobody can say i let you get away with this nobodyll say any such thing fifteen minutes more like ten the guard turned and walked away in the old days turk said an airport was anywhere in equatoria you could carve out a landing strip a little fourseater prop plane would get you places you couldnt otherwise go and nobody worried about filing a flight plan but that had changed under the relentless pressure of the provisional government and the airtravel conglomerates big business and big government would drive places like arundjis into the ground turk said sooner or later even now he said it wasnt exactly legal to be making this kind of afterhours departure from a closed strip probably it would cost him his license but he was being squeezed out anyhow nothing to lose he said nothing much then he pivoted the plane onto a vacant runway and started his takeoff run this was turk doing what he claimed to do best lise thought putting on his shoes and walking away from something he believed in the redemptive power of distant horizons it was a faith she couldnt bring herself to share the aircraft left the ground swaying like a kite its huge feathered props pulling them toward the moonlit mountains the engine purring ibu diane peered out the window and murmured something about how much quieter these things are than they used to beoh years ago now years ago lise watched the arc of the coast tilt to starboard and the distant smudge of port magellan grow even smaller she waited patiently for turk to say something maybe even to apologize but he didnt speakonly pointed once abruptly and lise looked up in time to see the whitehot trail of a shooting star flash over the peaks and passes of the mountains toward the emptiness of the western desert chapter fourteen brian gately wasnt prepared for the violent image that popped out of his mailbox that morning it provoked an unpleasant memory in the summer of his thirteenth year brian had done volunteer work at the episcopal church where his family worshipped he had not been a particularly devout teenagerdoctrinal matters confused him he avoided bible studybut the church both the institution and the physical building possessed a reassuring weight a quality he later learned to call gravitas the church put a sensible boundary on things that was why his parents who had lived through the economic and religious uncertainties of the spin went to church every week and that was why brian liked it that and the pinewood smell of the newlybuilt chapel and the way the stainedglass windows broke the morning light into colors so he had volunteered for summer work and had spent a few drowsy days sweeping the chapel or opening doors for elderly parishioners or running errands for the pastor or the choirmaster and in midaugust he was recruited to help set up tables for the annual picnic the suburb in which brian lived was graced with a number of wellmaintained parks and wooded ravines the annual church picnican institution so quaint the words themselves had a sort of horseandbuggy aura about themwas held in the largest of these parks more than a picnic it was according to the flyer in the sunday bulletin a day of family communion and there were plenty of families there to commune with three generations in some cases and brian was kept busy laying out plastic tablecloths and lugging coolers of ice and soft drinks until the event was well under way hot dogs circulating freely kids he barely knew tossing frisbees toddlers underfoot and it was the perfect day for it sunny but not too hot a breeze to carry off the smoke of the grills even at the age of thirteen brian had appreciated the slightly narcotic atmosphere of the picnic an afternoon suspended in time then his friends lyle and kev showed up and tempted him away from the adults down through the woods there was a creek where stones might be skipped or tadpoles captured brian begged a break from his volunteer work and went off with them into the green shade of the forest down by the verge of the creek which flowed in a shallow ribbon over gravel tilled by ancient glaciers they found not just stones to throw but surprisingly a habitation a scrap of canvas tent all awry and plastic grocery bags rusted cans pork and beans animal food empty bottles and brown flasks a corroded shopping cart and finally between two oak trees whose roots had grown out of the ground and twined together like a fist a bundle of old clotheswhich examined more closely was not a bundle of old clothes at all but a dead man the dead homeless man must have been there for days undiscovered he looked both bloated a tattered red cotton shirt stretched taut across his enormous belly and shrunken as if something essential had been sucked out of him the exposed parts of him had been nibbled by animals there were bugs on his milkywhite eyes and when the wind came around the smell was so bad that brians friend kev turned and promptly vomited into the glassy water of the creek the three of them ran back to the friendly part of the park and told pastor carlysle what theyd found and that was the end of the picnic the police were called an ambulance came to retrieve the body and the suddenly somber gathering broke up kev and lyle over the course of the next six months stopped showing up for sunday services as if the church and dead man had become associated one with the other but brian had the opposite reaction he believed in the protective power of the chapel precisely because he had seen what lay beyond it he had seen unhallowed death he had seen death and death shouldnt have surprised him nevertheless he was shocked by what popped out of his mailbox twenty years later within the sanctified walls of his office and the carefullydefined if crumbling boundaries of his adult life two days before he had received the brief aborted phone call from lise it had come late in the late evening brian had been on his way home from one of those tedious consulate social nights drinks at the ambassadors residence and small talk with the usual suspects brian didnt drink much but what he did drink went to his head and he let his car do the driving on the way home slowly thenthe car was idiotically literalminded about speed limits and restricted to the few streets with automated driving gridsbut safely he came back to the apartment he had once shared with lise with its attendant atmosphere of claustrophobia and something that might have been desperation had it been less comfortably furnished he showered before bed and as he toweled off he listened to the silence of the city night and thought am i inside the circle or out of it the phone rang as he turned out the lights he put the slate wedge to his ear and registered her distant voice he tried to warn her she said things he didnt immediately understand and then the connection was broken probably he should have gone to sigmund and weil with this but he didnt couldnt the message was personal it was meant for him and for him alone sigmund and weil could get along without it early the next day he sat in his office thinking about lise his failed marriage then he picked up the phone and called pieter kirchberg his contact at the security and law enforcement division of the un provisional government kirchberg had done him a number of small favors in the past and brian had done more than a few in return the settled eastern coast of equatoria was a united nations protectorate at least nominally with a complicated set of laws established and constantly revised by international committees the closest thing to a fullyestablished police force was interpol though bluehelmeted soldiers did most of the daily enforcement the result was a bureaucracy that created more paperwork than justice and existed mainly to smooth over conflicts between hostile national interests to get anything done you had to know people kirchberg was one of the people brian knew kirchberg answered promptly and brian listened to his inevitable complaintsthe weather the bullying oil cartels his boneheaded underlingsbefore getting down to business finally as kirchberg wound down he said i want to give you a name fine he said just what i need more work whose name tomas ginn he spelled it and why are you interested in this person departmental matter brian said some desperate american criminal a betterbaby salesman a renegade organvendor something like that ill run it when i can you owe me a drink anytime brian said he didnt tell sigmund and weil about that either it was the following morning that the photograph rolled out of his printer along with an unsigned note from kirchberg brian looked at the photograph then put it face down on his desk then picked it up again he had seen worse things what he thought about immediately and involuntarily was the body he had discovered beyond the outer limits of the church picnic a quarter of a century ago the body which had lain among the exposed roots of two trees with its eyes gone milky white and its skin traversed by feckless ants he felt the same involuntary lurch of his stomach the photograph was of an old mans body broken on a saltencrusted rock the marks on the body might have been massive bruises or simply the effects of decomposition but there was no mistaking the bullet wound in the forehead kirchbergs unsigned note said washed up near south point two days ago no papers but identified as tomas w ginn us merchant marine dna database one of yours mr ginn had wandered outside the boundaries of the picnic it seemed and so he thought with sickly dismay had lise in the afternoon he called pieter kirchberg again this time kirchberg was less chatty i got what you sent me brian said no need to thank me one of ours you said what did you mean by that id just as soon not discuss it an american you mean no answer one of yours so yes an american or was pieter suggesting that tomas ginn belonged to genomic security or that his death did maybe he meant one of your killings is there anything else kirchberg asked because i have a lot of work waiting for me one more favor brian said if you dont mind pieter another name part three into the west chapter fifteen before he could say anything morein martian or in englishthe boy isaac stopped speaking and fell into a sleep from which he could not be aroused the fourths continued to tend to his needs but were unable to treat or diagnose his condition his vital signs were stable and he seemed to be in no immediate danger sulean moi sat with the child in his room as the sun shone on the desert beyond the window clocking shadows across the alkaline grit two days passed one morning as occasionally happened this time of year a storm blew out of the mountains a shelf of coalblack clouds that produced much lightning and thunder but only a little rain by sunset the storm had gone and the sky in its wake was a radiant purified turquoise the air smelled fresh and astringent still the boy slept out in the western wastes spindly plants were provoked by the brief rain to flower perhaps other things too bloomed in the emptiness things like isaacs ocular rose outwardly calm sulean was terrified the boy had spoken with eshs voice she wondered if this was what religious texts meant when they talked about trembling in the presence of god the hypothetical werent godsif she understood what that simple but strangely elastic word meantbut they were just as powerful and just as inscrutable she didnt believe they possessed conscious intent and even the word they was a misnomer a crude anthropomorphism but when they manifested themselves the natural human response was to cower and hidethe instinctive reaction of the rabbit to the fox the fox to the hunter twice in a lifetime sulean thought thats my special burden to witness this twice in a lifetime at times she napped in the chair next to the bed where isaac lay his chest rising and falling with the cadence of his breath often she dreamedmore fiercely and deeply than she had dreamed since she was a childand in her dreams she was in a different desert where the horizon was close and the sky a dark and penetrating blue in this desert there were rocks and sand and also a number of brightlycolored tubular or angular growths like a madmans hallucinations come to life and of course there was the boy not isaac the other boy the first one he was more frail than isaac his skin was darker but his eyes like isaacs had become goldflecked and strange he was lying where he had fallen in a stupor of exhaustion and although sulean was in the company of a number of grown men she was the first who dared approach him the boy opened his eyes he could not otherwise move because his legs arms and torso had been bound with pliant ropes or vines the strange growths had pinned him there and some of them had pierced his body surely he must be dead how could anyone survive such an impalement but he opened his eyes he opened his eyes and whispered sulean she woke in the chair next to isaacs bed sweating in the dry heat mrs rebka had come into the room and was staring at her were having a meeting in the common room mrs rebka said we would like you to be there ms moi all right yes has his condition changed no sulean said thinking not yet it wasnt really a coma it was only sleep though a profound one that lasted many days isaac woke from it that evening and when he did he was alone in his room he felt different more alert than usual not only awake but more awake than he had ever been his vision seemed sharper and more focused he felt as if he could count the dust motes in the air if he wanted even though there was only the light of his bedside lamp to see by he wanted to go west he felt the attraction of what was out there although there was no word for it no word he knew a presence rising and it wanted him and he wanted it with an urgency akin to love or lust but he wouldnt leave the compound not tonight isaacs first and purely instinctive long walk had come to nothingapart from the discovery of the roseand there was no use repeating it not until he was stronger still he did need to get away from the narrow confinement of his room to smell the air and feel it on his skin he stood dressed and walked downstairs past the closed doors of the large central room from which emanated the solemn voices of adults he went out to the courtyard a guard had been posted at the far gate presumably to keep him from wandering away again but he stayed on the other side of the houses in the walled garden the air was cool tonight and the garden was lush he stepped in among the plants following the gardeners cobbled path the nightblooming succulents had put out blossoms richly colorful even in the faint moonlight other things small things stirred in the soil where the ash had been driven down by the rain isaac put his hand palmdown on a bare patch of earth the soil was warm retaining what it had conserved of the days heat overhead the stars were crystalbright isaac looked a long time at the stars they were symbols hovering on the brink of intelligibility letters that made words that made sentences he could almost not quite read something touched his hand where it rested on the rich garden loam and isaac looked down again when he pulled his hand away he saw the earth swell and crumble minutelya worm he thought but it wasnt a worm it wasnt anything he had ever seen before it shrugged itself slowly from the soil like a knuckled fleshy finger maybe some kind of root but it grew too quickly to be natural it extended itself toward isaacs hand as if it sensed his warmth he wasnt afraid of it well no that wasnt true part of him was afraid of it almost paralyzed with terror the everyday part of him wanted to recoil and run back to the safety of his room but above and enclosing the everyday part of him was this new sense of himself bold and confident and to the new isaac the pale green finger wasnt frightening or even unfamiliar he recognized it although he couldnt name it he allowed it to touch him slowly the green finger encircled his wrist isaac drew a curious strength from it and it from him he suspected and he looked back at the sky where the stars which were suns glimmered brightly now each star seemed as familiar as a face each with its own color and weight and distance and identity known but not named and like an animal scenting the air he faced once more to the west two things were obvious to sulean as she entered the common room one was that much discussion had taken place in her absenceshe had been called here to testify not to deliberate the second obvious thing was an atmosphere of collective sadness almost mourning as if these people understood that the life they had created for themselves was coming to an end and that was no doubt true this community couldnt exist much longer it had been created for the purpose of birthing and nurturing isaac and that process would soon be finished one way or another the majority of these people must have been born before the spin sulean thought like other terrestrial fourths a large percentage of them had come from the academic community but not all there were technicians who helped maintain the cryogenic incubators there was a mechanic a gardener like martian fourths these people had separated themselves from the general community they were not like the fourths among whom sulean had been raised but they were fourths they stank of fourthness so glum so selfimportant so blind to their own arrogance avram dvali of course was chairing the meeting he waved sulean to a chair at the front of the room wed like you to explain a few things ms moi before the crisis proceeds any further sulean sat primly erect of course im happy to help in any way i can mrs rebka who sat at dr dvalis right at the head table gave her a sharply skeptical look i hope thats true you know when we took on the task of raising isaac thirteen years ago we faced some opposition raising him mrs rebka or creating him mrs rebka ignored the remark opposition from other members of the fourth community we acted on convictions not everyone shared we know were a minority a minority within a minority and we knew you were out there ms moi doing whatever work you do for the martians we knew you might eventually find us and we were prepared to be frank and open with you we respect your connection to a community far older than our own thank you sulean said not concealing her own skepticism but we had hoped you would be as frank with us as we were with you if you have a question please ask it the procedure that created isaac has been attempted before it has been sulean admitted yes and is it true that you have some personal experience of that this time she wasnt quite so quick to answer yes the story of her upbringing had circulated widely among the terrestrial fourths would you share that experience with us if im reluctant to talk about it the reasons are largely personal the memory isnt pleasant nevertheless mrs rebka said sulean closed her eyes she didnt want to recall these events the memory came to her unbidden all too often but mrs rebka was right as much as sulean hated to admit it the time had come the boy the boy in the desert the boy in the martian desert the boy had died in the dry southern province of bar kea some distance from the biological research station where he had been born and where he had lived all his life sulean was the same age as the boy she had not been born at the bar kea desert station but she could remember no other home her life before bar kea was little more than a story she had been told by her teachers a story about a girl who had been washed away along with her family by a flood along the paia river and who had been rescued from the intake filter of a dam three miles downstream her parents had died and the small girl this unremembered sulean had been so grievously wounded that she could only be saved by profound biotechnical intervention specifically the child sulean had to be rebuilt using the same process that was used to extend life and create fourths the treatment was more or less successful her damaged body and brain were reconstructed according to templates written in her dna for obvious reasons she remembered nothing of her life before the accident her salvation was a second birth and sulean had relearned the world the way an infant learns it acquiring language a second time and crawling before she took her first or second tentative steps but there was a drawback to the treatment which was why it was so rarely used as a medical intervention it conferred its customary longevity but it also interrupted the natural cycle of her life at puberty every martian child developed the deep wrinkles that made martians appear so distinctive to terrestrials but that didnt happen to sulean she remained by martian standards sexless and grotesquely smoothskinned an overgrown infant when she looked in a mirror even today sulean was inevitably reminded of something pink and unformed a grub writhing in a rotten stump to protect her from humiliation she had been sheltered and nurtured by the fourths who saved her life the fourths of bar kea desert station at the station she had a hundred indulgent caring parents and she had the dry hills of bar kea for a playground the only other child at the station was the boy named esh they had not given him any other name only esh esh had been built to communicate with the hypotheticals though it seemed to sulean he could barely communicate even with the people around him even with sulean whose company he obviously enjoyed he seldom spoke more than a few words esh was kept apart and sulean was allowed to see him only at appointed times nevertheless she was his friend it didnt matter to sulean that the boys nervous system was supposedly receptive to the obscure signals of alien beings any more than it mattered to esh that she was as pink as a stillborn fetus their uniquenesses made them alike and had thus become irrelevant the fourths at bar kea desert station encouraged the friendship they had been disappointed by eshs refractory silences and his outward display of dullnormal intelligence he was studious but incurious he sat wideeyed in the classrooms the adults had designed for him and he absorbed a reasonable amount of information but he was indifferent to it all the sky was full of stars and the desert was full of sand but stars and sand might have traded places for all it mattered to esh whether he spoke to the hypotheticals or they to him no one could say he was stubbornly silent on the subject esh was at his liveliest when he was alone with sulean they were allowed to leave the station on certain days to explore the nearby desert they were supervised of coursean adult was always within sightbut compared to the closeted spaces of the station this was wild freedom bar kea was formidably dry but the scarce spring rains sometimes pooled among the rocks and sulean delighted in the small creatures that swam in these shortlived ponds there were tiny fish that encased themselves in hibematory cysts like seeds when the water dried and sprang back to life during the rare rains she liked to cup the populated water in her hands esh watching with silent wonder as the wriggling things slipped between her fingers esh never asked questions but sulean pretended he did at the station she was always being taught always being encouraged to listen alone with esh she became the teacher he the rapt and silent audience often she would explain to him what she had learned that day or week people had not always lived on mars she told him one day as they wandered among sunlit dusty rocks years and centuries ago their ancestors had come from earth a planet closer to the sun you couldnt see earth directly because the hypotheticals had enclosed it in a lightless barrierbut you knew it was there because it had a moon that circled it she mentioned the hypotheticals called by martians abashken a word compounded of the rootwords for powerful and remote cautiously at first wondering how esh would react she knew he was part hypothetical himself and she didnt want to offend him but the name provoked no special response only his usual blank indifference so sulean was free to lecture imagine dream even then the hypotheticals had fascinated her they live among the stars as far as anyone knows she told the boy esh of course said nothing in return theyre not exactly animals theyre more like machines but they grow and reproduce themselves they do things for no apparent reason she told him they put the earth inside a slowtime bubble millions of years ago but no one knows why no one has talked to them she said unless you have i suppose and no one has seen them but pieces of them fall out of the sky from time to time and strange things happen pieces of them fall from the sky this last piece of information caused considerable consternation among dr dvalis fourths dvali cleared his throat and said theres nothing about such an event in the martian archives no sulean admitted nor did we ever mention it in direct communication with the earth even on mars its a rare occurrencesomething that happens once every two or three hundred years mrs rebka said excuse me but what happens i dont understand the hypotheticals exist in a kind of ecology mrs rebka they bloom flourish and die back only to repeat the cycle again over and over by the hypotheticals dr dvali said i presume you mean their machines that may not be a meaningful distinction theres no evidence that their selfreproducing machines are under the control of anything but their own networked intelligence and their own contingent evolution naturally the detritus of their lives circulates through the solar system periodically the debris is captured by the gravitation of an inner planet why havent these things fallen on the earth before the spin the earth existed in a much younger solar system five billion years ago the hypotheticals had barely established themselves in the kuiper belt if their machines did occasionally enter the earths atmosphere it would have been an isolated rare event there are enough reports of hovering lights or strange aerial objects to suggest that perhaps it did happen now and then though no one recognized it as such when the spin barrier was put in place it excluded any such fallthrough and even now the earth is protected from the excessive radiation of the sun by a different kind of membrane mars for good or ill is more exposed martians didnt arrive in the modern day as strangers dr dvali weve grown and evolved for millennia with the knowledge that the hypotheticals exist and that the solar system is in effect their property the ash that fell on us mrs rebka said her voice throaty with a kind of hostile urgency was that the same phenomenon presumably and the growths in the desert its only natural to assume that this solar system has also hosted hypotheticals for countless centuries the annual meteor showers are more likely their detritus than the simple remains of ancient rocks the ashfall was just a particularly dense example perhaps from a recent exfoliation as if we had passed through a cloud of of of their discarded cells dr dvali said cells in a sense shed perhaps discarded but not necessarily inert or entirely dead some partial metabolism persists hence the ocular rose and the other abortive shortlived growths your people must have studied these remains oh yes sulean said in fact we cultivated them much of our biological technology was derived from the study of them even the longevity treatment is remotely derived from hypothetical sources most of our pharmaceuticals entail some element of hypothetical technologythats why we grow them at cryogenic temperatures simulating the outer solar system and the martian boyand isaac as well i suppose the treatment they received is much more closely related to the raw matter of hypothetical devices i suppose you thought it was some purely human pharmaceutical another example of marvelous martian biotech and in a sense it is but its something more too something inhuman inherently uncontrollable and yet wun ngo wen brought the seed stock to earth if wun had discovered the older wiser culture we all assumed must exist on earth im sure he would have been frank about the origins of it but he found something quite different unfortunately he entrusted many of our secrets to jason lawton who rashly experimented on himselfand jason lawton circulated the secrets to people he trusted who proved no more prudent sulean was aware of the shock in the room these were names wun ngo wen and jason lawton reverently spoken among terrestrial fourths but they were mortal men after all susceptible to doubt fear greed and hasty decisions repented at leisure still dr dvali said at last your people could have told us these are fourth things sulean was surprised by the vehemence in her own voice you dont understand its not zuret she couldnt exactly translate the word and all its nuances its not correct its not proper to share them with the unaltered the unaltered dont want to know these things are for the very old to worry about by accepting the burden of longevity they accept this burden too but i would have shared them with you dr dvali before you began this project if you hadnt hidden yourself so well but the people she was addressing born in the raucous jungle that was earth couldnt be expected to understand even their fourthness was alien the last estate of life the elective decades meant nothing more to them than a few more years in which to draw breath on mars all fourths were ritually separated from the rest of the population when you entered the fourth ageunless you entered it as sulean had under exceptional circumstancesyou accepted its constraints and agreed to live according to its cloistered traditions the terrestrial fourths had attempted to recreate some of those traditions and this group had even withdrawn to a kind of desert sanctuary but it wasnt the same they didnt understand the burden of it they hadnt been initiated into the sacral knowledge they lacked perversely the terrible dry monasticism of the martian fourths it was what sulean had hated about the fourths who raised her on mars the fourths moved as if through the invisible corridors of some ancient labyrinth they had traded joy for a dusty gravitas but even that was better than this anarchic recklessnessall the vices of terrestrial humanity needlessly prolonged dr dvali perhaps sensing her agitation said but what about the child tell us what happened to esh ms moi what happened to the boy was both simple and terrible it began with an infall of hypothetical debris from the outer system this was not entirely unexpected martian astronomers had tracked the movement of the dust cloud for days before its arrival there was some general excitement about the event sulean had been granted permission to climb the stairs to a high parapet of bar kea desert station which had served as a fortress in the last of the wars five hundred years ago to watch the fiery infall there had been no such event in two lifetimes and sulean wasnt the only one who climbed up on the walls to watch bar kea station had been built with its back to the spine of the omod mountains and the dry southern plains where much of the debris would fall stretched roadless and mysterious in the starlight that night the sky was shot through with falling stars like threaded fire and sulean stared at the show with rapt attention until an unwelcome sleepiness overcame her and one of her minders put a hand on her shoulder and escorted her back to bed esh had come up to the parapet too and although he watched the green and golden glow of the infalling debris he betrayed no reaction back in bed sulean found her sleepiness had evaporated she lay awake for a long time thinking of what she had seen she thought about the accumulated debris of abashken devices things that ate ice and rock and lived and died over the course of long millennia in lonely places far from the sun the remnants of them burning as they fell through the atmosphere in some of these events enough of the debris had survived that it began a kind of abortive new lifethe history books described curious growths of an incomplete and oddly mechanical nature unsuited to the heat and to them corrosive air of this planet would that happen again if so would she witness it astronomers said the bulk of the material would fall not terribly far from bar kea station fascinated as she was by the hypotheticals sulean longed to see a living example so apparently did esh there was considerable excitement in the station the next morning esh was in an agitated statehad cried for the first time since infancy and one of his tenders had found him knocking his head against the southern wall of his sleeping chamber some invisible influence had shattered his customary complacency sulean wanted to see himdemanded to be allowed to see him when she heard the newsbut she was refused for days on end doctors were called in to examine esh the boy slipped in and out of fevers and deep impenetrable sleeps whenever he was awake he demanded to be allowed to go outside he had stopped eating and by the time sulean was allowed into his chamber she hardly recognized him esh had been chubby roundcheeked young for his age now he had grown gaunt and his eyes strangely flecked with gold had retreated into the bony contours of his skull she asked him what was wrong not expecting an answer but he startled her by saying i want to go see them what who who do you want to see the abashken the boys timid voice made the word sound even stranger than it otherwise might have sulean felt a chill creep up from the small of her spine to the crown of her head what do you mean you want to go see them out in the desert esh said theres nothing out there yes there is the abashken then he began to cry and sulean had to leave the room the nurse who had been attending esh followed her into the corridor and said hes been asking for days to leave the building but this is the first time he mentioned the abashken were they really out there the hypotheticals the abashken or at least the fragmentary remains of them sulean posed the question to one of her caretakers a fragile elder who had been an astronomer before he became a fourth yes he said there had been some activity to the south and he showed her a set of aerial photographs that had been taken over the previous few days here was a wasteland not very different from the landscape beyond the gates of bar kea stationsand dust and rocks but cradled in a broad declivity was a clump of objects so unnatural as to defy description halfbuilt crazily incomplete things it seemed to suleanbrightlycolored pipes silvered hexagonal mirrors chambered spheres many of these things linked to one another like the parts of an enormous impossible insect this must be where he wants to go sulean said possibly but we cant allow that the risk is too great he might come to harm hes coming to harm here he looks like hes dying her tutor shrugged the decisions neither mine nor yours perhaps not but sulean was afraid for esh as a friend he wasnt much but he was all she had he shouldnt be held captive against his will and sulean longed to release him she tried to imagine how she might do that how she might sneak into his room and smuggle him outside but the corridors of bar kea station were never empty and esh was always under guard nor was she often allowed to see him and suleans life seemed empty without his mute presence sometimes she walked past his room and winced when she heard him crying or shouting the situation remained unchanged for more endless sunny days out in the wasteland her tutor said the abashken growths had bloomed and were beginning to wither unsuited as they were to this environment but eshs frantic anxiety only increased dr dvali said these growths were they dangerous no there was never anything more than a temporary kind of life to them like hothouse flowers sulean thought transplanted to the wrong climate and soil the last time she saw esh alive was a day later sulean was outside that morning walking where she used to walk with him her minder stood at a discreet distance mindful that sulean was troubled and might want time to herself it was another sunny day the rocks cast deep shadows across the sand sulean wandered aimlessly near the stations gates not really thinking about anythingin fact trying hard not to think about eshwhen she saw him as startling as a mirage squatting in the shade of a boulder looking south this was inexplicable sulean glanced back at her minder another venerable fourth he had paused to rest in the shade of bar kea stations southern wall the old fourth had not seen esh and sulean did nothing to betray his presence she walked slowly closer careful not to hurry and make herself conspicuous esh looked up plaintively from his hiding place she bent down as if examining a piece of shale or a scuttling sandbug and whispered how did you get away dont tell esh demanded i wont of course i wont but how no one was looking i stole a robe he added lifting his arms in the voluminous whiteness of some larger persons desert garb i came over the north parapet where it touches the rock wall and climbed down but what are you doing out here itll be dark in a couple of hours im doing what i have to you need food and water i can do without no you cant sulean insisted on giving him her water bottle which she always carried when she left the shelter of the station and a bar of pressed meal she had been saving for herself theyll know im gone esh said dont tell them you saw me this was more conversation than sulean had ever had with esh a comparative flood of words she said i will i mean i wont i wont tell anyone thank you sulean another startling novelty the first time he had ever said her name maybe the first time he had said anyones name this wasnt just esh crouching in the sand in front of her this was esh plus something else the abashken sulean thought the hypotheticals were inside him looking out through his altered eyes somewhere in the station a bell began to ring and suleans sleepy minder looked alert and called her name run she whispered but she didnt wait to see if the boy took her advice she turned back to the station pretending nothing had happened and went to her keeper and said nothing at all as if the silence in which esh had dwelt for so many years had entered her throat and stilled her voice what was it he wanted dvali asked to find the fallen artifacts presumablybut what then i dont know sulean said i suppose like calls to like the same instinct or programming that causes the hypothetical replicators to cluster and share information and reproduce may have operated equally on the boy esh the crisis was caused by his proximity to these devices as is isaacs mrs rebka asked possibly your people must have asked these questions without finding any answers unfortunately dvali said you told us the boy died yes tell us how sulean thought must i must i endure this yet again of course she must today as every other day he had been gone from the station for hours and it was well after dark when suleans resolve broke frightened by the thought of esh alone in the night and shaken by the anxiety and alarms that ran through the station like electricity in the absence of the boy she sought out the man she considered the kindest of her mentors her astronomy instructor who used the single name lochis she had seen esh this afternoon she told him through a gush of guilty tears when lochis finally understood he ordered her to stay where she was while he assembled a search party a group of five men and three women all experienced in the hazards and geography of the desert left the station at dawn they rode in a cart pulled by one of the stations few large machineslarge machines were a luxury on a resourcepoor planetand sulean was allowed to ride along to point out where she had last seen esh and perhaps to help convince him to return to the station should they find him more sophisticated machines lighterthanair remote viewing devices and the like had already been sent from the nearest large city but they wouldnt arrive for another day until then lochis told her it would be a labor of eyesight and intuition fortunately esh had not been able to conceal his tracks and it was obvious that he was heading for the most concentrated infall of abashken remains as the expedition crossed a line of low hills into the low basinland of the southern desert sulean saw the decaying evidence of that infall the machinedrawn cart passed close to a clump of dried and decaying well things was the only word sulean could apply to it a widemouthed tube yellowishwhite and more than two people high towered over a cluster of orbs pyramids and slivered mirrors all these things had simply grown out of the pebbly desert floor and died or almost died a few feathery tendrils like enormous bird feathers stirred feebly amidst the surrealistic rubble or maybe it was the faint dry wind that made them move suleans first confrontation with the hypothetical had been when she looked into eshs altered eyes this was her second she shivered despite the heat and shrank back against lochiss protective bulk dont be afraid he said theres nothing dangerous here but she wasnt afraid not exactly it was a different emotion that had overtaken her fascination dreadsome dizzying combination of the two here were pieces of the abashken fragments of things that had overgrown the stars themselves bone and sinew from the body of a god its as if i can feel them she whispered or perhaps it was her own future she felt bearing down on her like the waters of a swollen river again ms moi dr dvali said sternly how did the boy die sulean allowed a few moments to tick away in the silence of the common room it was late all was quiet she imagined she could hear the sound of the desert wind pulsing in her ears it was probably exhaustion that brought him to a stop we found him at last in a small depression invisible until we came very close he was prostrate barely breathing all around him she hated this image it had haunted her all her long life go on dvali said all around him things had grown he was enclosed in a sort of grove of hypothetical remnants they were spiky dangerouslooking things spears of some brittle green substance incomplete of course obviously not sustainable but still motile still alive if you accept that description and they had surrounded him mrs rebka asked her voice gentler now or they had grown up around him while he slept or he had deliberately gone to them some of them had pierced him she touched her ribs her abdomen to show them where killed him he was still conscious when we found him sulean had torn herself away from lochis and run thoughtlessly toward esh who was impaled on the picket of alien growths she ignored the frightened voices calling her back because this was her fault she should never have helped esh escape the station as unhappy as he had been there he had at least been safe now something dreadful had overtaken him she felt no particular fear of the abashken growths peculiar as they were they had grown around the boys body like a ring of sharpened fenceposts she could smell them although she was barely aware of ita sharply chemical smell sulfurous and rank the growths were not healthy they were mazed with cracks and fissures and in places blackened with something like rot their stalks shifted slightly when she moved among them as if they were aware of her presence and maybe they were they were certainly aware of esh several of the tallest growths had arched into halfcircles and pierced the boy with their sharpened tips they had penetrated his chest and abdomen in three places leaving little circles of dry blood on his clothing sulean couldnt tell at first whether he was dead or somehow still alive then he opened his eyes and looked at her andimpossiblysmiled sulean he said i found it then he closed his eyes for the last time the silence in the common room was interrupted by a timid knock there was only one person at the commune who hadnt attended this meeting mrs rebka hurried to open the door isaac stood outside still wearing his night clothes the knees of his pajamas soiled his hands dirty his expression somber someones coming he said chapter sixteen the door to brian gatelys office opened just as a news summary popped up on his desktop the visitor was the chubby dgs man named weil the press release was something about the recent ashfall weil had left his sullen friend sigmund elsewhere and he was grinningthough his cheerfulness under the circumstances struck brian as vaguely obscene you forwarded this brian asked gesturing at the release read it ill wait brian tried to focus on the document but his minds eye insisted on reviewing the photograph pieter kirchberg had sent the corpse of tomas ginn on a rocky beach much worse for wear he wondered whether weil had seen the photo or ordered the killing he was tempted to ask he dared not he blinked and read the press service release port magellan reuterset scientists at the mt mahdi observatory today made the startling announcement that the recent equatorian ashfall which affected the eastern coast and desert inland of that continent was not entirely inert the ashes and the microscopic structures the ash contained believed to be the degraded remnants of hypothetical structures from the outer reaches of the local solar system have apparently shown signs of life in a joint press conference held today at the observatory representatives of the american university the united nations geophysical survey and the provisional government displayed photographs and samples of incompletely selfreplicating and selfassembling quasiorganic objects recovered from the western extremes of the dry inland basin that stretches from the coastal mountains to the western sea these objects ranging from a peasized hollow sphere to an assembly of what appeared to be tubes and wires as large as a mans head were said to be unstable in a planetary environment and hence posed no threat to human life the spaceplague scenario is a nonstarter senior astronomer scott cleland said the infalling material was ancient and probably already corrupted by wear and tear before it entered the atmosphere the vast majority of it was sterilized by a violent passage that left only a few nanoscale elements intact a very few of these retained enough molecular integrity to reinitiate the process of growth but they were designed to flourish in the extreme cold and vacuum of deep space in a hot oxygenrich desert they simply cant survive for long asked whether any of these structures remained active today dr cleland said none that weve sampled by far the greatest number of active clusters occurred deep in the rub alkhali the oilrich far western desert residents of the coastal cities are unlikely to find alien plants in their gardens because harmful effects cannot be entirely ruled out however a loose quarantine has been established between the oil concessions and the western coast of equatoria this formidable terrain has attracted no substantial settlements although tourists occasionally visit the canyonlands and the oil consortia maintain a constant presence travel is being monitored and alerts have been issued said paul nissom of the provisional governments territorial authority we want to keep out the casually curious and facilitate the work of the researchers who need to study and understand this important phenomenon there were a couple of further paragraphs with trivial details and contact numbers but brian figured he had the gist he gave weil a wellwhataboutit look works out nicely for us weil said what are you talking about ordinarily the provisional government isnt much more than a harassed nanny since the ashfall and especially this weird shit out west they finally started paying attention to who goes where monitoring air traffic especially there were more private planes per capita in equatoria than anywhere back on earth most of them small craft and an equally large number of casual airstrips for years the traffic had been unregulated ferrying passengers between bush communities or oil geologists to the desert the bad news weil continued is that turk findley made it to his plane along with lise adams and an unidentified third party they flew out last night brian felt an expanding hollowness in his chest some of it was jealousy some of it was fear for lise who was digging herself into deeper trouble by the hour the good news weil said his smile broadening is that we know where they went and were going there and we want you to come with us chapter seventeen turk had expected to land his aircraft at a familiar strip a couple of miles outside of kubelicks grave west of the foothills on the highway to the oil allotments his plane might be confiscated if mike arundji had called ahead and was prepared to press charges but that was probably inevitable anyway diane surprised him as the plane began the long glide down the western slopes of the divide toward the desert by suggesting a different destination do you remember where you took sulean moi more or less take us there please lise craned her head to look back at diane you know where to find dvali ive heard a few things over the years these foothills are riddled with little utopian communities and religious retreats of every imaginable kind avram dvali disguised his compound as one of those but if you knew where he was we didnt not at first but even a community like dvalis is porous people arrive people leave he was hidden from us when it was critical for him to hide before the child was born it meant another half hour in the air after yet more simmering silence turk said im sorry about that phone thing back in the city what were you doing trying to get a message to your mom back in the states something like that something like that she was pleased that he had apologized and she didnt want to make it worse by admitting shed called brian gately even in an attempt to get tomas ginn out of custody can i ask you a question go ahead how come you had to steal your own plane i owed some money to the guy who owns the airstrip the business hasnt been going too well you could have told me that didnt seem like a good way to impress a rich american divorcee hardly rich turk looked that way from where i stood so how were you planning to get out of hock didnt have what you could call an actual plan worst case i figured id sell the plane and bank whatever i didnt owe and find a berth on one of those research ships that sail out past the second arch theres nothing past the second arch but rocks and bad air thought id like to see for myself that or or what or if something worked out between you and me i thought id stay in the port and get a job theres always pipeline work she was briefly startled also pleased not that it matters now he added once were done hereand whether you find out anything about your father or notyoure going to have to head back to the states youll be okay there you come from a respectable family and youre wellconnected enough that they wont arrest and interrogate you what about you i can disappear on my own terms you could you know come back with me come back to the states wouldnt be safe lise the trouble were in right now isnt the first trouble ive had there are good reasons why i cant go back tell me she thought dont make me ask do you know hes a criminal thats why he fled the states so tell me she said legal problems you dont want to know yeah i do he was flying low across the desert the moonlit foothills hanging off his right wing he said i burned down a building my fathers warehouse you told me your father was in the oil business he was at one time but he didnt like being overseas when we left turkey he went into my uncles import business they brought in nickelanddime shit from middle eastern factories rugs and souvenirs and things like that whyd you burn down the warehouse i was nineteen years old lise i was pissed off and i wanted to do some damage to my old man she said as gently as possible how come he allowed another silent moment to pass looking at the desert his instruments anywhere but at her there was this girl id been seeing we were going to get married it was that serious but my old man and my uncle didnt want it to happen they were oldfashioned about you know race youre girlfriend wasnt white hispanic did you really care what your father thought not at that point no i hated him he was a brutal little shit frankly drove my mother to her grave in my opinion i didnt give a fuck what he thought but he knew that so he didnt say a word to me what he did was he went to my girlfriends family and offered to pay a years tuition on her college education if she would stay away from me i guess it sounded like a good deal i never saw her again but she felt bad enough to send me a letter and explain what happened so you burned his warehouse took a couple cans of paint stripper out of the garage and went down to the industrial district and dumped it on the truck bay doors it was after midnight the place was threequarters in flames by the time the fire department got there so you had your revenge what i didnt know was that there was a night guard in the building he spent six months in a burn ward because of me lise said nothing what made it worse turk said was that my old man covered it up cooked up some arrangement with the insurance company he tracked me down and told me that how hed taken this huge financial hit in order to save me from legal action he said it was because i was family that was why he did what he did about my girlfriend because family mattered whether i knew it or not he expected you to be grateful hard as that is to believe yeah i think he honestly expected me to be grateful were you no turk said i was not grateful he landed the skyrex where he had landed it for sulean moi some months before on a little strip of pavement that appeared to be in the middle of nowhere but was diane insisted less than a mile from dvalis compound a hikeable distance they hiked carrying flashlights he could smell the commune before he could see it it smelled like water and flowers against the flat mineral essence of the desert then they crossed a little hill and there it was a few lights still burning four buildings and a courtyard terracotta roofs like some kind of transplanted hacienda there was a garden and a gate and turk saw what looked like a young boy standing behind the ornate ironwork as soon as the boy spotted them he ran inside and by the time they reached the gate many more lights had come on and a crowd of ten or fifteen people was waiting for them let me talk to them diane said a suggestion turk was happy to accept he stood a few paces back with lise while the old woman approached the fence turk tried to study the crowd of fourths but the light was behind them and they werent much more than silhouettes diane shaded her eyes mrs rebka she said abruptly a woman stepped out of the crowd all turk could see of this mrs rebka was that she was a little plump and that her hair was fine and made a white halo around her head diane dupree the woman named mrs rebka said im afraid ive brought uninvited guests and youre one yourself what brings you here diane do you have to ask i suppose not turn us away then or let us in im tired and i doubt well have much time to talk before were disturbed again isaac wanted to stay and see the visitorsunexpected visitors being as rare a phenomenon in isaacs life as the ashfall had beenbut his fever had returned and he was escorted back to bed where he lay sleepless and sweating for several hours more he knew that the tendril that had reached up from the garden and touched his hand was a hypothetical device a biological machine it was incomplete and unsuited to this environment but isaac had experienced a deep and thrilling sense of rightness as it circled his wrist some fraction of the unfulfilled need inside him had been briefly satisfied but that contact was over and the need was worse for its absence he wanted the western desert and he wanted it badly he was of course also afraidafraid of the vast dry land and of what he might find there afraid of the need that had overtaken him with such compulsive force but it was a need that could be sated he knew that now he watched the dawn as it drove the stars away the planet turning like a flower to the sun two of the fourths escorted lise and turk to a dormitory room in which several bunks had been set up the bedclothes were clean enough but had the smell of longundisturbed linen the fourths who accompanied them were aloof but seemed reasonably friendly given the circumstances both were women the younger of them said the bathroom is down the hall when you want it lise said i need to talk to dr dvaliwill you tell him i want to see him the fourths exchanged glances in the morning the younger one said lise lay down on the nearest bunk turk stretched out on another and almost immediately his breathing settled into long snores she tried to suppress her resentment her head was full of thoughts all raucous all screaming for attention she was a little shocked that she had come this far that she had been party to what amounted to a theft and was accepting the hospitality of a community of rogue fourths avram dvali was only a few rooms away and she might be exactly that close to understanding the mystery that had haunted her family for a dozen years understanding it she thought or being trapped in it she wondered how close her father had actually gotten to these dangerous truths she left her bunk tiptoed across the room and slipped under turks blanket she curled against him one hand on his shoulder and the other snaked under his pillow hoping his audacity or his anger would seep into her and make her less afraid diane sat with mrs rebkaanna rebka whose husband joshua had died before she became a fourthin a room full of tables and chairs recently abandoned by the communitys residents water glasses had been left on the rough wooden tabletops to marinate in their own condensation it was late and the night air of the desert moved through the room and chilled her feet so this is their compound diane thought comfortable enough if austere but there was an atmosphere of monasticism about it a sacral hush it was uneasily familiarshe had spent much of her youth among the intemperately religious she knew or could imagine much of what went on here the compound no doubt functioned like other such communities apart from their experiment with the child hidden somewhere probably underground were the ultralowtemperature bioreactors in which martian pharmaceuticals were propogated and stored she had already seen the pottery kilns that functioned as camouflage an uninvited visitor would be offered crude crockery and utopian tracts and sent away none the wiser diane had known or met most of the founding members only one of the original founders had not been a fourth and that was mrs rebka herself presumably she had taken the treatment since what i have to tell you diane said is that genomic security is in port magellan apparently in force and theyll find you before long theyve been following the martian woman mrs rebka maintained a steely calm havent they always been following the martian woman apparently theyre getting better at it do they know shes here if they dont they soon will and your coming here might have led them to us did you think about that diane theyve already connected sulean moi with kubelicks grave they have dvalis name from there how hard would it be for them to locate this place not hard mrs rebka admitted staring at the tabletop were modest about our presence here but still still diane said dryly have you planned for this contingency of course we have we can be gone within hours if we must what about the boy well keep him safe and hows the experiment going anna are you in touch with the hypotheticals do they talk to you the boy is sick mrs rebka raised her head and frowned spare me your disapproval did you ever consider what you were creating here with due respect if what you say is true we dont have time to debate diane saidmore gentlyhas it been what you hoped anna rebka stood and diane thought she wasnt going to answer but she paused at the door and looked back no she said flatly it hasnt lise woke when sunlight from the window touched her cheek like a feverish hand she was alone in the room turk had gone off somewhere probably taking a pee or inquiring about breakfast she dressed in the generic shirt and jeans the fourths had provided for her thinking about avram dvali framing the questions she wanted to ask him she needed to talk to him as soon as possible as soon as she washed up and had something to eat but there were hurried footsteps from the corridor beyond her door and when she looked out the window she saw a dozen vehicles being loaded with supplies she drew the obvious conclusion these people were getting ready to abandon the compound lise could think of dozens of good reasons why they might want to but she was suddenly afraid dvali would be gone before she could talk to him she hurried into the corridor and asked the first person who passed where she could find him probably the common room the passing fourth advised her down the corridor and left off the courtyardbut he might also be supervising the loading she finally located him by the garden gate where he was consulting some kind of written list avram dvali she must have glimpsed him at the faculty parties her parents used to hold in port magellan but she had seen so many unintroduced adults at those events that their faces had been blenderized by memory did he look familiar no or only vaguely from photographs because he had taken the fourth treatment he probably looked much as he had twelve years ago a bearded man big eyes in a rounded face his eyes were shaded by a broadbrimmed desert hat easy to imagine him circulating through the adams living room one more middleaged professor of somethingorother a drink in one hand and the other prospecting in the pretzel bowl she suppressed her anxiety and walked straight toward him he looked up as she approached miss adams he said he had been warned she nodded call me lise she saidto quell his suspicions not because she wanted to be on a firstname basis with a man who had created and confined a human child for purposes of scientific research diane dupree said you wanted to speak to me unfortunately at the moment youre busy she said whats going on were leaving where are you going here and there its not safe to stay for reasons i imagine you understand i really just need a few minutes i want to ask you about your father and id be happy to talk to you miss adamslisebut do you understand whats happening here not only do we have to leave with all deliberate speed we need to destroy much of what weve built the bioreactors and their contents documents and cultures anything we dont want to fall into the hands of our persecutors he consulted a printed paper then made a checkmark as two men dragged a dolly of cardboard boxes to one of the trucks once were ready to go you and your friends can ride with me for a while well talk but for now i need to attend to business he added your father was a brave and principled man miss adams we disagreed about some things but i held him in the highest regard that was something at least lise thought turk had gotten up early the sound of hurried footsteps in the hall woke him and he was careful to roll out of bed without disturbing lise who had climbed in with him sometime during the night she was halfwrapped in a blanket and softly snoring tender as the creation of some benevolent god he wondered how she would react to what he had told her about himself not the cv shed been hoping for more than enough to chase her back to her family in california maybe he went to find ibu diane meaning to offer his help if help was needed everybody seemed to be carrying something the fourths were obviously getting ready to abandon the place but diane when he found her in the common room told him all the duties had been assigned and were being performed in some meticulous order by the fourths so he made himself breakfast when he figured it was time to wake up lise if she wasnt up already he headed back to their room he was intercepted by a young boy peering out of a doorway down the corridor it could only be the boy diane was so worked up aboutthe halfhypothetical boy turk had pictured some freakish hybrid but what stood in front of him was just a babyfaced twelveyearold his face flushed and his eyes a little wide hey there turk said cautiously youre new the boy said yeah i got here last night my names turk i saw you from the garden you and the other two the boy added im isaac hi isaac looks like everybodys pretty busy this morning not me they didnt give me anything to do me neither turk said theyre going to blow up the bioreactors the boy confided are they yes because but suddenly the boy stiffened his eyes widened until turk could see the small uncanny flecks of gold around the irises whoa heyyou all right a terrified whisper because i remember the boy began to topple over turk caught him in his arms and called for help because i remember what isaac what do you remember too much the boy said and wept chapter eighteen by dawn brian gately was on a transport plane lofting out of port magellans major airport strapped into a bench seat with weil on one side of him and sigmund on the other elsewhere in the plane was a group of armed mennot quite soldiers since they wore no insignia on their flak jackets the interior of the plane was strippeddown and possessed all the homely comfort of an industrial warehouse brian could tell day was breaking by the red glow coming through the portholesized windows weil had ordered him to the airport well before dawn in the event that we get involved in negotiations he had said or in any other talkingtype situationa postevent interrogation saywed like you to be the one who interacts with lise adams we think youd be better than someone she doesnt know how do you feel about that how did he feel about that shitty basically but he could hardly say no he might be in a position to protect her he certainly didnt want her questioned by some hostile dgs functionary or one of these mercenaries she was in the wrong place for the wrong reasons but that didnt make her a criminal and with luck brian might be able to defend her from the threat of prison or worse his memory of the photo of tomas ginns body throbbed in his head like a fragile aneurysm what he told weil was ill help if i can thank you we appreciate that i know its not what you signed up for not what he had signed up for that was becoming a joke he had signed up with genomic security because he possessed a talent for administration and because one of his fathers cousins a dgs bureau chief in kansas city had opened the door for him he had believed in the work of genomic security at least to the degree to which it was professionally necessary to believe the departments mission statement had made sense to him the idea of preserving the human biological heritage against blackmarket cloning unlicensed human modification and imported martian biotech most nations had similar bureaus and they followed the broad guidelines set down by the united nations under the stuttgart accords all clean and above board and if there were bureaucratic nooks at the more carefully classified levels of dgs hidden aeries in which less politically palatable attacks on the enemies of human genetic continuity were planned and carried outwas that so surprising those who were required to know knew brian had never been required to know ignorance was his preferred mode of consciousness at least when it came to the executive action committee of course not everything could be done legally or visibly as an adult one understood this but he didnt like it it was brians nature to prefer rules to anarchy law was the gardener of human behavior and what lay beyond was brutal red in tooth and claw what lay beyond the garden was sigmund and weil and their uncommunicative smiles and their cadres of armed men what lay beyond fundamentally was the battered body of tomas ginn the aircraft lurched as it rose to cross the coastal mountains that absorbed most of equatorias rainfall and made the inland a desert well be in kubelicks grave in an hour weil said brian had passed through kubelicks grave once before part of an orientation tour he had taken when he was newlyarrived from the states it was a nothing town an adobe armpit that existed for the sole purpose of refueling land traffic bound for the oil sands of the rub alkhali or back through the mahdi pass to the coast weil said there was a community of robed eccentrics living in the desert foothills north and east of kubelicks grave rogue fourths in fact since aerial photographs taken in the past few hours showed turk findleys little bush plane nearby and now the site would be seized and secured brian thought and would the seizure be violent there was a large number of weapons on hand he hoped mainly for show to make a plausible threat because fourths were supposed to be nonviolent gentled by the same tech that granted them longevity no killing would be necessary surely and if there was any killing involved it wouldnt involve lise he would see to that in his intentions at least he was brave it all happened quickly the airport at kubelicks grave was barely large enough to accommodate the transport as soon as it had settled at the end of a cracked concrete runway the rear cargo door dropped and the armed men trooped off in military order a handful of lightly armored vehicles waited in the coppery morning sunlight brian joined sigmund and weil in one of those opentopped desert vehicles the locals called roosters for the way they bounced over the landscape like flightless birds sigmund took the drivers seat and they drove off at the back of the convoy not a comfortable ride the heat and sun were oppressive even at this hour all he saw of kubelicks grave was a garage and gas depot where rusty automobile parts lay scattered the drive train of an ancient truck abandoned on the gravel like the spine of some jurassic creature then they were off the main road rattling over a hardpan trail parallel to the mountains an hour passed broken only by the hoarse shouting of sigmund as he attempted to converse with someone over a field radio the talk what brian could hear of it consisted of codewords and incomprehensible commands then the convoy came over the peak of a small rill and the fourth compound was suddenly dead ahead the military vehicles put on a burst of speed big tires kicking up geysers of dust but weil pulled up short and killed the engine leaving brians ears ringing in the relative silence sigmund began yelling again first into his radio and then at weil something about too late and an order to abort they abandoned the compound weil said to brian fresh tracks must have been a good two dozen vehicles cant you secure the site at least not until we can defuse whatever ordnance they left behind what happens in these cases they he was interrupted by a burst of distant light brian looked at the fourth compound a moment before it had been a cluster of small buildings around a central courtyard now it was an expanding cloud of dust and smoke shit weil had time to say the concussion reached them a fraction of a second later a noise that seemed to swell his lungs until his chest hurt brian closed his eyes a second shockwave like the beat of a hot wing washed over him the compound was gone brian told himself that lise wasnt inside no one had been inside rig it weil was saying what they rig it to destroy their technical gear and keep us from taking samples we got here late weils complexion had turned pale with dust kicked up by the explosion sigmunds assault team had turned back hastily is lise we have to assume she left with the others going where they wont all be traveling together from the tracks it looks like a couple dozen vehicles headed in different directions well run down a few of them with luck well pick up lise and the other major targets with a little more warning we would have had drones in the air to keep watch but we didnt have time and anyway every drone on the continent has been shipped to the far west surveying the fucking oil allotments for earthquake damage sigmund was still growling into his handset then he switched it off and said to weil the planes gone turk findleys bush plane presumably gone escaped should he be pleased about that the aircraft at least we can track weil said and lise along with it brian looked back at the ruins of the compound black smoke gushed from collapsed foundations and small fires burned fitfully in the surrounding desert of the brick and adobe buildings that had once stood there nothing remained they spent the night in what passed for public accommodations in kubelicks grave a tileroofed motel in which brian shared a unit with sigmund and weil two beds and a cotbrian got the cot most of the afternoon and evening he spent listening to sigmund make and take calls the name of the executive action committee was frequently invoked that night unable to sleep in his cot cold despite the banging antique electric heater it occurred to brian to wonder whether they had found out about lises last call to him were his calls tapped for audio lises callback code had been unfamiliar to him probably a disposable loaded with anonymous minutes so they wouldnt have been able to trace it and there hadnt been anything really incriminating about the call apart from the fact that brian had failed to report it which would suggest that his loyalties were divided that he might not be a trustworthy dgs man he wanted to be angry with lise hated her pointless personal involvement in this fucking mess her obsessive need to sort out her fathers disappearance and turn the story into some kind of memoir he wanted to be angry with her and he was angry with himself when he didnt succeed reports on the roundup of fugitive fourths began to come in before dawn sigmund shouting into his phone while brian hurriedly dressed success had been mixed he gathered at least half the population of the compound is still at large weil said our guys intercepted three vehicles carrying a total of fifteen people none of them the major players the good news brian braced himself the good news is a small plane registered to turk findley attempted to refuel at a little utility airport a couple of hundred miles west of here the airport manager recognized the plane from a legal bulletinmr findleys former employer wants it impounded for back rent he called the provisional government and somebody there was kind enough to refer the matter to us our guys arrived and detained the pilot and passengers one male three females all refusing to identify themselves and one of them is lise brian asked maybe thats not confirmed and there may be highervalue targets along with her shes not a target i wouldnt call her a target she made herself a target when she ran but not high value he thought clinging to that can i see her we can be there by noon if we get a move on weil said it occurred to brian to wonder as the town of kubelicks grave vanished behind them who kubelick might have been and why he was buried out here in the badlands but nobody in the car had an answer to that question then the little cluster of buildings was behind them sigmund driving away from the mountains toward the razorflat western horizon the road ahead quivered in the morning heat like a figment of the imagination sigmund couldnt make his phone work though he kept banging it with one hand while he steered with the other even communication between the widelyspaced cars of the convoythis vehicle plus three heavy trucks containing hired soldierswas intermittent and unreliable weil couldnt explain it a halfdozen aerostats anchored between here and the west coast and not one of the fucking things doing what its supposed to do lucky we got the news from the airfield when we did jesus and it was not only the ruptured communication that seemed remarkable to brian he called attention to the steady flow of traffic in the opposite direction not just oilcompany traffic but a number of private vehicles some so sandpitted and sunscarred that they looked barely functional as if they were evacuating the inhabited outposts of the rub alkhali and maybe they weresome new tremor maybe sixty miles farther on the convoy pulled onto the gravel verge and stopped sigmund and weil went forward to talk to the leader of the paramilitary company it looked more like an argument than a conversation but brian couldnt make out the words he stood at the roadside watching the eastbound traffic eerie he thought how much this part of equatoria looked like utah the same dusty blue horizon the same torpid daytime heat had the hypothetical designed this desert when they assembled the planet and if so why but brian doubted they paid that kind of attention to detailsthe hypothetical it seemed to him were firm believers in the long result plant a seed or seed a planet and let nature do the rest until the harvest whatever that meant or might one day mean not much grew out here just the peculiar woody tufts the locals called cactus grass and even this looked dehydrated to brians eye but among the umber patches of cactus grass at his feet he spotted a place where something more colorful had taken root he crouched to look for lack of anything better to do what had caught his attention was a red flower he was no botanist but the bloom looked out of place in this barren scrub he put out his hand and touched it the plant was cold fleshy and it seemed almost to cringe the stem bent away from him the flower if it was a flower lowered its head was that normal he hated this fucking planet its endless strangeness it was a nightmare he thought masquerading as normalcy they came at last to the airfield off the highway a couple of quonsethut structures and two paved landing strips at contrary angles to one another a bank of fuel pumps a twostory adobe control tower with a radar bubble ordinarily the airstrips customers would have been oil company planes ferrying executives to and from the rub alkhali today there was just one plane visible on the tarmac turk findleys aircraft a sturdy little blueandwhite skyrex baking in the sun the genomic security caravan parked in front of the nearest pavilion brian was a little shaky getting out of the car his fears surfacing again fear for lise and under that a fear of liseof what she might say to him and what she might deduce correctly or not about his presence in the company of men such as sigmund and weil maybe he could help her he clung to that thought she was in trouble deep and perilous trouble but she could still keep herself afloat if she said the right things denied complicity shifted the blame and cooperated with the inquiry if she was willing to do that brian might be able to keep her out of prison she would have to go back home of course forget about equatoria and her little journalistic hobby given the events of the last few days though she might not be so haughty at the prospect of a trip back to the states she might even learn to appreciate what he had done and was willing to do on her behalf he hurried to keep up with sigmund and weil who brushed past a cluster of airstrip employees and hurried down a makeshift corridor to the door of a tiny office guarded by an airport security guy in a dusty blue uniform the suspects are inside sigmund asked all four of em lets see them the guard opened the door sigmund went through first weil behind him brian in the rear the two dgs men stopped short and brian had to crane to see over their shoulders fuck sigmund said three women and one man sat at a stained conference table in the middle of the room each of them had been handcuffed to a chair the male was maybe sixty years old judging by his looks probably older since he was a fourth he was whitehaired he was skinny he was darkcomplexioned what he was not was turk findley the three women were of similar age none of them looked like sulean moi and certainly none of them was lise adams decoys weil said his voice turgid with disgust find out who they are and what they know sigmund told the armed men waiting in the corridor weil pulled brian out after him are you all right just yes brian managed i mean im fine he wasnt fine he was picturing the four prisoners with bulletraddled skulls washed up perhaps on some distant beach or just buried in the desert bodies shriveled under a layer of grit paying the butchers bill for their longevity chapter nineteen dvali drove the car that took them north until nightfall and in her less distracted moments lise made a study of him he wasabove all elseprotective of the child isaac lise and turk had been hustled into a big utility vehicle the kind with sprungmetal wheels that could cope with all kinds of terrain the car had been built to accommodate six people comfortably but they had squeezed in seven lise and turk diane mrs rebka sulean moiand isaac turk had advocated taking the skyrex but dvali and mrs rebka argued him out of it an aircraft would be easier to trace and harder to hide than one land vehicle among many they would use the plane as a diversion dr dvali said four of the compounds eldest fourths one of whom was a qualified pilot volunteered to take it west probably they would be captured but they knew what they were doing dr dvali had insisted they werent afraid to die if it came to that one of the ironies of the martian treatment was that it quelled the fear of death even as it extended life turk asked if they had a cure for the fear of insolvency so they drove away and a dozen or so land vehicles left the compound after them scattering in multiple directions on the available roads or across the raw desert the compound had been rigged with explosives to keep it from falling into the hands of the authorities and to destroy any evidence that might lead to their eventual capture lise and company had been too far down the road to see the actual explosion but at one point she had spotted a plume of smoke on the horizon she asked dr dvali whether anyone might have been hurtif dgs agents had arrived before the timed detonation wouldnt they have been killed dgs knows what to expect in situations like this if they found the compound deserted they would have known it was rigged to detonate but if theyd been careless or the timing had been bad dvali shrugged nothing is guaranteed in this life i thought fourths were supposed to be nonviolent were more sensitive than unaltered people to the suffering of others that makes us vulnerable it doesnt make us stupid and it doesnt prevent us from taking risks even risks with other peoples lives sulean moiwho was according to diane a deformed martian but who looked to lise like a skinny appalachian apple dollhad smiled sardonically at that we arent saints that should be obvious by now we make moral choices often the wrong ones dvali wanted to drive through the night but turk convinced him to stop and make camp in a glade of the scrubby finger pines that forested the western slope of the mountainous equatorian divide because of the elevation rain fell fairly regularly here and there was even a cleanrunning creek from which they could draw potable water the water was cold and lise guessed it came from the glaciers that clung to the valleys of the highest passes the chill provoked a pleasant memory of the time she had been ten years old when her father took her skiing at gstaadt sunlight on snow the mechanical groan of the lifts and the sound of laughter cutting the cold air far away now worlds and years away she helped turk warm up a canned meat and vegetable stew over a propane stove he wanted to have dinner ready and the stove cooled off by nightfall in case there were drones overhead looking for their heat signature dr dvali said he doubted their pursuers would go to such lengths especially since most such surveillance equipment had been coopted for use in the crisis in the oilpatch turk nodded but said it was better to take a useless precaution than give themselves away on the road north along the foothills they had discussed their plans turk at least had discussed his plans the fourths were less forthcoming turk and lise would ride as far north as the town of new cumberland from there they would catch a bus over the pharoah pass to the coast the fourths would continue on towell to wherever it was they meant to go someplace where they could take care of the boy lise hoped he was a strangelooking child his hair was rusty red cut short by whoever passed for the compounds barber probably mrs rebka with a pair of kitchen scissors his eyes were widely spaced giving him a birdlike aspect and the pupils were flecked with gold he hadnt said much all day and most of that had been in the morning but he was uncomfortable in some way lise couldnt quite understand whenever the road curved he would either frown and moan or sigh with relief by late afternoon he was feverishagain she heard mrs rebka say now isaac was sleepingin one of the rear seats of the car windows open to let the alpine air flow through hot day but the sunlight had grown horizontal and she had been told the air might turn uncomfortably cold during the night there were only six sleeping bags in the vehicle but they were the expensive kind thermally efficient and someone could sleep in the car if necessary it didnt seem likely to rain but turk had already strung a tarp among the trees for what meager protection or concealment it could offer she stirred the pot of stew while turk made coffee its too bad about the plane i would have lost it anyway what are you going to do when you get back to the coast depends he said on what a lot of things he looked at her as if from a distance squinting probably go back to sea if nothing else turns up or we could go back to the states she said wondering how hed read that we the legal trouble you were in thats essentially over right it could heat up again so well do something else the pronoun hanging in the air like an unbroken pinata guess we have to we they served out dinner while the sun met the horizon in a reddening haze turk ate quickly and said little diane dupree sat on a distant log with the martian woman sulean moi conversing intently but inaudibly while mrs rebka hovered over isaac who had to be coaxed to eat which left dr dvali and lises first real opportunity to speak to him with any degree of privacy she abandoned turk to the camp stove and the pots and went to sit next to him dvali looked at her querulously like a large brown bird but made no objection when she joined him you want to talk about your father he said she could only nod we were friends it was as if dvali had rehearsed this speech what i admired most about your father was that he loved his work but not in a narrow way he was in love with it because he saw it in the broader context do you know what i mean no yes but she wanted to hear it from him not exactly dvali reached down and scooped a handful of dirt what do i have in my hand topsoil old leaves probably a few bugs topsoil mineral residue silts decaying biomass broken down to elemental nutrients feeding itself back to itself bacteria fungal sporesand no doubt some insects he brushed it away much like earth but subtly different in the details on the geological level the resemblance between the two planets is even more obvious granite is granite schist is schist but they exist here in different proportions theres less vulcanism here than on earth the continental plates drift and erode at a different speed the thermocline between the equator and the poles is less steep but whats really distinctive about this world is how fundamentally similar it is to earth because the hypotheticals built this planet for us maybe not for us exactly but yes they built it or at least modified it and that turns our study of this world into a whole new disciplinenot just biology or geology but a kind of planetary archaeology this world was profoundly influenced by the hypotheticals long before modern human beings evolved millions of years before the spin millions of years before the arch was put in place that tells us something about their methods and their extraordinary capacity for very longterm planning it may also tell us something about their ultimate goals if we ask the right question that was the context in which your father worked he never lost sight of that larger truth never ceased to marvel at it planet as artifact lise said the book he was writing dvali nodded have you read it all ive seen of it is the introduction and a few notes salvaged from one of her mothers convulsive fits of radical housecleaning i wish there had been more it would have been an important work is that what you talked about with him often enough yes but not always obviously we talked about the martians and what they might know about the hypotheticals he knew i was a fourth you told him i took him into my confidence may i ask why because of his obvious interest because he was trustworthy because he understood the nature of the world dvali smiled basically because i liked him he was okay with that with yourfourthness he was curious about it did he talk about taking the treatment himself i wont say he didnt consider it but he never made the request to me or so far as i know anyone else he loved his family miss adamsi dont need to tell you that i was as shocked as anyone else when i heard about his disappearance did you confide in him about this project of yours too about isaac when it was in the planning stage yes i talked to him about it dvali sipped his coffee he hated the idea but he didnt inform on you he didnt do anything to stop it no he didnt inform on us but we argued bitterly over itthe friendship was strained at that point strained but not broken because despite our disagreement he understood why the work seemed necessary urgently necessary dvali leaned closer to her and for a moment lise was afraid he would reach out and take her hands she wasnt sure she could stand that the idea of any tangible contact with the hypotheticalswith the motivating spirit behind their vast network of machinesfascinated him as much as it fascinated me he knew how important it was not just for our generation but for generations to come for humanity as a species you must have been disappointed when he wouldnt cooperate i didnt need his cooperation i would have liked his approval i was disappointed when he withheld it after a time we simply stopped talking about itwe talked about other things and when the project began in earnest i left port magellan i never saw your father again that was six months before he disappeared yes do you know anything about that about his disappearance no genomic security was in the port at the timelooking for me among others since rumors of the project had reached themand when i heard robert adams had gone missing i assumed hed been picked up and interrogated by genomic security but i dont know that for certain i wasnt there most of the people who are interrogated by genomic security walk away from it dr dvali although she knew better not all dvali said he wasnt a fourth why would they hurt him kill him she couldnt bring herself to say he would have resisted on principle and out of personal loyalty you knew him well enough to say that i took the treatment in bangalore miss adams twenty years ago im not omniscient but im a good judge of human character not that there was anything especially occult about robert adams he wore his sincerity on his sleeve he was murdered that had always been the most likely explanation though the details might be uglier than lise had imagined robert adams had been murdered and the men who murdered him would never come to trial for it but there was another story inside the story the story of his curiosity his idealism the strength of his convictions some of these thoughts must have shown on her face dvali was radiating a sympathetic concern i know that isnt much help im sorry lise stood up all she felt at the moment was cold may i ask you one more thing if you like how do you justify it the fate of humanity aside how do you justify putting an innocent child in isaacs position dvali turned up his cup and emptied the last of his coffee on the ground isaac was never an innocent child isaac has never been anything other than what he is now and i would trade places with him miss adams if i could eagerly she came across the campground to the circle of light in which turk was sitting fiddling with a pocket telecom receiver turk her avatar of disappearances turk who had vanished from many lives radio broken nothing coming in over the aerostats nothing from port magellan last i heard they were talking about another tremor out west oil revenue of course being the ports perennial obsession in the trusts we trust turk gave her a second look are you all right just tired she said she brewed another pot of coffee and drank enough to keep her alert even as the others began to settle in for the night at lastas she had hopedthere was no one up and moving except herself and the martian woman sulean moi lise was intimidated by sulean moi even though she looked like the kind of elderly woman you might help across the street at a stoplight she wore her age and the distance she had traveled as a kind of invisible aura it took a certain amount of courage to join her at the guttering campfire where the logs had worn down to radiant hollows and red chambers dont be afraid the old woman said lise was startled are you reading my mind reading your face im not really afraid not much sulean smiled exposing her small white teeth i think i would be in your positiongiven what you must have heard about me i know the stories they tell the grim elder martian victim of a childhood injury she tapped her skull my supposed moral authority my unusual history is that how you see yourself no but i recognize the caricature you spent a good deal of time and energy looking for me miss adams call me lise lise then do you still have that photograph youve been showing around no she had destroyed it back in the minang village at dianes urging just as well so here we are no one to overhear us we can talk when i started looking for you i had no idea that it would inconvenience me or that it would attract the attention of genomic security dont apologize you knew what you knew and what you didnt know could hardly enter into your calculations you want to ask me about robert adams and how and why he died do you know for a fact that hes dead i didnt witness the killing but ive spoken with people who saw him abducted and i cant imagine any other outcome if he had been able to come home he would have done so im sorry if that seems blunt blunt but increasingly selfevident lise thought its true that he was taken by genomic security by one of what they call their executive action groups and they were hunting for dr dvali and his group yes and so were you yes for slightly different reasons you wanted to stop him from creating isaac i wanted to stop him from performing a needlessly cruel and probably useless human experiment yes isnt that what genomic security wanted only in their press releases do you really believe organizations like genomic security operate within their mission statements if genomic security could acquire the tools they would have secret bunkers full of multiple isaacswired to machines under armed guard lise shook her head to order her thoughts how did you meet my father the first useful person i met in equatoria was diane dupree theres no formal hierarchy among terrestrial fourths but in every fourth community theres some pivotal figure who figures in every major decision diane played that role in coastal equatoria i told her why i wanted to find dvali and she gave me the names of people who might be usefulnot all of them fourths dr dvali had befriended your father i befriended him too dr dvali said my father was trustworthy your father had a striking faith in fundamental human goodness that didnt always work to his advantage you think dvali took advantage of him i think it took him a long time to see dr dvali for what he was which is a man with grandiose ambitions profound insecurities and a dangerously malleable conscience your father was reluctant to reveal dr dvalis announced plans and whereabouts even to me did he though once we got to know each other we spent a lot of time discussing cosmology first i think that was your fathers unique way of evaluating people you can tell a lot about a person he once said by the way they look at the stars if he told you what he knew why couldnt you find dvali and stop him because dr dvali was wise enough to change his plans once he left port magellan your father believed dvali was establishing a compound on the far west coast of equatoriastill mostly a wilderness even today apart from a few fishing villages thats what he told me and thats no doubt what he told genomic security when they interrogated him dvali thinks my father refused to talkthat that was why they killed him im sure he resisted i doubt he succeeded given what i know about their interrogation techniques i know it hurts you to hear that lise and im sorry but its the truth your father told me what he knew because he believed dvali ought to be stopped and he believed i had the authority to intervene without doing violence to dvali or the fourth community in general if he told these things to genomic security he would have done so only under duress but lise it didnt matter dvali wasnt on the west coast he never had been genomic security lost track of him and by the time i found out where he had truly gone it was far too lateyears had passed isaac was a living child he couldnt be called back into the womb i see in the ensuing silence lise could hear the crackle of the smoldering fire lise sulean moi said softly i lost my parents when i was very young i expect diane told you that i lost my parents but worse than that i lost my memory of them it was as if they had never existed at all im sorry im not asking for sympathy what i want to tell you is that at a certain age i made it my business to educate myself about themto learn who they were and how they had come to live beside a certain river before it flooded and what warnings they might have heeded or ignored i think i wanted to know whether i ought to love them for trying to rescue me or hate them for failing i found out a lot of things mostly irrelevant including a number of painful truths about their personal lives but the only important thing i learned was that they were blameless it was a very small consolation but it was all there would ever be and in a way it was enough liseyour father was blameless thank you lise said hoarsely and now we should try to sleep sulean moi said before the sun comes up again lise slept better than she had in several nightseven though she was in a sleeping bag on uneven ground in a strange forestbut it wasnt the sun that woke her it was turks hand on her shoulder still dark out she registered groggily we have to go turk said hurry up lise why the ash is falling again in port magellan more and heavier and itll cross the mountains before too long we need to get under shelter chapter twenty isaac woke to see the clouds billowing through the passes behind the moving car clouds shot through with luminous particles clouds like the clouds of august th but the sudden and breathtaking hurt obscured all that what he felt wasnt pain exactly but something very much like it a sensitivity that made light and noise intolerable as if the exposed blade of the world had been thrust into his skull isaac understood his own specialness he knew he had been created in an attempt to communicate with the hypothetical and he knew he had been a disappointment to the adults around him he knew other things too he knew the vacuum of space wasnt empty it was populated by ghost particles that existed too briefly to interact with the world of tangible things but the hypothetical could manipulate these ephemeral particles and use them to send and receive information the martian technology embedded in isaac had attuned his nervous system to this kind of signaling but it never resolved into anything like the comfortable linearity of words most of the time it was a sense of distant inexpressible urgency sometimesnowit was more like pain and the pain was connected with the approaching cloud of dust and ash the unseen world heaved with an invisible tumult and isaacs mind and body vibrated in concert he was aware too of being lifted into the rear seat of the car of being strapped in by hands not his own of the voices and concerns of his old and new friends they were afraid for him and they were afraid for themselves he was aware of dr dvali ordering everyone into the car the slamming doors the revving engine and he was glad it was not dr dvali who held his head and soothed him it was mrs rebka because he had come to dislike dr dvali almost to hate dr dvali for reasons he didnt understand mrs rebka wasnt a physician but she had trained herself in basic medicine as had the other fourths and lise watched as she administered a sedative pricking the boys arm with an oldfashioned syringe isaac began to breathe more deeply and his screaming eventually ebbed to a sigh they drove the vehicles headlights cut columns of light into the falling dust turk was doing the driving on behalf of the fourths trying to get out of the foothills before the roads became impassable lise had asked whether they shouldnt take isaac to a hospital but mrs rebka shook her head theres nothing a hospital can do for him nothing we cant do for him ourselves diane dupree watched the boy with wide anxious eyes sulean moi also watched him but her expression was more inscrutablesome combination it seemed to lise of resignation and terror but it was mrs rebka who allowed isaac to rest his head on her shoulder who reassured him with a word or the silent pressure of her hand when the bounce and rattle of the car disturbed him she smoothed his hair and dabbed his forehead with a damp cloth before long the sedative put him to sleep there was an obvious question lise had been wanting to ask since they arrived at the fourth compound and since no one else had anything to sayand because the noise of the windshield wipers scraping dust across glass was driving her slightly crazyshe drew a breath and asked is isaacs mother still alive yes mrs rebka said lise turned to face her are you his mother i am mrs rebka said what do you see isaac much later as he was waking up from the sleep they had injected into him isaac pondered the question mrs rebka was the one who had asked it he tried to formulate an answer before the pain came back and stole his words but the question was hard to answer because he was having a hard time seeing anything at all he was aware of the vehicle and the people in it the ash falling beyond the windows but they all seemed vague and unreal was it daytime yet but now the car had stopped and before he answered mrs rebkas question he asked one of his own where are we up front the man named turk findley said little town called bustee we might be staying here a while outside there were small buildings visible through the fog of dust he could see them plainly enough but that wasnt what mrs rebka had meant by her question isaac can you walk yes he could for now though the sedative was wearing off and the blade of the world was beginning to draw blood again he climbed out of the car with one hand on mrs rebkas arm dust sifted across his face the dust smelled like something burned mrs rebka steered him toward the nearest small building which was one wing of a motel isaac heard turk say he had rented the last available room for more money than it was worth lots of people were sheltering in bustee tonight turk said then he was inside on a bed on his back and the air was less dusty though it still stank and mrs rebka brought a fresh cloth and began to dab the grime from his face isaac she said again gently what are you looking at what do you see because he kept turning his head in one directionwest of courseand staring what did he see a light here in the room no a long way away farther than the horizon but you can see it from here you can see it through the walls he nodded what does it look like many words crowded isaacs mind many answers a fire in a faraway place an explosion sunrise sunset the place where the stars fall and burn in their eagerness to live and the thing deep underground that knows and welcomes them but what he said was simply truthfully i dont know only turk had been to bustee before the name he said was derived from a hindi word for slum it wasnt a slum but it was a greasy little road town on the edge of the rub alkhali catering to traffic along the northernmost route to and from the oil lands cinderblock buildings and a few timberframed houses a store that sold tire gauges maps and compasses sunblock cheap novels disposable phones three gas stations and four restaurants none of which lise could see from the window of the motel room the ashfall sifted down in gray stinking curtains power lines down or transformers shorted by dust she guessed and repairs wouldnt be quick not out here in lowpriorityland it was a miracle they had made it here at all even in their big allterrain allweather vehicle someone from the motel office knocked at the door and handed out flashlights and a warning not to attempt candles or any kind of open flame but the fourths had packed their own flashlights and there was nothing to see anyway only dingy walls and patchwork wallpaper lise kept a flashlight at hand for navigating her way to the bathroom when the need arose the boy isaac slept driven more by exhaustion than sedatives now lise guessed the adults had huddled for conversation dr dvali was speculating about the ashfall in his persuasive and gentlymodulated voice it might be a cyclical event theres evidence in the geological recordthis was some of your fathers work miss adams though we never knew how to interpret it very thin ash layers compressed into the rock at intervals of ten thousand years or so what does that mean turk asked it happens every ten thousand years everything gets buried in ash not everything not everywhere you find evidence of it mainly in the far west wouldnt it have to be a pretty thick layer to leave traces like that thick or persistent over a long period of time because these buildings arent built to hold up anything much more than their own weight roofs crushed dust entombing the survivors a cold pompeii lise thought that was chilling but she had another thought she said and isaacis the dustfall connected with whats happening to isaac sulean moi gave her a sad look of course it is she said isaac understood it best in his dreams where knowledge was rendered in wordless shapes and colors and textures in his dreams planets and species arose like vagrant thoughts were dismissed or committed to memory evolved as thoughts evolved his sleeping mind worked the way the universe workedhow could it be otherwise halfheard phrases filtered into his floating awareness ten thousand years the dust had fallen before ten thousand years before and ten thousand years before that vast structures seeded space with their residue feeding cyclical processes that turned and turned like faceted diamonds the dust fell in the west because the west was calling it as the west called isaac this planet wasnt earth it was older it existed in an older universe old things lived inside it things lived inside it things that were not mindful but listened and spoke and pulsed in slow millennial rhythms he could hear their voices some were close to him closer than they had ever been before the groan of the hotels stressed beams and timbers continued after dusk and through the nightmanagement sent a crew up to shovel the roofbut the ashfall tapered off and by dawn the air had cleared to a gritty semitransparency lise had fallen asleep despite her best efforts to stay awake curled on a foam mattress with the stink of the dust in her nostrils and sweat streaking her face she was the last to wake she opened her eyes and saw that the fourths were up and had gathered at the rooms two windows the light coming in was less bright than a rainy autumn glow but it was more than she had dared hope for while the dust was still falling she sat up she was wearing yesterdays clothes and her skin was encrusted with yesterdays dirt also her throat turk had noticed her movement he handed her a bottle of water and she gulped it gratefully what time is it about eight eight oclock by the long equatorian reckoning of the hours suns been up for a while now the dust stopped falling but its still settling a lot of fine powder in the air hows isaac hes not screaming anyway were okay but you might want to take a look outside mrs rebka stepped back to tend to isaac and allowed lise to take her place at the window lise looked outside reluctantly but there seemed to be nothing unexpected just a road drifted over with ash the same road they had crept along yesterday pushing their vehicle to the limit of its endurance the car was where they had left it dust duned on the windward side its webbed steel wheels were still dilated as big as the tires on the industrial rigs parked in sheltering rows beyond it the daylight was dim and gritty but she could see all the way to the gas station some hundred or so yards to the south the road was empty of pedestrians but other faces peered from other windows nothing moved no that wasnt quite true the dust moved beyond the courtyard in the gray emptiness of the road something like a whirlpool began to form as she watched a region of ash the size of a dinner table began to turn a slow clockwise circle what is that dr dvali standing next to turk said watch turk put a hand on her left shoulder and her own right hand moved to cover it the ash turned more quickly dimpled at the center of the vortex slowed again lise didnt like what she was seeing it was unnatural threatening or maybe that was just the vibe she was picking up from the others they knew what to expect they had seen this before whatever it was then the dust explodedlike a geyser lise thought it shot a plume about ten feet into the air she gasped and took an involuntary step back the ejected dust became a roostertail in the wind and eventually faded into the general miasma of the air but as it cleared it became obvious that the geyser had left something behind something shiny it looked like a flower a rubycolored flower lise marveled smoothstemmed and with a texture that made her think of the skin of a newborn infant stem and head were the same shade of deep hypnotic red turk said thats the closest one yet the flowera word to which lises frantic thoughts automatically defaulted because it really did look like a flower with a gargantuan stem and a crown of petals and she realized she was thinking of the sunflowers in her mothers garden in california which had been just about this tall when they went to seedbegan to arch and twist turning its convex head to some rhythmless inaudible tune she said there are more of these there were where what happened to them wait turk said the flower turned its head toward the hotel lise stifled another small gasp because in the center of the bloom there was something that looked like an eye it was round and it glittered wetly and it contained a sort of pupil obsidianblack for one awful moment it appeared to look directly at her is this what it was like on mars dr dvali said to sulean moi mars is countless lightyears away where we are now the hypothetical have been active for much longer the things that grew on mars were much less active different in appearance but if youre asking me whether this is a similar phenomenon then yes probably it is the ocular sunflower abruptly stopped moving the inundated town of bustee was still and silent as if holding its breath then there was to lises horror more motion in the dust bumpedup rills and puffs of ash converging on the flower somethingseveral thingsleaped onto the stalk of it with frightening speed they moved continuously and she could only form a vague impression of their nature things crablike seagreen manylegged and what they did to the sunflower was they ate it they nipped at its stalk until the writhing thing toppled then they were on it like piranhas on a carcass and when the manic flurry of their devouring was finished they disappeared or became inert once more camouflaged in the fallen ash nothing was left behind no evidence whatsoever this dr dvali said is why were reluctant to leave the room chapter twentyone turk spent the rest of the morning at the window cataloging the varieties of peculiar life that sprang out of the dust know your enemy he thought lise stood next to him much of the time asking brief but pertinent questions about what he had seen before she woke up dr dvali had switched on their little wireless telecom receiver and was drawing down sporadic reports from port magellan a useful activity in turks opinion but the other fourths did nothing but talk endlessly and to little purpose it was one of the failings of fourths turk decided they might occasionally be wise but they were incurably talky right now they were picking on the martian woman sulean moi who seemed to know more than the rest of them about the ashfall but who was reluctant to share her knowledge mrs rebka was particularly insistent your taboos arent relevant here she said we need all the information we can get you owe it to us to the boy at least temperate as it sounded this was by fourth standards nearly a fistfight the martian woman dressed in oversized denim pants that made her look like some implausibly skinny oilrig jock sat on the floor hugging her knees if you have a question she said sullenly ask it you said the ashfall on mars generated peculiar forms of of of life mrs rebka call it by its name why not lifeforms like what were seeing outside i dont recognize the flowers or the predators that consume them in that sense theres no similarity but thats to be expected a forest in ecuador doesnt look like a forest in finland but both are forests the purpose of it though mrs rebka said ive studied the hypotheticals since childhood and ive listened to a lot of highlyinformed speculation and i still cant guess the purpose of it the martian ashfalls are isolated events the life they generate is vegetative always shortlived and unstable in the long term what conclusions can be drawn from such isolated examples very few she hesitated frowning the hypotheticalswhatever else they areare almost certainly not discreet entities but a collation of vastly many interconnected processes they are an ecology in other words these manifestations either play some explicit role in that process or are an unintended consequence of it i dont believe they represent any kind of deliberate strategy on the part of a higher consciousness yes mrs rebka said impatiently but if your people understood enough to engineer hypothetical technology into human beings you possess that ability too sulean moi looked pointedly at isaac because it was given to us by wun ngo wen our work on mars has always been purely pragmatic we were able to culture samples from the ashfall and observe their ability to interact with human protein at the cellular level centuries of that kind of observation produced some insight into the ways human biology might be manipulated but you engineered what you admit is hypothetical technology technology or biologyin this case im not sure the distinction is meaningful yes we cultured alien life or technology if you prefer that word at the microscopic level because it grows reproduces and dies we were able to select and manipulate certain strains for certain traits over the course of a great many years we generated the modified cultures that enhance human longevity and other germ lines as well one of the most radical of which is the treatment you applied to isaac while he was still in the womb in your womb mrs rebka mrs rebka reddened turk understood the significance of what they were discussing and he guessed it was important but it seemed ridiculously remote at a time when real problems were percolating so close to hand right outside the door in fact was it safe to go outside that was the question they ought to be asking because sooner or later they would have to leave this room because they had very little in the way of food he begged the loan of dr dvalis little radio and pushed the nodes into his ears blocking out the querulous fourths and inducing other voices the available broadcast was a narrowband thing from port magellan two guys from one of the local media collectives reading un advisories and updated reports this ashfall had been only a little worse than the first at least in terms of weight and duration a few roofs had collapsed to the south of the city most roads were currently impassable people with respiratory problems had been sickened by ash inhalation and even healthy people were spitting gray residue but that wasnt what had everybody scared what had everybody scared were the peculiar things growing out of the ash the announcers called these things growths and reported that they had appeared randomly across the city but especially where the ash was deep or had drifted they sprang from the dust in other words like seedlings from mulch although they lived only briefly and were quickly reabsorbed into the local environment a few of themobjects resembling trees or enormous mushroomshad erupted to impressive heights there was a dreamlike or nightmarelike aspect to these reports a pink cylinder fifty feet in length was blocking traffic at a downtown intersection something witnesses describe as an immense spiky bubble like a piece of coral had sprouted from the roof of the chinese consulate reports of small motile forms were yet to be officially confirmed terrifying as this was the manifestations were dangerous only if you happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong timeif one of them fell on you for example still residents were advised to stay indoors and keep windows closed the ash had stopped falling an offshore breeze was dispersing the lightest of the particles and work crews were prepped to hose down the streets again growths and all turk supposed as soon as that was practical unless this began to happen repeatedly the city would recover but the city was on the far side of a chain of mountains pierced by a few currently useless passes and bustee like every other tinandtarpaper road town between the foothills and the rub alkhali depended on the coast for supplies how long till the passes were cleared weeks minimum turk guessed the last ashfall had been hard on these towns but this one had been worse locally much denser and the weirdass plant life or whatever it was would surely impede the work necessary to get commerce up and running so food would run short what about water he wasnt sure how these desert settlements were supplied you turned on the tap but where was the reservoir up in the foothills was the water still potable and would it stay that way at least there was food and bottled water in the car enough to last them a while what turk didnt like was that the vehicle was sitting out in the parking lot of this motel where someone might be tempted to break in and share the wealth here at least was a problem he could confront he stood up and said im going outside the others turned to look goggleeyed at him dvali said what are you talking about he explained about the food even if no one else is hungry i am it might not be safe dvali said turk had seen a couple of other people out in the street with handkerchiefs tied over their mouths one of them had been within fifteen feet of a lifeform when it sprouted from the dust but the flower hadnt interfered with the man and the man had shown absolutely no inclination to fuck with the flower which jibed with what the news was saying about port magellan just to the car and back but id like somebody in the doorway watching out for me and i need something to use for a mask there was no debate to turks relief dr dvali used a pocketknife to cut off a corner of the bedsheet which turk tied over his nose and mouth turk took the vehicles keycard from mrs rebka while lise volunteered for door duty dont stay out any longer than you need to she said dont worry he said the sky was blue made chalky by the ash that gave the air a sour sulfuric tang no telling what this was doing to everybodys lungs if the dust contained alien sporeswhich was what all the talk seemed to implymight they not take root in the moist interior of a human body but they didnt seem to need much moisture turk thought if they could grow on the paved street of a desert town in a dry september in any case there had been no reports of purely ashrelated deaths he shook off these concerns and tried to concentrate on the task at hand he felt lonely as soon as he stepped outside the motel parking lot was a paved halfmoon with an empty ceramic fountain in the middle of it beyond it was the main street really just a stretch of highway heading into the rub alkhali across the street there was a row of onestory brick commercial buildings all of this was ashcoated windows dustencrusted traffic signs and billboards rendered illegible the silence was unbroken the fourths vehicle recognizable by its boxy shape and sprungsteel wheels was parked a dozen yards to turks left he stood a moment and looked back at lise who was holding the door open a crack he gave her a little wave and she nodded all clear onward he took long deliberate steps trying not to stir up too much dust his shoes impacted the drifted ash and left finelydetailed prints under chalky clouds he reached the car without incident and was only slightly unnerved by the distance that had opened up between himself and the room where lise was waiting he used his forearm to brush a layer of ash off the rear of the vehicle the baggage compartment where the groceries were stored he took dr dvalis keycard out of his pocket and applied it to the security slot tendrils of dust rose up around his hands he paused and lifted the cloth that covered his mouth long enough to spit the spittle plopped inelegantly on the surface of the ashcovered sidewalk and he half expected something to rise up from beneath like a fish rising to bait and snatch it away he opened the cargo door and selected a cooler full of bottled water and a box of canned goodsthe kind of thing you could eat without cooking if you had toand that plus a few stacks of flatbread was all he could carry enough for now or he could get in the car and drive it closer to the room but that would block the route around the courtyard and maybe attract unwanted attention turk lise yelled from the doorway he looked back at her the door was wide open and she was leaning forward her hair framing her face she pointed with obvious urgency turk in the street he saw it at once it didnt look threatening whatever it was in fact it looked like nothing more than a scrap of loose paper or sheet plastic caught in a gust of wind fluttering at head level above the dustduned highway by the diner it flapped but you couldnt really say it was flying not in the purposeful way a bird flies but it wasnt a sheet of paper it was something stranger than that it was colored glassy blue at the center red at its four extremities and although it was clumsy in the air it appeared to move by design slipsliding up the center of the road then it seemed to hesitate its four wingtips pumping simultaneously to loft it a few feet higher the next time it moved it moved in a new direction it moved toward turk get the fuck back here lise was screaming they said these things werent dangerous turk hoped that was true he dropped everything but the carton of canned goods and began to run about halfway to the door he glanced back over his shoulder the flapping thing was right behind him a yard to his rightway too close he dropped the last carton and broke into a fullout sprint the thing was bigger than it had looked from a distance and louder it sounded like a bedsheet on a laundry line in a windstorm he didnt know whether it could hurt him but it was clearly interested in him he ran and because the ash here was six inches deep in places deeper it was like running on a sandy beach or in a nightmare lise threw the door wide open soon turk could see the flapping thing in his peripheral vision beating the air like a piston all it had to do was veer right and it would be on him but it kept its steady if erratic course paralleling him almost as if it was racing him racing him to the open door he slowed down the flapper rattled past him turk lise was still posed in the doorway turk ripped the cloth from his mouth and took a deep breath bad move because his throat was instantly clogged close it he croaked but she couldnt hear him he gagged and spat the door dammit close the fuckin door whether or not she heard him the danger dawned on lise she stepped back and simultaneously made a grab for the doorknob missed lost her balance and fell the flapping thing no longer awkward in the air homed in on her as if it were laserguided turk began sprinting again but she was too far away she sat halfway up balanced on an elbow eyes wide and turk felt a stab of fear under his ribs sharp as a thorn to the heart she raised an arm to fend off the thing but it ignored her as it had ignored turk it slid past her into the room turk couldnt see what happened next he heard a muted scream and then mrs rebkas voice a keening wail more shocking because it came from a fourth she was calling isaacs name chapter twewtytwo lise sat stunned on the floor not sure exactly what had happened the thing the flying thing the thing she had thought was about to attack turk had come inside the room for a single dazed moment she heard the sound of it subside to a moist fluttering then the sound stopped altogether and mrs rebka began shouting lise struggled to her feet shut the door dr dvali roared but no not yet she waited for turk who came barreling in along with a cloud of dust then she slammed the door and looked around warily for the flying creature idiotically she was thinking of the summer her parents had taken her on vacation to a cabin in the adirondacks one night a bat had come down the chimney and fluttered around in the darkness terrifying her she recalled with supernatural clarity the feeling that at any moment something hot and alive would tangle itself in her hair and begin to bite but the flapping thing had already alighted she realized the fourths gathered around the bed where isaac lay because because the flying creature had landed on the boys face the terrified boy had turned his head against the pillow the animal or creature or whatever it was called or ought to be called covered his left cheek like a fleshy red poultice one corner of it matted the hair above his temple while another enclosed his neck and shoulder isaacs mouth and nose remained free although the gelid body of the thing had adhered to his trembling lower lip his left eye was dimly visible through the creatures translucent body his other eye was wide open mrs rebka went on calling the boys name she reached for the creature as if to pull it away but dvali caught her hand dont touch it anna he said anna mrs rebkas name was anna some idiotically calm fraction of lises mind filed that fact away anna rebka who was also the boys mother we need to get it off him something to handle it with dvali said gloves a stick a piece of paper turk yanked a pillowcase from one of the spare pillows and wrapped it around his right hand strange lise thought how the flying thing had ignored turk in the street how it had ignored lise for that matter and the other adults all easy targets but had lighted without hesitation on isaac did that mean something whatever the flying thing truly wasand she did not doubt that it had sprung from the ash like the ocular flower or the host of carnival objects the news was reporting from port magellanwas it possible it had chosen isaac the others stood back from the bed as turk reached toward the creature with his wrapped hand but then another strange thing happened the flying thing disappeared the hell turk said isaac gasped and sat suddenly upright put his hand to his face and felt the freshly revealed skin lise blinked and tried to replay the memory in her minds eye the flapping thing had dissolvedor at least thats how it had looked it had turned to liquid all at once and instantly evaporated or no it had seeped away like a puddle of water drawn into moist earth there wasnt even a wisp of vapor where it had been it was as if it had drained directly into isaacs flesh she set aside that troubling thought mrs rebka pushed past turk and reached for the boyfell on the bed beside him and took him into her arms isaac still gasping bent his body against her and ducked his head into her shoulder he began to sob when it became obvious nothing more was about to happennothing monstrous at leastdvali asked the others to step back give them some room lise retreated and grabbed turks hand his hand was sweaty and dusty but infinitely reassuring she couldnt begin to guess what had just happened but the aftermath was utterly comprehensible a frightened child was being comforted by his mother for the first time lise began to see mrs rebka as something more than a spooky emotionally distant fourth for mrs rebka at least isaac wasnt a biology experiment isaac was her son what the fuck turk repeated is the kid all right that remained to be seen sulean moi and diane dupree sequestered themselves in the motel rooms tiny kitchen nook talking fervently but quietly dr dvali watched mrs rebka from a careful distance gradually isaacs breathing grew steadier at last he pulled away from mrs rebka and looked around his peculiar goldflecked eyes were large and wet and he hiccupped a couple of times diane dupree emerged from her conference with the martian woman and said let me examine him she was the closest thing to a medical doctor in the room so mrs rebka reluctantly allowed diane to sit with the boy measuring his pulse and thumping his chest doing these things lise suspected more to reassure isaac than to diagnose him she did look closely at his left cheek and forehead where the creature had touched him but there was no obvious rash or irritation lastly she looked into isaacs eyesthose strange eyesand seemed to find nothing extraordinary there isaac mustered enough courage to ask are you a doctor just a nurse and you can call me diane am i all right diane you seem all right to me what happened i dont know a lot of strange things are happening right now that was just one of them how do you feel the boy paused as if taking inventory better he said finally not scared no well not as much in fact he was speaking more coherently than he had for a couple of days may i ask you a question the boy nodded last night you said you could see through the walls you said there was a light only you could see do you still see it he nodded again where can you point at it haltingly isaac did so turk diane said do you have your compass turk carried a brassencased compass in his pockethe had refused to abandon it back in the minang village much to ibu dianes annoyance he took it out and sighted along isaacs arm toward his extended index finger this is nothing new mrs rebka said impatiently he always points the same way a little north of west just about due west now tending to the south if anything turk looked up and registered their expressions why is that important by midafternoon the street was more nearly normal nothing had grown out of the ashfall for a couple of hours there were occasional eddies in the dust but that could have been the winda gusty wind had come up clouding the air and piling gray windrows against exposed vertical surfaces but it swept away some of the ashfall and even exposed the asphalt in places only a few of the bizarre growths had lasted out the morning most like the flower with an eye in its bloom were attacked eaten lise thought might as well use the word by smaller and more mobile entities which then faded and vanished some of the larger growths were still more or less intact she had seen a sort of technicolor tumbleweed blowing down the street obviously the husk of something no longer vital and there was a fretwork of brittle white tubules clinging to one of the buildings opposite the motel obscuring a sign that had once announced auto parts but was no longer legible under the pale fretwork the relative calm drew people out of their hiding places a few bigtired vehicles clanked past more or less managing the dustfall the motel clerk knocked on the door and asked whether everyone was okayhe had seen a little of the mornings drama turk said they were fine and he even ventured outside again door firmly closed behind him lise at the window concealing her anxiety and came back from the car with enough groceries to last a couple of days mrs rebka continued hovering over isaac who was alert and not obviously suffering he was sitting up now facing the western wall of the room as if he were praying to some backward mecca this wasnt new behavior lise understood but it was still deeply spooky when mrs rebka took a bathroom break lise went to the boys bedside and sat with him she said hello he looked at her briefly then turned his head back to the wall lise said what is it isaac it lives underground the boy said and lise suppressed a shiver and backed away turk and dr dvali conferred over a map it was the standard foldup map of the topography and sparse roads of equatoria west of the mountains lise peeked over turks shoulder as he marked lines with a pen and a ruler whats this about were triangulating turk said triangulating what dvali with only slightly strained patience pointed at a dot on the map this is the compound where you met us miss adams we left there and we traveled north about two hundred mileshere a flyspeck marked bustee back at the compound isaacs obsession was with a very specific compass point which weve drawn out a long line into the west but where we are now his directional sense appears to have altered slightly another long line not quite parallel to the first the lines moved closer across the ambercolored vastness of the desert deep into the marked boundaries of the international mineralrights concessions they intersected in the rub alkhali the sandy tableland that comprised the western quarter of equatoria thats what hes pointing at thats what hes been pointing at all summermore urgently in the last few weeks so what is it whats there as far as i know nothing nothings there but its where he wants to go yes dr dvali looked past lise at the other fourths and thats where were going to take him the fourth women said nothing only stared it was mrs rebka who finally reluctantly nodded her consent lise couldnt sleep that night she tossed on her mattress listening to the sounds the others made whatever else the fourth treatment might cure it did nothing for snoring and yet they slept and she did not eventually well past midnight she got up stepped over sleeping bodies on her way to the bathroom and splashed her face with lukewarm water instead of going back to bed she went to the window where turk was sitting in a chair keeping the night watch cant sleep she whispered turk kept his gaze fixed on the street outside a ghostly void by the light of the dustdimmed moon nothing was happening the peculiar eruptions from the ashfall showed no sign of resuming finally he said you want to talk i dont want to wake anybody up come out to the car turk and dr dvali had moved the car closer to the room where it would be easier to keep an eye on we can sit there awhile its safe enough now lise had not left the room since they arrived and the idea appealed to her she was wearing her only pair of jeans and an oversized shirt she had borrowed from the fourth compound she pulled her shoes onto her bare feet turk opened the door and eased it shut when they had stepped outside the smell of the ash was instantly stronger sulfur or something bitter like thatwhy did the ash smell like sulfur hypothetical machines grew in cold places or so lise had learned in school distant asteroids the frozen moons of frozen planets was there sulfur out there she had heard of sulfur on the moons of was it jupiter the new worlds solar system had a planet like that a cold radioactive giant far from the sun the wind had died with nightfall the sky was hazy but she could see a few stars even when she was very young her father had loved to show her the stars the stars need names he would say and together they would name them big blue point of the triangle or silly names belinda grapefruit antelope she slid into the front seat next to turk we need to talk about what happens next he said yes that was undeniably true she said the fourths are taking isaac west right i dont know what they hope to accomplish they think he can talk to the hypothetical greatwhats he going to say greetings from the human race please stop dropping shit on us from outer space theyre hoping to learn something profound you believe that no but they do dvali does at least fourths are generally pretty reasonable people but would you put a bet on that outcome i wouldnt it was like religion lise supposed you didnt lay odds on the sacred you just looked for it with an open heart and hoped for the best but she didnt say that to turk so what do we do when they take off for the desert he said im thinking of going with them yourewhat wait it makes sense you saw the map right the place theyre headed is threequarters of the way to the west coast from there theres a decent road all the way to the sea the west coast lise thats nothing but fishing villages and research outposts catch a boat on the southern route back to port magellan and by the time i get there nobodys looking for me anymore the whole fourth thing is over and genomic security has probably figured that out i have enough friends in the fourth community that i can probably get myself a whole new set of identity documents nights got chilly in the desert this time of year the upholstery was cold and their talk had made condensation on the window i can see a couple of problems with that so can iwhats your list she tried to be logical well the ashfall even if the roads are passable even with a good vehicle you could get stalled run out of gas have engine problems its a risk he admitted but you can plan for it carry tools and parts and fuel and so on and the fourths arent a free ride they expect to find something out there what if theyre right i mean look at the way that flying thing went after isaac maybe he is special maybe he has some special attraction to the uh whatever grows out of the ash and if so that could be a major obstacle i thought about that too but i havent heard of anyone being seriously hurt by those things except accidentally even isaac whatever happened to him it doesnt seem to have made him worse it landed on his face turk it sank into his skin hes sitting up hes not feverish hes no sicker than he was before you wouldnt say that if it had been you thats the pointit wasnt me whatever that thing was im not what it wanted so we just tag along and when theyre finished with isaacwhatever that meanswe go on to the coast thats the plan he said with an embarrassment lise could feel even in the shadows of the car doesnt have to be both of us if you want you can stick here and try to catch a ride over the pass when the ash clears you have options i dont have probably safer to do that from the objective point of view the objective point of view doubtless turk imagined he was giving her the latitude to back out graciously from a reckless plan he led the kind of life that allowed for sudden reversals of fortune and heavy wagers against fate she didnt that was the implication and it was of course true by and largethough not lately ill think about it she said and stepped out of the car into the moonlit night wishing she had been able to sleep come morning there was a degree of nearnormality in bustee a few pedestrians in the street a few capable vehicles beginning to head toward the larger towns to the south locals gawked at the remains of alien life clinging to the facades of buildings or littering the sidewalks like broken oncebrightlycolored toys life reassembling itself lise thought despite the strangeness her own life more deeply unraveled was slower to knit the fourths now that they had reached a consensus set out to procure supplies a party of fourdr dvali sulean moi diane dupree and turkwent to see what money could still buy at the local shops turk was even talking about a second vehicle if they could procure one lise stayed in the motel room with mrs rebka and isaac hoping to catch another couple of hours of sleep which turned out to be difficult because isaac was agitated again not because of the flying thing that had attacked himthat seemed to have passed from his mind as promptly as a bad dreambut out of a new sense of urgency a need to hurry to the heart of whatever was happening out west mrs rebka had asked a few tentative questions what did he mean when he talked about something underground but isaac couldnt answer and grew frustrated when he tried so mrs rebka told him they were going west they were going west as soon as they possibly could and eventually isaac accepted this consolation and fell back to sleep mrs rebka left the bedside and moved to a chair lise pulled her own chair closer mrs rebka looked about fifty years old lise had assumed she was older she was a fourth and fourths could appear about fifty for decades but if isaac was hers she couldnt be much older than she looked and anyway lise thought wasnt it true that fourths were biologically unable to conceive so mrs rebkas pregnancy must have begun before her conversion the obvious question was difficult but lise was determined to ask it and she wasnt likely to have a better opportunity how did it happen mrs rebka the boy i mean how did he i mean if this isnt too personal mrs rebka closed her eyes fatigue was written all over her face fatigue or some deep intractable despair what are you asking miss adams how he was altered or why he was conceived lise fumbled for an answer but mrs rebka waved it off a brief and not especially interesting story my husband was a lecturer temporarily seconded to the american university not a fourth but friendly toward them he might have considered the treatment himself except that he was a devout orthodox jewhis religious principles forbade it and he died for the lack of it he had an aneurism in his brain inoperable the treatment was the only thing that might have saved him i begged him to take it but he refused in my grief i hated him a little for that because because you were pregnant yes did he know by the time i was certain of it the aneurism had burst he lived a few days but he was comatose that child was isaac mrs rebka closed her eyes that was fetal tissue that became isaac i know how brutal that sounds but i couldnt tolerate the idea of raising the child alone i meant to have an abortion it was dr dvali who convinced me otherwise he had been one of my husbands closest friends and he became mine he admitted that he was a fourth he talked to me about the controversies in the fourth community what it was like beingat least in some sensea better kind of human being and he talked to me about the hypothetical a subject that had always interested me he introduced me to others in his community they were supportive they talked you into doing what they wanted you to do nothing as crude as that they didnt feed me propaganda i liked these peoplei liked them better than all the unchanged people who visited me out of a sense of duty who were relentlessly sympathetic and secretly indifferent the fourths were authentic they said what they believed and one of the things avram dvali believed in was the possibility of communicating with the hypotheticals he led me very gradually to the idea that i might have something to contribute to that very important work because i was unchanged and pregnant so you gave him isaac not isaac i gave him the possibility of isaac otherwise i would never have carried the child to term she breathed in breathed out and the sound to lises ears was like the sound of the tide retreating from an ancient beach it wasnt any more complicated than the ordeal of becoming a fourth the customary injection and then when the process was underway an intrauterine injection to keep the altered infant from being rejected by my body i was tranquilized much of the time i honestly remember very little of the pregnancy itself he came to term in seven months and afterward mrs rebka looked away avram was adamant that he should be raised by the community not exclusively by me he said it would be better if i didnt bond too closely with the child better for you or better for isaac both we werent sure he would survive to maturity isaac wasisan experiment miss adams avram was protecting me from what could have been an even more traumatic episode of grief and beyond that as much as i wanted to be a parent to isaac the boy has a difficult personality he refused close contact with anyone as a baby he wouldnt consent to be held it really was as if he belonged to some new species as if on the most fundamental biological level he knew he wasnt one of us because you made him that way lise could not help saying true the responsibility is all ours and the guilt of course all i can say is that we hoped his contribution to our understanding of the universe would redeem the ugliness of his creation was that something you believed or something they told you to believe thank you for making excuses for me miss adams but yes i believed it all of us believed in it to one degree or another thats why we came together in the first place but none of us believed it as confidently and asim tempted to say as heroicallyas avram dvali we had doubts of course we did we had moments of remorse it isnt a pleasant story is it im sure youre asking yourself how we could have contemplated such a thing much less carried it out but people are capable of all kinds of acts miss adams even fourths you ought to remember that mrs rebka closed her eyes and now im tired and i dont have anything further to say the others came back with food bottled water spare parts and miraculously a second vehicleanother bigtired utility vehicle purchased turk said at ridiculous expense from a larcenous local dealer the fourths had more cash than good sense turk said or maybe the sense to know when cash was no good she helped turk load supplies into the vehicles he moved with easy muscularity loosehipped and unselfconscious there was a certain pleasure in doing the work with him not thinking about mrs rebka or isaac or dr dvali or what might be waiting out in the rub alkhali so are you riding with us he finally asked or are you waiting for a bus back to the port she didnt grace him with an answer he didnt deserve one because of course she was going with him into the big unknown or wherever it was good people went when they disappeared part four rub alkhali chapter twentythree brian gately was safely back in port magellan when the second ashfall struck sigmund and weil had done something remarkable as they flew with brian across the bodhi pass and down to the coastal plain they had admitted defeat the fourths were scattered weil said and the burned compound had yielded no evidence beyond the charred remains of a bioreactor hidden in a basement nothing incriminating had been discovered in turk findleys purloined aircraft and the four captives were obviously decoys elderly even by the standards of fourths so what then brian asked as their aircraft overflew a canyon along which far below a lone oil tanker was navigating the switchbacks you just go home of course we dont give up we do what weve been doing for years monitor communications run software on strategic surveillance sites sooner or later something turns up and in the meantime theres one less bioreactor to worry about if nothing else somebodys plans have been seriously fucked with for this brian asked people die who died brian i dont remember anyone dying so he came at last to his small apartment in the polyglot city and was alone there when for the second time the sky filled with the luminous debris of ancient incomprehensible machines he watched the local news broadcasts with a vague indifference the newscasters used words like strange and unprecedented but brian wasnt impressed it was only a kind of celestial rot the rubble of a vast disintegration the hypotheticals had built their intelligences in the cold places around and between countless stars and they built them to last no doubt but any made thing had a lifetime the pyramids of egypt eroded the roman aqueducts were stumps of broken stone so must the constructions of the hypotheticals break down once they had served their dozen or their million allotted years the ashes birthed monstrosities some of which he could see from his own window a dozen yards down the road where the arabic commercial district declined into a structureless maze of souks and tea shops a green tubule as big as a sewer pipe writhed as if in a strong wind and then tumbled over to barricade the street in his mind he played back lises final phone call where was she now not even sigmund and weil had been able to answer that question she had fled with the rogue fourths victim of her own wild sympathies free perhaps in some distasteful sense of the word unbroken not yet fallen to earth like an ancient machine the ashfall took longer to clean up than it had the first time and because it had happened twice the people on television were asking themselves somber questions was this the end of it or would it happen again would the effects follow some exponential curve each time more peculiar and disastrous until port magellan was entirely buried under a mass of what looked like enormous childrens toys part of brian wanted to deny the possibility while another part of him relished it this was after all an alien planet and how credulous we were he thought to imagine we could simply move in unmolested and conduct our lives as if it were a second earth but the civil authorities antlike methodically cleared the debris and reestablished their pheromonic lines of communication when he could no longer avoid it brian drove from his apartment along the smudged avenues to the american district to the consulate building to the offices of the department of genomic security port magellan branch he walked past his own office to the door of his immediate superior a consular legate named larry diesenhall diesenhall was a fiftyfiveyearold career man with a shaved head and eyes so delicately colored they appeared to have been drawn in crayon diesenhall looked up at brian and smiled good to see you back brian back at last the prodigal son brian took an envelope out of his jacket pocket and dropped it on diesenhalls immaculate desktop whats this have a look the envelope contained a pair of photographsthe photographs pieter kirchberg had sent him extra copies of which brian had run off on his printer this morning he averted his eyes while diesenhall opened the envelope jesus diesenhall said christ what am i looking at here the dead brian thought the dead who are customarily absent from church picnics and polite offices he sat down and explained about tomas ginn and about sigmund and weil and the burning compound in the desert and the four unlucky fourths who had been found in turk findleys aircraft and might or might not have been tortured in an attempt to extract their confessions on several occasions diesenhall tried to interrupt but brian talked over him compulsively a flood of words too powerful to be dammed by the time he finished diesenhall was staring at him gapjawed brian this is upsetting one way of describing it brian thought i mean wow do you realize how tenuous your position is here you come to me with these complaints about sigmund and weil but i dont have anything to do with them what the executive action committee does is outside the public mandate neither you nor i are members of that committee brian and that community isnt answerable to the likes of us you had a relationship with a woman who was apparently deeply involved with known fourths and for you and i hope you realize this the outcome could have been much worse questions were asked about you about your loyalty and i stood up for you i was happy to do that so now you come to me with these allegations and with this the photographs this obscenity what do you expect me to do i dont know get upset complain file a report really do you really want me to do any of that do you have any idea what that would mean for both of us and do you think it would make any kind of difference that any good would come of it that anything would change except for us brian thought about that he didnt have a counterargument probably diesenhall was right he took a second envelope from his jacket and dropped it on diesenhalls desktop diesenhall promptly recoiled his hands scuttling back to the edge of the desk christ whats this my resignation brian said chapter twentyfour the last human being they saw west of bustee was a stout woman who was locking up a sinopec gas station she had already shut down the pumps but she opened them long enough to refuel both vehicles while she lectured dr dvali in a cantonese accent about the foolishness of heading deeper into the desert nobody left out there she said even the riggers and pipeline workers even the hired men with no money but what they hoped to be paid they had all gone east after the first ashfall it was worse out there she said worse in what way just worse and the earthquakes earthquakes little earthquakes damaged things all that has to be fixed when its safe to come back if dr dvali frowned turk said were on our way to the west coast actually other side of the desert stupid way to get there the cantonese woman said to which turk could only nod and shrug extraterrestrial dust mixed with ordinary sand had duned against the sunwhite planking of the depot the wind came from the south hot and dry a talcumpowdered world lise thought she thought of what turk had said about the west coast the other side of the desert she imagined waves breaking on a beach a few adventurous fishing trawlers anchored in some natural harbor rainfall and greenness and the smell of water as opposed to this merciless sunstricken horizon stupid way to get there well yes no doubt during the long drive sulean moi watched the way avram dvali and anna rebka conducted themselves around the boy mrs rebka the boys mother almost despite herself was the most attentive dvali was less directly involvedisaac had begun to shrink from his touchbut his attention always circled back to the child dvali was an idolater sulean thought he worshipped a monstrosity he believed isaac held the key towhat not communication with the hypotheticals that neat and linear goal had been abandoned long ago a leap of cognition an intimacy with the immense forces that had shaped the mundane and celestial worlds dvali wanted isaac to be a god or at least godtouched and he wanted to touch the hem of his robes in turn and be enlightened and me sulean thought what do i want with isaac above all she had wanted to forestall his birth it was to prevent such tragedies that she had left the martian embassy in new york she had made herself a dark often unwelcome presence in the community of terrestrial fourths subsisting on their charity while scolding them for their hubris dont worship the hypotheticals they are not gods dont contrive to bridge the divide between the hypotheticals and the human that gap cannot be bridged we know we tried we failed and in the process we committed what can only be called a crime we shaped a human life for our own purposes and produced in the end only pain only death twice in her wanderings on earth she had forestalled such a project two rogue communities of fourths one in vermont and one in rural denmark had been on the verge of attempting to create a hybrid child in both cases sulean had alerted more conservative fourths and exerted the moral weight they accorded her as a martian fourth in both cases she had succeeded in preventing tragedies here she had failed she was a dozen years too late and yet she insisted on accompanying the child on what was no doubt his final journey when she could have walked away and continued her work elsewhere why she allowed herself to wonder whether she might be as susceptible as dr dvali to the seductive lure of contact even though she knew it was impossible and absurd more likely it was because the boy isaac had spoken a few words in a language he couldnt possibly have known that is to say because she was afraid of him you make much of that turk asked what the lady said about earthquakes he rode in the lead vehicle with dvali who had taken the wheel the wind still pushed snaketrails of dust across the road but most of the ash seemed to have been blown awayor had been absorbed into the earth the same way that flapping thing had been absorbed into isaacs skin another day of driving and they would reach the outskirts of the oil concessions the target they had triangulated was a couple hundred miles west of there i dont disbelieve her dr dvali said evenly was there anything in the news turk had been keeping dr dvalis radio plugged into one ear though reception was intermittent they were a long way from the aerostats nothing about earthquakes but i wouldnt rule it out he wouldnt rule out munchkins or dinosaurs at this point they say it could happen again the ashfall you think thats possible i dont know dr dvali said no one knows except maybe isaac turk thought they stopped for the night at a gasfoodlodging complex that had once catered to tanker drivers but was now deserted there was no mystery about why it had been abandoned alien growths were festooned across the buildings roof these were gaudy tubular things turned to lacework by their own decomposition but they must once have been heavy because pieces of the roof had collapsed under their weight and that wasnt all a filigree of blue tendrils had invaded the restaurant covering everything within a few yards of the door floor ceiling tables chairs a busboys cart in randomly interwoven ropes and strings these too were decaying touch them and they turned to rancid powder turk located room keys and opened doors until he found enough undamaged rooms to allow them all some welcome privacy turk and lise took one room dvali another sulean moi consented to share a suite with diane mrs rebka and the boy isaac sulean wasnt unhappy with the room arrangements she couldnt bring herself to like mrs rebka but she hoped to be allowed a few moments alone with the boy the opportunity came that evening dvali summoned everyone for what he called a community meeting isaac of course couldnt participate and sulean volunteered to stay with himshe had nothing to contribute to the talking she said mrs rebka agreed reluctantly as soon as she had left the room sulean went to the boys bedside he wasnt feverish he was even alert at times and he could sit up walk take food he had been blessedly quiet in the car as if some of the dreadful inhuman neediness had passed from him since the flying thing attacked him dvali was loathe to discuss that event since he didnt understand it but it was the boys first deeply personal contact with the semiliving creations of the hypotheticals sulean wondered what it had felt like was the thing still in his body even now had it disassembled itself into molecular fragments in order to circulate through his blood and if so why was there even a reason or was it just another mindless tropism evolved over uncountable millions of years she wished she could ask isaac but there was only time for the most pressing questions she forced herself to smile at the boy isaac smiled back as readily as he ever had im his friend she thought his martian friend i knew someone like you she said a long time ago i remember isaac said sulean felt a fluttering in her chest do you know who im talking about one word esh you know about esh isaac nodded solemnly his goldflecked eyes gone distant what do you know about him isaac began to tell the story of eshs brief childhood at bar kea station and sulean was astonished to hear the boy speaking eshs martian dialect again she felt dizzy esh she whispered isaac said in english he cant hear you but you can hear him he cant talk sulean hes dead you know that of course she knew that she had held his dying body in her arms sick with the knowledge that she had helped him escape to the desert to the thing he had so desperately wanted the same thing isaac wanted which was the hypotheticals which was death she said but you can speak in his voice because i remember him you remember him that is hei dont know how to explain the boy was becoming anxious sulean suppressed her own terror and forced what she hoped was a reassuring smile you dont have to explain its a mystery i dont understand it either just tell me how it feels i know what i am i know what they made me to be dr dvali mrs rebka they want me to talk to the hypotheticals but i cant do that im sorry but i cant but theres something in me he pointed to his ribs and out there the desert something that remembers a million things and esh is only one of them but because hes like me it remembers him to mei mean sulean stroked the boys head his hair was lank and gritty all this traveling and no water for baths poor child please dont be upset the thing in me remembers esh and i remember what esh remembered i look at you and i see both both the way you are now and the way you were then quite a contrast sulean imagined and esh can see me too no i told you hes dead he cant see anything hes not here but i know what he would say if he was here and what would he say isaac he would say and isaac slipped into the martian language again his inflections shockingly familiar even after all these long and arduous years he would say hello big sister eshs voice undeniably and he would say what tell me he would say dont be afraid oh but that i cannot do sulean thought and she retreated from the bed almost to the door where although she had not heard him arrive dr dvali was standing and listening his face red with an emotion that was as much jealousy as anger how long have you known this about him dvali had insisted on walking a short distance from the truck stop away from the others into the intimidating landscape that had surrounded them for days as if the deserts of mars had been recreated on this hotter alien world a huge sky domed the evening emptiness and of the works of man there was only the most tawdry esh esh she thought such a distance to come to hear his voice again a few weeks she managed to say weeks and were you planning to share this information with us there was never any information only a possibility the significant possibility that isaac is somehow sharing memories with your martian experiment this esh esh wasnt an experiment he was a child dr dvali and he was my friend youre evading the issue im evading nothing im not an accessory to your work had it been possible i would have prevented you from beginning it but you didnt and youre here now i think you should examine your own motives ms moi i think youre here for the same reason we created isaac because youve spent a lifetime trying to understand the hypotheticals and afterwhat eighty years ninetyyoure no farther ahead than you were when you were young certainly the hypotheticals had never been far from her thoughts not since they devoured esh an obsession yes maybe but it had never influenced her judgmenthad it as to whether she understood the hypotheticals they dont exist she said excuse me the hypotheticals they dont exist not the way you imagine them what do you picture when you think about them some great wise ancient presence beings of infinite wisdom inscrutable to our petty minds that was the mistake the martian fourths made what risk would not be justified by the possibility of conversing with god but they dont exist there is nothing in all the starry sky but some vast operative logic connecting one thoughtless machine to the next its ancient its complex but it isnt a mind if thats so dvali said then who were you just talking to sulean opened her mouth and then closed it that night for the first time in many days lise and turk made love the privacy of a separate room was an instant aphrodisiac they didnt discuss it didnt need to discuss it in the candlelit darkness lise had undressed and watched turk undress and then she had blown out the candle and found him by the faint light of the dustdimmed moon he smelled rank and so did she it didnt matter here was the communication at which they always excelled briefly she wondered whether elsewhere in this ruin the fourths could hear the creak of the bedsprings probably she thought probably good for them if they did hear it it might enliven their old juiceless lives turk eventually fell asleep with his arm across her ribs and she was content to lie with him in the fading glow at last though she had to shift herself out of the embrace despite everything she couldnt sleep she thought about how far they had come and she remembered a line she had read in some old book the thin end of nowhere whittled down to a fine point the night was cold she curled against turk again seeking his warmth she was still awake when the building began to tremble diane dupree was awake in the room she shared with sulean moi mrs rebka isaac she focused her attention on the sound of isaacs breathing thinking how strange life must have been for isaac raised motherlessmrs rebka had been something less than a motherand fatherlessunless you counted dr dvalis sinister hoveringsbut indifferent by all accounts to affection a difficult refractory child she had overheard a little of sulean mois argument with dr dvali earlier today it had raised uneasy questions in her mind the martian woman was right of course dr dvali and mrs rebka werent scientists studying the hypothetical by unconventional means they were on a pilgrimage and at the end of it they expected something holy something redemptive the same longingyears and years ago nowhad carried her almost to her death diane had wrapped herself in her first husbands faith and he had taken her to a religious retreat where she contracted an illness that nearly killed her the cure had been her conversion to what the martian wun ngo wen had called the fourth state the adulthood beyond adulthood she thought she had left that longing behind her when she became a fourth it was as if after the longevity treatment something cool and methodically rational had risen up and taken control of her life something soothing if a little deadening no more reckless storming of heaven she had lived a steady useful life could she have been wrong though about how much she had left behind and how much she still carried with her unsuspected when the lines had intersected on the map the triangulation of isaacs urges diane had felt a familiar longing for the first time in oh many years she felt it again when she found out that isaac could gain access to the memories of a longdead martian child he had never known the hypotheticals had remembered esh diane thought what else might the hypotheticals have remembered her brother jason had died in a state of attempted communion with the hypotheticals did they remember that did they in fact remember jason and if she asked would isaac speak with jasons voice she sat upright almost guiltily when the building began to tremble and shake fortifications breached she thought dazedly the walls of heaven tumbling down by the time turk managed to light a candle the shaking had stopped the old chinese lady was right he thought earthquakes he turned back to lise who sat up in bed with the blanket pooled around her waist he said you okay its just a tremor promise we wont stop she said turk blinked her skin by candlelight was pale unearthly stop when they get where theyre going and he understood by a toss of her head that she meant the fourths we dont stop right we keep on heading for the west coast like you said of course what are you worried about this was just a tremor lise you lived in california you must have felt little quakes like that because theyre crazy turk they sound rational but they have this big carnival of craziness planned i dont want any part of it turk went to the window just to make sure the stars hadnt exploded or anything because she was right lunacy was on the march but there was only the central equatorian desert stretched out under its meager moon that was a sight to make you feel small he thought that desert and another little tremor rattled the useless lamp on the side table isaac felt the tremor but it didnt quite wake him he had been sleeping a lot lately he had lost some of his ability to distinguish between sleeping and waking the clock of the stars turned relentlessly inside him in the darkness he dreamed things for which he had no words there were many things for which he had no words and there were words he knew but didnt understand and couldnt define for instance love i love you mrs rebka had whispered to him when no one but isaac could hear he hadnt known what to say in return but that was all right she didnt seem to need an answer i love you isaac my only son she had whispered and then turned her face away what did that mean what did it mean when he closed his eyes and saw the cycling stars or the banked fires of an invisible thing deep in the western desert what did it mean that he felt its liveliness and power what did it mean that he could hear a million voices more voices than there were stars in the sky what did it mean that out of that multitude he could call up the voice of esh a dead martian boy was he remembering esh or was something remembering esh through him remembering eshs voice with the air in isaacs lungs becauseand here was something isaac did knowthe act to which he had been summoned to which all the tumbling fragments of hypothetical machinery had been summoned from their lazy courses in the sky was a remembering a remembering larger than the world itself he felt it coming the crust of the planet trembled its shivering rose up through the foundation of this old building through the floor the joists the beams through the bed frame and the mattress until isaac trembled along with it the motion filling him with a heatless joy memory and annihilation advancing with giant steps with strides as long as continents until at last he asked himself is this love part five in the company of the unspeakable chapter twentyfive they had reached the outskirts of the oil concessionsthe desolate thin end of nowherewhen the third and most intense ashfall began there had been some warning conveyed by dr dvalis intermittentlyfunctional telecom receiver the precipitation had been relatively light in port magellan but dense waves of it were falling in the west as if focused there by the time dr dvali announced this news the threat was ominously visible lise looking through the back window of the vehicle as it sped down the highway between two equally flat horizons saw clouds the color of boiling slate materialize from a chalkblue sky well need to get under cover again she heard turk say to the southwest turk could just make out the silverblack silhouettes of the aramco drilling and pumping complex evacuated presumablya couple of the far towers seemed to be leaning off vertical though that could be an illusionbut turk guessed the site would still be guarded both by machines and by armed men fortunately they didnt need to head in that direction the oil concessions had grown a ring of commerce around them businesses run by lonely men for lonely men strip clubs and bars and porn vendors which meant that not far down the road they would find more respectable commercial concessions and housing for the hired workers which appeared as the two cars raced the black cloud flowing from the east a gated side road the gate unchained a mall grocery store media retailers a multimart and a number of sturdy concrete buildings in which one or tworoom utility apartments were stacked like boxes turk in the lead car with lise and dr dvali looked back and saw the second vehicle pulling into the mall lot dvali swung around and intercepted them in front of the grocer store supplies diane explained we dont have time dvali said sternly we need to get under cover such as the building up ahead i would suggest you break in or whatever you need to do and well follow as soon as we find food dvali clearly didnt like this idea but just as clearly turk thought it made sense they had been running low on essentials and the ash storm might maroon them for a good long time be quick about it dvali said unhappily whoever designed this workers barracks had made no attempt to disguise the institutional nature of the project on the outside the building was weathered concrete and cracked pavement and an empty parking lot adjoining a tennis court enclosed in a chainlink fence its net slumped in disarray the door turk approached was hollow steel painted industrial yellow no doubt battered by the boots of hundreds of shitdrunk oilriggers over the years and it was locked but the lock was fragile and gave way after some leverage with a tireiron dvali fidgeted while turk performed this task glancing back at the approaching storm the light was thinning already the disc of the sun growing weak and obscure the door sprang loose and turk stepped into the interior darkness followed by dr dvali and finally lise uck lise said god it stinks the evacuation must have been hurried in many of the apartments that opened onto this hallwaymore like cells with their small high windows and cubicle bathroomsfood had been left to rot toilets had been abandoned unflushed they set about finding the most presentable firstfloor residences and settled on three spaces two adjoining and one crosshall from which the previous residents had removed the most obvious perishables lise reached up to swing open a window but dvali said no not with the dust coming well have to live with the stench there was no electricity and the light was fading fast turk and dvali unloaded their gear from the car by which time the afternoon had turned into a smudgy twilight and the ash had begun to fall like snow dvali said where are the others i could go hurry them up turk offered no they know where to find us diane and sulean moi left mrs rebka in the car with isaac while they scrounged for groceries the store had been nearly stripped but in a stockroom in the back they discovered a few boxes of canned soups not especially appetizing but possibly vital if the storm locked them indoors for any length of time they ferried a few of these cartons out to the vehicle as the sky darkened one more box diane said at last assessing the oncoming ash cloud and then we should get under cover a skylight above the aisles of the grocery store cast pale illumination on the empty shelves some of which had been tumbled down by a previous tremor diane and sulean each picked up a final carton and headed for the door feet crunching on glass and litter as soon they reached the sidewalk they heard isaacs screams diane dropped her carton instantly spilling cans of creamed thisandthat down the sidewalk and yanked open the passengerside door and then craned her head back help me the boys screaming was interrupted only by gasps for breath and diane couldnt help thinking that it must hurt simply to make such a noise that a childs lungs shouldnt be capable of this awful sound he thrashed and kicked and she grabbed his wrists and pinned them which required more strength than she would have imagined mrs rebka was up front fumbling the keycard into its slot he just started screamingi cant calm him down the important thing now was to get under shelter start the car diane said i tried it wont now the storm was on top of them not just a few ominous dustflakes anymore but a roiling front that came out of the desert with shocking speed and solidity it broke before diane could say another word and as quick as that they were engulfed in it choking in it literally choking she gagged and even isaac fell silent as soon as he drew a deep breath full of the dust all light faded and the air became impenetrably dark and dense diane spat out a gagging mouthful of foulness and managed to shout we have to take him inside had mrs rebka heard had sulean evidently she had sulean little more than a dimlyperceptible shape helped diane lift the boy and take him from the car into the grocery store while mrs rebka followed her hand on dianes back being inside the store wasnt much improvement the broken skylight admitted huge gusts of ash they managed to get isaac upright between them and he even supported his own weight as they groped for the stockroom and found it and closed themselves inside in absolute darkness now waiting for the dust to settle enough to allow a decent breath registering how much worse this was than they had anticipated diane thinking after all these years is this where ive come to die chapter twentysix it was obvious as soon as the storm broke that isaac and the fourth women had been stranded elsewhere because storm was not just an abstraction this time this wasnt a loose fall of dust lise thought like some earlyautumn snow shower in vermont nor was it a puzzling astrophysical phenomenon that could be swept away by morning light if this had happened in port magellan the city would have been shut down for months it was a deluge an inundation no less so because it was taking place in the evacuated far west where there were few eyes to see and no one to send help the darkness was the worst of it because the expedition was divided they had only the two flashlights from the vehicle dvali had been driving the flashlights were fullycharged and guaranteed the label said for a hundred hours but even their cumulative power made for a dismally small zone of light in a large and stifling darkness turk and dr dvali insisted on combing through all three stories of the residence to make sure the accessible windows were sealed against the dust it was a scary arduous task an ongoing reminder of how alone they were in this hollow windscreaming building and even after that the ash managed to get inside invading the inevitable chinks and gaps spilling out of the stairwells particles of it hovered in the flashlight beams and the stink infused the air their clothes their bodies finally they settled down in a room on the third floor with a window from which they could assess the situation outside if morning ever came lise thought if the suns light reached them ever again and turk opened a can of corned beef with his pocketknife and served it out on some plastic dishes he found in one of the kitchen cupboards oil riggers lived like university freshmen lise had concluded angry depressive university freshmen exhibits a b c the empty bottles randomly scattered the heaps of clothes abandoned in corners the stripped mattresses and tattered paper shrines to the worlds biggest breasts dvali was talking about isaac he had been talking about isaac for hours it seemed to lise fretting over his absence and what this fresh starfall might mean to his status as a communicant it all began to sound more than slightly mad until she was moved to ask if you care so much about him couldnt you have given him a last name dvali looked sideways at her we raised him communally mrs rebka named him isaac and that seemed sufficient you could have called him isaac hypothetical turk said given his paternity i dont find that funny dvali said but at least he shut up the ash was falling thicker than ever she could see it outside the window when she pointed a flashlight that way but only as an undifferentiated wash of glittery gray more than in port magellan she thought more than in bustee she didnt care to consider what might be growing in it it took a long while for the air in the poorlysealed grocery store stockroom to settle and it never settled completely but eventually diane noticed that her lungs were less painful her throat less raw her vertigo slowly becoming bearable how much time had passed since the storm began two hours a dozen she couldnt be sure there was no sunlight anymore in fact no light whatsoever there hadnt been time to rescue flashlights from the vehicle or anything else for that matter there had only been time to search the narrow stockroom by touch and from memory for something to rinse the ash out of their mouths a cache of carbonated soft drinks in plastic bottles warm the liquid foamed on the tongue and mixed with the inhaled particles until it tasted like charred flannel but drink enough of it and you could speak at least the three women were gathered around isaac who lay on the concrete floor breathing noisily isaac had become their touchstone diane thought he had sipped several times from one of the bottles but he was feverisha new frightening heat baked off his skinand since the ashfall began he hadnt spoken or been able to speak were like the witches in macbeth diane thought and isaac is our cauldron boiling isaac anna rebka said isaac can you hear me isaacs response was a stirring in his limbs a faint murmur that might have been assent diane knew they might die here all of them the thought wasnt extraordinarily troubling to her though she dreaded the pain and discomfort one of the benefits of fourthness and they were all fourths in this room even in his way isaac was this muting of the anxiety about ones death she had lived after all a very long time she carried memories of the spinless world the vanished earth as she had seen it as a child and on its last night a house a lawn the sky back when she had believed in god a god who made sense of the world by loving it the god she missed perhaps even the god dr dvali had been unconsciously invoking when he created isaac oh she had seen it all before the fractured longing for redemption she had lived with it lived it it had driven her brother jason just as it had driven diane jasons obsession had not been very different from dvalisthe difference being that jason in the end had offered himself on the altar not a child isaacs breathing began to deepen and his body cooled slightly diane wondered about his reaction to the ashfall the link of course was through the hypothetical machines the halfliving things that generated and inhabited and arose from the fallen dust but what did that mean what was the point of it what was it meant to accomplish she must have spoken that last aloudher mind was still a little muddledbecause sulean moi said nothing its meant to accomplish nothing her voice was a raw croak thats the truth dr dvali wants to deny the hypotheticals are comprised of a network of selfreproducing machines that much we all more or less agree upon but they arent a mind diane they cant talk to isaac not the way im talking to you thats smug mrs rebka said from her corner of the darkness and not true you talked to the dead boy esh through isaac wouldnt you call that communication the martian woman was silent how strange it was to be having this conversation in the absolute darkness diane thought and how fourth of us how would she have reacted to this predicament before her own treatment probably the fear would have overwhelmed her fear and claustrophobia and the steady awful sifting sound of ash but it was so much more than ash settling on the roof and stressing the buildings beams and timbers he told me he remembers esh sulean said memory is also an attribute of machines a modern telephone has a larger memory than some mammals i suspect the first hypothetical machines were sent out into the universe for the purpose of gathering data and i suspect they still do that in infinitely subtler ways somehow eshs memory became available to the machines that killed him he became a datum which isaac is able to access then i suppose isaac will become a datum too mrs rebka said suddenly meek and here diane thought was the heart of her revealed mrs rebka knew that isaac would die that there was no other possible outcome of his transaction with the hypotheticals and some part of her had accepted that dreadful truth as he probably remembers jason lawton sulean moi said isnt that the question on your mind diane hateful in her perceptiveness this martian hag doomed to exile from her planet her people even her fourthness she was steeped in bitterness worse she was right it was the question diane had dared not ask maybe id rather not know and dr dvali wouldnt stand for it he would prefer to keep isaacs epiphanies to himself but dr dvali isnt here that doesnt matter diane said faintly panicky isaac sulean moi said stop mrs rebka said isaac can you hear me mrs rebka said stop again but isaacs voice came faintly a whisper yes isaac sulean moi said do you remember jason lawton please no diane thought but the boy said yes and what would he say if he were here isaac cleared his throat a moist froggy sound he would say hello diane he would say no more diane begged please he would say be careful diane because its about to happen the last thing what last thing but there wasnt even time to pose the question before the last thing came up from the limestone and bedrock far underground it shook the building it rocked the floor it quenched all thought and it didnt stop chapter twentyseven only isaac saw it happening because only isaac had eyes that could see it he could see many things few of which he had described even to mrs rebka or sulean moi his most trusted friends for instance he could see himself he saw himself more clearly than ever before in the absolute darkness of the buried stockroom not his body exactly but when he looked down he could see the silver skein of the hypothetical presence inside him it shared his nervous system made glowing traceries of everfiner filaments joined in bundles to the shimmering rod of his spine had the others been able to see him this way they probably would have been horrified some fraction of isaac the merely human part was also horrified but that voice was a diminishing presence and a dissenting voice thought he was beautiful he looked like electricity he looked like fireworks the womenmrs rebka sulean moi dianewere also visible to him but they shone with a much fainter light isaac guessed the fourth treatment had done that to them that it had infected them with a little bit but only a little bit of hypothetical life it was as if they were timid lamps in a fog while isaac isaac was a searchlight glaring and he could see other things too beyond the walls he saw the ashfall to isaacs eyes it was a storm of stars each grain distinctly bright and merging into a general brightness an atmosphere of luminosity bright yes but also somehow transparent he could see through itespecially to the west the infinitely tiny hypothetical machines werent falling at random taken together their trajectories were focused on the place where something old was rising from the bedrock of the desert it had stirred in its sleep like a lazy behemoth and the ground had trembled canting the oil derricks and shattering pumps and pipelines it had stirred and stirred again as more ash fell triggered by unknowable cues into new activity and it stirred again now ferociously the earth didnt just shake this time it roared and although the merely human part of isaac was blind in the darkness he heard quite clearly the groan of deep rock stressed to the fracturing point the slap and crack of collapsing walls he felt a rush of foul air and his breath became labored and painful again but none of that mattered to the part of him that could see this is a machine he thought watching the great device heave itself out of the night desert a hundred and more miles to the west machine yes but it was alive it was both the words did not exclude one another the voice in him that had been jason lawtons voice said a living cell is a machine made of protein what falls from the sky and what rises from the earth is just life by other means the giant structure shouldering itself out of the ground in the west resembled the arch or at least the pictures isaac had seen of the arch it was a huge halfring made of the same stuff as the dust that was falling from beyond the sky condensed and differently arranged its molecules and its unusual atoms subverting natural laws for which isaac had no name but to which jason lawtons memory attached words like strong force and weak force it was lovely in its intrinsic glow a rainbow shining in colors without names it was an arch for things to pass through but it didnt lead to another planet things were passing through it now from the utter blackness inside it where even isaac couldnt see luminous clouds ascended to the stars the thought of jason lingered in dianes mind even after she was hurt the earthquake happened in a series of jolting shocks almost unbearable in the darkness that much she understood and she had been able to suppress her fear at least for the first few moments then the building began to collapse or so she intuited from the fact that she felt a sharp blow to her right shoulder and neck followed by dazed unconsciousness followed by an awakening to pain nausea and a terrifying inability to draw breath she gasped a little air entered her lungs but not enough not nearly enough lie still the voice was a gutteral croak mrs rebka no she thought it must be sulean moi diane tried to answer but couldnt her lungs wouldnt do anything but spasm in feeble attempts to draw air she tried to sit up or at least turn to one side in order to avoid vomiting on herself that was when she discovered that the left side of her body was numb dead useless part of the ceiling came down on you sulean moi said diane gagged and retched but nothing came up for which she was thankful and the tremors in the earth had stopped that was good she tried to evaluate her own injuries but couldnt think clearly enough to do so not when her body was pulling so hard for air she hurt and she was frightened she had no particular fear of death but this oh this was less bearable than death itself this was why people elected to die to make an end to this kind of suffering she thought of jason againwhy had she been thinking of jasonand then of tyler her lost husband then even these thoughts became too weighty to sustain and she passed out again isaac could see that diane had been badly hurt even in the dark it was possible to see that her dim glow had been nearly extinguished compared to sulean moi diane was a guttering candle it was hard to pay attention he was mesmerized by the invisible landscape all around him mesmerized because he was a part of it he was becoming it but that could wait now that the new arch had assembled itself in the westfrom hypothetical molecules granite magma memorythere was a kind of pause all around him for many miles the fresh blanket of dust began to undergo a new stage of metabolism that would take time isaac could afford to be patient he surprised sulean moi and mrs rebka by crawling over fallen beams fragments of drywall scattered foam insulation and collapsed aluminum venting to the place where diane dupree lay trapped beneath a heavy joist his lungs labored and his mouth was foul with dust but he could breathe at least which diane apparently could not not easily and he could tell when he reached out to touch her that the falling debris had hurt her head he meant to stroke her hair the way mrs rebka stroked his hair when he was ill but the place above dianes left ear yielded to his touch and his hand came away sticky tyler dupree had died one day in august the long equatorian august two years ago the long equatorian years diane had hiked with him up one of the steep rolling ridges of the coast for no other reason than to sit at its summit and watch the forest drop like a deep green broadcloth to the sea neither of them was young both had lived out most of their extended lives as fourths lately tyler complained from time to time of fatigue but he had gone on seeing patients mainly the young men who worked as breakers their injuries could be horrendous and the minang villagers among whom she and tyler had settled today he had said he felt fine and he had insisted on the long hikehe called it the closest thing to a vacation im likely to get so diane had gone with him relishing the dimness beneath the trees and the brightness of the high meadows but also vigilant watching him the fourth metabolism was powerful but finely balanced it could be pushed hard but like any other physical thing it had a breaking point age couldnt be indefinitely deferred because the treatment itself aged when fourths failed they tended to fail all at once which was how tyler had failed she thought he might have known it was happening that was why he had insisted on this hike they came to a place he loved but seldom had time to visit a broad swath of granite and mountain grass they put out a blanket and diane opened her backpack and withdrew the treasures she had stored for this occasion australian wine bread from the bakeries of port magellan cold roast beef things foreign to the minang diet to which they had become accustomed but tyler wasnt hungry he lay down on his back and pillowed his head against a bump of moss he was thin these days his skin was pale despite exposure to the sun and he looked diane thought almost elfin i think ill sleep he said and it was at that moment in the august sunlight and surrounded by the smell of rock and water and black earth that she had known he was dying some atavistic part of her wanted to rescue him to carry him down the mountain the way he had once carried her across much of the continental united states when she was mortally ill but there was no cure the fourth treatment could be taken only once time later for grief she knelt beside him and stroked his head she said can i get you anything and he said im happy right here so she lay down beside him and held him in her arms as the afternoon waned much later much too soon the sun went down and it was time to go home but only diane stood up im happy right here but was this jason with her in the darkness her brother jason who had died so many years ago no it was the strange boy isaac but he sounded so much like jason i can remember you diane if thats what you want i can do it she understood what he was offering the hypotheticals remembered jason and so did she but the long slow memory of the hypotheticals was less perishable it persisted over billions of years did she want to join him in that immensity she tried to turn her head but could not she drew a breath just enough to force out a single word no she said chapter twentyeight turk was asleep when the earthquake struck he and lise and dr dvali had spread mattresses on the concrete floor and slept or tried to sleep and at some point in the darkness lise had scooted up next to him both of them still wearing the reeking clothes they had worn for days not that it mattered she curled against the small of his back and cupped her knees to his knees her breath warming his neck and raising the small hairs there then the floor heaved like a live thing and the air filled with a clamorous roar the only distinguishable element of which was lises scream audible because it was next to his ear he managed somehow to roll over and hold herthey held each otherwhile the noise reached an unthinkable crescendo and the rooms carefullysealed window kicked out of its flanges and shattered on the floor nothing to do but hold on as the floor itself slanted away from horizontal bucking like a car that had slipped its gears they held each other until it stopped how long a time that was turk couldnt say a mediumsized eternity it left his ears ringing his body bruised he drew enough good air to ask lise whether she was okay and she drew enough good air to say i guess so turk called out to dr dvali who answered belatedly my legs hurt other than that im all right the noise and vertigo went on well after the shaking ceased but turk began to recover some composure he thought about aftershocks maybe we should try to get outside he said but dvali said no not in the ash storm turk separated himself from lise and began to grope through the litter on the floor finally locating the flashlight he had left beside the mattress it had rolled all the way to the windowside wall switched on it lit up a column of dust motes and debris the room was intact but barely lise huddled on the mattress ghostwhite and dvali just as pale sat propped in a corner his left leg was bleeding where something sharp had fallen on it but the wound didnt seem serious so what do we do lise asked dvali said wait until dawn and hope it doesnt happen again if dawn ever came turk thought if anything like sunlight ever again reached this godforsaken badland lise said i hate to be practical here but i have to pee really badly turk swung the flashlight beam toward the adjoining bathroom looks like the thrones intact but i wouldnt try to flush and the doors off entirely so look the other way lise said gathering her blankets around her and turk thought how much easier all this would be if he didnt love her so much theres light coming in the window she said an hour or so later and turk made his way over there treading cautiously on the broken glass the ash had stopped falling that much was obvious had the dustfall been as thick as it was yesterday they would have choked on it but only a few stray flakes had drifted in and turk thought the air smelled fresher and less sulfurous unless he was just getting used to it the light to which lise had drawn his attention was real enoughit became obvious when he switched off the flashlight but it was too early for dawn and this light wasnt coming from the sky it was coming from down below from the streets of this little corporate outpost from the roofs of damaged buildings the desert anywhere the ash had fallen he called lise and dvali over to look a few nights when he was at sea turk had seen his vessels wake glowing where bioluminescent algae had been stirred up by the passage of the ship always an eerie thing to see and this reminded him of it but what was happening here was stranger still the desert or the interplanetary dust that had fallen on it was aglow with a phosphorescence of many colors gemstone reds glassy yellows glistening blues and the colors werent stationary but constantly shifting like a polar aurora what do you think it is lise asked dr dvalis face was bathed in the reflected colors he said a little breathlessly i think were as close as anyone has come to seeing the face of the hypothetical turk said so what are they doing out there but even dr dvali couldnt answer that question come dawn it was apparent that they had been lucky most of the north wing of the building had collapsed corridors ended in masses of rubble or open air if wed turned left instead of right turk thought wed be buried in there as soon as there was enough light to navigate they made their way downstairs the structure wouldnt survive another shakingand we need to find isaac dvali said but turk was a little uncertain about how to proceed because another thing was obvious by daylight the situation on the ground had changed where there had been desert there was a forest or something like a forest dvali was limping conspicuously by the time they descended the stairwell to the door at the intact end of the building though he refused to stop and rest it was essential he said that they find isaac and the others the others being a sort of footnote in dvalis mind lise suspected for dvali there was only isaac isaac and the apotheosis of the hypotheticals whatever that might turn out to mean go on open it dvali said waving at the door lise and turk had agreed that the most useful thing they could do was to try to reach the local mall where they had left isaac and the fourth women how to get there was an open question when lise had looked out into the light of dawn she had seen a landscape utterly transformedhad seen what she might have called a canopy of trees if trees were made of glossy tubes and iridescent beach balls and she asked the same stupid irrepressible question why whats it for why now why here we may yet find out dr dvali said if the past was any guide turk thought the hypothetical growths would ignore human beings with the obvious exception of isaac who was only partly humanbut was that still true he cracked the door a narrow inch and when nothing came rushing in he risked a look outside cool air touched his face the sulfuric stench of the ashfall was gone so was the ash itself it had all turned into a technicolor forest compared to this the growths in bustee had been daffodils withering in a cold breeze this was high summer this was some kind of hypothetical eden he drew the door fully open and waited lise and dr dvali crowded him from behind the ash had turned itself into a forest of stalks bearing globular fruit instead of leaves the stalks of several colors but predominantly a cyanotic blue lofted up twenty or thirty feet into the air and were so closely spaced that a person would have to turn sideways to pass between them the globes that comprised the canopy ranged in size from goldfish bowl to beach ball to something a man might climb inside and stand upright in without bumping his head they pressed up against each other gently yielding where they touched to make a nearly solid but translucent mass the sunlight that came through was dim and shiftingly iridescent turk took a tentative step from here he could see along the wall of the workers barracks to the point at which it had collapsed the three floors of the north wing pancaked into something less than one god help us if wed been in there he thought and god help isaac and the women wherever they might have found shelter the trunks as he began to think of them of the strange trees though you could call them lampposts just as accurately were rooted in the groundwhere there had been pavement they had cracked and penetrated itand turk couldnt see far enough in any direction to really get his bearings everything faded forty or fifty yards out to a shimmering blue vagueness to find the mall where the women and isaac had last been seen they would have to navigate by compass and the clues directly under their feet what do they live on lise asked in a hushed voice theres no water here maybe more water than theyre used to getting out where they usually grow turk said dvali said or theyre using some catalytic process that doesnt need water a completely different kind of metabolism they must have evolved for billion of years in an environment far harsher than this a billion years of evolution if that was true turk thought then these things as a species if that word applied were older than the human race itself they moved in silence through the hypothetical forest though it was not entirely a silent place no wind reached them at street level but there must have been a wind blowing turk guessed because the iridescent globes that crowned the tubular trunks occasionally bumped against each other and made a gentle sound that suggested a rubber mallet on a wooden xylophone and there was motion at ground level too small blue tubes like roots periodically snaked between the trees running with a whipcrack motion that might be quick and powerful enough to break a leg if you ran across one at the wrong time twice turk saw paperlike objects fluttering overhead occasionally touching or merging with the globesvarieties of the thing that had attacked isaac back in bustee mistaking him for one of their own turk thought or maybe it wasnt a mistake lise walked close behind him he could hear her indrawn breath every time something rattled or fluttered in the dim and shifting light he felt bad about that about the fear she was enduring and whatever else she might have to endure before they were finished here he turned and said im sorry i got you into this she wouldnt let him finish do you really think youre somehow responsible for what happened for taking you on this halfassed trip west maybe i made that choice which was true but still turk thought shes here because of me the chorus of his biography appeared to him as if conjured by the untrustworthy light lost or purloined lovers friends become enemies friends damaged or killed in bar fights or shipboard accidents see my bridges burning he thought see my trail of tears he didnt want that for lise he didnt want to drag her beyond the boundaries of the kind of life she might still make for herself a life in which kindness was not fleeting and there was the possibility of something more meaningful than nights sealed in the cockpit of an aircraft months bunking below the deck of some stinking freighter years locked in the castle of his own head while she waited for what he could not provide and grew disappointed and finally bitter he would find her a way out of this jungle he thought and then if he could summon the requisite courage or cruelty he would find a way to leave her it is a communication avram dvali thought he thought there is no denying it the hypotheticals were all around him a small but significant fraction of the network that comprised their incomprehensibly vast intelligence all process the dogmatic martian woman had said during one of their arguments of no more significance than the flowering of club moss or periwinkles put it together any way you liked it was only evolution mindless as the sea but she was wrong he felt it he did not could not understand how these organisms grew or what nourishment they derived from the parched earth but communication passed between of that he was sure they had not grown randomly but at some precipitative signal he had been watching the canopy of the forest the clustered globes shifted color constantly and it seemed to him that each globes color was affected by the changes in its immediate neighbors perhaps according to some rule or set of rules so that patterns traveled through the forest like flocks of intangible birds this was communication in the sense that cells in the human brain communicated one with another and in concert produced the emergent phenomenon of mind he was walking through the physical architecture perhaps of some great thought a thought he could never comprehend though perhaps isaac could if isaac was alive and if he understood finally the nature of the gift avram dvali had given him chapter twentynine it was warm in the ruined stockroom and although most of the dust had settled out of the airseemed to have been absorbed somehow into the rubbleno fresh air flowed into the enclosed space sooner or later sulean moi thought and most likely sooner that would become a problem and there was the body of diane dupree to think about if she could tolerate such thoughts she crawled along the accessible perimeter of the room for the second time feeling with her hands for anything hopefula draft or some promisingly loose heap of rubble and for the second time found none she had begun to believe she might die in this awful place on this awful planet haunted by the ghost of esh haunted that is to say by the hypotheticals in whom she did not believe at least not in the sense avram dvali believed in them the hypotheticals were a network of selfreplicating spaceborne machines some longextinct civilization must once have seeded its local environment with these devices or perhaps it had happened more than once a multiple genesis over many millions of years either way once variable selfreplication was introduced into the medium of interplanetary and interstellar space the process of evolution was engageddifferent from organic evolution in every detail but not in principle like organic evolution the process had generated strange and gaudy complexities even such apparently engineered devices as the spin barrier that surrounded the earth or the arches that linked planets separated by vast distances were ultimately no more intrinsically intelligent than such biological constructions as a coral reef or a termite hill the periodicity of the ashfall and the truncated grotesqueries it generated were proof enough she thought what had been installed in eshand in isaacwas nothing more than a tragic susceptibility to alien tropisms esh could not be a communicant because there was no one with whom to communicate evolution did demonstrably produce minds and she supposed it was possible that the long interstellar evolution of the hypothetical machines had also produced mindslocally temporarily but such minds if they existed were the byproduct not the process they controlled nothing but themselves they couldnt be the hypotheticals as dr dvali imagined them to be she remained unnerved however by the obvious fact that isaac remembered esh who had died many years before isaac was born if esh had become a memory in the networked ecology of the hypotheticals could such a memory possess volition and who or what was the rememberer sulean this was mrs rebka who wouldnt leave isaacs side her voice came out of the darkness of their sealed tomb as if from an infinite distance yes what do you hear that sulean hushed her own thoughts and listened an intermittent scraping the tacktacktack of something solid tapping stone followed by more tentative scraping someones trying to dig us out mrs rebka said it must be avram and the others they must know were here tickscratchtick yes maybe sulean thought but then isaac said very suddenly and with startling clarity no mrs rebka it isnt the other people who want in it isnt people at all its them sulean turned toward the place from which isaacs voice had come she quelled her own fear and said isaac do you really know whats happening yes his tone was unexcited i can see them the hypotheticals a pause you could call them that then explain it to me please isaac youre part of it now arent you in a way esh never was tell me whats happening for a moment there was only the tickscratchtick at the walls of the fallen building in which they were trapped then isaac began to speak chapter thirty turk navigated by the fractured remnants of pavement and sidewalk through the alien forest that had lately been a settlement for oil riggers he managed to find the parking lot of the workers mallwhite lines cracked blacktopand from there it was a short hike to the complex where they had left diane dupree sulean moi mrs rebka and isaac except it wasnt there anymore he came upon rubble where the trees had grown more densely further obscuring the dim light of what was by now afternoon here was an embankment of broken tile wallboard wood sheet aluminum twisted into unlikely shapes beyond that in the dimness steel beams stood in skeletal rectangles some of these beams and pillars had been entwined by the rootlike extensions of the trees well angle toward the south end of the mall he said where the food store was or had been might be something still standing there the haunted forest lise thought boy was it ever she found herself silently reciting a line from a storybook her father had read to her when she was small book and story all forgotten except in her fathers melodramatic drawl into the dark forest they stepped into the dark forest they stepped into the dark forest of trees that harbored birds that resembled sheets of torn paper the forest from which another fragment of the same story they must escape but that was easier said than done because here there were wolves or worse and night was coming and she didnt know the way out she wanted to lunge up from under the covers and grab her fathers hand wanted it more than anything but couldnt she scolded herself in her mothers voice this time dont be stupid elise straighten up fly right girl she nearly flew right past a heap of plasterspecked metal until turk pointed it out it was the car mrs rebka had been driving when the two groups separated she recognized the steelmesh tires on prominent display because a rodlike tree trunk had sprung up from the cracked pavement and tumbled the vehicle on its side useless now the car but any car would be useless until this forest shrank back into the ground and that seemed unlikely to happen soon if we leave here lise thought well have to leave on foot and that was a daunting prospect the good news was that the car was empty isaac and the women werent inside hence might still be alive elsewhere so were near the food store turk said and dr dvali ran recklessly a few yards ahead where the remains of the storefront were vaguely visible behind a picket of alien growths the quake hadnt spared this part of the mall and if the others had taken shelter here they might be dead this was so obvious it didnt need saying dr dvali wanted to start digging immediatelyfutile as that might be the three of them versus a few tons of debrisbut turk said lets circle around back first the structure looks maybe a little more intact back that way dvali stood slumpshouldered at the brink of the rubble field a moment longer and for the first time lise felt a degree of sympathy for him all night all morning lise had been imagining the women and isaac huddled in some safe place the group would be reunited and then she and turk could set out for some safe harbor even if the mad fourths insisted on staying here in freakland that was her bestcase scenario now it looked like that might not happen the story might end tragically there might be no way to escape from the dark forest maybe she thought for isaac and the women the story was already over the rear of the mall seemed at first glance more intact than the front but that was only because the concrete loading bays had been left undamaged by the quake structurally everything was a mess lise felt heartsick and dr dvali seemed to be suppressing tears it was turk who continued to pick his way along the border of the rubble field with grim determination and it was turk who finally turned and held up his palm in a stophere gesture and said quietly listen lise stood still she heard the usual flutterings of the forest to which she had almost grown accustomed the wind was up and the luminous globes made their muted wooden music but beneath that faintly a sound like scratching a sound like digging dvali said theyre alive they must be lets not rush to judgment turk said follow me and try to keep quiet dvali was fourth enough to suppress his surge of renewed optimism the three of them walked within an arms length of one another turk up front following the sound the diggingscratching sound grew more clearly audible with each step and lises own optimism began to falter there was something not right about that sound the relentless gentle rhythm of it somehow too patient to be completely human then turk made his halt gesture again and beckoned them forward to look there was activity at one of the fractured loading bays but as lise had begun to suspect it was hypothetical activity a dense hedge of the growths dvali called ocular roses had grown here their petaled eyes all focused on the debris around them the trees had expressed a thick and writhing mat of motile roots some sharply pointed and some flattened into spatulate blades it was this mass of roots that was doing the digging surreal lise thought giddily especially since the debris included not just concrete and steel and plastic but crumpled cereal boxes milk jugs canned food she watched an inky blue tendril wrap itself around an industrialsized soup can puckering the red and white paper label lift it so the nearest eyeflower could examine it then relay it to another tentacle that passed it on seriatim until it was deposited on a rubbish tip of previously cleared debris the process was so perversely methodical that she found herself wanting to laugh instead she stared for what seemed like an immensely long time if the ocular roses were aware of their presence they displayed no reaction the patient digging went on and on scratching probing tapping sifting she stifled a scream when turk suddenly put his hand on her shoulder we ought to back off a ways he whispered which struck her as an excellent idea was the sun already setting lise had lost her watch somewhere along the trail or back in the riggers dorm she hated the idea of the coming night as soon as they felt free to speak but still whispering as if the ocular roses could overhear them and for all she knew they could turk said to dvali im sorry it wasnt the women we heard but dvali was still brighteyed with hope dont you see what this means they must be alive under thereisaac at least must be alive because it was isaac the hypotheticals wanted these growths might not be sentient singly or collectively but they knew something of their own had been separated from them by rock and ruin they wanted isaac but what would they do with him when they found him we can only watch dr dvali said camp here and watch until the boy comes out alive comes out to meet his fate lise thought chapter thirtyone in the darkness of the buried stockroom isaac struggled to cling to what was left of himself beyond the debris that enclosed him he could see the luminous forest a vast meadow of light and at the center of it the unbearably beautiful structure that had erupted from the fractured sandstone and bedrock of the desert a thing the memory of jason lawton wanted to call a temporal arch inert for ten thousand years in its hibernatory sleep caverned in rock it had called to him from the westernmost point of the compass and now it had broken its bonds and shaken free of the earth and grown immensely large and powerful and if he could only pass through these walls he would go to it isaac the martian womans voice came to him as if from far away he tried to ignore it he could see the temporal arch and he could see other things too he could see unfortunately the body of diane dupree she was dead but the notentirelyhuman part of her her fourthness was still faintly alive struggling to repair her corpse which of course it could not do her light guttered like a candle burned down to a puddle of wax and a final thread of wick the part of isaac that was jason lawton mourned for her these memories the memories that belonged to jason and esh had taken on an independent life in isaacs mind so much so that isaac was afraid he might lose himself in them i remember he would think but the memories were endless and only a fraction of them were his own even the word i had divided into double or triple meanings i lived on mars i lived on earth i live in equatoria all these statements were true and he didnt want to suppress the contending memories completely because they comforted him as much as they frightened him who would come with him into the vortex of the temporal arch if not jason and esh isaac do you really know whats happening yes he did in part at least then and he registered that it was the voice of sulean moi eshs friend isaacs friend explain it to me please these words had to come from jason lawton he turned to sulean moved toward her reached out from the darkness and took her hand as esh or isaac might have done and spoke with jasons voice its an embedded loop in the cycles and seasons of the the hypothetical seasons he felt the appropriateness of the word seasons within epochal seasons the ebb and flood of the galaxys ocean of life in a in what you might call a mature solar system the elements of the hypotheticals expand their mass accumulate information reproduce until at some critical moment the oldest surviving specimens undergo a kind of sporulation produce compact elisions of themselves that resemble clouds of dust or ash and those clouds follow long elliptical orbits that intersect with planets where they gather have they gathered here sulean asked here yes he said or thought on this rocky planet made habitable for the potential civilization to which it had ultimately been connected do they know us then sulean moi asked sharply isaac was bewildered by the question but the memory of jason lawton seemed to understand it the network processes information over lightyears and centuries but some biological civilizations survive long enough to be perceptible to it yes and civilizations are useful because they generate new machine life to be absorbed and understood or or or devoured sulean moi said or in a sense devoured and civilizations generate something else that interests the network what ruins the memory of jason lawton said they generate ruins outside beyond the walls of concrete and debris impenetrable to human vision the ballet of memory proceeded at a quickening pace memory he told sulean moi was what was happening here ten thousand years of relentlessly gathered and shared knowledge was compressed into the spheres that made the canopy of the hypothetical forest information to be collated and carried forward isaac said through the temporal arch which was opening its mouth to inhale all that knowledge representations of the orbits and climates and evolution of local planets of the millions of interlaced trajectories of icy cometary bodies from which the hypothetical machines had drawn and would continue to draw their mass of signals received from elsewhere in the galaxy and absorbed and reemitted why memory sulean moi demanded to what end isaacwhat is it that remembers what remembered was the thing he couldnt see though he saw much else not even jason lawton could answer the question sulean moi had posed what was happening here was only a trivial event in the network in the mind ofofoh diane has it really grown out there among the stars the thing you used to want so badly to believe in isaac can you hear me he fell back into the abyss of his own thoughts because isaac remembered jason it was also true that jason remembered isaac jasons adult understanding of the world had been overlaid on isaacs raw experience and that created a kind of double vision that was deeply discomforting it reflected his life as in a funhouse mirror for instance mrs rebka she was someone close to him someone he trusted but when jason inspected those same memories she became cold distant something much less than a real mother to isaac she existed in a realm beyond judgment to jason she was guilty of a profound moral recklessness likewise his memories of dr dvali the aloof god who had defined isaacs world and whom jason perceived as an obsessive monster isaac desperately wanted not to hate these people and even the part of him that was jason lawton retained some sympathy for mrs rebka she had loved isaac as much as she attempted to conceal it and isaac understood with some shame how difficult he had been to love he had returned her studied indifference and he hadnt been wise enough to recognize her pain and her perseverance he recognized it now she hadnt spoken for more than an hour and when isaac went to her side and sat with her when he looked at her with what he had begun to think of as his hypothetical eyes he knew why she had not been spared when the building collapsed during the earthquake she was hurthurt inside where it didnt show but hurt so badly that her fourthness was failing to repair the damage she was bleeding internally there was a coppery aura of blood around her she whispered his name her voice was less loud than the sound of the hypothetical digging and scratching at the rubblewhich had itself grown louder over the last few hours i can take you with me isaac said sulean moi overhearing said what do you mean but isaacs mother only nodded then there was a gust of quick cool air and the darkness was dispelled by the light of the alien forest chapter thirtytwo lise said we need to get our bearings before the sun sets turk gave her a puzzled lookhe had just finished helping dr dvali assemble a rough shelter under the lee of a concrete loading pier close but not too close to the digging treesthen he interpreted her frowning glances at dvali and said yeah youre right well do that he asked dvali to gather up any intact canned food he could find among the excavated debris while he and lise scouted dvali gave him a suspicious glareas a fourth he probably recognized a halftruth when he heard onebut nodded tersely and waved them away so he walked with lise back along the perimeter of the tumbled mall steering wide of the dig and as soon as they were out of earshot turk said get our bearings she confessed that she had mainly wanted to get away from dvali if only briefly and i thought we could get above these trees and have a look around how do you propose to do that she showed him at the south end of the mall there was a quadrangle of intact exterior walls where a steel fire escape was bolted in place she had noticed it earlier in the day she said turk surveyed it and decided it was sturdy enough to carry their weight and yeah maybe it was a good idea to look around while there was still some daylight left if they were careful so they climbed as far as the roof and stood on a steel mesh platform above the canopy of globes in the simple light of the fading afternoon and marveled at what they saw the view was similar to what lise had seen this morning from the riggers dorm but it extended in every direction including the westisaacs direction she thought dizzilywhere something monstrous had grown out of the ground from this place above the canopy of the dark forest the ruins of human structures were easy to discern the long line of the collapsed mall lay across the body of the forest like a train wreck the building where they had sheltered last night projected from the trees like the prow of a grounded ship and farther off she could see the silhouettes of drill rigs and cracking towers and storage something was burning in the oil fields the wind scrawled a line of black smoke across the horizon hypothetical growths carpeted the desert in every direction reflecting the light of the setting sun and radiating their own a sea of dark jewels she thought she wondered how much mass these things must have extracted from the ash or the ground or the air in order to grow themselves wondered if the whole inland basin of equatoria had been hollowed out to build them and in the west against the glare of the sun hold on turk said as a brisk wind rattled the platform but her grip on the railing was already painfully tight in the west something immense had arisen a kind of arch lise had sailed under the arch of the hypothetical three times twice as an adolescent coming to port magellan with her parents and leaving without her father and once as an adult that arch aweinspiring as it was had been too large to be perceived as a single thing what you saw was the nearest leg soaring beyond the atmosphere or the part of it that continued to reflect sunlight in the hours after dark a silvery blaze suspended over the sea what she saw now was less immenseshe could see all of it at once an inverted u against the sunsetbut that only made its size more starkly obvious it must have been twenty or fifty miles high high enough that a haze of cloud paled its uppermost curve but at the same time it seemed delicate almost fragile how did it sustain its own weight more importantly why was it here what was it meant to do an even stronger gust of wind bounced the platform and carried turks matted hair into his eyes she didnt like the expression on his face as he stared at the thing in the west for the first time since she had known him he looked lost lost and a little scared we shouldnt stay up here he said this wind she agreed the view was in an unearthly way beautiful but it was also unendurable it implied too much she followed him down they rested at the foot of the stairs back under the canopy of globes like mice in a mushroom patch she thought protected from the wind for a moment they didnt speak then turk reached into the lefthand pocket of his grimy jeans and brought out his compass the same militarysurplus compass in a battered brass case he had been carrying the day he first flew her into the mountains he opened the case and looked at the gently swinging needle as if to confirm its alignment then he reached for lises hand and put the compass in her palm whats this for i dont know if theres an edge to this fucking forest but if there is youll probably need a compass to find your way out so ill just follow you keep it i want you to have it but come on lise all the time weve been together what did i ever give you id like to give you something it would make me happy just take it gratefully but uneasily she closed her hand on the chilly brass case i was thinking about dvali lise said as they walked back to camp she knew she shouldnt be saying this out loud but the combined effect of exhaustion and the twilight glitter of the forest not entirely dark she had to admit and turks peculiar gift had made her reckless about dvali putting together his commune in the desert sulean moi said there were other attempts to do the same thing but theyd been stopped in time dvali must have known that right i would guess so but it seemed like he was pretty free with his information he took a lot of people into his confidence including my father couldnt have been too reckless or they would have caught up with him he changed his plans thats what he told me he was supposed to establish his compound out on the west coast but he changed his mind after he left the university hes not stupid lise i dont think hes stupid i think hes lying he never intended to go to the west coast the west coast plan was bullshit it was designed to be bullshit maybe turk said does it matter the story was supposed to derail anyone who came after him but do you see what that means dvali knew genomic security was looking for him and he must have known they would come after my father turk he sat not a foot away from me and told me he knew my father was principled and loyal and wouldnt tell dgs what they wanted to knowexcept under extreme duress dvali could have warned him as soon as he heard dgs was in port magellan if not before but thats not what he wanted to do my father disapproved of dvalis project on moral grounds so dvali hung him out like a red flag he couldnt have known your father would be killed but he must have known it was a possibility and he certainly would have expected him to be tortured if it isnt murder its the next best thing murder by indirectionthe only kind of murder a fourth could commit she didnt know what she could do with this thought which had begun to burn like a brushfire in her mind could she face dvali again should she tell him what shed guessed or pretend innocence until they escaped this place and what then was there any real justice for fourths she thought diane dupree might be able to answer that question or sulean moi if they were still alive listen turk said all lise could hear was the canopy of the dark forest rattling in the rising wind she and turk were back at the loading bays now back where the creepy hedge of eyeball flowers had grown but there wasnt even that maddening scratchtap sound because her eyes widened it stopped turk said the digging had stopped chapter thirtythree avram dvali was collecting canned food and worrying about the rising wind when the sound of digging abruptly ceased he stood upright chilled his first thought was the boy is dead the hypothetical trees had stopped digging because the boy was dead and for one long heartbeat it seemed not just an idea but a blackbordered truth then he thought or they found him he dropped what he was holding and ran for the dig in his haste he almost blundered into the hedge of ocular roses one of the tallest of them turned to inspect him its eye as indifferent as a dark pearl he ignored it he was startled by how much the digging trees had accomplished since the last time hed looked the spatulate roots were slow but the sum of their groping and picking had exposed an intact wall and beyond it leading inside an opening in the banked rubble he pushed past the ocular roses pushed aside their fleshy stems because somewhere in that cloistered darkness isaac must still be alive alive and in conversation with the forces dvali had loved and feared ever since they embraced the earth and stole it out of time the hypotheticals the roots of the hypothetical trees had pulled back from the excavation they had made and lay in a motionless tangle at the entrance to the buried room dvali hesitated at the brink of that hole which was just large enough to allow him to pass through knowing it was unwise to go fartherthe weight of the debris must be immense tons of it balanced on the partiallyintact ceiling with nothing to support it but a few joists and groaning timbersand knowing at the same time that he couldnt stop himself the rising wind had begun to keen through the ruins with the urgency of a siren he took another step into the shadows and wrinkled his nose at the dismaying smell unmistakably something had died here his heart sank isaac he called out the dim ambient light showed him nothing until his eyes adjusted to it then certain shapes became apparent the martian woman sulean moi was she dead no she looked up at him from the floor of this halfcollapsed room with an expression of shock her own eyes perhaps blinded by the sudden daylight what a hell this imprisonment must have been dvali thought she scrabbled on hands and knees toward the opening and he wanted to help her but his thoughts remained focused on isaac he wished he had a lamp a flashlight anything the wind howled like a wounded dog a dust of plaster shook loose from the ceiling dvali pressed on into the stink and muck the next body he encountered belonged to diane dupree the fourth woman from the coast was dead and as soon as he was sure of that he moved past her the ceiling was low he stooped as he walked but in the deeper darkness he was able at last to see isaacthrillingly isaac alive isaac kneeling over the prostrate form of anna rebka isaac inched away as dvali approached the boys eyes were luminous the golden flecks in his irises prominently aglow even his skin seemed faintly alight he looked inhuman was inhuman dvali reminded himself anna rebka remained inert he asked is she dead no isaac said leave her sulean moi called from the fading daylight just beyond the entrance to the buried stockroom isaac leave her come out it isnt safe but her throat was dry and the command emerged as a feeble plea dvali put his fingers on annas throat feeling for a pulse but knowing as soon as he touched her that he wouldnt find one isaac was wrong or was denying an obvious truth no isaac he said gently shes dead thats just her body isaac said what do you mean haltingly and to dvalis astonishment the boy began to explain this wind sulean moi thought it will kill us yet she saw turk and lise hurrying toward her through the accumulation of alien growths a kind of forestit was almost too much for her to register after hours of blindness in the buried stockroom overhead a canopy of strangely glittering globes were attached to these should she call them trees and a sort of bramble of ocular flowers had grown nearby and some of them had turned their mindless eyes in her direction the world was obscenely transformed and the wind where had it come from its intensity increased almost by the second it tugged at the ruins behind her lofting kites of tattered drywall and tar paper high among the alien trees she turned her head back and called out more audibly this time isaac it was the boy who mattered not the foolish avram dvali isaac come out as the unstable debris shifted and groaned dvali grasped immediately what the boy was telling him it was little more than he had long imaginedisaac had become a conduit to the hypothetical but with this astonishing difference isaac had been able to acquire the memories of anna rebka before she died she lived in him as did the martian child esh he whispered anna as if he could summon her from the boy like a conjurer summoning a ghost but the boys eyes changed in some indefinable way the corners of his lips turned down as if with distaste and it was exactly the way anna had been looking at him lately then dvali said a thing he had not anticipated saying though the words were as logical and as inevitable as the last step on a long road take me with you he said the boy stepped back from him shaking his head take me with you isaac wherever you are wherever youre going take me with you stressed timbers creaked as if the weight of the world was balanced on them there was a sound like gunshots as the wood fractured no the boy said calmly firmly and this was maddening maddening because he was so close so close and because the voice that denied him sounded so much like annas voice chapter thirtyfour sulean moi was sprawled on the ground by the hedge of eyeball flowers lise swallowed her dread of the hypothetical growths and pulled her a safer distance from the windtorn debris field turk leaned over the martian woman and said where are the others for a moment sulean seemed unable to answer she opened her mouth closed it she was in shock lise thought dead the martian woman finally managed diane is dead anna rebka what about isaac alive dvali is with himinside in there why wont they come out its not safe turk stood and surveyed the rubble and the small opening the digging trees had made lise held his arm because he must not go in there not into that teetering cavern no he pulled away she would remember that sensation of his forearm slipping out of her grasp like the best and worst memories it would become indelible it would haunt her on long nights for the rest of her life but she couldnt stop him and she couldnt bring herself to follow him it was dark in the buried stockroom turk almost tripped over the body of diane dupree before he registered isaac and dr dvali confronting one another against a wall of broken shelves and fissured cinderblocks dvali was grabbing for the boy and isaac was retreating by steps not wanting to be touched but not yet willing to run and turk could hear dvalis low begging voice under the roar of this fucking wind that had come out of nowhere and seemed about ready to tip the continent off its hinges he had seen enough weirdness today to last him a lifetime but he registered one more eerie miracle the boys skin had gone milky white and was faintly luminous his face a candleglow around his golden eyes his body a sort of jackolantern where his ribs showed through his torn and filthy shirt isaac turk said and the boy turned to him its okay the doors open you can go isaac looked at him gratefully then the wind made a sound like the horn of some monster ship leaving harbor and all the ruin that had hung suspended above them began to fall sulean moi held lise adams in her arms as the building shifted and compacted a wave of concrete dust and atomized plaster spilled over them and was carried off by the terrible wind stay down sulean said you cant help them now lise fought a little longer then all the strength spilled out of her and sulean held the girl against her shoulder rocking her gently there had been a terrible finality about the last collapse sulean thought no one could have survived it then she revised her opinion the ocular roses bent by the wind refocused their solemn attention look sulean said patiently the hypothetical trees had begun once more to dig part six the ordinance of time chapter thirtyfive then it was overwhen there was nothing left of the great glittering forest but a few palsied and rapidly decomposing stems when the towering arch had finished its work and turned to dust when the desert basin of the rub alkhali had gone to sleep for another ten thousand yearslise came back to port magellan the skies were fair and half a hundred ships lay at anchor in the harbor though not as many as there used to be or as there would be again perhaps when the oil industry had been reconstructed and the tourist trade revived she took a room in a hotel genomic security seemed to have lost interest in her after dvalis fourths detonated their bioreactors at kubelicks grave but her name might still be on someones list so she rented a room under an assumed name and thought about how she might begin to reassemble her life and finally a week after she had arrivednot by trawler as she had once imagined but on a bus with forty or fifty other refugees from the rub alkhalishe had gathered up her courage what remained of it and called brian gately when his exclamations of surprise and disbelief subsided she agreed to meet him on neutral turf harleys in the mild afternoon at a table overlooking the hills where the white city tumbled down to the bay she showed up early and spent the hiatus considering what she wanted to say to him but her mind refused to focus a waiter brought ice water and bread to the table as if to distract her the waiters nametag said mahmud and she asked mahmud if tyrell still worked at the restaurantshe remembered tyrell from the night of the first ashfall august th when she had brought turk here to look at the photograph of sulean moi no tyrell had gone back to the states mahmud said many people had left port magellan after the strange things fell from the sky everything the same lise thought yes everything different and as mahmud left the table she saw brian come through the door he smiled tentatively when he spotted her she nodded he came and sat at the table brian gately no longer of the department of genomic security that was one of the first things he had told her when she called i dont work for them anymore he said as if establishing his bona fides solemnly i quit he hadnt said why you caught me just in time he said next week im out of the apartment all i own right now is four packed bags and a ticket home youre going back to the states no reason to stay ill tell you a secret lise i hate this city by extension this entire planet because he was no longer with dgs he couldnt help her but neither could he hurt her as a threat he was more or less neutered so the question was would she tell him what had happened in the desert because he was going to ask she was certain he would ask hold on sulean moi had told her and that was what lise had done even when it seemed like the entire world was tilting under her all around her the brightly fluorescing globes shook loose from the hypothetical trees and were drawn toward the central vortex of the temporal arch the wind became a gale and the gale became a hurricane and she braced herself against a concrete pier too terrified even to scream she was only vaguely aware of sulean moi curled under the same ledge of stone not far away the wind was unceasing and she passed in and out of consciousness somehow remaining braced where she was coming to herself time and again as if awaking not from but into a bad dream and did the night pass a day another night eventually it did stop the wind died to a breeze the world righted itself and sulean moi was calling her name lise adams are you hurt there were a thousand ways to answer that question but she couldnt speak she must have slept at least some of the time the impossible arch in the west was gone and most of the dark forest with it all that remained were broken buildings raw foundations cracked and tumbled pavement and the stumps of hypothetical trees here was the desert again lise thought and the intolerable ache of cramping muscles and the infinitely deeper throb of grief days later she sat at the side of a barren road hungry and gaunt in filthy clothing next to sulean moi and not far from a dozen other boneweary men and womenmostly menwho had weathered the crisis in abandoned buildings or the crevices of the ruined oil facilities they were waiting for a bus the rescue workers had said would be along any hour now the bus was supposed to take them to a recovery area on the northeast coast but lise and sulean planned to slip away before that maybe at bustee and make their own way over the mountains she turned to sulean who sat with her chin on the heels of her hands are you thirsty only tired the martian woman said in that ancient voice that made lise think of a badlyrosined bow abusing the estring of a violin and i was thinking about dr dvali avram dvali dead beyond redemption what about him he was wrong about so many things but he may have been right about the hypotheticals the martian womans expression became even more mournful i believed there were no hypotheticals in the sense of consciously acting agentsconscious entities there was only the process the needles of evolution endlessly knitting lise at this moment couldnt bring herself to care but it mattered to sulean and sulean had been kind to her so she said well isnt that right what happened hereyoure saying it was planned not planned there was never any sort of galactic council that sat down and decided to put a temporal gateway in the middle of equatoria i expect it grew there over countless millions of years the unpredicted outcome of whatever preceded it like every other act of evolution so dvali was wrong but only in the most literal sense isaac had explained this to her she said back in the ruined mall millions of highly evolved selfreproducing machines collect and collate information about a volume of space that information is periodically brought here to be compiled the temporal arch feeds it forward ten thousand years into the future and at the same time a similar body of ancient information is released into the present to be reabsorbed and to restore what has been lost to entropy that isnt memory in the passive sense its an act of remembering and organisms remember in order to preserve or usefully alter their behavior its how the hypothetical network remembers okay i get that but but if the network remembers then it must have some kind of volition at least a rudimentary sense of itself as separate from the rest of the natural world in other words taken as a whole its exactly what dr dvali imagined it to bea transcendent being so immense that even a detailed record of a human life is only an infinitesimal fraction of its smallest component part a detailed record of a human life like eshs for instance like and that implies something else sulean moi said something perhaps even more dreadful consider jason lawton because he is remembered by the network of the hypotheticals he has achieved a sort of existence beyond death passive perhaps but still meaningful and what will we make of that miss adams once the truth is out put it in the simplest terms there is a god and this god can enable immortality and that immortality can be mediated by a drug the drug that jason lawton took the one that connected him to the hypotheticals before it killed him lise said but if its deadly physically quite deadly but if one is remembered if one passes from death directly into the mind of a very real god people will be tempted by it more than tempted theyll call it a fifth age mark my words theyll call it a fifth age not an adulthood beyond adulthood but a birth beyond death theyll worship it theyll fight over it theyll create their departments of spiritual security and what that will make of us in the long run i dread to think the martian woman closed her eyes as if against this intolerable vision of the future lise was still trying to grasp what sulean had said about the hypotheticals how if they were capable of remembering they must be a thing with some sense of itself a sort of mind a mind made out of countless millions of mindless parts but wasnt that the definition of any mind her own for instance the afternoon sun was merciless lise took a long drink from the bottled water the rescue workers had handed out and adjusted the brim of her hat also a handout she said if it has a memory what else does it have does that mean it has compassion say or imagination sulean gave this a moments thought then she smiled which must have been painful lise thought because her ancient lips were cracked and in places bleeding i dont know maybe we have our own role to play as a species i mean the intervention of the hypotheticals is making something unpredictable of us wouldnt you call that an act of imagination so the network of the hypotheticals remembered and maybe it even dreamed and factored humanity into its dreams but did it feel grief did it wonder at the galaxies beyond its own boundaries did it speak to them and did they answer these were questions her father would have asked her shadow lay before her like a dark twin she squinted into the distance that speck in the shadeless desert might be the approaching bus if it lived she thought did that mean it would it die and did it know it would die and did it want to live forever much of what lise had seen firsthandthe alien forest the eruption and ultimate collapse of the temporal archhad been captured on video by drone cameras and relayed back to port magellan by now the images had been broadcast all over this world and into the more crowded one next door commentators had taken to calling it a hypothetical event of unknown significance she told brian she had been close to it when it happened and that she had been lucky to survive but she refused to be drawn out on specifics not because she distrusted him but because the memory was too vividly present to put into words brian seemed to accept that but then he askedwith all the tact he could musterwhat had happened to turk findley and lise closed her eyes and wondered what she could say all she could think of and she couldnt speak of this was the sound of his voice coming out of the wind and the night out of the darkness lit by the glow of the fruit still clinging to the hypothetical trees the globes on their stalks shed a collective ethereal starlight even as the wind howled around them and carried them off in increasing numbers their endlessly shifting colors played over the face of sulean moi who had wrapped a tarpaulin around herself and crawled into the meager shelter of the concrete pier in the morning lise promised herself when the wind stopped if it stopped as soon as it was possible to stand upright she would dig she would dig where the hypothetical trees were digging she would dig out turk and isaac and even dr dvali but so much time had passed since the building had collapsedhoursand the wind had grown steadily more fierce bending the hypothetical trees like penitents at prayer shrieking gusts came through the gaps in the concrete pier and lise could hear wallboard and sheet metal singing as it caught the air the radiant globes rattled on their stiff limbs or broke loose and were carried upward she saw or dreamed she saw them massing in the sky a river of them above the nownaked branches of the hypothetical trees a flock like luminous birds in migration flowing into the temporal arch lise said a voice from behind herloud enough to hear over the screeching of the wind impossibly loud but it was turks voice and in her astonishment she sat up and tried to turn to face him he was somewhere behind these concrete slabs somehow enduring the galeforce wind turk dont look at me lise its better if you dont this frightened her so badly that she couldnt look she imagined him hurt or horribly wounded so she looked at the ground but that was no better because she could tell by the shadows that there was a vivid light coming from the place where turk must be standingpossibly from turk himself which threatened to drive her into an even deeper chasm of terror so she closed her eyes altogether closed them tight and clenched her hands into fists and let him speak lise brian said are you okay yes she said there was a wineglass in front of her and mahmud was filling it refilling it she pushed it away sorry turk had said a few things things that were private things she would carry with her to her grave words meant exclusively for her he had apologized in simple words for leaving her he didnt have a choice he said there was only one door left to him when she asked where he was going all he said was west he went west she told brian and when she finally forced herself to raise her head and look really look what she had seen was not turk but isaac isaac was ragged he was hurt one of his arms was bent twice in the wrong direction but he was shining like a full moon his skin had become as luminous and shiftingly colorful as the memory globes as if he had become one of them and she supposed he had she understood this because turk had explained it turks body was back in the ruins but his living memory was here with this battered remnant of isaac that had been excavated by the hypothetical trees and esh was with him also jason lawton also anna rebka and diane diane he said had preferred to stay behind and she had asked dr dvali no not dr dvali then the luminous shell of isaac had given itself to the wind and the wind had carried him west brian was saying something about your book there was never any book you learn anything about your father a few things because i did some investigation of my own after you mentioned tomas ginn i made some inquiries ginn is dead lise he was killed in the course of a secret interrogation lise said nothing the same thing may have happened to your father may have well no did in fact you have evidence of this a photograph not exactly evidence its not actionable but thats the truth lise if the truth is what you were looking for a photograph of her fatherof his corpse brian seemed to be implying she didnt want to see it i know what happened she said do you she knew what had happened to her blameless father and she knew something even brian didnt know she knew what had killed him and she knew why she had already sent a text message to her mother in california he didnt leave he was taken away i know this her mother sent back then you can come home but thats where i am lise replied and later walking by the dockside in a morning fog she realized it was true she had said goodbye to sulean moi at a rural bus stop on her way into the port lise had asked the martian woman whether she would be okay on her own but of course she would be okay she had lived for decades on her wits and the generosity of charitable fourths and she still had work to do she said isaac had been her great failure but there would be more battles whatever the hypothetical network truly was sulean moi still disapproved of its commerce with human beings i dont want to be an element in some creatures vast transactions she said nor do i wish my species to be so where will you go lise had asked and the martian woman smiled and said maybe ill go west what about you are you all right no of course she was not all right lises memories of the rub alkhali would generate sweatdrenched dreams for months if not years to come but she shrugged and said ill survive and must have been sincere because the martian woman had taken her hand and looked into her eyes and solemnly nodded i wish it had worked out better for us brian said which was his way of acknowledging that the marriage was well and truly finished i wish a lot of things had worked out better which made it easier to be grateful for everything hed done or tried to do on her behalf easier to see him as blameless their lunch had gone long it was already dusk down in the port lights were starting to wink on from the illuminated billboards along the rue de madagascar to the strings of multicolored diodes that glorified the souks and open markets all that polyglot beauty lise thought as if the city were a single organism following its own diurnal rhythms and steeped in its own evolving imagination she wondered if it would still be here in a thousand yearsor ten thousand years when turks ghost came walking out of the temporal arch to begin another cycle any real understanding of the nature of the hypotheticals must take this into account they were ancient when we first encountered them and they are more ancient now the introduction to her fathers book brian took her hand a final time then turned and walked away lise sat at the table a while longer the cooling air from the patio was pleasant the stars were coming out mahmud poured coffee from a silver carafe what we cannot remember we must rediscover im sorrydid you say something i said its getting dark mahmud smiled its these sunsets seems like they go on forever
