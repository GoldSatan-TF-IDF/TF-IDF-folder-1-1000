sara paretsky killing orders the third book in the vi warshawski series i old wounds my stomach muscles contracted as i locked the car door i hadnt been to melrose park for ten years but as i walked up the narrow pavement to the houses side entrance i felt a decade of maturity slipping from me felt the familiar sickening my heart thudding the january wind scattered dead leaves around my feet little snow had fallen this winter but the air blew cold after ringing the bell i jammed my hands deep into the pockets of my navy car coat to keep them warm i tried to argue my nervousness away after all they had called me begged me for help the words meant nothing i had lost an important battle by responding to the plea i stamped my feet to loosen the toes frozen inside thinsoled loafers and heard at last a rattling behind the painted blue door it swung inward into a dimly lit vestibule through the screen i could just make out my cousin albert much heavier than hed been ten years ago the screen and the dark behind him softened his pout come in victoria mother is waiting for you i bit back an excuse for being a quarter hour late and turned it into a neutral comment on the weather albert was almost bald i noted with pleasure he took my coat ungraciously and draped it over the banister at the foot of the narrow uncarpeted stairs a deep harsh voice called to us albert is that victoria yes mama albert muttered the only light in the entryway came from a tiny round window facing the stairs the dimness obscured the pattern in the wallpaper but as i followed albert down the close corridor i could see it hadnt changed gray paper with white loops ugly cold as a child i thought the paper oozed hate behind alberts wobbling thighs the old chill stuck out tendrils at me and i shivered i used to beg my mother gabriella not to bring me to this house why should we go rosa hated her hated me and gabriella always cried after the long l ride home but she would only set her lips in a tight smile and say i am obligated cara i must go albert led me into the formal parlor at the back of the house the horsehair furniture was as familiar to me as my own apartment in my nightmares i dreamed of being trapped in this room with its stiff furniture the iceblue drapes the sad picture of uncle carl over the fake fireplace and rosa thin hawknosed frowning seated pokerbacked in a spindlelegged chair her black hair was ironcolored now but the severe disapproving stare was unaltered i tried taking diaphragm breaths to calm the churning in my stomach youre here because she begged you i reminded myself she didnt stand up didnt smilei couldnt remember ever seeing her smile it was good of you to come victoria her tone implied it would have been better if id come on time when one is old one doesnt travel easily and the last few days have made me old indeed i sat down in what i hoped was the least uncomfortable chair yes i said noncommittally rosa was about seventyfive when they performed her autopsy they would find her bones were made of cast iron she did not look old to me she hadnt begun to rust yet albert pour some coffee for victoria rosa s single virtue was her cooking i took a cup of the rich italian coffee gratefully but ignored the tray of pastries albert profferedid get pastry cream on my black wool skirt and feel foolish as well as tense albert sat uneasily on the narrow settee eating a piece of torta del re glancing surreptitiously at the floor when a crumb dropped then at rosa to see if shed noticed you are well victoria you are happy yes i said firmly both well and happy but you have not remarried the last time id been here was with my brief husband for a strained bridal visit it is possible to be happy and not married as albert doubtless can tell you or as you know yourself the last was a cruel remark uncle carl had killed himself shortly after albert was born i felt vindictively pleased then guilty surely i was mature enough not to need that kind of satisfaction somehow rosa always made me feel eight years old rosa shrugged her thin shoulders disdainfully no doubt you are right yet for mei am to die without the joy of grandchildren albert shifted uncomfortably on the settee it was clearly not a new complaint a pity i said i know grandchildren would be the crowning joy of a happy and virtuous life albert choked but recovered rosa narrowed her eyes angrily you of all people should know why my life has not been happy despite my efforts at control anger spilled over rosa for some reason you think gabriella destroyed your happiness what mysterious grievance a girl of eighteen could have caused you i dont know but you threw her out into the city on her own she didnt speak english she might have been killed whatever she did to you it couldnt have been as bad as what you did to her you know the only reason im here gabriella made me promise that i would help you if you needed it it stuck in my gut and it still does but i promised her and here i am so lets leave the past in peace i wont be sarcastic if youll stop throwing around insults about my mother why not just tell me what the problem is rosa tightened her lips until they almost disappeared the most difficult thing i ever did in my life was to call you and now i see i should not have done it she rose in one movement like a steel crane and left the room i could hear the angry clip of her shoes on the uncarpeted hail and up the bare stairs in the distance a door slammed i put down my coffee and looked at albert he had turned red with discomfort but he seemed less amorphous with rosa out of the room how bad is her trouble he wiped his fingers on a napkin and folded it tidily pretty bad he muttered whyd you have to make her mad it makes her mad to see me here instead of at the bottom of lake michigan every time ive talked to her since gabriella died shes been hostile to me if she needs help all i want is the facts she can save the rest for her psychiatrist i dont get paid enough to deal with it i picked up my shoulder bag and stood up at the doorway i stopped and looked at him im not coming back to melrose park for another round albert if you want to tell me the story ill listen but if i leave now thats it i wont respond to any more pleas for farm unity from rosa and by the way if you do want to hire me im not working out of love for your mother he stared at the ceiling listening perhaps for guidance from above not heavenjust the back bedroom we couldnt hear anything rosa was probably jabbing pins into a piece of clay with a lock of my hair stuck to it i rubbed my arms involuntarily searching for damage albert shifted uneasily and stood up uh look uh maybe id better tell you fine can we go to a more comfortable room sure sure he gave a half smile the first id seen that afternoon i followed him back down the hail to a room on the left it was tiny but clearly his private spot a giant set of stereo speakers loomed from one wall below them were some builtin shelves holding an amplifier and a large collection of tapes and records no books except a few accounting texts his highschool trophies a tiny cache of bottles he sat in the one chair a large leather desk chair with a hassock next to it he slid the hassock over to me and i perched on that in his own place albert relaxed and his face took on a more decisive look he was a cpa with his own business i remembered when you saw him with rosa you couldnt imagine him managing anything on his own but in here it didnt seem so improbable he took a pipe from the desk top next to him and began the pipe smokers interminable ritual with it with luck id be gone before he actually lit it all smoke makes me ill and pipe smoke on top of an empty stomachid been too tense for lunchwould be disastrous how long have you been a detective victoria about ten years i swallowed my annoyance at being called victoria not that it isnt my name just that iliked using it i wouldnt go by my initials and youre good at it yes depending on your problem im about the best you can get i have a list of references if you want to call someone yeah id like a name or two before you go he had finished drilling out the pipe bowl he knocked it methodically against the side of an ashtray and began packing it with tobacco mothers gotten herself involved with some counterfeit securities wild dreams of rosa as the brains behind chicago s mob ran through my head i could see sixpoint screamer headlines in the heraldstar involved how they found some in the st albert priory safe i sighed to myself albert was deliberately going to drag this out she plant them there whats she got to do with this priory the moment of truth had come albert struck a match and began sucking on the pipestem sweet blue smoke curled up around his head and wafted toward me i felt my stomach turn over mothers been their treasurer for the last twenty years i thought you knew he paused a minute to let me feel guilty about not keeping up with the family of course they had to ask her to leave when they found the securities does she know anything about them he shrugged he was sure she didnt he didnt know how many there were what companies they were drawn on how long since theyd last been examined or who had access to them the only thing he knew was the new prior wanted to sell them in order to make repairs on the building yes theyd been in a safe her hearts broken because of the suspicion he saw my derisive look and said defensively just because you only see her when shes upset or angry you cant imagine she has real feelings shes seventyfive you know and that job meant a lot to her she wants her name cleared so she can go back surely the fbi is investigating and the sec yes but theyd be just as happy to hang it on her if it made things easier for them after all who wants to take a priest to court and they know shes old shed get off with a suspended sentence i blinked a few times albert no youre out of touch if she were some poor west side black they might railroad her but not rosa shed scare em too much for one thing and the fbitheyll want to get to the bottom of this theyre never going to believe an old woman masterminded a counterfeiting scheme unless of course she had i wished i could believe it but rosa was malicious not dishonest but that church is the only thing she really loves he blurted turning crimson they might believe she got carried away people do we talked about it some more but it ended as i suppose id known it had to with me pulling out two copies of my standard contract for albert to sign i gave him a family rate on the feesixteen dollars an hour instead of twenty he told me the new prior would be expecting my call boniface carroll his name was albert wrote that on a piece of paper along with a rough map of how to find the priory i frowned as i stuck it in my bag they were taking an awful lot for granted then i laughed sourly at myself once id agreed to make the trek to melrose park they could take a lot for granted back at my car i stood rubbing my head for a few minutes hoping the cold clean air would blow the pipe fumes from my throbbing brain i glanced back at the house a curtain fell quickly at an upstairs window i climbed into the car somewhat cheered to see rosa spy furtively on melike a small child or a thiefmade me feel somehow that more of the power lay in my hands ii remembrance of things past i woke up sweating the bedroom was dark and for a moment i couldnt remember where i was gabriella had been staring at me her eyes huge in her wasted face the skin translucent as it had been those last painful months of her life pleading with me to help her the dream had been in italian it took time to reorient myself to english to adulthood to my apartment the digital clock glowed faintly orange fivethirty my sweat turned to a chill i pulled the comforter up around my neck and clenched my teeth to keep them from chattering my mother died of cancer when i was fifteen as the disease ate the vitality from her beautiful face she made me promise to help rosa if her aunt ever needed me i had tried to argue with gabriella rosa hated her hated mewe had no obligation but my mother insisted and i could not refuse my father had told me more than once how he met my mother he was a policeman rosa had thrown gabriella out on the street an immigrant with minimal english my mother who always had more courage than common sense was trying to earn a living doing the only thing she knew singing unfortunately none of the milwaukee avenue bars where she auditioned liked puccini or verdi and my father rescued her one day from a group of men who were trying to force her to strip neither he nor i could understand why she ever saw rosa again but i made her the promise she wanted my pulse had calmed down but i knew more sleep was out of the question shivering in the cold room i padded naked to the window and pulled back the heavy curtain the winter morning was black snow falling like a fine mist glowed in the streetlamp at the corner of the alley i kept shivering but the still morning held me entranced the thick black air pressing at me comfortingly at last i let the curtain drop i had a ten oclock meeting in melrose park with the new prior of st albert s i might as well get going even in the winter i try to run five miles a day although financial crime my specialty doesnt often lead to violence i grew up in a rough south side neighborhood where girls as well as boys had to be able to defend themselves old habits die hard so i work out and run to stay in shape anyway running is the best way i know to ward off the effects of pasta i dont enjoy exercise but it beats dieting in the winter i wear a light sweatshirt loose pants and a down vest once warmed up i donned these and ran quickly down the hall and three flights of stairs to keep my muscles loose outside i wanted to abandon the project the cold and damp were miserable even though the streets were already filling with early commuters it was hours before my usual waking time and the sky had barely begun to lighten by the time i got back to halsted and belmont i walked carefully up the stairs to my apartment the steps were shiny with age and very slippery when wet i had a vision of myself sliding backward on wet running shoes cracking my skull on old marble a long hallway divides my apartment in half and makes it seem bigger than its four rooms the dining room and kitchen are to the left bedroom and living room to the right for some reason the kitchen connects to the bathroom i turned on water for a shower and went next door to start coffee armed with coffee i took my running clothes off and sniffed them smelly but not too bad for one more morning i dropped them over a chair back and gave myself up to a long hot shower the stream of water drumming on my skull soothed me i relaxed and without realizing it i started to sing a bit under my breath after a while the tune drifted into my consciousness a sad italian folksong gabriella used to sing rosa was really lying heavy on my mindthe nightmare visions of my skull breaking now mournful songs i was not going to let her control me this waythat would be the ultimate defeat i shampooed my hair vigorously and forced myself to sing brahms i dont like his lieder but some like meine liebe ist grun are almost painfully cheerful coming out of the shower i switched to the dwarfs song from snow white off to work we go my navy walking suit i decided to make me mature and dignified it had a threequarterlength doublebreasted jacket and a skirt with two side pleats a knit silk top of pale gold almost the colour of my skin and a long scarf bright with red and navy and brushed again with the same gold perfect i edged the corners of my eyes with a faint trace of blue pencil to make their gray color bluer added a little light rouge and lipstick to match the red in the scarf opentoed redleather pumps italian gabriella brought me up to believe that my feet would fall off if i wore shoes made anyplace else even now that a pair of magli pumps go for a hundred forty dollars i cant bring myself to wear comfortstride i left the breakfast dishes in the sink with last nights supper plates and those from a few other meals and the bed unmade and the clothes strewn around perhaps i should save the money i spend on clothes and shoes and invest in a housekeeper or even a hypnosis program to teach me to be neat and tidy but what the hell who besides me was going to see it iii the order of preachers the eisenhower expressway is the main escape route from chicago to the western suburbs even on warm sunny days it looks like a prison exercise yard for most of its length rundown houses and faceless projects line the tops of the canyons on either side of its eight lanes l stations are planted along the median the eisenhower is always choked with traffic even at three in the morning at nine on a wet workday it was impossible i could feel tension tightening the cords in the back of my neck as i oozed forward i was on an errand i did not wish to make to talk to a person i had no desire to see about the troubles of an aunt i loathed to do so i had to spend hours stalled in traffic and my feet were cold inside their opentoed pumps i turned up the heat further but the little omega didnt respond i curled and uncurled my toes to get the blood moving but they remained obstinately frozen at first avenue the traffic eased up as the offices there sucked up most of the outbound drivers i exited north at mannheim and meandered through the streets trying to follow alberts roughly sketched directions it was five after ten when i finally found the priory entrance being late did nothing to improve my humor the priory of st albertus magnus included a large block of neogothic buildings set to one side of a beautiful park the architect apparently believed he had to compensate for the beauties of nature in the misty snow the gray stone buildings loomed as ungainly shapes a small lettered sign identified the nearest concrete block as the house of studies as i drove past a few men in long white robes were scuttling into it hoods pulled over their faces so that they looked like medieval monks they paid no attention to me as i crept slowly up the circular drive i saw a number of cars parked to one side i left the omega there and quickly ran to the nearest entrance this was labelled simply st albert s priory inside the building had the halfeerie halftired atmosphere you often find in religious institutions you can tell people spend a lot of time praying there but perhaps they also spend too much time feeling depressed or bored the entryway had a vaulted concrete ceiling that disappeared in the gloomy light several stores up marble flagstones added to the coldness a corridor ran at right angles to the entrance i crossed to it my heels echoing in the vaulted chamber and looked doubtfully around a scarred wooden desk had been stuck in a corner formed by the entry hall and a stairwell a thin young man in civvies sat behind it reading the greater trumps by charles williams he put it down reluctantly after id spoken several times his face was extremely thin he seemed to burn with a nervous asceticism but perhaps he was merely hyperthyroid at any rate he directed me to the priors office in a hurried whisper not waiting to see if i followed his directions before returning to the book at least i was in the right building a relief since i was now fifteen minutes late i turned left down the corridor passing icons and shut doors a couple of men in white robes passed me arguing vigorously but in subdued voices at the end of the hall i turned right on one side of me was a chapel and across from it as the youth had promised the priors office the reverend boniface carroll was on the phone when i came in he smiled when he saw me and motioned me to a chair in front of his desk but continued his conversation in a series of grunts he was a frail man of perhaps fifty his white woolen robe had turned faintly yellow with age he looked very tired as he listened to his caller he kept rubbing his eyes the office itself was sparsely furnished a crucifix over one wall was the only decoration and the wide desk was scuffed with age the floor was covered with institutional linoleum only partly hidden by a threadbare carpet well actually shes here right now mr hatfield no no i think i should talk to her i raised my eyebrows at that the only hatfield i knew worked on fraud for the fbi he was a competent young man but his sense of humor left something to be desired when our paths crossed it was usually to our mutual irritation since he tried to overcome my flippancy with threats of the might of the fbi carroll terminated the conversation and turned to me you are miss warshawski arent you he had a light pleasant voice with a trace of an eastern accent yes i handed him one of my cards was that derek hatfield the fbi man yes hes been out here with ted dartmouth from the securities exchange commission i dont know how he learned we were going to meet but he was asking me not to talk to you did he say why he thinks this is a matter for the fbi and the sec he told me an amateur such as yourself might muddy the waters make the investigation more difficult i rubbed my upper lip thoughtfully id forgotten the lipstick until i saw the smear on my forefinger cool vic if i were being logical id smile politely at father carroll and leave after all id been cursing him rosa and my mission all the way from chicago however theres nothing like a little opposition to make me change my mind especially when the opposition comes from derek hatfield thats sort of what i said to my aunt when i talked to her yesterday the fbi and the sec are trained to handle this kind of investigation but shes old and shes scared and she wants someone from the family in her corner ive been a private investigator for almost ten years ive done a lot of financial crime and ive got a good reputationi could give you the names of some people in the city to call so you dont have to take just my word for it carroll smiled relax miss warshawski you dont have to sell me i told your aunt i would talk to you and i feel we owe her something here if only a conversation with you shes worked for st albert s very faithfully for a long time it really hurt her when we asked her to take a leave of absence i hated doing it but ive made the same request to everyone with access to the safe as soon as we get this business cleared up she knows we want her back shes extremely competent i nodded i could see rosa as a competent treasurer it flashed through my mind that she might have been less angry if she had channeled her energy into a career she would have made a good corporate financial officer i dont really know what happened i said to carroll why dont you tell me the storywhere the safe is how you came to find the fakes how much money is involved who could have gotten at them who knew about themand ill butt in when i dont understand he smiled again a shy sweet smile and got up to show me the safe it was in a storeroom behind his office one of those old castiron models with a combination lock it was stuck in a corner amid stacks of paper an ancient mimeo machine and piles of extra prayer books i knelt to look at it of course the priory had used the same combination for years which meant anyone whod been there a while could have found out what it was neither the fbi nor the melrose park police had discovered any signs that the lock had been forced how many people do you have here at the priory there are twentyone students at the house of studies and eleven priests on the teaching faculty but then there are people like your aunt who come in and work during the day we have a kitchen crew for example the brothers do all the washing up and waiting at table but we have three women who come in to do the cooking we have two receptionists the young man who probably directed you to my office and a woman who handles the afternoon shift and of course there are a lot of neighborhood people who worship with us in the chapel he smiled again we dominicans are preachers and scholars we dont usually run parish churches but a lot of people do treat this as their parish i shook my head youve got too many people around here to make sorting this out easy who actually had official access to the safe well mrs vignelli of course that was rosa i do the procuratorhe handles the financial affairs the student master we have an audit once a year and our accountants always examine the stocks along with the other assets but i dont think they know the combination to the safe whyd you keep the things here instead of in a bank vault he shrugged i wondered the same thing i was just elected last may the smile crept back into his eyes not a post i wantedim like john roncallithe safe candidate who doesnt belong to any of the factions here anyway id never been at all involved in running thisor any otherpriory i didnt know anything about it i didnt know we kept five million dollars worth of stock certificates on the premises to tell you the truth i didnt even know we owned them i shuddered five million dollars sitting around for any casual passerby to take the wonder was that they hadnt simply been stolen years before father carroll was explaining the history of the stocks in his gentle efficient voice they were all bluechip sharesat t ibm and standard of indiana primarily they had been left to the priory ten years ago by a wealthy man in melrose park the priory buildings were close to eighty years old and needed a lot of repairs he pointed to some cracks in the plaster on the wall and i followed the line of damage to a wide brown stain on the ceiling the most urgent problems are the roof and the furnace it seemed reasonable to sell some shares and use the money to repair the plant which is after all our main asset even though its ugly and uncomfortable we couldnt begin to replace it today so i brought up the matter at chapter meeting and got an agreement the next monday i went into the loop and met with a broker he agreed to sell eighty thousand dollars worth of shares he took them from us then that had been the last of the matter for a week then the broker had called back the fort dearborn trust the companys stocktransfer agent had examined the shares and found they were counterfeits is there a possibility the broker or the banker made an exchange he shook his head unhappily thats the first thing we thought of but we had all the remaining certificates looked at theyre all fakes we sat silently for a bit what a dispiriting prospect when was the last time the shares were authenticated i asked at last i dont know i called the accountants but all they do is verify that the shares are there according to the fbi man these certificates are extremely good forgeries they were found out only because the serial numbers had not been used by the issuing companies theyd fool any ordinary observer i sighed i probably should talk to the former prior and to the student master and procurator i asked carroll about them his predecessor was in pakistan for a year running a dominican school there but the student master and procurator were both in the building and would be at lunch youre welcome to join us if you like ordinarily the refectory in a convent is cloisteredthat means only friars can use the room he explained in answer to my puzzled look and yes we friars call this a convent or a friary anyway weve lifted the cloister here at the school so that the young men can eat with their families when they come to visit the food isnt very interesting but its an easier way to meet pelly and jablonski than trying to track them down afterward he pulled back a yellowed sleeve to reveal a thin wrist with a heavy leather watchband on it its almost noon people will be gathering outside the refectory now i looked at my own watch it was almost twenty of twelve duty had driven me to worse things than undistinguished cuisine i accepted the prior locked the storeroom carefully behind him another example of locking the barn door he said there was no lock on that storeroom until we discovered the fake securities we joined a throng of whiterobed men walking down the corridor past carrolls office most of them said hello to him eyeing me covertly at the end of the hall were two swinging doors through their glass top halves i could see the refectory looking like a highschool gym converted to a lunch room long deal tables metal folding chairs no linens hospitalgreen walls carroll took me by the arm and led me through the huddle to a pudgy middleaged man whose head emerged from a fringe of gray hair like a softboiled egg from an egg cup stephen id like you to meet miss warshawski shes rosa vignellis niece but shes also a private investigator shes looking into our crime as an amica familiae he turned to me this is father jablonski whos been the student master for seven years stephen why dont you dig up augustine and introduce him to miss warshawski she needs to talk to him too i was about to murmur a social inanity when carroll turned to the crowd and said something in latin they answered and he rattled off what i assumed was a blessing everyone crossed himself lunch was definitely uninteresting bowls of campbell s tomato soup which i loathe and toasted cheese sandwiches i put pickles and onions inside my sandwich and accepted coffee from an eager young dominican jablonski introduced me to augustine pelly the procurator and to some half dozen other men at our table these were all brothers not fathers since they tended to look alike in their fresh white robes i promptly forgot their names miss warshawski thinks she can succeed where the fbi and the sec are baffled jablonski said jovially his nasal midwestern accent blaring above the dining room cacophony pelly gave me a measuring look then smiled he was almost as thin as father carroll and very tanned which surprised mewhere did a monk go sunbathing in midwinter his blue eyes were sharp and alert in his dark face im sorry miss warshawskii know stephen well enough to tell hes joking but im afraid i dont get the joke im a private investigator i explained pelly raised his eyebrows and youre going to look into our missing securities i shook my head i dont really have the resources to match the fbi on that type of thing but im also rosa vignellis niece she wants someone from the family on her side in the investigation a lot of people have had access to that safe over the years im here to remind derek hatfield of that if he starts breathing down rosa s neck too hard pelly smiled again mrs vignelli doesnt strike one as the type of woman to need protection i grinned back at him she certainly doesnt father pelly but i keep reminding myself that rosa s been aging just like any other human being at any rate she seems a little frightened especially that she wont be able to work here anymore i ate some of my sandwich kraft american next to stilton and brie my favorite cheese jablonski said i hope she knows that augustine and i are also forbidden access to the priorys finances until this matter is cleared up shes not being singled out in any way that we arent maybe one of you could call her i suggested that might make her feel better im sure you know her well enough to realize shes not a woman with a lot of friends shes centered a good part of her life around this church yes pelly agreed i didnt realize she had any family besides her son shes never mentioned you miss warshawski nor that she had any polish relatives her brothers daughter was my mother who married a chicago policeman named warshawski ive never understood the laws of kinship too well does that mean that she has polish relatives because im half polish you dont think im posing as rosa s niece just to get inside the priory do you jablonski gave his sardonic smile now that the securities are gone theres nothing worth worming your way into the priory for unless you have some secret fetish for friars i laughed but pelly said seriously i assume the prior looked into your credentials there wasnt any reason for him to he wasnt hiring me i do have a copy of my pi license on me but i dont carry any identification that proves im rosa vignellis niece you could call her of course pelly held up a hand im not doubting you im just concerned for the priory were getting some publicity which none of us relishes and which is really detrimental to the studies of these young men he indicated the intently eavesdropping young brothers at our table one of them blushed in embarrassment really dont want anyone even if shes the popes niece stirring things up here further i can understand that but i can also see rosa s pointits just too convenient to have her on the outside of the priory taking the fall she doesnt have a big organization with lots of political connections behind her you do pelly gave me a freezing stare i wont attempt to untangle that one miss warshawski you obviously are referring to the popular myth about the political power of the catholic church the direct line from the vatican that was going to control john kennedy that sort of thing its beneath discussion i think we could have a pretty lively discussion about it i objected we could talk about the politics of abortion for example how local pastors try to influence their congregations to vote for antichoice candidates regardless of how terrible their qualifications may be otherwise or maybe youd like to discuss the relations between archbishop farber and police superintendent bellamy or even between him and the mayor jablonski turned to me i think pastors would be gravely lax in their moral duty if they didnt try to oppose abortion in any way possible even urging their parishioners to vote for prolife candidates i felt the blood rush to my head but smiled were never going to agree on whether abortion is a moral issue or a private matter between a woman and her physician but one thing is clearit is a highly political issue there are a lot of people scrutinizing the catholic churchs involvement in this area now the tax code spells out pretty specifically how clear of politics you have to stay to keep your taxexempt status so when bishops and priests are using their offices to push political candidates theyre walking a pretty thin line on taxexempt status so far no taxcourt judge has been willing to take on the catholic churchwhich in itself argues some hefty clout pelly turned an angry crimson under his tan i dont think you have the least idea what youre talking about miss warshawski maybe you could keep your remarks to the specific points that the prior asked you to discuss fine i said lets concentrate on the priory here is there anyone who would have reason to take close to five million dollars no one pelly said shortly we take vows of poverty one of the brothers offered me more coffee it was so thin as to be almost undrinkable but i accepted it absently you got the shares ten years ago since then almost anyone with access to the priory could have taken the money discounting random strangers walking in off the street that means someone connected with this place what kind of turnover do you have among your monks theyre actually called friars jablonski interjected monks stay in one place friars roam around what do you mean by turnover every year students leavesome have been ordained others find the conventual life doesnt suit them for some reason and theres a lot of movement among the priests too people who taught at other dominican institutions come here or vice versa father pelly here just returned from six months in ciudad isabella he was a student in panama and likes to spend a certain amount of time down there that explained his suntan then we can probably eliminate people who move on to other dominican seats but what about any young men whove left the order in the last decade could you find out if any of them claimed coming into an inheritance pelly shrugged disdainfully i suppose so but i would be most reluctant to do so when stephen said young men find the monastic life doesnt suit them its not usually because of lack of luxury we do a careful screening of our applicants before we allow them to become novices i think wed turn up the type who would steal father carroll joined us at that point the refectory was clearing knots of men stood talking in the doorway some staring at me the prior turned to the brothers lingering at our table dont you have exams next week perhaps you should be studying they got up a little shamefacedly and carroll sat in one of the empty seats are you making any progress pelly frowned weve progressed past some wild accusations about the church in general to a concentrated attack on young men who have left the order in the last decade not exactly what id expect from a catholic girl i held up a hand not me father pelly im not a girl and im not a catholic were really at a standstill ill have to talk to derek hatfield and see if hell share the fbis ideas with me what you need to find is someone with a secret bank account perhaps one of your brothers possibly my aunt although if she stole the money it certainly wasnt to use on herself she lives very frugally perhaps though shes a fanatic about some cause i dont know anything about and stole to support it which might be true of any of you as well rosa as a secret torquemada appealed to me but there wasnt any real evidence of it it was hard to imagine her feeling positive enough about anyone or anything to love it let alone steal for it as the procurator father pelly perhaps you know whether the shares were ever authenticated if this wasnt done when you got them its possible they came to you as forgeries pelly shook his head it never occurred to us i dont know if were too unworldly to handle assets but it doesnt seem like the kind of thing anyone does probably not i agreed i asked him and jablonski some more questions but neither was very helpful pelly still seemed miffed with me over the church and politics since id compounded my sin by not being a catholic girl his answers were fairly frosty even jablonski commented on it why are you on such a high horse with miss warshawski gus so shes not a catholic neither is eightyfive percent of the worlds population that should make us more charitable not less pelly turned his cold stare on him and carroll remarked lets save group criticism for chapter stephen pelly said im sorry if i seem rude miss warshawski but this business is very worrying especially because i was the procurator for eight years and im afraid my experiences in central america make me sensitive to criticisms about the church and politics i blinked a few times sensitive how carroll intervened again two of our priests were shot in el salvador last spring the government suspected they were harboring rebels i didnt say anything whether the church was working for the poor as in el salvador or supporting the government as in spain it was still in my book up to its neck in politics but it didnt seem polite to pursue the argument jablonski thought otherwise rubbish gus and you know it youre only upset because you and the government dont see eye to eye but if your friends have their way you know very well that the friary of san tomás will have some very powerful allies he turned to me thats the trouble with people like you and gus miss warshawskiwhen the church is on your side whether its fighting racism or poverty its just being sensitive not political when it goes against your position then its political and up to no good carroll said i think were all getting a long way from miss warshawskis real business in coming out here stephen i know we dominicans are supposed to be preachers but it violates some rules of hospitality to preach at a guest over lunch even so meager a lunch as this he stood up and the rest of us got up also as we walked from the refectory jablonski said no hard feelings miss warshawski i like a good fighter sorry if i offended you in your role as a guest to my surprise i found myself smiling at him no hard feelings father im afraid i got a little carried away myself he shook hands with me briskly and walked down the hail in the opposite direction from carroll who said good im glad you and stephen found some common ground hes a good man just a little aggressive sometimes pelly frowned aggressive hes completely without he suddenly remembered to save group criticism for chapter and broke off sorry prior maybe i should go back to san tomásthats where my mind seems to be these days iv return engagement it was close to three when i threaded my way to my office in the south loop its in the pulteney building which is of the right vintage to be a national historic landmark i sometimes think it might even qualify if it ever acquired a management interested in looking after it buildings around there dont fare well theyre too close to the city lockup the slums the peepshows and the cheap bars so they attract clients like me detectives on shoestring budgets bail bondsmen inept secretarial services i put the car into a lot on adams and walked the block north to the pulteney the snow or rain or whatever it was had stopped while the skies were still sullen the pavement was almost dry and my beloved magli pumps were free from further insults someone had left a bourbon bottle in the lobby i picked it up and carried it with me to throw out in my office my longawaited oiltanker billionaire might show up and be put off by empty whiskey bottles in the lobby especially if he saw the brand the elevator working for a change clanked lugubriously down from the sixteenth floor i stuck the bottle under one arm and slid open an ancient brass grille with the other if i never worked out id stay in shape just by coming to the office every daybetween running the elevator repairing the toilet in the ladies room on the seventh floor and walking up and down the stairs between my fourthfloor office and the bathroom the elevator grudgingly stopped at the fourth floor my office was at the east end of the corridor the end where low rents sank even further because of the noise of the dan ryan l running directly underneath it a train was clattering by as i unlocked the door i spend so little time in my office that ive never put much into furnishing it the old wooden desk id bought at a police auction that was it except for two straightbacked chairs for clients my chair and an armygreen filing cabinet my one concession to grace was an engraving of the uffizi over the filing cabinet i picked up a weeks accumulation of mail from the floor and started opening it while i called my answering service two messages i didnt need to get in touch with hatfield hed called me and would see me in his office at nine the next morning i looked at a bill from a stationery company two hundred dollars for letterhead and envelopes i put it in the trash and dialed the fbi hatfield wasnt in of course i got his secretary yes please tell derek i wont be free tomorrow morning but three tomorrow afternoon will be fine she put me on hold while she checked his calendar i continued through the mail the society of young women business executives urged me to join among their many benefits was a group life and health insurance plan dereks secretary came back on the line and we dickered compromising on twothirty my second message was more of a surprise and much more welcome roger ferrant had called he was an englishman a reinsurance broker whom id met the previous spring his london firm had underwritten a ship that blew up in the great lakes i was investigating the disaster his firm was protecting its fiftymilliondollar investment we hadnt seen each other since a night when id fallen asleepto put it politelyacross from him at a posh steakhouse i reached him at his firms apartment in the hancock building roger what are you doing in chicago hello vic scupperfield plouder sent me over here for a few weeks can we have dinner is this my second chance or did you like my act the first time so well you want an encore he laughed neither how about it are you free this week anytime i told him i was free that very night and agreed to meet him at the hancock building for a drink at seventhirty i hung up in much better spiritsi deserved a reward for messing around in rosa s affairs i quickly sorted through the rest of my mail none of it needed answering one envelope actually contained a check for three hundred fifty dollars way to pick your clients vic i cheered silently before leaving i typed out a few bills on the old olivetti that had been my mothers she subscribed firmly to the belief that ibm had stolen both the executive and selectric designs from olivetti and would have been ashamed of me if id owned one of the itsybitsy machine companys models i quickly finished the bills stuffed them in envelopes turned out the lights and locked up outside the street was jammed with rushhour crowds i jostled and darted my way through them with the ease of long experience and retrieved the omega for another long slow drive through stopandgo traffic i bore the delays meekly swooping off the kennedy at belmont and detouring around to my bank with the check before going home in a sudden burst of energy i washed the dishes before changing clothes i kept on the yellow silk top found a pair of black velvet slacks in the closet and put on a blackandorange scarf eyecatching but not vulgar ferrant seemed to think so too he greeted me enthusiastically in the scupperfield plouder apartment at the hancock i remembered you were tough and funny vic but id forgotten how attractive you are if you like thin men which i do ferrant looked good himself he had on welltailored casual slacks with tiny pleats at the waist and a dark green sweater over a pale yellow shirt his dark hair which had been carefully combed when he opened the door fell into his eyes when i returned his hug he pushed it back with a characteristic gesture i asked what brought him to chicago business with ajax of course he led me into the living room a modernistically furnished square overlooking the lake a large orange couch with a glassandchrome coffee table in front of it was flanked by chrome chairs with black fabric seats i winced slightly hideous isnt it he said cheerfully if i have to stay in chicago more than a month im going to make them let me get my own apartment or at least my own furniture do you drink anything besides chateau st georges we have a complete liquor cabinet he swept open a blondandglass cabinet in one corner to display an impressive array of bottles i laughed id drunk two bottles of chateau st georges when we went to dinner together last may johnny walker black if they have it he rummaged through the cupboard found a halfused bottle and poured each of us a modest drink they must hate you in london to send you to chicago in january and if you have to stay through february youll know youre really on their hit list he grimaced ive been here before in winter it must explain why you american girls are so tough are they as hardboiled as you in south worse i assured him theyre tougher but they hide it under this veneer of soft manners so you dont know youve been hit until you start coming to i sat at one end of the orange couch he pulled up one of the chrome chairs close to me and leaned storklike over his drink his hair falling into his eyes again he explained that scupperfield plouder his london firm owned three percent of ajax were not the largest stockholder but were an important one so we keep a finger in the ajax pie we send our young fellows here for training and take some ajax people and teach them the london market believe it or not i was a young fellow once myself like many people in english insurance ferrant had started to work right after high school or what we think of as high school so at thirtyseven he had close to twenty years of experience in the topsyturvy reinsurance business im telling you that so you wont be so startled to hear im now a corporate officer pro tem he grinned a lot of people at ajax feel their noses bent because im so young but by the time they have my experience theyll be six or eight years older aaron carter the head of ajax s reinsurance division had died suddenly last month of a heart attack his most likely successor had left in september to join a rival company im just filling in until they can find someone with the right qualifications they need a good manager but they must find someone who knows the london market upside down he asked me what i was working on i had a few routine cases going but nothing interesting so i told him about my aunt rosa and the counterfeit securities id love to see her put away for securities fraud but im afraid shes just an innocent bystander on second thought no one who ever met rosa would think of her as innocent crimefree might be a better adjective i declined a second scotch and we put on our coats to go into the winter night a strong wind was blowing across the lake driving away the clouds but dropping the temperature down to the teens we held hands and half ran into its face to an italian restaurant four blocks away on seneca despite its location in the convention district the caffe firenze had a cheerful unpretentious interior i didnt know you were part italian when i made the reservation or i might have hesitated ferrant said as we turned our coats over to a plump young girl do you know this place is the food authentic ive never heard of it but i dont eat in this part of town too often as long as they make their own pasta we should be fine i followed the maître d to a booth against the far wall firenze avoided the redchecked cloth and chianti bottles so many italian restaurants display in chicago the polished wood table had linen placemats on it and a flower stuck in a tuscan pottery vase we ordered a bottle of ruffino and some pasticcini di spinaci enchanting the waiter by speaking italian it turned out ferrant had visited the country numerous times and spoke italian passably well he asked if id ever seen my mothers family there i shook my head my mothers from florence but her family was half jewishher mother came from a family of scholars in pitigliano they scattered widely at the outbreak of the warmy mother came here her brother went to africa and the cousins went every which way my grandmother died during the war gabriella went back once in to see her father but it was depressing he was the only member of her immediate family left in florence and she said he couldnt deal with the war or the changes it brought he kept pretending it was and the family still together i think hes still alive but i made a gesture of distaste my dad wrote him when my mother died and we got back a very unsettling letter inviting us to hear her sing ive never felt like dealing with him was your mother a singer then shed trained as one shed hoped to sing opera then when she had to flee the country she couldnt afford to continue her lessons she taught instead she taught me she hoped id pick it up and have her career for her but i dont have a big enough voice and i dont really like opera all that well ferrant said apologetically that he always had tickets for the royal opera and enjoyed it thoroughly i laughed i enjoy the staging and the sheervirtuosity i guess it isof putting an opera together its very strenuous work you know but the singing is too violent i prefer lieder my mother always saved enough money from the music lessons to take the two of us to a couple of lyric opera performances every fall then in the summer my dad would take me to see the cubs four or five times the lyric opera is better than the chicago cubs but i have to admit ive always gotten more pleasure from baseball we ordered dinnerfried artichoke and polio in galantina for me veal kidneys for ferrant the talk moved from baseball to cricket which ferrant played to his own childhood in highgate and finally to his career in scupperfield plouder as i was finishing my second cup of espresso he asked me idly if i followed the stock market at all i shook my head i dont have anything to invest why he shrugged ive only been here a week but i noticed in the wall street journal that ajaxs volume seems quite heavy compared to the other stockinsurance companies and the price seems to be going up great looks like your firm picked a winner he signaled for the check were not doing anything spectacular in the way of earnings not buying any companies or selling off any properties what else makes a share price go up sometimes institutional investors take a whimsical fancy to a stock insurance companies fared better during the last depression or recession or whatever than most businesses ajax is one of the biggestmaybe the funds and the other big investors are just playing it safe if you want i could give you the name of a broker i know she might have some other information maybe so we collected our coats and headed back into the wind it was blowing harder but fried artichokes and half a bottle of wine made it seem less penetrating ferrant invited me up for a brandy he turned the lamp by the bar on a low switch we could see the bottles but the garish furniture was mercifully muted i stood at the window looking down at the lake ice reflected the streetlights on lake shore drive by squinting i could make out the promontories farther south which held navy pier and mccormick place in the clear winter air the south works twelve miles away glowed red i used to live there in an illbuilt wooden row house made distinctive by my mothers artistry ferrant put his left arm around me and handed me a snifter of martell with the right i leaned back against him then turned and put both arms around him carefully holding the snifter away from his sweater it felt like cashmere and might not take kindly to brandy he was thin but wiry not just an operaloving beanpole he slid his hand under my silk top and stroked my back then began fumbling for the bra strap it opens in front i was having a hard time maintaining my balance and the snifter at the same time so i put the brandy down on the window ledge behind me ferrant had found the front hook i fumbled with the buttons on his pleated trousers making love standing up is not as easy as they make it look in the movies we slid down onto the thick orange carpet together v frustration we finished the brandy and the rest of the night in a kingsized bed with a blond scandinavian headboard when we woke up well after eight the next morning ferrant and i smiled at each other with sleepy pleasure he looked fresh and vulnerable with his dark hair hanging down in his dark blue eyes i put an arm around him and kissed him he kissed me back enthusiastically then sat up america is a country of terrible contrasts they give you these wonderful outsize beds which id give a months pay for back home then they expect you to hop out of them in the middle of the night to be at work in london i wouldnt dream of being in the city before ninethirty at the earliest but here my whole staff has already been at the office for half an hour id better get going i lay back in bed and watched him go through the male dressing ritual which ended when he had encased his neck meekly in a grayandburgundy choker he tossed me a blue paisley robe and i got up to drink a cup of coffee with him pleased with my foresight in changing my meeting with hatfield to the afternoon after ferrant left muttering curses against the american work ethic i phoned my answering service my cousin albert had called three times once late last night and twice this morning the second time hed left his office number my pleasure in the morning began to evaporate i put on last nights clothes frowning at myself in the wide mirrors that served as closet doors an outfit that looks sexy at night tends to appear tawdry in the morning i was going to have to change for my meeting with hatfield i might as well go home and do it before calling albert i paid dearly for parking the omega at the hancock building for fourteen hours that did nothing to cheer me up and i earned a whistle and a yell from the traffic cop at oak street for swinging around the turning traffic onto the lake shore drive underpass i sobered up then my father had drummed into my head at an early age the stupidity of venting anger with a moving car he was a policeman and had taken guns and cars very seriouslyhe spent too much time with the wreckage of those who used such lethal weapons in anger i stopped for a breakfast falafel sandwich at a storefront lebanese restaurant at halsted and wrightwood and ate it at the red lights the rest of the way up halsted the decimation of lebanon was showing up in chicago as a series of restaurants and little shops just as the destruction of vietnam had been visible here a decade earlier if you never read the news but ate out a lot you should be able to tell who was getting beaten up around the world from north avenue to fullerton halsted is part of the recently renovated north side where young professionals pay two hundred fifty thousand or more for chic brick townhouses four blocks farther north at diversey the rich have not yet stuck out rehabilitation tentacles most of the buildings like mine are comfortably rundown one advantage is the cheap rents the other is space to park on the street i stopped the omega in front of my building and went inside to change back into the navy walking suit for my meeting with hatfield by then j had delayed calling albert long enough i took a cup of coffee into the living room and sat in the overstuffed armchair while i phoned i studied my toes through my nylons maybe id paint the nails red i cant stand nail polish on my fingers but it might be sexy on my toes a woman answered alberts work number his secret lover i thought rosa assumes shes his secretary but he secretly buys her perfume and zabiglione i asked for albert she said in a nasal uneducated voice that mr vignelli was in conference and would i leave a message this is v i warshawski i said he wants to talk to me tell him this is the only time ill be available today she put me on hold i drank coffee and started an article in fortune on chicanery at citicorp i was delighted ive never forgiven them for taking two years to answer a billing complaint i was just getting into illegal currency manipulation when albert came on the line sounding more petulant than usual where have you been i raised my eyebrows at the mouthpiece at an allnight sex and dope orgy the sex was terrible but the coke was really great want to come next time i might have known youd just laugh instead of taking mamas problems seriously im not laughing albert if you read the paper you know how hard it is to get good coke these days but tell me has rosa s problem taken a turn for the worse just to show you i mean well i wont even charge you for my time waiting on hold i could visualize his fat round face puckered up in a fullscale pout as he breathed heavily into my ear at last he said angrily you went to st albert s priory yesterday didnt you i assented what did you find out that this is going to be incredibly tough to sort out our best hope is that the securities had already been faked before the priory got them im meeting with the fbi this afternoon and im going to see if theyre looking into that well mama has changed her mind she doesnt want you to investigate this after all i sat frozen for a few seconds while anger came to a focus inside my head what the hell do you mean albert im not a vacuum cleaner that you switch on and off at will you dont start me on an investigation then call up two days later to say youve changed your mind i could hear paper rustling in the background then albert said smugly your contract doesnt say that it just says termination of the case may be requested by either party whether the requested results are obtained or not regardless of the state of the investigation and regardless of whether either party disagrees with the results the fee and expenses incurred to the time of termination shall be paid if you send me a bill victoria ill pay promptly i could smell my brain burning albert when rosa called me on sunday she made it sound as though her suicide would be on my head if i didnt come out and help her whats happened since then she find a detective she likes better or did carroll call and promise her her job back if shed get me out of the investigation he said aloofly she told me last night she felt she was acting in a very unchristian way by getting so worried about this she knows her name will be cleared if its not shell bear it like a christian how noble i said sarcastically rosa as a bitter martyr is a pose i know well but the woman of sorrows is a new departure really victoria youre acting like an ambulance chaser just send me a bill at least i had the dubious satisfaction of hanging up first i sat fuming cursing rosa in italian then in english just like her to jack me around get me out to melrose park by screaming about gabriella and my duty to my dead mother if not to my live aunt send me off on a wildgoose chase then call the whole thing off i was strongly tempted to phone her and tell her once and for all exactly what i thought of her omitting no detail however slight i even looked her number up in my address book and started dialing before i realized the futility of such an act rosa was seventyfive she was not going to change if i couldnt accept that then i was doomed to be a victim of her manipulation forever i sat for a while with fortune open in my lap staring across the room at the gray day outside last nights strong wind had blown clouds in front of it across the lake what was rosa s real reason for wanting the investigation to stop she was cold angry vindictivea dozen disagreeable adjectives but not a schemer she wouldnt call a hated niece after a tenyear hiatus just to run me through hoops i looked up st albert s priory in the phone book and called carroll the call went through a switchboard i could see the ascetic young man at the reception desk reluctantly putting down his charles williams to answer the phone on the sixth ring picking up the book again before switching the call through i waited several minutes for the prior at last carrolls educated gentle voice came on the line this is v i warshawski father carroll he apologized for keeping me waiting hed been going over the household accounts with the head cook and the receptionist had paged the kitchen last no problem i said i wondered if youd spoken with my aunt since i saw you yesterday with mrs vignelli no why shes decided suddenly that she doesnt want any investigation into the counterfeit securities at least not on her behalf she seems to think that worrying about them is very unchristian i wondered if someone at the priory had been counseling her unchristian what a curious idea i dont know i suppose it would be if she got absorbed by this problem to the exclusion of other more fundamental matters but its very human to worry about a fraud that might harm your reputation and if you think of being christian as a way to be more fully human it would be a mistake to make someone feel guilty for having natural human feelings i blinked a few times so you didnt tell my aunt to drop the investigation he gave a soft laugh you didnt want me to build a watch you just wanted the time no i havent talked to your aunt but it sounds as though i should and did anyone else at the priory talk to her i mean not as far as he knew but hed ask around and get back to me he wanted to know if i had learned anything useful yet i told him id be talking to hatfield that afternoon and we hung up with mutual promises to stay in touch i puttered around the apartment hanging up clothes and putting a weeks accumulation of newspapers into a stack on the back porch where my landlords grandson would collect them for recycling i made myself a salad with cubes of cheddar cheese in it and ate it while flicking aimlessly through yesterdays wall street journal at twelvethirty i went down for the mail when you thought about it seriously rosa was an old lady she probably had imagined she could make her problem disappear by scowling at it the way shed made all her problems including her husband carl disappear she thought if she called me and ordered me to take care of it it would go away when the reality came a little closer after shed talked with me she decided it just wasnt worth the energy it would take to fight it my problem was that i was so wound up in all the old enmities that i suspected everything she did was motivated by hatred and a need for revenge ferrant called at one partly for some light chat and partly because of questions about ajax s stock one of my responsibilities seems to be our investment division so i got a call today from a chap named barrett in new york he called himself the ajax specialist at the new york stock exchange i know reinsurance not the us stock market or even the london stock market so i had some trouble keeping up with him but you remember i told you last night our stock seemed really active barrett called to tell me that called to let me know he was getting a lot of orders from a small group of chicago brokers who had never traded in ajax before nothing wrong with them you understand but he thought i should know about it and now i know about it but im not sure what if anything i should do so id like to meet that friend you mentionedthe one whos the broker agnes paciorek and i had met at the university of chicago when i was in law school and she was a math whiz turned mba we actually met at sessions of university women united she was a maverick in the graytailored world of mbas and wed remained good friends i gave roger her number after hanging up i looked up ajax in the wall street journal their range for the year went from to and they were currently trading at their high aetna and cigna the two largest stockinsurance carriers had similar bottom prices but their highs were about ten points below ajax yesterday theyd each had a volume of about three hundred thousand compared to ajax s which was almost a million interesting i thought about calling agnes myself but it was getting close to time for me to leave to meet hatfield i wrapped a mohair scarf around my neck pulled on some driving gloves and went back out into the wind two oclock is a good time to drive into the loop the traffic is light i made it to the federal building on dearborn and adams in good time left the omega in a selfpark garage across the street and walked in under the orange legs of the threestory calder designed for chicago s federal building we pride ourselves in chicago on our outdoor sculptures by famous artists my favorite is the bronze wind chimes in front of the standard oil building but i have a secret fondness for chagalls mosaics in front of the first national bank my artist friends tell me they are banal it was exactly twothirty when i reached the fbi offices on the eighteenth floor the receptionist phoned my name in to hatfield but he had to keep me waiting ten minutes just to impress me with how heavily chicago s crime rested on his shoulders i busied myself with a report for a client whose brotherinlaw had been pilfering supplies apparently out of bitterness from some longstanding family feud when hatfield finally stuck his head around the corner from the hall i affected not to hear him until the second time he called my name i looked up then and smiled and said i would be just a minute and carefully finished writing a sentence hello derek i said hows crime for some reason this jolly greeting always makes him grimace which is probably why i always use it his face has the bland handsomeness required by the fbi hes around six feet tall with a square build i could see him doing a hundred situps and pushups every morning with methodical uncomplaining discipline always turning down the second martini picking up only college girls to make sure someone with a modicum of brains would breathe in his ear how smart and how brave he was he was dressed today in a grayplaid suitmuted gray on slightly paler gray with the discreetest of blue stripes woven ina white shirt whose starch could probably hold up my brassiere for a week and a blue tie i dont have a lot of time warshawski he shot back a starched cuff and looked at his watch probably a rolex im flattered then that you wanted to make some of it available to me i followed him down the hail to an office in the southwestern corner hatfield was head of whitecollar crime for the chicago region obviously a substantial position judging by the furnitureall wood veneerand the location thats a nice view of the metropolitan lockup i said looking out at the triangular building it must be a great inspiration for you we dont send anyone there not even for overnight holding what about joey lombardo and allen dorfmann i thought thats where they were staying while they were on trial could you cut it out i dont know anything about dorfmann or lombardo i want to talk to you about the securities at st albert s great i sat down in an uncomfortable chair covered in tan naugahyde and put a look of bright interest on my face one of the things that occurred to me yesterday was that the certificates might have been forged before they were passed on to st albert s what do you know about the donor and his executors also it is possible some exdominican with a grudge could have been behind it do you have a trail on people who left the order in the last ten years im not interested in discussing the case with you warshawski were very well able to think of leads and follow them up we have an excellent record here in the bureau this forgery is a federal offense and i must request you to back out of it i leaned forward in my chair derek im not only willing but eager for you to solve this crime it will take a cast of thousands to sort it out you have that i dont im just here to make sure that a seventyfiveyearold woman doesnt get crushed by the crowd and id like to know what youve turned up on the possibilities i just mentioned to you were following all leads we argued it back and forth for several more minutes but he was adamant and i left emptyhanded i stopped in the plaza at a pay phone next to the praying mantis and dialed the heraldstar murray ryerson their chief crime reporter was in he and i have been friends sometimes lovers and easy rivals on the crime scene for years hi murray its v i is three oclock too early for a drink thats no question for the crime desk ill connect you with our etiquette specialist he paused am or pm now wiseass ill buy gosh vic you must be desperate cant do it now but how about meeting at the golden glow in an hour i agreed and hung up the golden glow is my favorite bar in chicago i introduced murray to it a number of years ago its tucked away in the dusable building an s skyscraper on federal and has the original mahogany bar that cyrus mccormick and judge gary probably used to lean over i went to my office to check mail and messages and at four walked back up the street to the bar sal the magnificent black bartender who could teach the chicago police a thing or two about crowd control greeted me with a smile and a majestic wave she wore her hair in an afro today and had on gold hoop earrings that hung to her shoulder a shiny blue evening gown showed her splendid cleavage and fivefooteleven frame to advantage she brought a double black label to my corner booth and chatted for a few minutes before getting back to the swelling group of early commuters murray came in a few minutes later his red hair more disheveled than usual from the january wind he had on a sheepskin coat and western boots the urban cowboy i said as much by way of greeting while a waitress took his order for beer sal only looks after her regular customers personally we talked about the poor showing the black hawks were making and about the greylord trial and whether mayor washington would ever subdue eddie vrdolyak if washington didnt have vrdolyak hed have to invent him murray said hes the perfect excuse for washington not being able to accomplish anything the waitress came over i declined a refill and asked for a glass of water murray ordered a second becks so what gives v i wont say it always spells trouble when you call up out of the blue but it usually means i end up being used murray i bet you a week of my pay that youve gotten more stories out of me than i have gotten clients out of you a week of your pay wouldnt keep me in beer whats up did you pick up a story last week about some forged securities in melrose park out in a dominican priory there dominican priory murray echoed since when have you started hanging around churches its a family obligation i said with dignity you may not know it but im half italian and we italians stick together through thick and thin you know the secret romance of the mafia and all that when one member of the family is in trouble the others rally around murray wasnt impressed you going to knock off somebody in the priory for the sake of your family honor no but i might take out derek hatfield in the cause murray supported me enthusiastically hatfield was as uncooperative with the press as he was with private investigators murray had missed the story of the faked certificates maybe it wasnt on the wires the feds can be pretty secretive about these thingsespecially derek think this prior would make a good interview maybe ill send out one of my babies to talk to him i suggested he send someone to interview rosa and gave him the list of possibilities id offered hatfield murray would work those into the story hed probably get someone to dig up the name of the original donor and get some public exposure on his heirs that would force hatfield to do something either eliminate them as being involved or publicly announce how old the dud certificates were them that eat cakes that the parsee man bakes make dreadful mistakes i muttered to myself what was that murray said sharply are you setting me up to do your dirty work for you warshawski i gave him a look that i hoped implied limpid innocence murray how you talk i just want to make sure the fbi doesnt railroad my poor frail old aunt i signaled to sal that we were ready to leave she runs a tab that she sends me once a month the only bill i ever pay on time murray and i moved up north for seafood at the red tide for eight dollars you can get a terrific whole dungeness crab which you eat sitting at a bar in a dark basement about half the size of my living room afterward i dropped murray at the fullerton l stop and went on home alone im past the age where bedhopping has much appeal vi uncle stefan s profession snow was falling the next morning as i made my fivemile run to belmont harbor and back the icefilled water was perfectly still across the breakwater i could see the lake motionless too not peaceful but sullenly quiet its angry gods held tightly by bands of cold a salvation army volunteer was stamping his feet and calling cheery greetings to commuters at the corner of belmont and sheridan he gave me a smiling god bless you as i jogged past must be nice to have everything so simple and peaceful what would he do with an aunt rosa was there any smile broad enough to make her smile back i stopped at a little bakery on broadway for a cup of cappuccino and a croissant as i ate at one of the spindlylegged tables i pondered my next actions id met with hatfield yesterday more out of bravado than anything elseit brought me some sort of perverse pleasure to irritate his wellpressed brooks brothers facade but he wasnt going to do anything for me i didnt have the resources to pry into the dominicans anyway even if murray ryerson turned something up what would i do about it if rosa didnt want me investigating wasnt my obligation finished with her abrupt command to stop i realized that i was carrying on this internal monologue as an argument with gabriella who didnt seem pleased with me for bugging out so early goddamn it gabriella i swore silently why did you make me give you that crazy promise she hated you why do i have to do anything for her if my mother were alive she would shrivel me on the spot for swearing at her and then turn fierce intelligent eyes on me so rosa fired you did you go to work only because she hired you i slowly finished my cappuccino and went back out into a minor blizzard strictly speaking rosa had not fired me albert had called to say she didnt want me on the job any longer but was that albert or rosa speaking i should at least get that much clear before deciding what else to do which meant another trip to melrose park not todaythe roads would be impossible with the snow traffic creeping people falling into ditches but tomorrow would be saturday even if the weather continued bad there wouldnt be much traffic at home i peeled off layers of shirts and leggings and soaked in a hot tub for a while being selfemployed i can hold my review of operations and management anywhere this means time spent thinking in the bath is time spent working unfortunately my accountant doesnt agree that this makes my water bill and bath salts tax deductible my theory of detection resembles julia childs approach to cooking grab a lot of ingredients from the shelves put them in a pot and stir and see what happens id stirred at the priory and at the fbi maybe it was time to let things simmer a bit and see if the smell of cooking gave me any new ideas i put on a wool crepedechine pantsuit with a highnecked redstriped blouse and lowheeled black boots that should be warm enough to walk in if i got stuck in the snow someplace wrapping my big mohair scarf around my head and neck i went back into the storm adding the omega to the queue of slowly moving sliding cars trying to get onto lake shore drive at belmont i crept downtown barely able to see the cars immediately next to me and slithered off at jackson leaving the omega next to a snowdrift behind the art institute i trudged the six blocks to the pulteney building which looked worse than usual in the winter weather tenants had tracked snow and mud into the lobby tom czarnik the angry old man who calls himself the building superintendent refuses to mop the floor on stormy mornings his theory is that it will just get nasty again at lunch so why bother i should applaud a man whose housekeeping views coincide so closely with mine but i cursed him under my breath as my boots slid in the lobby slush the elevator wasnt working today either so i stomped up four flights of stairs to my office after turning on the lights and picking up the mail from the floor i phoned agnes paciorek at her brokers office on hold while she sold a million shares of at t i looked through bills and pleas for charity nothing that wouldnt wait until next month at last her brisk deep voice came on the line agnes its v i warshawski we exchanged pleasantries for a few minutes then i explained who roger ferrant was and said id given him her number i know he called yesterday afternoon were meeting for lunch at the mercantile club are you downtown want to join us sure great you find anything unusual depends on your definition brokers dont think buying and selling stock is unusual but you might ive got to run see you at one the mercantile club sits on top of the old bletchley iron building down in the financial district its a businessmens club which reluctantly opened its doors to women when mrs gray became president of the university of chicago since most of the trustees meetings were held there having admitted one woman they found others sneaking through in her wake the food is excellent and the service impeccable although some of the old waiters refuse to work tables with women guests ferrant was already sitting by the fire in the reading room where the maître d sent me to wait for agnes he looked elegant in navyblue tailoring and stood up with a warm smile when he saw me come into the room agnes invited me to gatecrash i hope you dont object by no means you look very smart today how are your forgeries coming i told him about my useless interview with hatfield and the dominicans dont know anything either at least not about forgery i need to start at the other endwho could have created them to begin with agnes came up behind me created what she turned to ferrant and introduced herself a short compact dynamo in a brownplaid suit whose perfect stitching probably required an eighthundreddollar investment half a days work for agnes she shepherded us into the dining room where the maître d greeted her by name and seated us by a window we looked down at the south branch of the chicago river and ordered drinks i seldom drink whiskey in the middle of the day and asked for oloroso sherry ferrant ordered a beer while agnes had perrier with limethe exchanges didnt close for almost two hours and she believes sober brokers trade better once we were settled she repeated her initial question i told her about the forgery as far as i know the fort dearborn trust discovered it because the serial numbers hadnt been issued yet the fbi is being stuffy and closemouthed but i know the forgery was pretty high qualitygood enough to pass a superficial test by the auditors anyway id like to talk to someone who knows something about forgingtry to find out whod have the skill to create that good a product agnes cocked a thick eyebrow are you asking me i just sell em i dont print em rogers problem is the type of thing im equipped to handle maybe she turned to ferrant why dont you tell me what you know at this point he shrugged thin shoulders i told you on the phone about the call from our specialist in new york andy barrett maybe you can start by telling me what a specialist is he doesnt work for ajax i take it no specialists are members of the new york stock exchangebut theyre not brokers for the public usually theyre members of a firm who get a franchise from the exchange to be specialistspeople who manage buyandsell orders so business keeps flowing barrett makes markets in your stock someone wants to sell a thousand shares of ajax they call me i dont go down to the floor of the chicago exchange waving em around until a buyer happens alongi phone our broker in new york and he goes to barretts post on the floor barrett buys the shares and makes a match with someone whos looking for a thousand shares if too many people are unloading ajax at once and no one wants to buy it he buys on his own accounthes got an ethical obligation to make markets once in a great while if the market gets completely haywire hell ask the exchange to halt trading in the stock until things shake out she paused to give us time to order dover sole for me rare steaks for her and roger she lit a cigarette and began punctuating her comments with stabs of smoke from what i gather something of the opposite kind has been going on with ajax the last few weeks theres been a tremendous amount of buying about seven times the normal volume enough that the price is starting to go up not a lot insurance companies arent glamor investments so you can have heavy action without too much notice being taken did barrett give you the names of the brokers placing the orders yes they didnt mean anything to me hes sending a list in the mail i wondered if it wouldnt be too great an imposition miss paciorek whether youd look at the names when i get them see if they tell you anything also what should i do to my annoyance agnes lit a second cigarette no no imposition and please call me agnes miss paciorek sounds too much like the north shore i guess what were assuming to put the evil thought into blunt words is that someone may be trying a covert takeover bid if thats true they cant have got too faranyone with five percent or more of the stock has to file with the sec and explain whats he doing with it or she she grinned at me how much stock would someone need to take over ajax i asked the food arrived and agnes mercifully stubbed out her cigarette depends who besides your firm owns sizable chunks ferrant shook his head i dont really know gordon firth the chairman some of the directors we own three percent and edelweiss the swiss reinsurers holds four percent i think theyre the largest owners firth maybe owns two some of the other directors may have one or two percent so your present management owns around fifteen percent someone could carry a lot of weight with sixteen percent not guaranteed but that would be a good place to start especially if your management wasnt aware it was happening i did some mental arithmetic fifty million shares outstanding sixteen percent would be eight million youd need about five hundred million for a takeover then she thought for a minute thats about right but keep in mind that you dont need to come up with that much capital once youve bought a large block you can leverage the rest put your existing shares up as collateral for a loan to buy more shares then you leverage those and keep going before you know it youve bought yourself a company thats oversimplified of course but thats the basic idea we ate in silence for a minute then ferrant said what can i do to find out for sure agnes pursed her square face as she thought about it you could call the sec and ask for a formal investigation then youd be sure of getting the names of the people who are really doing the buying thats an extreme step though once theyre called in theyre going to scrutinize every transaction and every broker youd want to talk to your board before you did thatsome of your directors might not relish having all their stock transactions revealed to the piercing light of day well short of that every brokerage firm has what we call a compliance officer once you get the list of firms from barrett you can try calling them and find out on whose behalf theyre trading theres no reason for them to tell you thoughand nothing illegal about trying to buy a company the waiters hovered around our table dessert coffee ferrant absentmindedly selected a piece of apple pie do you think theyd talk to you missagnes the compliance officers i mean as i told vic im way out of depth with this stockmarket stuff even if you coached me in what to ask i wouldnt know if the answers i was getting were right agnes put three lumps of sugar in her coffee and stirred vigorously it would be unusual let me see the list of brokers before i let you know one way or another what you could do is call barrett and ask him to send you a list of the names the shares were registered in when he sold them if i know anyone really welleither the brokers or the customersi could probably call them she looked at her watch ive got to get back to the office she signaled for a waiter and signed the bill you two stay though ferrant shook his head id better call london its after eight theremy managing director should be home i left with them the snow had stopped the sky was clear and the temperature falling one of the bank thermometers showed degrees i walked with roger as far as ajax as we said goodbye he invited me to go to a movie with him saturday night i accepted then went on down wabash to my office to finish the report on pilfered supplies during the slow drive home that night i pondered how to find someone who knew about forging securities forgers were engravers gone wrong and i did know one engraver at least i knew someone who knew an engraver dr charlotte herschel lotty to me had been born in vienna grew up in london where she ultimately received her doctor of medicine degree from london university and lived about a mile from me on sheffield avenue her fathers brother stefan an engraver had immigrated to chicago in the twenties when lotty decided to come to the states in she picked chicago partly because her uncle stefan lived here i had never met himshe saw little of him just saying it made her feel more rooted to have a relative in the area my friendship with lotty goes back a long way to my student days at the university of chicago when she was one of the physicians working with an abortion underground i was involved in she knew agnes paciorek from that time too i stopped at a treasure island on broadway for groceries and wine it was sixthirty when i got home and phoned lotty she had just come in herself from a long day at the clinic she runs on sheffield near her apartment she greeted my offer of dinner enthusiastically and said she would be over after a hot bath i cleaned up the worst ravages in my living room and kitchen lotty never criticizes my housekeeping but she is scrupulously tidy herself and it didnt seem fair to drag her out for a brainpicking session on such a cold night then have her spend it in squalor chicken garlic mushrooms and onions sautéed in olive oil then flamed with brandy made an easy attractive stew a cup of ruffino finished the dish by the time i had water hot for fettucine the doorbell rang lotty came up the stairs briskly and greeted me with a hug a lifesaver that you called my dear it was a long very depressing day a child dead of meningitis because the mother would not bring her in she hung an amulet around her neck and thought it would bring down a fever of fortyone degrees there are three sisters we put them in st vincent s for observation but my god i held her for a minute before we went into the apartment asking if she wanted a drink lotty reminded me that alcohol is poison for extreme situations she believes brandy is permissible but she did not consider todays woes extreme i poured myself a glass of ruffino and put on water for her coffee we ate by candlelight in the dining room while lotty unburdened herself by the time we had finished the salad she felt more relaxed and asked me what i was working on i told her about rosa and the dominicans and alberts phoning me to tell me the whole thing was off the candlelight was reflected in her black eyes as she narrowed them at me and what are you trying to prove by continuing it was albert who phoned rosa may not agree i said defensively yes your aunt dislikes you shes decidedfor whatever reasonto discontinue the effort to protect herself so what are you doing proving that you are tougher or smarter or just plain better than she is i thought it over lotty is sometimes about as pleasant as a can opener but she braces me i know myself better when i talk to lotty you know i dont spend a lot of time thinking about rosa its not as though shes an obsession she doesnt control my head that much but i feel very protective of my mother rosa hurt her and that makes me angry if i can show rosa she was wrong to stop the investigation that i can solve this problem despite failure by the fbi and the sec ill have proof that she was wrong about everything and shell have to believe it i laughed and finished my glass of wine she wont of course my rational self knows that but my feeling self thinks otherwise lotty nodded perfectly logical does your rational self have any way of solving this problem there are lots of things the fbi can do that i cant because they have so much manpower but one thing i could look into is who actually did the forgeries let derek concentrate on who planted them and which exdominicans are living in luxury i dont know any forgers but it occurred to me that a forger is really a species of engraver and i wondered about your uncle stefan lotty had been watching me with an expression of shrewd amusement now her face changed suddenly her mouth set and her black eyes narrowed is this an inspired guess or have you spent your spare time investigating me i looked at her in bewilderment you wondered why you never met my uncle stefan although he is my only relative living in chicago no i said doggedly i never thought about it for a minute youve never met my aunt rosa even if she werent a virago youd probably never have met herfriends seldom have much in common with relatives she continued to stare searchingly at me i felt very hurt but could think of nothing to say that would bridge the gulf of lotty s suspicious silence the last time i had felt this way was the night i realized the man i had married and thought i loved was as foreign to me as yasir arafat could a friendship evaporate in the same mist as a marriage my throat felt tight but i forced myself to talk lotty youve known me for close to twenty years and ive never done anything behind your back if you think ive started now that sentence wasnt going in the right direction theres something you dont want me to know about your uncle you dont have to tell me carry it to the grave with you but dont act as though everything you know about me suddenly has no foundation a light bulb went on over my head oh no dont tell me your uncle really is a forger the set look held in lottys face for a few seconds then cracked into a wry smile you are right vic about my uncle and about you and me im truly sorry my dear i wont try to make excusesthere are none but stefan when the war ended i found there was left of my family only my brother and the distant cousins who had taken us in during the war hugomy brotherand i spent what time and money we had searching for relatives and we found papas brother stefan when hugo decided to move to montreal i came to chicago i had an opportunity for a surgical residency at northwestern too good a chance to turn down she made a throwaway gesture with her left hand so i set out to find uncle stefan and discovered him in a federal prison at fort leavenworth currency was his specialty although he had a social conscience he was also forging passports for sale to the many europeans trying to come to america at the time she grinned at me the old lotty grin i leaned across the table and squeezed her hand she returned the pressure but went on talking detectives and doctors both know the value of talking i went to see him hes likable like my father but without the moral foundation and i let him stay with me for six months when he was released that was i was his only family too he got a job doing custom work for a jewelerafter all he wasnt a robber so they werent afraid hed lift the sterling as far as i know hes never stepped over the edge again but naturally i havent asked naturally not well i will try to find a different engraver lotty smiled again oh no why not call him hes eightytwo but he still has all his wits and some besides he might be the one person who could help you she would talk to him the next day and arrange a time when i could have tea with him we had coffee and pears in the living room and played scrabble as usual lotty won vii christian charity the air was clear and cold the next morning and a bright winter sun cast a strong glare back from the drifts lining the roads halsted had not been plowed at least not north of belmont and the omega jumped skittishly from rut to rut on the way to the kennedy expressway and melrose park i put on sunglasses and turned on wfmt satie unbearable i turned it off again and started singing myselfnothing very noble just the theme from big john and sparky if you go down to the woods today youd better not go alone it was a little after ten when i turned north on mannheim and made my way to rosa s in melrose park even the side streets had been carefully cleaned maybe there was something to be said for suburban living after all the path leading to her side door had been shoveled neatly not just a path half a person wide like my building super believed in there was even something to be said for living with albert which just went to show albert came to the door the light was behind me and i could see his petulant face through the thick screen he was surprised and angry what are you doing here albert if rosa has stressed it once shes stressed a hundred times the importance of families sticking together im sure shed be shocked to hear you greet me so ungraciously mama doesnt want to talk to you i thought i made that clear the other day i pulled the screen door open nope you made it clear you didnt want me talking to her thats by no means the same thing albert probably outweighs me by eighty pounds which may be why he thought it would be easy to push me back out the door i twisted his left arm up behind him and circled around past him i hadnt felt so good in weeks rosa s harsh voice wafted down the dim hail from the kitchen demanding to know who was at the door and why albert didnt shut it didnt he know what they were paying to heat this house i followed the voice albert walking sulkily behind me its me rosa i said walking into the kitchen i thought we ought to have a little talk about theology rosa was chopping vegetables presumably for soup since a shinbone was browning in oil on the stove the kitchen still had its old s sink the stove and refrigerator were old too small white appliances set against unpainted walls rosa put the pairing knife down on the counter with a snap turned full face and hissed angrily i have no wish to talk to you victoria i pulled a kitchen chair around and sat backward on it leaning my chin on its back not good enough rosa im not a television that you turn on and off at whim a week ago you called me and played a tremolo passage on the family violin and dragged me out here against my will on thursday suddenly your morals or ethics got the better of you you looked at the lilies of the field and decided that it was wrong to have me toiling and spinning over your innocence i looked at her earnestly rosa it sounds beautiful it just doesnt sound like you she drew her thin mouth into a tight line how should you know you were never even baptized i would not expect you to know how a christian behaves well you could be right the modern world offers few opportunities to see one in action but you dont understand you tugged hard on my emotions to get me out here its going to be even harder to get rid of me if you had picked a private investigator out of the yellow pages one who had no connection with you it would be different but you insisted on me and its me youve got rosa sat down her eyes blazed fiercely i have changed my mind that is my right you should not do anything more i want to know something rosa was this your own idea or did someone else suggest it to you her eyes darted around the kitchen before she spoke naturally i discussed it with albert naturally your righthand man and confidant but who else no one no rosa that little pause and the look around the room says the opposite it wasnt father carroll unless he lied to me on thursday who was it she said nothing who are you protecting rosa is it someone who knows about these forgeries still silence i see you know the other day i was trying to figure an approach that i was better equipped to handle than the fbi i came up with one but youve just offered me a better ill get some surveillance on you and find out just who you talk to the hate in her face made me recoil physically so what i should have expected from the daughter of a whore without thinking i leaned forward and slapped her on the mouth slyness joined the hate in her face but she was too proud to rub her mouth where id hit it you would not love her so much if you knew the truth thanks rosa ill be back next week for another lesson in christian conduct albert had stood silently in the kitchen doorway throughout our altercation he walked me to the outer door the smell of burning olive oil followed us down the hall you really should knock it off victoria shes pretty worried why do you stick up for her albert she treats you like a retarded fouryearold stop being such a goddamned mamas boy go get yourself a girlfriend get your own apartment no ones going to marry you while youre living with her he mumbled something inaudible and slammed the door behind me i got into the car and sat heaving for several minutes how dared she she had not only insulted my mother she had manipulated me into hitting her i couldnt believe id done it i felt sick from rage and selfdisgust but the last thing i would ever do was apologize to the old witch on that defiant note i put the car into gear and headed for the priory father carroll was hearing confessions and would be busy for an hour i could wait if i wanted i declined leaving a message that i would call later in the weekend and headed back to the city i was in no mood to do anything but fight back at the apartment i got out my december expenses but couldnt keep my mind on them finally i gathered all my stale clothes and took them down to the washing machine in the basement i changed the sheets and vacuumed and still felt terrible at last i gave work up as a bad idea dug my ice skates out of the closet and drove over to the park at montrose harbor they flood an outdoor rink there and i joined a crowd of children and skated with more energy than skill for over an hour afterward i treated myself to a late light lunch at the dortmunder restaurant in the basement of the chesterton hotel it was close to three when i got home again tired but with the anger washed out of me the phone was ringing as i started undoing the upper of the two locks on my door my fingers were stiff with cold i heard the phone ring eleven times but by the time i got the bottom lock open and sprinted across the hall to the living room the caller had hung up i was meeting roger ferrant for a movie and dinner at six a short nap and a long bath would restore me and even leave a little time to work on my bills lotty called at four just as i had the taps running to ask if i wanted to go with her to uncle stefans tomorrow at threethirty we arranged for me to pick her up at three i was lying well submerged and slightly comatose when the phone began to ring again at first i let it go then thinking it might be ferrant calling to change plans i leaped from the tub trailing a cloud of chanel bubbles behind me but the phone had stopped again when i reached it cursing the perversity of fate i decided i had put off work long enough got a robe and slippers and started in earnest by five i had my yearend statement almost complete and decembers bills ready to mail to clients and i went to change with a feeling of awesome virtue i put on a full peasant skirt which hit me midcalf kneehigh red cavalier boots and a fullsleeved white blouse ferrant and i were meeting at the sullivan for the six oclock showing of terms of endearment he was waiting for me when i got there a courtesy i appreciated and kissed me enthusiastically i declined popcorn and coke and we spent an agreeable two hours with half our attention on shirley maclaine and half on each others bodies making sure that various parts abandoned on thursday morning were still where they belonged the movie over we agreed to complete the survey at my apartment before eating dinner we walked lazily up the stairs together arm in arm i had just gotten the bottom lock unfastened when the phone started to ring again this time i reached it by the fourth ring miss warshawski the voice was strange a neutral voice no accent a hardtodefine pitch yes im glad to find you home at last youre investigating the forged securities at st albert s arent you who is this i demanded sharply a friend miss warshawski you might almost call me an amicus curiae he gave a ghostly selfsatisfied laugh dont go on miss warshawski you have such beautiful gray eyes i would hate to see them after someone poured acid on them the line went dead i stood holding the phone staring at it in disbelief ferrant came over to me what is it vic i put the receiver down carefully if you value your life stay away from the moor at night i tried for a light note but my voice sounded weak even to me roger started to put an arm around me but i shook it off gently i need to think this out on my own for a minute theres liquor and wine in the cupboard built into the diningroom wall why dont you fix us something he went off to find drinks and i sat and looked at the phone some more detectives get a large volume of anonymous phone calls and letters and youd be a quick candidate for a straitjacket if you took them very seriously but the menace in this mans voice had been very credible acid in the eyes i shivered id stirred a lot of pots and now one of them was boiling but which one could poor shriveled aunt rosa have gone demented and hired someone to threaten me the idea made me laugh a little to myself and helped restore some mental balance if not rosa though it had to be the priory and that was just as laughable hatfield would like to see me out of the case but this wasnt his kind of maneuver roger came in with a couple of glasses of burgundy youre white vic who was that on the phone i shook my head i wish i knew his voice was soso careful without accent like distilled water someone wants me away from the forgeries bad enough to threaten to pour acid on me he was shocked vic you must call the police this is horrible he put an arm around me this time i didnt push him away the police cant do anything roger if i called and told themdo you have any idea of the number of crank calls that are made in this city in any one day but they could send someone around to keep an eye on you sure if they didnt have eight hundred murders to investigate and ten thousand armed robberies and a few thousand rapes the police cant look after me just because someone wants to make crank phone calls he was troubled and asked if i wanted to move in with him until things quieted down thanks roger i appreciate the offer very much but now i have someone worried enough to do something if i stay here i may just catch him doing it wed both lost our interest in lovemaking we finished the wine and i made us a frittata roger spent the night i lay awake until after three listening to his quiet even breathing trying to place that accentless voice wondering who i knew who threw acid viii at the old forge sunday morning i drove the mile to lottys through a succession of residential oneway streets turning often waiting on the blind side of intersections no one was following me whoever had called last night wasnt that interested yet lotty was waiting for me in her building entryway she looked like a little elf live feet of compact energy wrapped in a bright green loden jacket and some kind of outlandish crimson hat her uncle lived in skokie so i went north to irving park road and over to the kennedy the main expressway north as we drove past the grimy factories lining the expressway a few snowflakes began dancing on the windshield the cloud cover remained high so we didnt seem to be in for a heavy storm turning right on the edens fork to the northeast suburbs i abruptly told lotty about the phone call id had last night its one thing for me to risk my life just to prove a point but its not fair to drag you and your uncle into it as well the odds are it was just an angry call but if notyou need to know the risk ahead of time and make your own decision we were approaching the dempster interchange lotty told me to exit east and drive to crawford avenue it wasnt until id followed her directions and we were moving past the imposing homes on crawford that she answered i cant see that youre asking us to risk anything you may have a problem and it may be exacerbated by your talking to my uncle but as long as he and i dont tell anyone youve been to see him i dont think itll matter if he thinks of anything you can usewell i would not permit you in my operating room telling me what was and what was not too great a risk and i wont do that with you either we parked in front of a quiet apartment building lottys uncle met us in the doorway of his apartment he carried his eightytwo years well looking a bit like laurence olivier in marathonman he had lottys bright black eyes they twinkled as he kissed her he half bowed shaking hands with me so two beautiful ladies decide to cheer up an old mans sunday afternoon come in come in he spoke heavily accented english unlike lotty who had learned it as a girl we followed him into a sitting room crammed with furniture and books he ushered me ceremoniously to a stuffed chintz armchair he and lotty sat on a horsehair settee at a right angle to it in front of them on a mahogany table was a coffee service the silver glowed with the soft patina of age and the coffee pot and serving pieces were decorated with fantastic creatures i leaned forward to look at it more closely there were griffins and centaurs nymphs and unicorns uncle stefan beamed with pleasure at my interest it was made in vienna in the early eighteenth century when coffee was first becoming the most popular drink there he poured cups for lotty and me offered me thick cream and lifted a silver cover by its nymphhandle to reveal a plate of pastries so rich they bordered on erotic now you are not one of those ladies who eats nothing for fear of ruining her beautiful figure are you good american girls are too thin arent they lottchen you should prescribe sacher torte for all your patients he continued speaking about the healthful properties of chocolate for several minutes i drank a cup of the excellent coffee and ate a piece of hazelnut cake and wondered how to change the subject gently however after pouring more coffee and urging more cakes on me he abruptly took the plunge himself lotty says you wish to talk about engraving yes sir i told him briefly about aunt rosas problems i own a hundred shares of acorn a young computer company given me in payment for an industrial espionage case id handled for them i pulled the certificate out of my handbag and passed it to uncle stefan i think most shares are printed on the same kind of paper im wondering how difficult it would be to forge something like this well enough to fool someone who was used to looking at them he took it silently and walked over to a desk that stood in front of a window it too was an antique with ornately carved legs and a green leather top he pulled a magnifying glass from a narrow drawer in the middle turned on a bright desk lamp and scrutinized the certificate for more than a quarter of an hour it would be difficult he pronounced at last perhaps not quite as difficult as forging paper money successfully he beckoned me over to the desk lotty came too peering over his other shoulder he began pointing out features of the certificate to me the paper stock to begin with was a heavygrade parchment not easy to obtain and it has a characteristic weave to fool an expert you would need to make sure of this weave they make the paper like this on purpose you see just to make the poor forgers life more difficult he turned to grin wickedly at lotty who frowned in annoyance then you have the logo of the issuing company and several signatures each with a stamp over it it is the stamp that is most difficult that is almost impossible to replicate without smearing the ink of the signature have you seen those fake shares of your aunts do you know what they did wrong i shook my head all i know is that the serial numbers were ones that the issuing companies had never used i dont know about these other features he snapped off the desk lamp and handed me back the certificate its a pity you havent seen them also if you knew how the forger intended to use them that would tell you how good howconvincingthey had to be ive thought about that the only real use for a phony share would be as collateral theyre always examined closely by the banks at the time of sale in this case though some real stocks were stolen so the thief just needed to convince some priests and their auditors that they still had their assets that way it wouldnt be like an ordinary theft where youd know just when the stuff was taken and who had had access to it since you last saw it well im sorry i can tell you nothing else young lady but surely you will have another piece of cake before you go i sat back down and took a piece of apricotalmond torte my arteries were screaming in protest as i ate a bite actually sir there is something else you might know the forgeries could have been done anytime in the last ten years but suppose for the sake of argument they were made relatively recently how could i find out who did them assuming he or sheworked in the chicago area he was gravely silent for a long minute then he spoke quietly lottchen has told you about my past how i created twentydollar bills masterpieces really he said with a return of his more jovial manner considering i made all my own equipment there are really two breeds of forger miss warshawski independent artisans like me and those who work for an organization now here you have someone who has done the work at another persons request unless you believe that the same person who created the new stole and disposed of the old really what you want is not thethe master engraver but his client am i not right i nodded well i cannot help you with finding this engraver we independent artisans tend not toto make public our handiwork and i am not part of a network of forgers but perhaps i could help you find the client how lotty asked before i could by making up such a piece and letting it be known that i have one for sale i thought about it it might work but youd be running a terrible risk even with my most persuasive intervention it would be hard to convince the feds that your motives were pure and remember that the people who ordered these things might be violentive already had a threatening phone call if they found out you were doublecrossing them their justice would be even harder to take than a stint at fort leavenworth uncle stefan leaned over and clasped one of my hands young lady i am an old man although i enjoy life my fear of death has passed and such an occupation would be rejuvenating for me lotty interrupted with some vigorous arguments of her own their discussion got quite heated and moved into german until lotty said disgustedly in english on your grave we will put a marker reading he died stubborn after that uncle stefan and i discussed practical details he would need to keep my acorn certificate and get some others he would find any supplies he needed and send me the bills to be on the safe side in case my anonymous caller really meant business he wouldnt phone me if he needed to talk to me hed run an ad in the heraldstar unfortunately he couldnt promise very speedy results you must resign yourself to weeks perhaps many weeks not days my dear miss warshawski lotty and i left amid mutual protestations of goodwillat least between uncle stefan and me lotty was a little frosty as we got into the car she said i suppose i could call you in to consult on geriatric cases you could think of criminal enterprises that would bring adventure and the flush of youth back to people worried about making ends meet on social security i drove over to route the old highway connecting chicago and the north shore nowadays it offered a quiet pretty drive past stately homes and the lake im sorry lotty i didnt go there with anything more than the hope that your uncle might know whos who in chicago forging personally i think his idea is a long shot if he can do the job and make some contacts how likely is it hell come up with the right people but its a clever idea and better than anything i can think of anyway id certainly rather have a charming criminal as my only chicago relative than an honest bitch if youre too upset ill trade you rosa for stefan lotty laughed at that and we made the drive back to chicago peaceably stopping on the far north side for a thai dinner i dropped lotty at her apartment and went on home to call my answering service a father carroll had phoned and so too had murray ryerson from the star i tried the priory first they told me you were by here yesterday miss warshawski im sorry i couldnt see you then i dont know if youve heard but we had some rather extraordinary news this morning we found the original certificates i stood momentarily stunned that is extraordinary i finally said where did they turn up they were on the altar this morning when we began celebrating mass since well over a hundred people had legitimate business in the priory chapel on sunday mornings no one could possibly say who might or might not have gone there early and returned the stolen goods yes the fbi had sent someone out to take possession but hatfield had called at three to say that these shares were genuine the fbi was keeping them awhile to run lab tests on them and carroll didnt know now if theyd ever get them back out of curiosity i asked if rosa had been to mass that morning yes and looking grimly at anyone who tried to talk to her carroll assured me her son stayed away but he usually did as we started to hang up he remembered my question about whether anyone at the priory had talked to rosa about pulling out of the investigation he had asked the fathers whom rosa would most likely listen to and none of them had talked to her i called murray next he wasnt as full of the returned certificates as i expected more recent news occupied his attention i talked to hatfield twenty minutes ago you know what an arrogant uncommunicative bastard he is well i couldnt get shit out of him about the returned stocks and i asked every question in my arsenal and more besides i got him in a corner finally and he as good as admitted the fbi is dropping the investigation putting it on the back burner he said cliché hack that he is but that means dropping it well if the real things have turned up they dont need to worry so much yeah and i believe in the easter bunny come on vic okay wordlywise newspaperman whos applying the screws the fbi isnt scared of anyone except maybe j edgars ghost if you think someones backing them off who is it vic you dont believe that any more than i do no organization is exempt from pressure if you know where the right nerves are if you know something youre not telling illill he broke off unable to think of an effective threat and another thing what was that crap you gave me about your poor frail old aunt i sent one of my babies out to talk to her yesterday afternoon and some fat goon who claimed he was the son practically broke my gals foot in the door then the vignelli woman joined him in the hall and treated her to some highlevel swearing on newspapers in general and the star in particular i laughed softly okay rosa two points for our side goddamn it vic whyd you sic me onto her i dont know i said irritably to see if shed be as nasty to anyone else as she is to me to see if you could learn something she wouldnt tell me i dont know im sorry your poor little protégé had her feelings hurt but shes going to have to learn to take it if she plans to survive in your game i started to tell murray that i too had been warned off the investigation then held back maybe someone had brushed back the fbi and maybe that someone had called me as well if the fbi respected them so should i i bade murray an absentminded goodnight and hung up ix final trade the snow held off overnight i got up late to do my virtuous five miles running north and west through the neighborhood i didnt think anyone was watching me but if they were it was sensible to vary my route a little later i followed the same procedure in my car looping the omega north and west through the side streets then hitting the kennedy from the west at lawrence i seemed to be clean thirty miles south on the expressway past the city limits is the town of hazel crest you cannot buy handguns in chicago but a number of suburbs do a flourishing legal business in them at rileys on st street i showed them my private investigators license and my certificate that proved id passed the states exam for private security officers these enabled me to waive the threeday waiting period and also to register the gun in chicago private citizens cant register handguns here unless they bought them before i spent the rest of the day finishing up a few outstanding problemsserving a subpoena to a bank vicepresident hiding unconvincingly in rosemont and showing a small jewelry store how to install a security system and i kept wondering who was backing off first rosa and then the fbi it wouldnt help to park in front of rosa s and watch her what i really needed was a tap on her phone and that was beyond my resources i tried thinking about it from the other end who had i talked to that was easy the prior the procurator and the student master id also told ferrant and agnes what i was doing none of these five seemed a likely candidate for threatening either me or the fbi of course jablonski could be that type of antiabortion fanatic who thinks its a worse sin to have an abortion than to kill someone who promotes freedom of choice but he hadnt struck me as particularly crazy despite pellys protests the catholic church does carry a lot of clout in chicago but even if it could pressure the fbi out of the investigation why would it want to anyway a priory in melrose park was on the fringes of the church power structure and why would they steal their own stock certificates even assuming they were in touch with forgers the whole idea was too far out i went back to my original theorymy phone call had come from a crank and the fbi was backing out because it was understaffed and overworked nothing happened to make me change my mind during the next several days i wondered vaguely how uncle stefan was doing if it werent for the fact that there really had been a forgery i would have put the whole thing out of my mind on wednesday i had to go to elgin to testify in a case being tried in the state appeals court there i stopped in melrose park on my way back to town partly to see carroll partly to see if a visit to the priory might tickle my threatening caller back to life if it didnt it would prove nothing but if i heard from him again it might show he was watching the priory it was fourthirty when i reached st albert s and the friars were filing into the chapel for vespers and evening mass father carroll came out of his office as i stood hesitating and gave me a welcoming smile inviting me to join them for evening prayer i followed him into the chapel two rows of raised stalls faced each other in the middle of the room i went with him to the back row on the left side the seats were divided by arms raised between them i sat down and slid back in the seat father carroll gave me a service book and quietly pointed out the lessons and prayers they would be using then knelt to pray in the winter twilight i felt as though i had slipped back five or six centuries in time the brothers in their white robes the candlelight flickering on the simple wooden altar to my left the few people coming in from the outside to worship in the public space divided from the main chapel by a carved wooden screenall evoked the medieval church i was the discordant note in my black wool suit my high heels my makeup father carroll led the service singing in a clear welltrained voice the whole service was sung antiphonally between the two banks of stalls its true as rosa said that im no christian but i found the service satisfying afterward carroll invited me back to his office for tea almost all tea tastes like stewed alfalfa to me but i politely drank a cup of the pale green brew and asked him if hed heard anything more from the fbi they tested the shares for fingerprints and a lot of other thingsi dont know what they thought there might be dust or something on them that would show where the things had been stored i guess they didnt find anything so theyre going to bring them back tomorrow he grinned mischievously im making them give me an armed escort over to the bank of melrose park were getting those things into a bank vault he asked me to stay for dinner which was being served in five minutes memories of kraft american cheese restrained me on an impulse i invited him to eat with me in melrose park the town has a couple of excellent italian restaurants somewhat surprised he accepted ill just change out of my robe he smiled again the young brothers like to go out in them in publicthey like people to look at them and know theyre seeing a foreign breed but we older men lose our taste for showing off he returned in ten minutes in a plaid shirt black slacks and a black jacket we had a pleasant meal at one of the little restaurants on north avenue we talked about singing i complimented him on his voice and learned hed been a student at the american conservatory before entering the priesthood he asked me about my work and i tried to think of some interesting cases i guess the payoff is you get to be your own boss and you have the satisfaction of solving problems even if theyre only little problems most of the time i was just out in elgin today testifying at the state court there it brought back my early days with the chicago public defenders office either we had to defend maniacs who ought to have been behind bars for the good of the world at large or we had poor chumps who were caught in the system and couldnt buy their way out youd leave court every day feeling as though youd just helped worsen the situation as a detective if i can get at the truth of a problem i feel as though ive made some contribution i see not a glamorous occupation but it sounds very worthwhileid never heard mrs vignelli mention you until she called last week i didnt know she had any family besides her son are there other relatives i shook my head my mother was her only chicago relativemy grandfather and she were brother and sister there may be some family on my uncle carls side he died years before i was born shot himself actuallyvery sad for rosa i fiddled with the stem on my wineglass tempted to ask him if he knew what lay behind rosa s dark insinuations about gabriella but even if he knew he probably wouldnt tell me and it seemed vulgar to bring up the family emnity in public after i took him back to the priory i swung onto the eisenhower back to chicago a little light snow had begun falling it was a few minutes before ten i turned on wbbm chicago s news station to catch news and a weather forecast i listened vaguely to reports of failed peace initiatives in lebanon continued high unemployment poor retail sales in december despite christmas shopping then alan swansons crisp voice continued tonights top local story is the violent death of a chicago stockbroker cleaning woman martha gonzales found the body of broker agnes paciorek in one of the conference rooms in the offices of feldstein holtz and woods where miss paciorek worked she had been shot twice in the head police have not ruled out suicide as a cause of death cbs news correspondent mark weintraub is with sergeant mcgonnigal at the fort dearborn tower offices of feldstein holtz and woods swanson switched over to weintraub i almost swerved into a ditch at cicero avenue my hands were shaking and i pulled the car over to the side i turned off the engine semis roared past rattling the little omega the car cooled and my feet began growing numb inside their pumps two shots in the head and the police still havent ruled out suicide i muttered my voice jarred me back to myself i turned the motor on and headed back into the city at a sober pace wbbm played the story at tenminute intervals with few new details the bullets were from a twentytwocaliber pistol the police finally decided to eliminate suicide since no gun was found by the body miss pacioreks purse had been recovered from a locked drawer in her desk i heard sergeant mcgonnigal saying in a voice made scratchy by static that someone must have intended to rob her then killed her in rage because she didnt have a purse on impulse i drove north to addison and stopped in front of lottys apartment it was almost eleven no lights showed lotty gets her sleep when she canher practice involves a lot of night emergencies my trouble would keep back at my own apartment i changed from my suit into a quilted robe and sat down in the living room with a glass of black label whiskey agnes and i went back a long way together back to the golden age of the sixties when we thought love and energy would end racism and sexism shed come from a wealthy family her father a heart surgeon at one of the big suburban hospitals theyd fought her about her friends her lifestyle her ambitions and shed won every battle relations with her mother became more and more strained i would have to call mrs paciorek who disliked me since i represented everything she didnt want agnes to be id have to hear how they always knew this would happen working downtown where the niggers are i drank another glass of whiskey id forgotten all about laying some bait for my anonymous phone caller until the telephone interrupted my maudlin mood i jumped slightly and looked at my watch eleventhirty i picked up a dictaphone from my desk and turned it to record before picking up the receiver it was roger ferrant feeling troubled about agness death hed seen it on the ten oclock news and tried calling me then we commiserated a bit then he said hesitantly i feel responsible for her death the whiskey was fogging my brain slightly whatd you dosend a punk up to the sixtieth floor of the fort dearborn tower i switched off the dictaphone and sat down vic i dont need your toughgirl act i feel responsible because she was staying late working on this possible ajax takeover it wasnt something she had time for during the day if you hadnt called her if you hadnt called her she would have been there late working on another project i interrupted him coldly agnes often finished her day latethe lady worked hard and if it comes to that you wouldnt have called her if i hadnt given you her number so if anyones responsible its me i took another swallow of whiskey and i wont believe that we hung up i finished my third glass of scotch and put the bottle away in the builtin cupboard in the dining room draped my robe over a chair back and climbed naked into bed just as i turned out the bedside light something ferrant had said rang a bell with me i called him back on the bedside phone its me vic how did you know agnes was working late on your project tonight i talked to her this afternoon she said she was going to stay late and talk to some of her broker pals she didnt have time to get to it during the day in person or on the phone huh oh i dont know he thought about it i cant remember exactly what she said but it left me with the impression that she was planning to see someone in person you should talk to the police roger i hung up and fell asleep almost immediately x mixed grill no matter how often i wake up with a headache i never remember it the next time im putting away five or six ounces of whiskey thursday morning a dry mouth and pounding head and heart woke me at fivethirty i looked disgustedly at myself in the bathroom mirror youre getting old v and unattractive when your face has cracks in it the morning after five ounces of scotch its time to stop drinking i squeezed some fresh orange juice and drank it in one long swallow took four aspirins and went back to bed the ringing phone woke me again at eightthirty a neutral young male voice said he was connected with lieutenant robert mallory of the chicago police department and would i be able to come downtown that morning and talk to the lieutenant its always a pleasure for me to talk to lieutenant mallory i replied formally if somewhat thickly through the miasma of sleep perhaps you could tell me what this is about the neutral young man didnt know but if i was free at ninethirty the lieutenant would see me then my next call was to the heraldstar murray ryerson hadnt yet come in for the day i called his apartment and felt vindictive pleasure at getting him out of bed murray what do you know about agnes paciorek he was furious i cant believe you got me out of bed to ask me that go buy the fucking morning edition he slammed the phone down angry myself i dialed again listen ryerson agnes paciorek was one of my oldest friends she got shot last night now bobby mallory wants to talk to me im sure hes not calling for deep background on university women united or clergy and laity concerned about vietnam what was in her office that makes him want to see me hang on a second he put the receiver down i could hear his feet padding away down the hall then water running and a womans voice saying something indistinguishable i ran into the kitchen and put a small pot of water on the stove ground beans for one cup of coffee and brought cup water and filter back to my bedside phoneall before murray returned i hope you can hold off jessica or whatever her name is for a few seconds dont be catty vic it isnt attractive i heard springs creaking then a muffled ouch from murray right i said dryly now tell me about agnes paper rustled springs creaked again and murray s smothered voice whispered knock it off alice then he put the mouthpiece in front of his lips again and began reading from his notes agnes paciorek was shot at about eight last night two twentytwo bullets in the brain office doors not locked cleaning women lock behind when they finish sixtieth floor usually at eleven oclock martha gonzales cleans floors fiftyseven through sixty got to floor at her usual time ninefifteen saw nothing unusual on premises got to conference room at ninethirty saw body called police no personal attackno signs of rape or struggle police presume attacker took her completely by surprise or possibly someone she knew thats the lot youre someone she knew they probably just want to know where you were at eight last night by the way since youre on the phone where were you in a bar waiting for a report from my hired gun i hung up and looked sourly around the room the orange juice and aspirin had dissipated the headache but i felt rotten i wasnt going to have time for running if i had to be in mallorys office by ninethirty and a long slow run was what i needed to get the poisons out of my system i didnt even have time for a long bath so i steamed myself under the shower for ten minutes put on the crepedechine pantsuit this time with a mantailored shirt of pale lemon and ran down the stairs two at a time to my car if the warshawski family has a motto which i doubt its never skip a meal perhaps in old church slavonic wreathed around a dinner plate with knife and fork rampant at any rate i stopped at a bakery on halsted for coffee and a ham croissant and headed for lake shore drive and the loop the croissant was stale and the ham might have been rancid but i plowed into it bravely bobbys little chats can go on for hours i wanted to fortify myself lieutenant mallory had joined the police the same year as my dad but my father his better in brains never had a lot of ambition certainly not enough to buck the prejudice against polish cops in an allirish world so mallory had risen and tony had stayed on the beat but the two remained good friends thats why mallory hates talking to me about crime he thinks tony warshawskis daughter should be making a better world by producing happy healthy babies not by catching desperadoes i pulled into the visitors parking lot at the eleventh street station at ninetwentythree i sat in the car to relax for a few minutes finish my coffee clear my mind of all thoughts for once i had no guilty secrets it should be a straightforward conversation at ninethirty i made my way past the high wooden admissions desk where pimps were lining up to redeem last nights haul of hookers and went down the hallway to mallorys office the place smelled a lot like st albert s priory must be the linoleum floors or maybe all the people in uniform mallory was on the phone when i got to the cubicle he calls an office his shirt sleeves were rolled up and the muscular arm that waved me in strained the white fabric before entering i helped myself to coffee from a pot in the corner of the hall then sat in an uncomfortable folding chair across the desk while he finished his call mallorys face betrays his moods he turns red and blustery on days when im on the periphery of some crime relaxed and genial means hes thinking of me as his old buddy tonys daughter today he looked at me gravely as he hung up the phone trouble i took a swallow of coffee and waited he flicked a switch on the intercom on his desk and waited silently while someone answered his summons a young black officer resembling neil washington from hill street blues came in shortly with a steno pad in one hand and a cup of coffee for mallory in the other mallory introduced him as officer tarkinton miss warshawski is a private investigator mallory informed tarkinton spelling the name for him officer tarkinton is going to keep a record of our conversation the formality and the display of officialdom were supposed to intimidate i drank some more coffee puzzled were you a friend of agnes marie paciorek bobby youre making me feel like i ought to have my attorney here whats going on just answer the questions well get to the reasons quickly enough my relations with agnes arent a secret you can get the details from anyone who knows both of us unless you tell me whats behind this im not answering any questions when did you first meet agnes paciorek i drank some more coffee and said nothing you and paciorek are described as sharing an alternate lifestyle this same witness says you are responsible for introducing the dead woman to unconventional behavior do you want to comment on that i felt my temper rising and controlled it with an effort its a typical police tactic in this type of interrogationget the witness mad enough to start mouthing off and who knows what selfconstructed pitfalls youll wander into i used to see it all the time in the public defenders office i counted to ten in italian and waited mallory clenched his fist tightly around the edge of his metal desk you and paciorek were lesbians werent you suddenly his control broke and he smashed his fist on the desk top when tony was dying you were up at the university of chicago screwing around like a pervert werent you it wasnt enough that you demonstrated against the war and got involved with that filthy abortion underground dont think we couldnt have pulled you in on that we could have a hundred times over but everyone wanted to protect tony you were the most important thing in the world to him and all the time jesus christ victoria when i talked to mrs paciorek this morning i wanted to puke are you charging me with something bobby he sat smoldering because if youre not im leaving i got up putting an empty styrofoam cup on the corner of his desk and started out the door no you dont young lady not until we get this straightened out theres nothing to straighten out i said coldly first of all under the illinois criminal code lesbianism between consenting adults is not an indictable offense therefore it is none of your goddamned business whether or not ms paciorek and i were lovers second my relations with her are totally unconnected with your murder investigation unless you can demonstrate some kind of connection i have absolutely nothing to say to you we locked gazes for an angry minute then bobby his face still set in hurt hard lines asked officer tarkinton to leave when we were alone he said in a tight voice i should have gotten someone else to handle the interrogation but goddamn it vicki his voice trailed off i was still angry but i felt grudging sympathy for him you know bobby what hurts me is that you talk to mrs paciorek whom you never met before in your life and believe a shopping list of calumny from her without even asking me and youve known me since i was born okay talk im asking talk to me about the paciorek girl i picked up the styrofoam cup and looked inside it was still empty agnes and i met when we were both students in the college i was prelaw and she was a math major who ultimately decided to get an mba im not going to try to describe to you what it felt like in those daysyou dont have much sympathy for the causes that consumed us i think sometimes that ill never feel soso alive again a wave of bittersweet memory swept over me and i closed my eyes tightly to keep tears at bay then the dream started falling apart we had watergate and drugs and the deteriorating economy and racism and sexual discrimination continued despite our enthusiasm so we all settled down to deal with reality and earn a living you know my story i guess my ideals died the hardest its often that way with the children of immigrants we need to buy the dream so bad we sometimes cant wake up well agness story was a little different you met the parents first of all her father is a successful cardiac surgeon pulls in a good half million a year at a conservative guess but more important her mother is one of the savages you know old catholic money convent of the sacred heart for prep school then the deb balls and all the other stuff i dont know exactly how the very rich live just differently from you and me anyway agnes was born fighting it she fought it through twelve years at sacred heart and came to the u of c against their harshest opposition she borrowed the money because they wouldnt pay to send her to a jewish commie school so it wasnt too surprising that she got swept up in all the causes of the sixties and for both of us feminism was the most important because it was central to us i was talking more to myself than to bobby i wasnt sure how much he could really hear of what i was saying well after tony died agnes used to invite me up to lake forest for christmas and i got to know the pacioreks and mrs paciorek decided to hang all agness weird behavior on me it took her off the hook you seeshe wasnt a failure as a parent agnes who figured as sweet and impressionable in this scenario had fallen under my evil influence well buy that or not as you choose but keep in mind that sweet impressionable people dont build up the kind of brokerage business agnes did anyway agnes and i were good friends at the university and we stayed good friends and in its way that was a small miracle when our rap group followed the national trend and split between radical lesbians and well straights she became a lesbian and i didnt but we remained very good friendsan achievement for that era when politics divided marriages and friends alike it seems pointless now but it was very real then like a lot of my friends id resented suddenly being labeled straight because of my sexual preferences after all wed been fighting the straightsthe prowar antiabortion racist world now overnight we were straights too it all seems senseless now the older i get the less politics means to me the only thing that seems to matter is friendship and agnes and i had been good friends for a longtime i could feel tears behind my eyes and squeezed them tightly again when i looked up at bobby he was frowning at the desk top drawing circles on it with the back of a ballpoint pen well ive told you my story bobby now explain why you needed to hear it he continued to stare at the desk where were you last night my temper began rising again goddamn it if you want to charge me with murder come out and do it im not accounting for my movements otherwise from the way the body looked we believe she was seeing someone she expected not a chance intruder he pulled a leathercovered date book from the middle desk drawer he flipped it open and tossed it to me for wednesday january agnes had written viw heavily underscored followed by several exclamation points looks like a date doesnt it i tossed the book back to him have you established that im her only acquaintance with those initials there arent too many people in the metropolitan area with those initials so the current theory reads that she and i were lovers and we had a fallingout now shes been living with phyllis lording for three years and ive been involved with godknowswhoall since we left school besides being married onceoh yeah i guess the theory would say i divorced dick to keep agnes happy but despite all that suddenly we decided to have a grand lovers quarrel and because im trained in selfdefense and carry a gun at times i won by putting a couple of bullets through her head you said hearing about me from mrs paciorek made you want to puke frankly bobby listening to what goes on in the alleged minds of the police makes me feel like ive wandered into a really lowgrade porn shop talk about puking anything else you want to know i stood up again well you tell me why she wanted to see you and were you there last night i stayed on my feet you should have started with your last question i was in melrose park last night with the reverend boniface carroll op prior of st alberts dominican priory from about fourthirty to about ten and i dont know why agnes wanted to talk to meassuming im the one she wanted to talk to try vincent ignatius williams whos he bobby demanded startled i dont know but his initials are viw i turned and left ignoring bobbys voice as it came bellowing down the corridor after me i was furious my hands were shaking with rage i stood by the door of the omega taking in deep gulps of icy air slowly expelling it trying to calm myself finally i climbed into the car the dashboard clock read eleven i headed the omega north into the loop parking at a public lot not too far from the pulteney from there i walked three blocks to ajax s headquarters their glassandsteel skyscraper occupies sixty of the ugliest stories in chicago located at the northwestern corner of michigan and adams it overwhelms the art institute opposite ive often wondered why the blairs and the mccormicks allowed a monster like ajax so near their favorite charity uniformed security guards patrol ajax s gray lobby their job is to keep miscreants like me from attacking officers like roger ferrant even after theyd checked with him and found he was willing to see me they made me fill out a form for a visitors pass by that time my temper was so brittle that i scribbled a note under my signature promising not to mug any of their executives in the hallway ferrants office lay on the lake side of the fiftyeighth floor which proved the importance of his temporary position an angular secretary in a large antechamber informed me that mr ferrant was engaged and would see me shortly her desk facing the open door kept her from seeing lake michigan i wondered if that was her own idea or if ajax management didnt think secretaries could be trusted to work if they saw the outside world i sat in a large greencovered plush armchair and flicked through the mornings wall street journal while i waited the headline in heard on the street caught my eye the journal had picked up the rumor of a potential takeover for ajax the tisch brothers and other likely insurancecompany owners had been interviewed but all of them professed total ignorance ajax chairman gordon firth was quoted as saying naturally were watching the share price with interest but no one has approached our shareholders with a friendly offer and that seemed to be all they knew in new york at a quarter to twelve the door to the inner office opened a group of middleaged men mostly overweight came out talking in a subdued hubbub ferrant followed straightening his tie with one hand and pushing his hair out of his eyes with the other he smiled but his thin face was troubled have you eaten good well go to the executive dining room on sixty i told him that was fine and waited while he put on his suit jacket we rode in silence to the top of the building in the executive dining and meeting rooms ajax compensated for the stark unfriendliness of the lobby brocade drapes were looped back over gauze hangings at the windows walls were paneled in dark wood possibly mahogany and the recessed lighting picked up strategically placed bits of modern sculpture and painting ferrant had his own table near a window with plenty of space between him and any eavesdropping neighbors as soon as we were seated a blackuniformed waiter popped out of the ground to waft luncheon menus in front of us and ask for our drink orders last nights scotch was adding to the discomfort of my morning with mallory i ordered orange juice i flipped indifferently through the menu when the waiter came back with our drinks i found i didnt have any appetite nothing for me now ferrant looked at his watch and said apologetically that he was on a short timetable and would have to eat once the waiter was gone i said abruptly i spent the morning with the police they think agnes was expecting someone last night you said the same thing did she tell you anythinganything at all that would help identify the one she was waiting for barrett sent me the names of brokers here in chicago whove been trading in ajax it came in mondays mail and i met agnes for lunch on tuesday and gave it to her then along with the list of those the shares had been registered to she said she knew a partner in one of the firms pretty well and would call him but she didnt tell me who did you keep a copy of the names he shook his head ive kicked myself a hundred times over for that but i dont have the american photocopy habit i always thought it was stupid generated mounds of useless paper now im changing my mind i can get barrett to send me another copy but i wont get it today i drummed my fingers on the table useless to be irritated about that maybe her secretary can dig it up for me when she talked to you yesterday did she mention my name at all he shook his head should she have she had my initials in her date book with agnes that meansmeanta reminder to herself she didnt write down her appointments she relied on her secretary to keep track of them so my initials meant she wanted to talk to me id been too angry with mallory to explain that to him too angry as well to tell him about ferrant and ajax the police came up with an extraterrestrial theory about agnes and me being lovers and my shooting her out of spite or revenge or something it didnt make me too confiding but i cant help wondering you saw the story in this mornings journal he nodded well here youve got a possible takeover bid none of the principalsif there are anystep into the open agnes starts prying she wants to talk to me but before she does that she ends up dead he looked startled you dont really think her death has anything to do with ajax do you the waiter brought him a club sandwich and he began eating automatically it really troubles me to think my questions might have sent that poor girl to her death you poohpoohed me last night for feeling responsible christ i feel ten times as responsible now he put his sandwich down and leaned across the table vic no company takeover is more valuable than a persons life leave it be if there is a connectionif you stir up the same peoplei just couldnt bear it its bad enough to feel responsible for agnes i scarcely knew her but i just dont want to worry about that with you too you cant touch someone in the executive dining room every corporate officer i ever met was a bornagain gossip word would spread through all sixty floors by nightfall that roger ferrant had brought his girlfriend to lunch and held hands with her thanks roger agnes and iwere grown women we make our own mistakes no one else has to take responsibility for them im always careful i think you owe taking care of yourself to the friends who love you and i dont want to cause my friends any grief im not sure i believe in immortality or heaven or any of those things but i do believe with roger fox that we all have to listen to the voice within us and how easily you can look at yourself in the mirror depends on whether you obey that voice or not everyones voice gives different counsel but you can only interpret the one you hear he finished his drink before answering well vic add me to the list of friends who dont want to grieve over you he got up abruptly and headed for the exit leaving his sandwich half eaten on the table xi acid test the fort dearborn trust chicago s largest bank has buildings on each of the four corners of monroe and lasalle the tower their most recent construction is a seventyfivestory building on the southwest side of the intersection its curved aquatinted glass sides represent the newest trend in chicago architecture the elevator banks are built around a small jungle i skirted trees and creeping vines until i found the elevators to the sixtieth floor where feldstein holtz and woods the firm in which agnes had been a partner occupied the north half id first been there when the firm moved in three years ago agnes had just been made a partner and phyllis lording and i were helping her hang pictures in her enormous new office phyllis taught english at the university of illinoischicago circle id called her from the ajax dining room before coming over to the fort dearborn tower it was a painful conversation phyllis trying unsuccessfully not to cry mrs paciorek was refusing to tell her anything about the funeral arrangements if youre not married you dont have any rights when your lover dies she said bitterly i promised to come see her that evening and asked if agnes had said anything either about ajax or why she wanted to see me she told me shed had lunch with you last friday you and some englishman i know she said hed brought up an interesting problem i just cant remember anything else now if phyllis didnt know agness secretary might i hadnt bothered phoning ahead to feldstein holtz and woods and i arrived on a scene of extraordinary chaos the inside of a brokerage firm always looks like a hurricanes just been through brokers carve perilous perches for themselves inside mountains of documentsprospectuses research reports annual reports the wonder is that they ever work through enough paper to know anything about the companies they trade in a murder investigation superimposed on this fire hazard was unbearable even for someone with my housekeeping standards gray dusting powder covered the few surfaces not crowded with paper desks and terminals were jammed into the already overflowing space so work could go on while police cordoned off parts of the floor they thought might yield clues as i walked through the open area towards agness office a young patrolman stopped me demanding my business i have an account here im going to see my broker he tried to stop me with further questions but someone barked an order at him from the other side of the room and he turned his back on me agness office was roped off even though the murder had taken place on the other side of the floor a couple of detectives were going through every piece of paper i figured they might finish by easter alicia vargas agness young secretary was huddled miserably in a corner with three wordprocessor operators the police had commandeered her rosewood desk as well she saw me coming and jumped to her feet miss warshawski you heard the news this is terrible terrible who would do a thing like that the wordprocessor operators all sat with their hands in their laps green cursors blinking importunately on blank screens in front of them could we go someplace to talk i asked jerking my head toward the eavesdroppers she collected her purse and jacket and followed me at once we rode the elevator back down to the coffee shop tucked into one corner of the lobby jungle my appetite had come back i ordered corned beef on ryeextra calories to make up for skipping lunch at the executive dining room miss vargass plump brown face was swollen from crying agnes had picked her out of the typing pool five years ago when miss vargas was eighteen and on her first job when agnes was made partner miss vargas became her personal secretary the tears marked genuine grief but probably also concern for her uncertain future i asked her whether any of the senior partners had talked to her about her job she shook her head sadly i will have to talk to mr holtz i know they will not think of it until then i am supposed to be working for mr hampton and mr janvilletwo of the junior partnersuntil things are straightened out she scowled fiercely keeping back further tears if i must go back to the pool or working for many men ii well i will have to find a job elsewhere privately i thought that was the best thing for her to do but being in a state of shock is not the best time to plan i set my energies instead to calming her down and asking her about agness interest in the putative ajax takeover she didnt know anything about ajax and the brokers names given agnes by ferrant she shook her head if they hadnt come in the mail she wouldnt have seen them in the normal course of things i sighed in exasperation id have to get roger to ask barrett for a duplicate list if it didnt turn up in the office i explained the situation to miss vargas theres a strong possibility that one of the people on the list might have been coming to see agnes last night if so that would be the last person to see her alive it might even be the murderer i can get another copy of the list but itll take time if you can look through her papers and find it itd be a help im not sure what will identify it it should be on letterhead from andy barrett the ajax specialist may even be part of a letter to roger ferrant she agreed readily enough to look for the list although she didnt hold out much hope of finding it in the mass of papers in agness office i settled the bill and we went back to the disaster area the police pounced on miss vargas suspiciously where had she been they needed to go over some material with her she looked at me helplessly i told her id wait while she talked to the police i nosed out feldstein holtzs research director frank bugatti he was a young hardhitting mba i told him id been a client of miss paciorek shed been looking into insurance stocks for me i hate to seem like a vulturei know shes only been dead a few hours but i saw in this mornings paper that someone might be trying to take over ajax if thats true the price should keep going up shouldnt it maybe this is a good time to get into the stock i was thinking of ten thousand shares agnes was going to check with you and see what you know about it at todays prices a customer buying ten thousand shares had a good half million to throw around bugatti treated me with commensurate respect he took me into an office made tiny by piles of paper and told me all he knew about a potential ajax takeover nothing after twenty minutes of discoursing on the insurance industry and other irrelevancies he offered to introduce me to one of the other partners who would be glad to do business with me i told him i needed some time to adjust to the shock of miss pacioreks death but thanked him profusely for his help miss vargas was back at her makeshift desk when i returned to the floor she shook her head worriedly when i appeared i find no list of the kind youre looking for at least not on top of her desk ill keep looking if the police let me back in her officeshe made a contemptuous facebut maybe you should get the names elsewhere if you can i agreed and called roger from her phone he was in a meeting i told the secretary this was more important than any meeting he could be in and finally bullied her into bringing him to the phone i wont keep you roger but id like another copy of those names you gave agnes can you call barrett and ask him to express mail them to you or to me i could get them on saturday if he sent them out tomorrow morning of course i should have thought of that myself ill call him right now miss vargas was still staring at me hopefully i thanked her for her help and told her id be in touch when i walked past agness ropedoff office i saw the detectives still toiling away at papers it made me glad to be a private investigator that was about the only thing i was glad about all day it was four oclock and snowing when i left the dearborn tower by the time i picked up the omega the traffic had congealed early commuters trying to escape expressway traffic had immobilized the loop i wished i hadnt agreed to stop in on phyllis lording id started the day exhausted by the time id left mallorys office at eleven i was ready for bed as it turned out i wasnt sorry i went phyllis needed help dealing with mrs paciorek i was one of her few friends who knew agness mother and we talked long and sensibly about the best way to treat neurotics phyllis was a quiet thin woman several years older than agnes and me its not that i feel possessive about agnes i know she loved mei dont need to own her dead body but i have to go to the funeral its the only way to make her death real i understood the truth of that and promised to get the details from the police if mrs paciorek wouldnt reveal them to me phylliss apartment was on chestnut and the drive a very posh neighborhood just north of the loop overlooking lake michigan phyllis also felt depressed because she knew she couldnt afford to keep the place on her salary as a professor i sympathized with her but i was pretty sure agnes had left her a substantial bequest shed asked me to lunch one day last summer shortly after shed redone her will i wondered idly if the pacioreks would try to overturn it it was close to seven when i finally left turning down phylliss offer of supper i had been too overloaded with people for one day i needed to be alone besides phyllis believed eating was just a duty you owed your body to keep it alive she maintained hers with cottage cheese spinach and an occasional boiled egg i needed comfort food tonight i drove slowly north the thickly falling snow coagulated the traffic even after rush hour all food starting with p is comfort food i thought pasta potato chips pretzels peanut butter pastrami pizza pastry by the time i reached the belmont exit i had quite a list and had calmed the top layer of frazzle off my mind i needed to call lotty i realized by now she would have heard the news about agnes and would want to discuss it remembering lotty made me think of her uncle stefan and the counterfeit securities that reminded me in turn of my anonymous phone caller alone in the snowy night his cultured voice weirdly devoid of any regional accent seemed full of menace as i parked the omega and headed into my apartment building i felt frail and very lonely the stairwell lights were out this was not unusualour building super was lazy at best drunk at worst when his grandson didnt come round a light often went unchanged until one of the tenants gave up in exasperation and took care of it normally i would have made my way up the stairs in the dark but the night ghosts were too much for me i went back to the car and pulled a flashlight from the glove compartment my new gun was inside the apartment where it could do me the least good but the flashlight was heavy it would double as a weapon if necessary once in the building i followed a trail of wet footprints to the second floor where a group of de paul students lived the melted snow ended there obviously id let my nerves get the better of me a bad habit for a detective i started up the last flight at a good clip playing the light across the worn shiny stairs at the half landing to the third floor i saw a small patch of wet dirt i froze if someone had come up with wet feet and wiped the stairs behind him he might have left just such a small streaky spot i flicked off the light and wrapped my muffler around my neck and face with one arm ran up the stairs fast stooping low as i neared the top i smelled wet wool i flung myself at it keeping my head tucked down on my chest i met a body half again as big as mine we fell over in a heap with him on the bottom using the flashlight i smashed where i thought his jaw should be it connected with bone he gave a muffled shriek and tore himself away i pulled back and started to kick when i sensed his arm coming up toward my face i ducked and fell over in a rolling ball felt liquid on the back of my neck underneath the muffler heard him tearing down the stairs half slipping i was on my feet starting to follow when the back of my neck began burning as though id been stung by fifty wasps i pulled out my keys and got into the apartment as quickly as i could doublebolting the door behind me i ran to the bathroom shedding clothes i kicked off my boots but didnt bother with my stockings or trousers and leaped into the tub turning the shower on full force i washed myself for five minutes before taking a breath soaking wet and shivering i climbed out of the tub on shaking legs the mohair scarf had large round holes in it the collar of the crepedechine jacket had dissolved i twisted around to look at my back in the mirror a thin ring of red showed where the skin had been partially eaten through a long fat finger of red went down my spine acid burn i was shaking all over now shock half my mind thought clinically i forced myself out of wet slacks and pantyhose and wrapped up in a large towel that irritated my neck horribly tea is good for shock ithought vaguely but i hate tea there wasnt any in my house hot milkthat would do hot milk with lots of honey i was shaking so badly i spilled most of it on the floor trying to get it into a pan and then had a hard time getting the burner lighted i stumbled to the bedroom pulled the quilt from the bed and wrapped up in it back in the kitchen i managed to get most of the milk into a mug i had to hold the cup close to my body to keep from spilling it all over me i sat on the kitchen floor draped in blanketing and gulped down the scalding liquid after a while the shakes eased i was cold my muscles were cramped and aching but the worst was over i got stiffly to my feet and walked on leaden legs back to the bedroom as best i could i rubbed vaseline onto the burn on my back then got dressed again i piled on layers of heavy clothes and still felt chilly i turned on the radiator and squatted in front of it as it banged and hissed its way to heat when the phone rang i jumped my heart pounded wildly i stood over it fearfully my hands shaking slightly on the sixth ring i finally answered it it was lotty lotty i gasped she had called because of agnes but demanded at once to know what the trouble was she insisted on coming over brusquely brushing aside my feeble protests that the attacker might still be lurking outside not on a night like this and not if you broke his jaw she was at the door twenty minutes later so liebchen youve been in the wars again i clung to her for a few minutes she stroked my hair and murmured in german and i finally began to warm up when she saw that id stopped shivering she had me take off my layers of swaddling her strong fingers moved very gently along my neck and upper spine cleaning off the vaseline and applying a proper dressing so my dear not very serious the shock was the worst part and you didnt drink did you good worst possible thing for shock hot milk and honey very good not like you to be so sensible talking all the while she went out to the kitchen with me cleaned the milk from the floor and stove and set about making soup she put on lentils with carrots and onions and the rich smell filled the kitchen and began reviving me when the phone rang again i was ready for it i let it ring three times then picked it up my recorder switched on it was my smoothvoiced friend how are your eyes miss warshawski or vic i should sayi feel i know you well how is your friend oh walter will survive but were worried about you vic you might not survive the next time you know now be a good girl and stay away from rosa and st albert s youll feel so much better in the long run he hung up i played the tape back for lotty she looked at me soberly you dont recognize the voice i shook my head someone knows i was at the priory yesterday though and that can only mean one thing one of the dominicans has to be involved why though im being warned off the priory i said impatiently only they know i was there a terrible thought struck me and i began shivering again only they and roger ferrant xii funeral rites ltty insisted on spending the night she left early in the morning for her clinic begging me to be careful but not to drop the investigation youre a jillthegiantkiller she said her black eyes worried you are always taking on things that are too big for you and maybe one day you will take on one big thing too many but that is your way if you werent living so you would have a long unhappy life your choice is for the satisfied life and we will hope it too is a long one somehow these words did not cheer me up after lotty left i went down to the basement where each tenant has a padlocked area with aching shoulders i pulled out boxes of old papers and knelt on the damp floor sorting through them at last i found what i wanteda tenyearold address book dr and mrs thomas paciorek lived on arbor drive in lake forest fortunately their unlisted phone number hadnt changed since i told the person who answered that i would speak to either dr or mrs paciorek but was relieved to get agness father although hed always struck me as a cold selfabsorbed man hed never shared his wifes personal animosity toward me he believed his daughters problems stemmed from her own innate willfulness this is v i warshawski dr paciorek im very sorry about agnes id like to come to her funeral can you tell me when it will be were not making a public occasion of it victoria the publicity around her death has been bad enough without turning her funeral into a media event he paused my wife thinks you might know something about who killed her do you if i did you can be sure i would tell the police dr paciorek im afraid i dont i can understand why you dont want a lot of people or newspapers around but agnes and i were good friends it matters a lot to me to pay my last respects to her he hemmed and hawed but finally told me the funeral would be saturday at our lady of the rosary in lake forest i thanked him with more politeness than i felt and called phyllis lording to let her know we arranged to go together in case the knights of columbus were posted at the church door to keep out undesirables i didnt like the way i was feeling noises in my apartment were making me jump and at eleven when the phone rang i had to force myself to pick it up it was ferrant in a subdued mood he asked if i knew where agness funeral was being held and if i thought her parents would mind his coming probably i said they dont want me there and i was one of her oldest friends but come anyway i told him the time and place and how to find it when he asked if he could accompany me i told him about phyllis she probably isnt up to meeting strangers at agness funeral he invited me to dinner but i turned that down too i didnt really believe roger would hire someone to throw acid at me but still i had eaten dinner with him the same day id made my first trip to the priory it was the next day that rosa decided to back out of the case i wanted to ask him but it sounded too much like thomas paciorek asking me on my honor as a girl scout if id helped kill his daughter i was scared and i didnt like it it was making me distrust my friends i didnt know where to start looking for an acid thrower i didnt want to be alone but didnt know roger well enough to be with him at noon as i walked skittishly down halsted to get a sandwich an idea occurred to me that might solve both my immediate problems i phoned murray from the sandwich shop i need to talk to you i said abruptly when he came to the phone i need your help he must have sensed my mood because he didnt offer any of his usual wisecracks agreeing to meet me at the golden glow at five at fourthirty i changed into a navy wool pantsuit and stuck a toothbrush the gun and a change of underwear in my handbag i checked all the locks and left by the back stairs a look around the building told me my fears were unwarranted no one was lying in wait for me i also checked the omega carefully before getting in and starting it today at least i was not going to be blown to bits i got stuck in traffic on the drive and was late to the golden glow murray was waiting for me with the early edition of the heraldstar and a beer hello v i whats up murray who do you know who throws acid on people he doesnt like no one my friends dont do that kind of thing not a joke murray does it ring a bell who do you know had acid thrown at them me i turned around and showed him the back of my neck where lotty had dressed the burn he was trying for my eyes but i was expecting it and turned away in time the throwers name is probably walter but the man who got him to throw itthats who i want i told him about the threats and the fight and described the voice of the man who had called murray im scared i dont scare easily butjesus christ the thought of some maniac out there trying to blind me id rather take a bullet in the head he nodded soberly youre stepping on the feet of someone with bunions v i but i dont know whose acid he shook his head id be sort of tempted to say rodolpho fratelli but the voice doesnt sound righthes got that heavy grating voice you cant miss it fratelli was a highranking member of the pasquale family maybe someone who works for him i asked he shrugged ill get someone to look into it can i do a story on your attack i thought about it you know i havent been to the police i guess im too angry with bobby mallory i sketched my interview with him for murray but maybe it will make my anonymous caller a little more cautious if he sees theres a big universe out there keeping an eye open for him the other thing isim kind of embarrassed to ask this but the truth is im not up to a night alone can i crash with you murray looked at me for a few seconds then laughed you know vic its worth the earful ill get canceling my date just to hear you plead for help youre too fucking tough all the time thanks murray glad to make your day i wasnt liking myself too well when he went off to the telephone i wondered what column this went under taking prudent precautions or being chicken we went to dinner at the officers mess a romantic indian restaurant on halsted and then dancing at bluebeards as we were climbing into bed at one murray told me hed sicced a couple of reporters on digging up information about acid throwers i got up early saturday and left murray still asleepi needed to change for agness funeral all was still quiet at my apartment and i began to think i was letting fear get far too much the better of me changing into the navy walking suit this time with a pale gray blouse and navy pumps i took off to collect lotty and phyllis it was only degrees out and the sky was overcast again i was shivering with cold by the time i got back into the cari needed to replace my mohair shawl lotty was waiting in her doorway dressed in black wool for once dignified enough to be a doctor she didnt say much on the drive down to chestnut street when we got to the condo she got out to fetch phyllis who didnt look as if shed slept or eaten in the two days since id seen her last the skin on her pale fineboned face was drawn so tightly i thought it might crack and she had bluish shadows under her eyes she was wearing a white wool suit with a pale yellow sweater i had a vague idea that those were mourning colors in the orient phyllis is a very literary person and she would pay tribute to a dead lover with some kind of mourning that only another scholar would understand she smiled at me nervously as we headed back north toward lake forest they dont know im coming do they she asked no lotty took exception to that why was i acting in a secretive way which could only precipitate a scene when mrs paciorek realized who phyllis was shes not going to do that graduates of sacred heart and st marys dont have scenes at their daughters funerals and she wont take it out on phyllisshell know i was the real culprit besides if id told her ahead of time who i was bringing she might have instructed the bouncer not to seat us bouncer phyllis asked i guess they call them ushers in churches that made phyllis laugh and we made the rest of the drive considerably more at ease our lady of the rosary was an imposing limestone block on top of a hill overlooking sheridan road i slid the omega into a parking lot at its foot finding a niche between an enormous black cadillac and an outsize mark iv i wasnt sure id ever find my car again in this sea of limos as we climbed a steep flight of stairs to the churchs main entrance i wondered how the elderly and infirm made it to mass perhaps lake forest catholics were never bed or wheelchairridden but wafted directly to heaven at the first sign of disability agness brother phil was one of the ushers when he saw me his face lit up and he came over to kiss me v im so glad you made it mother told me you werent coming i gave him a quick hug and introduced him to lotty and phyllis he escorted us to seats near the front of the church agness coffin rested on a stand in front of the steps leading up to the altar as people came in they knelt in front of the coffin for a few seconds to my surprise phyllis did so before joining us in the pew she knelt for a long time and finally crossed herself and rose as the organ began playing a voluntary i hadnt realized she was a catholic one of the ushers a middleaged man with a red face and white hair escorted mrs paciorek to her place in the front row she was wearing black with a long black mantilla pinned to her head she looked much as i remembered her handsome and angry her glance at the coffin as she entered her pew seemed to say i told you so i felt a tap on my shoulder and looked up to see ferrant elegant in a morning coat i wondered idly if hed packed morning clothes just on the chance of there being a funeral in chicago and moved over to make room for him the organ played fauré for perhaps five minutes before the procession entered it was huge and impressive first came acolytes one swinging a censer one carrying a large crucifix then the junior clergy then a magnificent figure in cope and miter carrying a crosierthe cardinal archbishop of chicago jerome farber and behind him the celebrant also in cope and miter a bishop but not one i recognized not that i know many bishops by sightfarber is in the papers fairly regularly i realized after the ceremony had begun that one of the junior priests was augustine pelly the dominican procurator that was oddhow did he know the pacioreks the requiem mass itself was chanted in latin with farber and the strange bishop doing a very creditable job i wondered how agnes would have felt about this beautiful if archaic ritual she was so modern in so many ways yet the magnificence might have appealed to her i made no attempt to follow the flow of the service through risings and kneelings nor did lotty and roger phyllis however participated completely and when the bell sounded for communion i wasnt surprised that she edged her way past us and joined the queue at the altar as we were leaving the church phil paciorek stopped me he was about ten years younger than agnes and me and had had a mild crush on me in the days when i used to frequent the lake forest house were having something to eat at the house id like it if you and your friends came along i looked a question at lotty who shrugged as if to say it would be a mistake either way so i accepted i wanted to find out what pelly was doing here i hadnt been to the paciorek house since my second year in law school i sort of remembered it as being near the lake but made several wrong turns before finding arbor road the house looked like a frank lloyd wright building with a genetic malfunctionit had kept reproducing wings and layers in all directions until someone gave it chemotherapy and stopped the process we left the car among a long line of others on arbor road and went into one of the boxes that seemed to contain the front door when i used to visit there agnes and i had always come in from the side door where the garage and stables were we found ourselves in a blackandwhite marbled foyer where a maid took lottys coat and directed us to the reception the bizarre design of the house meant going up and down several short marble staircases that led nowhere until we had made two right turns which took us to the conservatory this room had been inspired by the library at blenheim palace almost as big it contained a pipe organ as well as bookstacks and some potted trees i wasnt sure why they called it a conservatory instead of a music room or a library phil spotted us at the door and came over to greet us he was finishing a combined mdphd program at the university of chicago dad thinks im crazy he grinned im going into neurobiology as a researcher instead of neurosurgery where the money is i think cecelia is the only one of his children who has turned out satisfactorily cecelia the second daughter after agnes was standing near the organ with father pelly and the strange bishop at thirty she already looked like mrs paciorek including an imposing bosom under her expensive black suit i left phil talking to phyllis and skirted my way through the crowd to the organ cecelia refused to shake hands and said mother told us you werent coming this was the same thing phil had said when i met him at the church except that he was pleased and cecelia was angry i havent talked to her cecelia i spoke with your dad yesterday and he invited me she said she phoned you i shook my head since she wasnt going to introduce me i said to the strange bishop im v i warshawski one of agness old school friends father pelly and i have met out at the friary of albertus magnus i half held out my hand but dropped it when the bishop made no corresponding gesture he was a lean grayhaired man of perhaps fifty sporting a purple episcopal shirt with a gold chain draped across it pelly said this is the right reverend xavier ofaolin i whistled mentally xavier ofaolin was a vatican functionary in charge of the vaticans financial affairs hed been in the papers quite a bit last summer when the scandal broke over the banco ambrosiano and roberto calvis tangled problems the bank of italy believed ofaolin might have had a hand in ambrosianos vanishing assets the bishop was half spanish half irish from some central american country i thought heavy friends mrs paciorek had and you were both old friends of agness i asked a bit maliciously pelly hesitated waiting for ofaolin to say something when the bishop didnt speak pelly said austerely the bishop and i are friends of mrs pacioreks we met in panama when her husband was stationed there the army had put dr paciorek through medical school hed done his stint for them in the canal zone agnes had been born there and spoke spanish quite well id forgotten that paciorek had come a long way from a man too poor to pay his own tuition so she takes an interest in your dominican school in ciudad isabella it was an idle question but pellys face was suddenly suffused with emotion i wondered what the problem was did he think i was trying to revive the churchinpolitics argument at a funeral he struggled visibly with his feelings and at last said stiffly mrs paciorek is interested in a wide range of charities her family is famous for its support of catholic schools and missions yes indeed the archbishop finally spoke his english so heavily accented as to be almost incomprehensible yes we owe much to the goodwill of such good christian ladies as mrs paciorek cecelia was biting her lips nervously perhaps she too was afraid of what i might say or do please leave now victoria before mother realizes youre here shes had enough shocks because of agnes your father and brother invited me ceil im not gatecrashing i pushed my way through a mink and sable farm glistening with diamonds to the other side of the room where id last seen dr paciorek about halfway there i decided the best route lay on the outside of the room through the corridor made by the potted plants skirting sideways against the main flow of traffic i made my way to the edge a few small knots of people were standing beyond the trees talking and smoking desultorily i recognized an old school friend of agness from sacred heart lacquered hard and encrusted with diamonds i stopped and exchanged stilted pleasantries as regina paused to light a fresh cigarette i heard a man speaking on the other side of the orange tree we stood under i fully support jims policy in interior we had dinner last week in washington and he was explaining what a burden these diehard liberals are making of his life someone else responded in the same vein then a third man said but surely there are adequate measures for dealing with such opposition not an unusual conversation for a rightwing bastion of wealth but it was the third speakers voice that held me riveted was certain id heard it on the phone two nights ago regina was telling me about her second daughter now in eighth grade at sacred heart and how clever and beautiful she was thats wonderful regina so nice to see you again i circled the orange tree a large group stood there including the redfaced man whod been ushering at the church and ofaolin mrs paciorek whom i hadnt seen earlier was standing in the middle facing me in her late fifties she was still an attractive woman when i knew her she followed a rigorous exercise regimen drank little and didnt smoke but years of anger had taken their toll on her face under the beautifully coiffed dark hair it was pinched and lined when she saw me the furrows in her forehead deepened victoria i specifically asked you not to come what are you doing here what are you talking about dr paciorek asked me to the service and philip invited me to come here afterward when thomas told me yesterday that you were coming i phoned you three times each time i told the person who answered to make sure you knew you were not welcome at my daughters funeral now dont pretend you dont know what im talking about i shook my head sorry mrs paciorek you spoke with my answering service i was too busy to phone in for messages and even if id gotten your orders i would still have come i loved agnes too much to stay away from her funeral loved her her voice was thick with anger how dare you make filthy innuendos in this house love filthy innuendos i echoed then laughed oh youre still stuck on the notion that agnes and i were lovers no no just good friends at my laughter her face suffused with crimson i was afraid she might have a stroke on the spot the redfaced whitehaired man stepped forward and took my arm my sister made it clear youre not wanted here i think its time you left his heavy voice was not that of my threatening caller sure i said ill just find dr paciorek and say goodbye to him he tried to propel me toward the door but i shook his hand loose with more vigor than grace i left him rubbing it and paused in the crowd behind mrs paciorek straining for the smooth accentless voice of my caller i couldnt find it at last i gave up found dr paciorek made some routine condolences and collected phyllis and lotty xiii late trades ferrant dropped by late in the afternoon with a copy of barretts list he was grave and formal and declined an offer of a drink he didnt stay long just looked over the brokers with me told me none of those registered as buying the stock were ajax customers and left none of the firms listed were familiar to me nor were the names of the stock registrants in fact most of the registrants were the brokers themselves barretts cover letter to roger explained that this was typically the case right after a stock changed handsit generally took a month or so for the actual owners name to be filed one company appeared several times woodsage inc its address was s lasalle three of the brokers also had addresses there a fact that seemed more interesting than it really was when i looked it up on my detailed map of the loop i discovered that it was the midwest stock exchange there wasnt much i could do with the list until monday so i put it in a drawer and concentrated on the nfl pro bowl i sent out for a pizza for supper and spent the night restlessly the smith wesson loaded next to my bed sundays heraldstar had a nice little story about my acid burn on the front page of chicago beat theyd used a picture taken last spring at wrigley field a bright eyecatching shot readers who made it to section iii couldnt avoid seeing me the personal ads included numerous thanksgivings to st jude several lovers seeking reconciliations but no message from uncle stefan monday morning i stuck my gun in a shoulder holster under a loose tweed jacket and drove the omega into the loop to begin a day at the brokerage houses at the offices of bearden lyman members of the new york stock exchange i told the receptionist i had six hundred thousand dollars to invest and wanted to see a broker stuart bearden came out to meet me personally he was a dapper man in his middle forties wearing a charcoal pinstripe suit and a david niven mustache he led me through a maze of cubicles where earnest young people sat with phones in one hand typing on their computer terminals with the other to his own office in the far corner of the floor he brought me coffee and treated me with the deference half a million dollars commands i liked it id have to tell more people i was rich calling myself carla baines i explained to stuart that agnes paciorek had been my broker i was getting ready to place an order for several thousand shares of ajax when shed warned me away from the stock now that she was dead i was looking for a new broker what did bearden lyman know about ajax would they agree with ms pacioreks advice bearden didnt blink or blench on hearing agness name instead he told me what a tragedy her death was what a tragedy too that you couldnt feel safe working in your own office at night he then punched away at his computer and told me the stock was trading at its been going up the last few weeks maybe agnes had some inside news that the stock is cresting are you still interested im not in any hurry to invest i guess i should make up my mind about ajax in the next day or so though do you think you could scout around and let me know if you hear anything he looked at me closely if youve been thinking about this move for some time you must know theres a lot of talk about a covert takeover bid if thats the situation the price will probably continue to go up until the rumor is confirmed one way or another if youre going to buy you should do it now i spread my hands thats why i dont understand ms pacioreks advice thats why i came hereto see if you knew why shed warn me not to buy bearden called his research director the two had a short conversation our staff hasnt heard anything to counterindicate a buy order id be very happy to take it for you this morning i thanked him but said i needed to do some more research before i made a decision he gave me his card and asked me to let him know in a day or two bearden lyman was on the fourteenth floor of the stock exchange i rode the elevator down eleven floors to my next quarry gill turner rotenfeld by noon having talked myself dry in three different brokerage offices i beat a discouraged retreat to the berghoff for lunch ordinarily i dont like beer but their homemade dark draft is an exception a stein and a plate of sauerbraten helped recoup my strength for the afternoon everyone had given me essentially the same information id gotten from stuart bearden they knew the rumors about ajax and they urged me to buy none of them showed any dismay on hearing either agness name or my interest in ajax i wondered if id taken the wrong approach maybe i should have used my own name maybe i was barking up an empty tree perhaps a latenight burglar intent on computer terminals had found agnes and shot her i continued to prove that a woman with six hundred thousand dollars to invest gets redcarpet treatment id talked to no one but senior partners all morning and tilford sutton was no exception preston tilford would see me personally like the firms id visited that morning this one was mediumsized the names of twenty or so partners were on the outer door a receptionist directed me down a short hallway and through the trading room where a score of frantic young brokers manned phones and terminals i picked my way through the familiar stacks of debris to tilfords office in the far corner his secretary a pleasant curlyhaired woman in her late forties told me to go in tilford was nervous his fingernails bitten down to the quick this was not necessarily a sign of guilty knowledge at least not guilty knowledge about agnes most of the brokers id seen today were highstrung it must be nerveracking following all that money up and down he doodled incessantly as i pitched my tale to him ajax hmm he said when id finished i dont know i havehad a lot of respect for agness judgment it so happens were not recommending anyone to buy now either ms uh baines our feeling is that these takeover rumors have been carefully placed by someone trying to manipulate the stock the bottom could crash out at any time now if youre looking for a growth stock i have several here that i could recommend for you he pulled a stack of prospectuses from a desk drawer and shuffled through them with the speed of a professional card dealer i left with two hot prospects tucked into my bag and a promise to call again soon on my way to number seven i called my answering service and told them to take messages if anyone phoned asking for carla baines at fourthirty id finished with barretts list except for preston tilford everyone had recommended buying ajax he was also the only one who discounted the takeover rumors that didnt prove anything one way or another about him it might mean only that he was a shrewder broker than the restafter all only one man in one brokerage firm had recommended against buying baldwin when its stock was soaring and he was the only one out of the entire universe of security analysts who had been correct still tilfords recommendation against ajax was the sole unusual incident of the day so that was where i had to start back home i changed out of my business clothes into jeans and a sweater pulled on my lowheeled boots before charging into action i called the university of chicago and undertook the laborious process of tracking down phil paciorek someone finally referred me to a lab where he was working late phil its vi there was someone at your house yesterday whose name id like to know trouble is i dont know what he looks like only how his voice sounds i described the voice as best i could that could be a lot of different people he said dubiously no accent at all i repeated probably a tenor you know most people have some kind of regional accent he doesnt no midwestern nasal no drawl no extra boston rs sorry vi doesnt ring a bell if something occurs to me ill call you but thats too vague i gave him my phone number and hung up gloves pea jacket picklocks and i was set cramming a peanut butter sandwich into my coat pocket i clattered down the stairs into the cold january night back at the stock exchange a security guard in the hall asked me to sign in he didnt want any identification so i put down the first name that came to me derek hatfield i rode to the fifteenth floor got off checked the stairwell doors to see that they werent the kind that lock behind you and settled down there to wait at nine oclock a security guard came up the stairs from the floor below i slid back into the hallway and found a ladies room before he got to the floor at eleven the floor lights went out the cleaning women calling to each other in spanish were packing up for the night after they left i waited another half hour in case anyone had forgotten anything finally leaving the stairwell i walked down the hall to the offices of tilford sutton my boots clopping softly on the marble floor id brought a flashlight but fireexit lights gave enough illumination at the outer door i shone my flashlight around the edges to make sure there was no alarm offices in a building with internal security guards usually dont have separate alarms but its better to be safe than sorry pulling my detectives vade mecum from my pocket i tried a series of picklocks until i found one that worked no windows opened onto the outer office it was completely dark except for the green cursors flashing urgent messages on blank computer screens i shivered involuntarily and ran a hand across the burn spot on the back of my neck using my light as little as possible i picked my way past desks and mounds of papers to preston tilfords office i wasnt sure how often the security guards visited each floor and didnt want to risk showing a light tilfords door was locked too and took a few minutes of fumbling in the dark id learned to pick locks from one of my more endearing clients in the public defenders office but had never achieved the quickness of a true professional tilfords door was solid wood so i didnt have to worry about light shining through a panel as i did with the outer door closing it softly i flipped a switch and took my bearings one desk two filing cabinets try everything first to see whats locked and look in the locked drawers i worked as quickly as i could keeping my gloves on not really sure what i was trying to find the locked file cabinet contained files for tilfords private customers i picked a couple at random for close scrutiny as far as i could tell they were all in order not knowing what should be in a customer statement made it hard to know what to look forhigh debit balances maybe but tilfords customers seemed to keep on top of their accounts i handled the pages carefully leaving them in their original order and refiled them neatly i looked at the names one by one to see if any of his customers sounded familiar other than a handful of wellknown chicago business names i didnt see any i knew personally until i came to the ps catherine paciorek agness mother was one of prestons clients my heart beating a little faster i pulled out her file it too was in order only a small amount of the fabled savage fortune amassed by agness grandfather was handled at tilford sutton i noticed that mrs paciorek had purchased two thousand shares of ajax on december that made me raise my eyebrows a little hers was a bluechip portfolio with few transactions in fact ajax was the only company shed traded in worth pursuing further i could find no other clients trading in ajax stock yet tilford had registered many more than catherine pacioreks two thousand shares i frowned and turned to the desk this was carefully built of dark mahogany and the lock in the middle drawer was tough i ended up scratching the surface as i fumbled with the picklocks i stared at it in dismay but it was too late now to worry tilford kept an unusual collection in his private space besides a halfempty bottle of chivas which wasnt too surprising he had a fine collection of hardcore porn it was the kind of stuff that makes you feel we should work toward shaws idea of a disembodied mind i grimaced flipping through the whole stack to make sure nothing more interesting was interleafed after that i figured tilford owed me a drink and helped myself to some of the chivas in the bottom drawer i uncovered file folders of more clients perhaps his ultrapersonal supersecret accounts there were nine or ten of these including an organization called corpus christi i dimly remembered reading something about it recently in the wall street journal it was a roman catholic lay group made up primarily of wealthy people the current pope liked it because it was conservative on such important points as abortion and the importance of clerical authority and it supported rightwing governments with close church ties the pope liked the group so much according to the journal that hed appointed some spanish bishop as its leader and had himthe spaniardreporting directly to himthe pope this miffed the archbishop of madrid because these lay groups were supposed to report to their local bishops only corpus christi had a lot of money and the popes polish missions took a lot of money and no one was saying anything directly but the journal did some discreet reading between the ledger lines i flipped through the file looking at transactions for the corpus christi account it had started in a small way the previous march then it began an active trading program which ran to several million dollars by late december but no record existed of what it was trading in i wanted it to be ajax tilford sutton was supposed to have taken largish positions in ajax according to barrett yet the two thousand shares mrs paciorek bought in december were the only trace of ajax activity id seen in the office where were copies of corpus christis statement showing what it was actually buying and selling and why wasnt it in the file as was the case with the other customers tilfords office didnt include a safe using my flashlight as little as possible i surveyed the other offices a large modern safe stood in a supply room its door to be opened by someone who knew which eighteen numbers to punch on the electronic lock not me if corpus christis records were in there they were in there for good the bells at the nearby methodist temple chimed the hour two oclock i took the corpus christi and mrs paciorek files out to the main room and hunted around for a photocopier a large xerox machine stood in the corner it took a while to warm up using my flashlight surreptitiously i copied the contents of the two files to separate the pages i had to take off my gloves i stuffed them in my back pocket i had just finished when the night watchman came by and looked in through the glass panel like a total imbecile i had left tilfords office door ajar as the watchman fumbled with his keys i hit the off button and looked around desperately for a hiding place the machine had a paper cupboard built in underneath my fivefeeteight frame fit badly but i squeezed in and pulled the door as nearly shut as i could the watchman turned on the overhead lights through a crack in the door i watched him go into tilfords office he spent long enough in there to decide the place had been burglarized his voice crackled dimly as he used his walkietalkie to call for reinforcements he made a circuit of the outer room shining his flashlight in corners and closets apparently he thought the xerox machine held nothing but its own innards he walked past it stopped directly in front of me then returned to the inner office hoping he would stay there until help arrived i gently shoved the door open silently easing my cramped body onto the floor i crawled on hands and knees to the near wall where a window overlooked a fire escape i slid the window open as quietly as possible and climbed out into the january night the fire escape was covered with ice i almost ended my career forever as i skidded across its narrow iron platform saving myself with a grab at the burningcold railing id been holding both the originals and photocopies of tilfords documents as well as my flashlight these flew across the ice as i seized the guardrail cursing to myself i crawled precariously across the platform retrieving documents stuffing them into my jeans waistband with numbed fingers i pulled the gloves from my back pocket and put them on while skidding my way down as quickly as possible to the floor below the window was locked i hesitated only seconds then kicked it in brushing glass fragments away with my sweatshirted arm i soon had a hole big enough to climb through i landed on top of a desk covered with files these scattered in my wake i kept bumping into desks and cabinets as i tried running to the far door how could people get to their desks in the morning with so much clutter blocking their paths i cracked the outer door heard nothing and made my way down the hall i was about to open the stairwell door when i heard feet pounding on the other side turning back down the hail i tried every door miraculously one opened under my hand i stepped inside onto something squishy and was hit in the nose by someone with a stick fighting back i found myself wrestling a large mop outside i could hear the voices of two patrolmen agreeing in low murmurs about which parts of the floor to guard trying to move quietly i edged my way to the wall of the supply closet and ran into a coatrack clothes were hanging from it the regulation smocks of the cleaning women i fumbled in the dark pulled my jeans off stuck my documents inside the waistband of my tights and pulled on the nearest smock it came barely to my knees and was miles too large in the shoulders but it covered me hoping i was not covered with paper glass shards or blood and praying that these patrolmen had not dandled me on their knees thirty years ago i swung open the closet door the policemen were about twenty feet from me their backs turned you i screamed donning gabriellas thick accent they swirled around what goes on here eh i am calling manager i started off in righteous indignation to the elevator they were on me in an instant who are you me i am gabriella sforzina i work here i belong but you what you doing here anyway i started shouting in italian trusting none of them knew the words to madamina from don giovanni they looked at each other uncertainly take it easy lady take it easy the speaker was in his late forties not far from pension time not wanting any trouble someone broke into one of the offices upstairs we think he left by the fire escape you havent seen anyone on this floor have you what i shrieked adding in italian why do i pay taxes eh thats what i want to knowfor bums like you to let burglars in while im working so i can be raped and murdered i obligingly translated into english for them the younger one said uh look lady why dont you just go on home he scribbled a note on a pad and ripped off the sheet for me just give that to the sergeant at the door downstairs and hell let you out it was only then that i realized my gloves were lying with my jeans on the floor of the supply closet xiv fiery aunts mourning mothers lotty was not amused you sound just like the cia she snapped when i stopped by the clinic to tell her my adventure breaking into peoples offices stealing their files im not stealing the files i said virtuously i wrapped them up and mailed them back first thing this morning what troubles me from a moral standpoint is the jacket and gloves i left theretechnically their loss is a business expense yet will the irs turn me in if i itemize i should call my accountant do that she retorted her viennese accent was evident as always when lotty was angry now leave im busy and have no wish to talk to you in such a mood the breakin had made the late editions police speculated that the watchman interrupted the thief before he took anything of value since nothing of value was missing my prints are on file at the eleventh street station so i hoped none showed up that i couldnt reasonably account for as part of my business visit to tilfords office what would they make of derek hatfields name on the stock exchanges signin register i wondered i had to figure out some way of finding out if they questioned hatfield about whistling through my teeth i started the omega and headed out to melrose park despite lottys ill humor i was pleased with myself typical criminal failingyou carry off a coup then have to brag about it sooner or later one of your bragees tells the police snow was beginning to fall as i turned onto mannheim road small dry spitballs arctic snow no good for snowmen i was wearing long underwear under my navy pantsuit and hoped that would be enough protection against a minus wind chill some time today id have to find an armynavy surplus and get another pea jacket the priory of albertus magnus loomed coldly through the driving pellets i parked the car out of the wind as far as possible and fought my way to the priory entrance the wind sliced through suit and underwear and left me gasping for air inside the highvaulted stale hallway the sudden silence was palpable i rubbed my arms and stamped my feet and warmed myself before asking the anemic ascetic at the reception desk to find father carroll for me i hoped i was too early for evening prayers and too late for classes or confessions about five minutes later as the buildings essential chill began making me shiver father carroll himself came down the hall he was moving quickly yet not hurrying a man in control of his life and so at peace miss warshawski how nice to see you have you come about your aunt shes back today as she probably told you i blinked a few times back back here you mean no she hadnt told me i came i came to see if you could give me any information about a catholic lay organization called corpus christi hmm father carroll took my arm youre shivering lets get to my office and have a cup of tea you can have a nice chat with your aunt father pelly and father jablonski are there too i followed him meekly down the hall jablonski pelly and rosa were sitting at a deal table in pellys outer office drinking tea rosas steelcolored hair was as stiffly waved as though made in fact from cast iron she wore a plain black dress with a silver cross at the throat she was listening attentively to pelly as carroll and i came in at the sight of me her face changed victoria what are you doing here the hostility was so obvious that carroll looked astounded rosa must have noticed this but her hatred was too fierce for her to care about externals she continued to glare at me her thin bosom heaving i walked around the table to her and kissed the air by her cheek hello rosa father carroll says theyve brought you backas the treasurer i hope how splendid i know albert must be ecstatic too she looked at me malevolently i know well i cannot make you be quiet or stop you harassing me but perhaps in the presence of these holy fathers you will at least not strike me i dont know rosa depends on what the holy spirit prompts you to say to me dont bet on anything though i turned to carroll im rosas brothers only surviving granddaughter when she sees me it always chokes her up like this could i trouble you for that cup of tea glad of something to do to cover the tension carroll bustled with an electric kettle behind me when he handed me a cup i asked does this mean youve found who was responsible for the forgeries he shook his head his pale brown eyes troubled no father pelly persuaded me though that mrs vignelli really could not have been involved we know how valuable her work is and how much it means to herit seemed unnecessarily cruel to make her sit at home for months or years pelly put in actually were not sure they will ever clear the matter up the fbi seems to have lost interest do you know anything about it he looked questioningly at me i shrugged i get all my news from the daily papers i havent seen anything in there about the fbi dropping the investigation what has hatfield said to you carroll answered mr hatfield hasnt told us anything but since the real stocks turned up they dont seem to be as interested in the investigation could be derek doesnt talk too much to me i sipped some of the pale green tea it was warming that was the best that could be said for it i really came out here for a different reason a friend of mine was shot last week saturday i learned father pelly was a friend of hers too perhaps the rest of you knew heragnes paciorek carroll shook his head of course weve all been praying for her this week but augustine was the only person out here who knew her personally i dont think we can tell you much about her i didnt come about her or not directly about her she was shot while tracking down some information for an englishman i introduced her to that would make me feel responsible even if we hadnt been good friends i think she was looking at something connected with a catholic lay organization called corpus christi i wanted to know if you could tell me anything about it carroll smiled gently ive heard of it but i couldnt tell you much about it they like to operate secretlyso even if i were a member i couldnt tell you anything rosa said venomously and why do you want to know victoria to sling mud at the church more mud sorry rosa just because im not a catholic doesnt mean i go around persecuting the church no then why do you involve yourself in protest meetings on abortion i saw you at that demonstration last year outside the diocesan offices rosa dont tell me you were out there with the fetus worshippers were you the old woman who spat at a girl in a wheelchair rosas teacup clattered from the deal table to the uncarpeted linoleum floor the institutional mug was too heavy to break but tea spilled everywhere she leaped to her feet ignoring the tea dripping down the front of her black dress figlia di puttana she shouted mind your own business leave the business of good catholics alone carroll looked shocked whether from the unexpected outburst or because he understood italian i couldnt tell he took rosas arm mrs vignelli youre letting yourself get overexcited maybe the strain of this terrible suspicion has been too much for you im going to call your son and ask him to come pick you up he told jablonski to get some towels and sat rosa down in the rooms one armchair pelly squatted on the floor next to her he smiled chidingly mrs vignelli the church admires and supports those who support her but even ardor can be a sin if not held in check and used properly a good catholic welcomes all questions about the church and the faith even if you suspect your niece of scoffing at you and your faith treat her with charity if you turn the other cheek long enough thats how youll win her if you abuse her youll only drive her away rosa folded thin lips into an invisible line youre right father i spoke without thinking you will forgive me victoria i am old and small things affect me too much the charade of piety made me faintly ill i smiled sardonically and told her that was fine i could make allowances for her enfeebled state a young brother came in with an armful of towels rosa took these from him and cleaned herself floor and table with her usual angry efficiency she smiled bleakly at father carroll now if you will let me use the phone i will call my son pelly and carroll ushered her into the inner office i sat in one of the folding chairs at the table jablonski was eyeing me with lively curiosity do you usually rub your aunt the wrong way i smiled shes old little things get to her shes extremely difficult to work with he said abruptly weve lost a lot of parttime people over the years because of herno one can do anything perfectly enough for her for some reason she listens to gus but hes the only one who can make her see reason she even snaps at boniface and you have to be pretty thinskinned not to get along with him why keep her then whats all the anxiety to bring her back shes one of those indispensable battleaxes he grimaced she knows our books she works hard shes efficientand we pay her very little wed never get anyone with her skill or dedication for what we can afford to give her i grinned to myself served rosa right for all her antifeminist attacks to be the victim of wage discrimination herself she came out with pelly backbone as straight as ever ignoring me pointedly as she said goodbye to jablonski she was going to wait for albert in the entrance hall she announced pelly took her elbow solicitously and escorted her out the door the only man who could get along with rosa what a distinction for a fleeting moment i wondered what her life had been like when uncle carl was alive carroll came back into the outer office a few seconds later he sat down and looked at me for a while without talking i wished i hadnt let myself get caught up in rosas anger when he spoke it wasnt about my aunt do you want to tell me why youre asking about corpus christi and agnes paciorek i chose my words carefully the ajax insurance company is one of the countrys largest propertycasualty insurers one of their officers came to me a couple of weeks ago concerned that a covert takeover bid might be in the offing i talked to agnes about itas a broker she had ready access to trading news the night she died she called the man from ajax to tell him she was meeting with someone who might have information about the stock at the least that person was the last who saw her alive since heor shehasnt come forward it might even be the person who killed her now came the tricky part the only clue i have is some notes she scribbled some of the words made it clear she was thinking about ajax when she wrote them corpus christi appeared on that list it wasnt a memo or anything like that just the cryptic comments you make when youre writing while you think i have to start someplace so im starting with these notes carroll said i really cant tell you much about the organization its members guard their privacy zealously they take literally the injunction about doing your good works in secret they also take quasimonastic vows those of poverty and obedience they have some kind of structure with the equivalent of an abbot in all the locations where they have members and their obedience is to the abbot who may or may not be a priest he usually is even so hed be a secret member carrying out his parish duties as his regular work how can they take vows of poverty do they live in communes or monasteries he shook his head but they give all their money to corpus christi whether its their salary or inheritance or stockmarket earnings or whatever then the order gives it back to them according to their level of need and also the kind of lifestyle they need to maintain say you were a corporate lawyer theyd probably let you have a hundred thousand dollars a year you see they dont want any questions about why your living standard is so much lower than that of your fellow lawyers pelly came back into the room at that point lawyers prior i was trying to explain to miss warshawski how corpus christi works i dont really know too much about it do you gus just what you hear around why do you want to know i told him what id told carroll id like to see those notes pelly said maybe theyd give me some idea what the connection was in her mind i dont have them with me but the next time i come out ill bring them if i remembered to put something down on paper it was nearly fourthirty when i got back to the eisenhower and the snow was coming down as furiously as ever it was dark now too and nearly impossible to see the road traffic moved at about five miles an hour every now and then id pass some poor soul whod slid off the side completely as i neared the belmont exit i debated whether to go home and leave my next errand for an easier day two angry ladies in one afternoon was a little hard on the system but the sooner i talked to catherine paciorek the sooner id get her out of my life i continued north it was seven by the time i reached the half day road exit away from the expressway arteries the roads were unplowed i almost got stuck a few times on sheridan road and came to a complete halt just after turning onto arbor i got out and looked thoughtfully at the car no one in the paciorek house was likely to give me a push youd better be moving by the time i come back i warned the omega and set off to do the last half mile on foot i moved as quickly as possible through the deep snow glad of earmuffs and gloves but wishing desperately for a coat i let myself into the garage and rang the bell at the side entrance the garage was heated and i rubbed my hands and feet in the warmth while i waited barbara paciorek agness youngest sister answered the door she had been about six when i last saw her a teenager now she looked so much like agnes had when i first met her that a small shock of nostalgia ran through me vic she exclaimed did you drive all the way up from chicago in this terrible weather is mother expecting you come on in and get warm she led me in through the back hallway past the enormous kitchen where the cook was hard at work on dinner daddys stuck at the hospitalcant get home until they plow the side roads so were going to eat in about half an hour can you stay sure if your mother wants me i followed her across vaguely remembered hallways until we reached the front part of the house barbara led me into what the pacioreks called the family room much smaller than the conservatory perhaps only twenty or thirty feet across the room held a piano and an enormous fireplace mrs paciorek was doing needlepoint in front of the fire look whos dropped in mother barbara announced as though she was bringing a pleasant surprise mrs paciorek looked up a frown creased her handsome forehead victoria i wont pretend im happy to see you im not but there is something i wanted to discuss with you and this saves me the trouble of phoning barbara leave please the girl looked surprised and hurt at her mothers hospitality i said barbara theres something you could do for me if youd be good enough while your mother and i are talking could you find a filling station with a tow truck my omega is stuck about a half mile down the road if you call now they should have a truck free by the time i leave i sat in a chair near the fire across from mrs paciorek she put her needlepoint aside with a tidy anger reminiscent of rosa victoria you corrupted and destroyed the life of my oldest child is it any wonder that you are not welcome in this house catherine that is pig swill and you know it her face turned red before she could speak i regretted my rudenesstoday was my day for tangling with angry women agnes was a fine person i said gently you should be proud of her and proud of her success very few people achieve what she did and almost no women she was smart and she had guts she got a lot of that from you be proud feel pleased grieve for her like rosa she had lived with her anger too long to want to give it up i wont flatter you by arguing with you victoria it was enough for agnes to know i believed in something for her to believe the opposite abortion the war in vietnam worst of all the church i thought i had seen my family name degraded in every possible way i didnt realize how much i could have forgiven until she announced in public that she was a homosexual i opened my eyes very wide in public she actually announced it right in the middle of lasalle street out where every taxi driver in chicago could hear her i know you think youre being very funny but she might as well have screamed it in the middle of lasalle street everyone knew about it and she was proud of it proud of it archbishop farber even agreed to talk to her to make her understand the degradation she was subjecting her body to her own family as well and she laughed at him called him names the kinds of things you would think of i could tell you had led her into that just as you led her into all her other horrible activities and thento bring thatthat creature that vile thing to my daughters funeral just out of curiosity catherine what did agnes call archbishop farber her face turned alarmingly red again its that kind of thing that kind of attitude you have no respect for people i shook my head wrong i have a lot of respect for people i respected agnes and phyllis for example i dont know why agnes chose lesbian relations but she loved phyllis lording and phyllis loved her and they lived very happily together if five percent of married couples brought each other that much satisfaction the divorce rate wouldnt be what it is phyllis is an interesting woman shes a substantial scholar if you read her book sappho underground you might get some understanding of what she and agnes were all about in their life together how can you sit there and talk about thisperversion and dare compare it with the sacrament of marriage i rubbed my face the fire was making me a little lightheaded and sleepy were never going to agree about this maybe we should just agree not to discuss it anymore for some reason it brings you solace to be furious at agness way of living and it brings you further pleasure to blame it on me i guess i dont really care that muchif you want to be that blind about your daughters character and personality and how she made her choices thats your problem your views dont affect the truth and they only make one person miserable you maybe barbara some perhaps dr paciorek but youre the main sufferer why did you bring her to the funeral i sighed not to piss you off believe it or not phyllis loved agnes she needed to see her funeral she needed that ritual why am i talking youre not listening to what im saying anyway you just want to fuel your rage but i didnt come all the way out here in a snowstorm just to talk about phyllis lording although i enjoyed that i need to ask you about your stock transactions specifically how you came to buy two thousand shares of ajax last month ajax what are you talking about the ajax insurance company you bought two thousand shares on december second why her face had turned pale the skin looked papery in the firelight it seemed to me a cardiac surgeon would talk to his wife about the strain her wild mood changes put on her heart but they say you notice least about the ones youre closest to her iron control came through for her i dont expect you to understand what its like to have a lot of money i dont know what two thousand shares of ajax are worth almost a hundred twenty thousand at todays prices i put in helpfully yes well thats a fraction of the fortune my father left in my care its very possible my accountants thought it was a good yearend investment for transactions that small they wouldnt bother to consult me i smiled appreciatively i can understand that what about corpus christi youre an influential catholic what can you tell me about them please leave now victoria im tired and its time for my dinner are you a member catherine dont call me catherine mrs paciorek is appropriate and i would prefer you to call me miss warshawski are you a member of corpus christi mrs paciorek i never heard of it there didnt seem to be anything left to discuss at that point i started to leave then thought of something else and stopped in the doorway what about the woodsage corporation know anything about it maybe it was just the firelight but her eyes seemed to glitter strangely leave she hissed barbara was waiting for me at the end of the hallway where it angled off toward the back of the house your cars in the garage vic i smiled at her gratefully how could she have grown up so sane and cheerful with such a mother how much do i owe you twentyfive she shook her head nothing iim sorry mothers so rude to you so youre making up for it by towing my car i took out my billfold you dont have to do that barbara what your mother says to me doesnt affect how i feel about you i pushed the money into her hand she smiled with embarrassment it was only twenty i took the extra five back do you mind if i ask you something were you and agnes like mother keeps saying she broke off blushing furiously were your sister and i lovers no and while i love many women dearly ive never had women lovers it makes your mother happier though to think that agnes couldnt make her own decisions i see i hope youre not angry that you dont mind nope dont worry about it phone me sometime if you want to talk about your sister she was a good lady or give phyllis lording a call shed appreciate it very much xv the fire next time it was so late when i got home that i didnt check with my answering service until the next morning they told me then that roger had called several times and murray ryerson had also left a message i tried murray first i think i found your friend walter a man calling himself wallace smith was treated last thursday at st vincents for a broken jaw he paid cash for the visit which astounded the staff because he was there overnight and the bill came to more than a thousand dollars still you know what they saythe best medical care today costs no more than the cheapest nuclear submarine his address a fake im afraid so turned out to be a vacant lot in new town but we got a good description from the night nurse in the emergency room big surly guy with black curly hair bald in front no beard i gave it to my gofer at the police he said it sounded like walter novick hes a stevedore and usually uses a knife might explain why he didnt do so well with acid i didnt say anything and murray added penitently sorry not funny i guess anyway hes a free lance but hes done a lot of work for annunzio pasquale i felt an unaccustomed surge of fear annunzio pasquale local mob figure murder torture you name it yours for the asking what could i possibly have done to arouse the interest of such a man you there vic yes for a few more hours anyway send irises to my funeral ive never cared much for lilies sure kid you be careful who you open doors to look both ways before you cross halsted maybe ill run a little story on thismight make the mean streets a bit safer for you thanks murray i said mechanically and hung up pasquale it had to be the forgeries had to be if you wanted to create money and push it into circulation whos the first person youd hire a mafia man ditto for securities i dont frighten easily but im not the avengeri cant take on organized crime with my own bare hands if pasquale really was involved with the forgeries id graciously concede the round except for one thing my life had been threatened gratuitously not just my lifemy eyesight my livelihood if i gave in to that id never have a moments peace with myself again i frowned at a stack of newspapers on the coffee table there might be a way if i could talk to pasquale explain where our interests diverged explain that the matter of the securities would blow up in his face and just to leave that alone id turn the other cheek if he would withdraw his protection from novick i wondered how i could best get this message to the don an ad in the heraldstar would do the trick but might bring the law down on me hard and heavy too hatfield would love to be able to hold me on an obstructing federal justice charge i called a woman i know in the das office maggie v i warshawski i need a favor im on my way to court v can it wait this wont take longi just want to know some of don pasquales frontsrestaurants laundries anyplace i might be able to get discreetly in touch with him a long silence at the other end youre not so hard up youd work for him are you no way maggiei dont think i could stand up in court to an interrogation by you another pause then she said i guess im happier not knowing why you want to know ill call you when im freemaybe about three this afternoon i wandered restlessly around the apartment i was sure it wasnt pasquale whod been on the phone to me id seen him in the federal building once or twice heard him speak in a thick italian accent besides say pasquale was ultimately responsible for the forged stocks responsible for creating them he couldnt be the one who got them into the priory safe maybe he lived in melrose park maybe he went to church at the priory even so hed have to have bought off a lot of people there to get at the safe boniface carroll or augustine pelly as front men for the mafia ludicrous of course there was always rosa i snorted with laughter at the image of rosa as a mafia moll shed keep annunzio in line good and properyes no pasta for you tonight annunzio unless you burn my niece with acid i suddenly thought of my cousin albert i hadnt even included him in the picture before he was so much in rosas shadow but he was a cpa and the mob could always use good cpas and here he was fat forty unmarried dominated by this truly awful mother maybe that would rouse some antisocial spirit in himit would in me what if rosa had called me without his knowing it then afterward he talked her into sending me away for some bizarre reason he had stolen st alberts stocks and replaced them with counterfeits but when the investigation heated up he replaced them he could have gotten the combination to the safe at any time from rosa i continued to work up a case against albert while cooking curried eggs with peas and tomatoes for lunch i didnt know my cousin very well almost anything could go on behind that bloated amorphous exterior roger ferrant called again while i was halfway through the curried eggs i greeted him cheerfully vic youre sounding more like yourself again i want to talk to you sure have you learned something new about your ajax takeover no but theres something else i want to discuss with you can we have dinner tonight on an impulse still preoccupied with albert i not only agreed but even offered to cook after hanging up i cursed myselfthat meant cleaning up the damned kitchen feeling slightly aggrieved i scrubbed out a collection of stale pots and plates made the bed trudged through unshoveled sidewalks to the grocery where i bought a pot roast and cooked it like beef bourguignon with onions mushrooms salt pork and of course burgundy to show roger i didnt suspect him anymoreor at least not at the momenti decided to serve dinner wine in the red venetian glasses my mother had brought from italy she had originally carried out eight carefully wrapped in her underwear but one of them broke several years ago when my apartment was ransacked i now keep them in a locked cupboard in the back of my clothes closet when maggie called at fourthirty i realized one side benefit of heavy houseworkit definitely keeps your mind off your troubles id been too busy to think about don pasquale all afternoon her voice on the phone brought the clutch of fear back to my stomach i just took a brief glance through his files one of his favorite meeting places is torfinos in elmwood park i thanked her with as much heartiness as i could muster dont she said soberly i dont think im doing you any favor telling you this all im doing is speeding you on your way i know youd find it out for yourselfone of your newspaper pals would be glad to send you to your funeral just to generate a snappy story she hesitated you were always a maverick when you were on the public defenders rosteri hated appearing against you because i never knew what outrageous defense you might rig up i know youre a good investigator and i know you have a lot of pride if youre onto something that leads to pasquale call the police call the fbi theyve got the resources to handle the mob and even theyre fighting a losing battle thanks maggie i said weakly i appreciate the advice i really do ill think about it i got the number of torfinos restaurant when i called and asked for don pasquale the voice at the other end said brusquely hed never heard of such a man and hung up i dialed again when the same voice answered i said dont hang up if you should ever happen to meet don pasquale id like to give him a message yes grudgingly this is v i warshawski id like a chance to talk to him i spelled my last name slowly giving him my phone number and hung up by now my stomach was jumping in earnest i wasnt sure id be able to handle either roger or dinner let alone a combination of the two to relax i went into the living room and picked out scales on my mothers old piano deep diaphragm breaths now scales on a descending ah i worked vigorously for fortyfive minutes starting to feel some resonance in my head as i loosened up i really should practice regularly along with the red glasses my voice was my legacy from gabriella i felt better when roger arrived at seven with a bottle of taittingers and a bunch of white spider mums i was able to greet him cheerfully and return his polite kiss he followed me to the kitchen while i finished cooking i wished now i hadnt cleaned up this morning the place was such a mess id have to wash up again tomorrow i lost track of you at agness funeral i told him you missed a good old scene with some of her relatives just as well im not much of a scene person i dressed a salad and handed it to him and pulled the roast from the oven we went into the dining room roger uncorked the champagne while i dished out the dinner we ate without talking for a while roger staring at his place at last i said you said there was something you wanted to discussnot anything very pleasant i take it he looked up at that i told you im not interested in scenes and im afraid what i want to discuss has the makings of a row i set down my wineglass i hope youre not going to try to talk me into laying off my investigation that would lead to a firstclass fight no i cant say im crazy about it its the way you do it thats all youve closed me out of any discussion about that or anything youre doing i know we havent spent that much time together so maybe i dont have the right to have expectations about you but youve been damned cold and unfriendly the last few days since agnes was shot in fact youve been really bitchy i see i seem to have stirred up some people who are a lot bigger than me im afraid and i dont like that i dont know who i can trust and that makes it hard to be open and friendly with people even good friends his face twitched angrily what the hell have i done to deserve that i shrugged nothing but i dont know you that well roger and i dont know who you talk to listen i guess i am being bitchyi dont blame you for getting mad i got involved in a problem that was puzzling but didnt seem too dangerous my aunts thing with the fake stock sharesand the next thing i knew someone tried pouring acid in my eyes he looked shocked yes right on this very landing someone who wants me away from the priory i dont really think thats you but i dont know where its coming from and that makes me draw away from people i know its bitchy or im bitchy but i cant help it and then agness being shot i do feel kind of responsible because she was working on your problem and i sent you to her even if her being shot doesnt have anything to do with ajax which maybe it doesnt i still feel responsible she was working late and probably meeting someone involved in the takeover i know thats not very clear but do you understand he rubbed a hand through his long forelock but vic why couldnt you say any of this to me why did you just draw back i dont know its how i operate i cant explain it its why im a private eye not a cop or a fed well could you at least tell me about the acid you were here the night i got the first threatening phone call well they tried making good on it last week i anticipated the attack and broke the guys jaw and took the acid on my neck instead of my face still it was verywell shocking i thought i heard the man who made the phone call talking at agness funeral but when i tried to find him i couldnt i described the voice and asked roger if he remembered meeting anyone like that his voice it was like someone who didnt grow up speaking english and is disguising an accent or someone whose natural accent would be a strong drawl or something regional that hes trying to cover roger shook his head i cant differentiate american accents too well anyway but vic why couldnt you tell me this you didnt really think i was responsible for it did you no not really of course i just have to solve my own problems i dont plan to turn into a clinging female who runs to a man every time something doesnt work out right do you think you could find some middle way between those two extremes like maybe talking your problems over with someone and still solving them yourself i grinned at him nominating yourself roger its a possibility yes ill think about it i drank some more champagne he asked me what i was doing about ajax i didnt think i should spread my midnight adventure at tilford sutton too fara story like that is very repeatable so i just said id done a little digging i came across the name of a holding company woodsage i dont know that theyre involved in your problem but the context was a bit unusual do you think you could talk to your specialist and see if hes heard of them or to some of your corporate investment staff roger half bowed across the table oh wow legman for v i warshawski whats the male equivalent of a gangsters moll i laughed i dont know ill get you fitted out with a machine gun so you can do it in the best chicago style roger reached a long arm across the table and squeezed my free hand id like that something to tell them about in the box at lloyds just dont shut me out v or at least tell me why youre doing it otherwise i start imagining im being rejected and get complexes and other freudian things fair enough i disengaged my hand and moved around the table to his chair i dont blame men for loving long hair on women there was something erotic and soothing about running my fingers through the long mop that kept falling into ferrants eyes over the years ive noticed that men hate secrets or ambiguities sometimes i even feel like pampering them about it i kissed roger and loosened his tie and after a few minutes uncomfortable squirming on the chair led him into the bedroom we spent several agreeable hours there and fell asleep around ten oclock if we hadnt gone to bed so early my deepest sleep wouldnt have been over by threethirty i might have been sleeping too heavily for the smoke to wake me i sat up in bed irritated momentarily thinking i was back with my husband one of whose less endearing habits was smoking in bed however the acrid smell in no way resembled a cigarette roger i shook him as i started scrambling around in the dark for a pair of pants roger wake up the place is on fire i must have left a burner on in the kitchen i thought and headed toward it with some vague determination to extinguish the blaze myself the kitchen was in flames thats what they say in the newspapers now i knew what they meant living flames enveloped the walls and snaked long orange tongues along the floor toward the dining room they crackled and sang and sent out ribbons of smoke party ribbons wrapping the floor and the hallway roger was behind me no way v he shouted above the crackling he grabbed my shoulder and pulled me toward the front door i seized the knob to turn it and drew back scorched felt the panels they were hot i shook my head trying to keep panic at bay its on fire too i screamed fire escape in the bedroom lets go back down the hail now purple and white with smoke no air crawl on the ground on the ground past the dining room past the remains of the feast past my mothers red venetian glasses wrapped with care and taken from italy and the fascists to the precarious south side of chicago i dashed into the dining room and felt for them through the smog knocking over plates the rest of the champagne finding the glasses while roger yelled in anguish from the doorway into the bedroom wrapping ourselves in blankets shutting the bedroom door so opening the window wouldnt feed the hungry flames the flames that devoured the air roger was having trouble with the window it hadnt been opened in years and the locks were painted shut he fumbled for agonizing seconds while the room grew hotter and finally smashed the glass with a blanketed arm i followed him through the glass shards out into the january night we stood for a moment gulping in air clinging to each other roger had found his pants and was pulling them on he had bundled up all the clothes he could find at the side of the bed and we sorted out the leavings i had my jeans on no shirt no shoes one of my wool socks and a pair of bedroom slippers had come up in the bundle the freezing iron cut into my feet and seemed to burn them the slippers were motheaten but the leather was lined with old rabbit fur and cut out the worst of the cold i wrapped my naked top in a blanket and started down the slippery snowcovered steps clutching the glasses in one hand and the icy railing in the other roger wearing untied shoes trousers and a shirt came hard on my heels his teeth were chattering take my shirt vie keep it i called over my shoulder youre cold enough as it is ive got the blanket we need to wake up the kids in the secondfloor apartment your legs are so long you can probably hang over the edge of the ladder and reach the groundit ends at the second floor if youll take my mothers goblets and carry them down ill break in and get the students he started to argue chivalry and all that but saw there wasnt time i wasnt going to lose those glasses and that was that grabbing the snowcovered rung at the end of the escape with his bare hands he swung over the edge he was about four feet from the ground he dropped off and stretched up a long arm for the goblets i hooked my legs over one of the rungs and leaned over our fingertips just met im giving you three minutes in there vic then im coming after you i nodded gravely and went to the bedroom window on the second story while i pounded and roused two terrified youths from a mattress on the floor half my mind was working out a puzzle fire at the front door fire in the kitchen i might have started a kitchen fire by mistake but not one at the front door so why was the bottom half of the building not on fire while the top half was the studentsa boy and a girl in the bedroom another girl on a mattress in the living roomwere confused and wanted to pack their course notes i ordered them roughly just to get dressed and move i took a sweatshirt from a stack of clothes in the bedroom and put it on and bullied and harassed them out the window and down the fire escape the fire engines were pulling up as we half slid half jumped into the snow below for once i was grateful to our building super for not shoveling betterthe snow made a terrific cushion i found roger in front of the building with my firstfloor neighbors an old japanese couple named takamoku hed gone in for them through a groundfloor window the fire engines were drawing an excited crowd what fun a midnight fire in the flashing red lights of the engines and the blue of the police cars i watched avid faces gloating while my little stake in life burned roger handed me my mothers wineglasses and i cradled them shivering while he put an arm around me i thought of the other five locked in my bedroom in the heat and flames oh gabriella i muttered im so sorry xvi no one is lucky forever the paramedics hustled us off to st vincents hospital in a couple of ambulances a young intern curlyhaired and exhausted went through some medical rituals no one was badly hurt although ferrant and i both were surprised to find burns and cuts on our handswed been too keyed up during our getaway to notice the takamokus were badly shocked by the fire they had lived quietly in chicago after being interned during world war ii and the destruction of their tiny island of security was a harsh blow the intern decided to admit them for a day or two until their daughter could fly from los angeles to make housing arrangements for them the students were excited almost unbearably so they couldnt stop talking and yelling nervous reaction but difficult to bear when the authorities came in at six to question us they kept shouting and interrupting each other in their eagerness to tell their tale dominic assuevo was with the fire departments arson unit he was a hullshaped mansquare head short thick neck body tapering down to surprisingly narrow hips perhaps an exboxer or exfootball player with him were a uniformed fireman and bobby mallory id been sitting in a torpor anguished at the wreck of my apartment unwilling to think or move looking at bobby i knew id need to pull my wits together i took a deep breath it almost didnt seem worth the effort the weary intern gave exhausted consent for the police to question usexcept for the takamokus who had already been wafted into the hospitals interior we moved into a tiny office near the emergency room the hospital securitystaff room obligingly vacated by two drowsing security guards the eight of us made a tight fit the investigators and one of the students standing the rest in the rooms few chairs mallory looked at me in disgust and said if you knew what you looked like warshawski half naked and your boyfriend no better i never thought id see the day id be glad tony was dead but im thankful he cant see you now his words acted like a tonic the dying war horse staggers to its feet when it hears a bugle police accusations usually rouse me thank you bobby i appreciate your concern assuevo intervened quickly i want the full story on what happened tonight how you became aware of the fire what you were doing i was asleep i explained the smoke woke me up mr ferrant was with me we realized the kitchen was on fire tried the front door and found it was on fire too we got out by the fire escapei roused these kids he got mr and mrs takamoku thats all i know roger confirmed my story we both vowed that the people wed gotten up had been sound asleep at the time could they have been faking it assuevo wanted to know ferrant shrugged they could have been but they seemed pretty deep in sleep to me i wasnt concerned about that kind of thing mr assuevo just to get them up and out after thrashing that out assuevo went on to explore our feelings about the landlorddid any of us bear a grudge what kind of problems had we had with the apartment how had the landlord responded to my relief even the overwrought students sensed where those questions were going he was a landlord one of the girls said the thin longhaired one whod been in the living room the other two chimed in their agreement you know the place was clean and the rent was cheap we didnt care about anything else after a few more minutes of that assuevo murmured with bobby near the door he came back and told the students they could leave why dont you go too i said to roger its time you were getting down to ajax isnt it ferrant gripped my shoulder dont be an ass v ill call my secretary in a bitits only seven oclock well see this out together thank you mr ferrant assuevo said swiftly since you were in the apartment at the time of the fire we would have to ask you to stay anyway bobby said why dont you explain how you two know each other and why i looked coldly at mallory i can see where this is headed and i dont like it one bit if you are going to imply in any way that either mr ferrant or i knew anything about the fire we are going to insist on charges being brought before we answer any questions and my attorney will have to be present roger scratched his chin ill answer any questions thatll help solve this problemi assume everyone agrees the apartment was set on fire by an arsonistbut if youre charging me with breaking any laws id better call the british consul oh get off your high horse both of you i just want to know what you were doing tonight i grinned at him no you dont bobby itd make you blush assuevo stepped in again someone tried to kill you ms warshawski they broke the lock on the front door to get into the building they poured kerosene on your apartment door and set fire to it you want my opinion youre lucky to be alive now the lieutenant and i gotta make sure ms warshawski that there arent some bad guyshis eyebrows punctuated the remark to let me know that bad guys was facetious out there who are trying for you personally maybe its just someone with a grudge against the landlord and he goes after you as a sideline but maybe its against you okay and so maybe mr ferrant heresketching a gesture at rogeris assigned to make sure you stay in the apartment tonight so dont be such an angry lady the lieutenant and i were just doing our job trying to protect you unless maybe you set the fire yourself huh i looked at roger he pushed the hair out of his eyes and tried straightening a nonexistent tie before speaking i can see you have to look into that mr assuevo ive done my share of fireclaim investigations and i assure you i know you have to explore every possibility while youre doing that though maybe we can try to find out who actually set that fire he turned to me miss warshawski you dont think it could be the same person who threw no i interrupted him firmly before he could complete the sentence not at all then who if it was personally directedno not the people who shot agnes roger looked at mallory you know miss paciorek was murdered recently while looking into a takeover attempt for me now miss warshawskis trying to pick up that investigation this is something you really need to look into roger you goon i thought did that just occur to you mallory and assuevo were talking in unison threw what bobby was demanding while assuevo said whos miss paciorek when they quieted down i said to bobby do you want to explain agnes paciorek to mr assuevo lieutenant dont ride me warshawski he warned weve had our discussion on that if you or mr ferrant has some hard evidence to show she was killed because she was looking into those ajax buyers give it to me and ill follow it to the end but what youve told me so far doesnt add up to more than the kind of guilt we always find with friends and relationsshe was killed because i didnt do this or that or because i asked her to stay late or whatever you have anything to add to that mr ferrant roger shook his head but she told me she was staying late to talk to someone about the sales bobby sighed with exaggerated patience thats just what i mean youre the collegeeducated one vicki you explain to him about logic and moving from one argument to the other she was working late on ajax and she got shot wheres the connection ah assuevo said that stockbroker who was killed my sisters husbands niece is a cousin of her secretary do you think theres a connection with the fire ms warshawski i shrugged tell me something about the arson does it have a signature you recognize it could be the work of any professional quick clean minimum fuel no printsnot that we expect prints in the middle of january no evidence left behind it was organized ms warshawski organized so we want to know who is organizing against you maybe the enemies of ms paciorek mallory looked at me thoughtfully i know you vicki youre just arrogant enough to go stirring that pot without telling me what have you found its not arrogance bobby you made some really disgusting accusations the morning after agnes died i figure i dont owe you one thing not one name not one idea his round face turned red you dont talk to me that way young lady if you obstruct the police in the performance of their duties you can be arrested now what have you found out nothing i know who the chicago brokers were for the big blocks of ajax sales the last sixseven weeks you can get those from mr ferrant here thats what i know his eyes narrowed you know the firm of tilford and sutton stockbrokers yeah theyre on mr ferrants list you ever been to their offices i dont have anything to invest you wouldnt have been there two nights ago would you investigating their ajax sales at night stockbrokers do business during the day even i know that yeah clown someone broke into their offices i want to know if it was you there were eight or nine brokers on mr ferrants list were they all broken into he smashed his fist on the table to avoid swearing it was you wasnt it why bobby you keep telling me theres nothing to investigate there so why would i break in to investigate something that doesnt exist because youre pigheaded arrogant spoiled i always told tony and gabriella they should have more childrenthey spoiled you rotten well too late to cry about that now look ive had a rough night i want to find some place to crash and then try to get my life going again can i go back to the apartment and see if any of my clothes are salvageable assuevo shook his head we got a lot more to discuss here ms warshawski i need to know what youre working on oh yeah bobby put in ferrant here started to ask if it was the same person who threw something and you cut him off who threw what oh some kids on halsted threw a rock at the car the other nightrandom urban violence i dont think theyd set fire to my apartment just because they missed the car you chase them assuevo demanded you hurt them in some way forget it bobby told him it didnt happen she doesnt chase kids she thinks shes paladin or the lone ranger shes stirred up something big enough to hire a professional torch and now shes going to be a heroine and not say anything about it he looked at me his gray eyes serious his mouth set in a tight line you know tony warshawski was one of my best friends anything happens to you his and gabriellas ghosts will haunt me the rest of my life but no one can talk to you since gabriella died there isnt a person on this planet can get you to do something you dont want to do i didnt say anything there wasnt anything i could say cmon dominic lets go im putting a tail on joan of arc here thats the best we can do right now after he left the exhaustion swept over me again i felt that if i didnt leave now id pass out in the chair still wrapped in the blanket i forced myself to my feet accepting rogers helping hand gratefully in the hallway assuevo lingered a moment to talk to me ms warshawski if you know anything about this arson attempt and do not tell us you are liable for criminal prosecution he stabbed my chest with his finger as he talked i was too tired even to become angry i stood holding my glasses and watched him trot to catch up with bobby roger put an arm around me youre all done in old girl come back to the hancock with me and take a hot bath as we reached the outer door he felt in his pockets i left my wallet on your dresser no money for a cab you have any i shook my head he ran across the parking lot to where bobby and assuevo were climbing into bobbys police car i staggered drunkenly after him roger demanded a lift back to my apartment so he could try to rummage for some money and possibly some clothes the ride back down halsted was strained and quiet when we got to the charred remains of my building assuevo said i just want you to be very clear that that building may not be safe any accidents youre on your own thanks i said wearily you guys are a big help roger and i picked our way across ice mountains formed by the frozen jets of water from the fire trucks it was like walking through a nightmareeverything was familiar yet distorted the front door broken open by the firefighters hung crazily on its hinges the stairs were almost impassable covered with ice and grime and bits of walls that had fallen in at the secondfloor landing we decided to separate the stairs and floor might take the weight of one person but not two locked in my stubborn desire to cling to my mothers two surviving wineglasses i allowed roger to go ahead and stood holding them shivering in my slippers wrapped in the blanket he picked his way cautiously up to the third floor i could hear him going into my apartment heard the occasional thud of a brick or piece of wood falling but no crashes or loud cries after a few minutes he came back to the hallway i think you can come up vic i clutched the wall with one hand and stepped around the ice the last few stairs i had to do on hands and knees moving the glasses up a step then myself and so to the landing the front of my apartment had essentially been destroyed standing in the hail you could look directly into the living room through holes in the walls the area around the front door had been incinerated but by stepping through a hole in the livingroom wall you could stand on supporting beams such furniture as i owned was destroyed blackened by fire and soaked with water it was irrecoverable i tried picking out a note on the piano and got a deadened twang i bit my lip and resolutely moved past it toward the bedroom because bedroom and dining room were on either side of the main hall and the main path of the fire the damage there was less id never sleep in that bed again but it was possible by sorting carefully to find some wearable clothes i pulled on a pair of boots donned a smokefilled sweater and rummaged for an outfit that would carry me through the morning roger helped me pack what seemed restorable into two suitcases prying open their frozen locks what we dont take now i might as well kiss goodbyethe neighborhood will be poking through the remains before too long i waited until we were ready to leave before looking in the cupboard at the back of my closet i was too afraid of what id find fingers shaking i pried the door off its sagging hinges the glasses were wrapped carefully in pieces of old sheet i unrolled these slowly the first one i picked had a jagged piece broken from it i bit my lower lip again to keep it in order and unwrapped the other four they seemed to be all right i held them up to the dim morning light and twirled them no cracks or bubbles roger had been standing silently now he picked his way across the debris all well ones broken maybe someone could glue it thoughits just one big piece the only other valuables in the cupboard were gabriellas diamond drop earrings and a necklace i put these in my pocket rewrapped the glasses and placed them in one suitcase and put on the shoulder holster with my smith wesson in it i couldnt think of anything else i desperately needed to keep unlike peter wimsey i collect no first editions such kitchen gadgets as i owned could be replaced without too much grief as i started lugging the suitcases to the hole in the livingroom wall the phone rang roger and i looked at each other startled it never occurred to us that ma bell could keep the wires humming after a fire i managed to find the livingroom extension buried under some plaster yes miss warshawski it was my smoothvoiced friend you were lucky miss warshawski but no one is lucky forever xvii the fallen knight we drove down to the hancock in the omega i let roger out with my baggage and went to find street parking by the time i staggered back to his apartment i knew i wasnt going to be able to do anything until i got some sleep pasquale rosa albert and ajax whirled muzzily through my brain but walking was so difficult that thinking was impossible roger let me in and gave me a set of keys he had showered his face was gray with fatigue but he didnt think he could take the day off with so many rumors flying around about the takeovermanagement was meeting daily mapping strategy he held me tightly for a few minutes i didnt say much at the hospital because i was afraid i might ruin your story but please vic please dont run off into anything stupid today i like you better in one piece i hugged him briefly all i care about right now is getting some sleep dont worry about me roger thanks for the place to stay i was too tired to bathe too tired to undress i just managed to pull my boots off before falling into bed it was past four when i woke again stiff and foggy but ready to start moving again i realized with distaste that i stank and my clothes stank too a small utility room next to the bathroom held a washing machine i piled in jeans underwear and everything in the suitcases that didnt require dry cleaning a long soak in the bathtub and i felt somewhat more human as i waited for my jeans to dry i called my answering service no message from don pasquale but phil paciorek had phoned and left his oncall number i tried it but he apparently was handling some emergency surgery i gave ferrants number to the hospital and tried torfinos restaurant again the same gritty voice id talked to the day before continued to disclaim all knowledge of don pasquale the early evening editions had arrived in the downstairs lobby i stopped in the coffee shop to read them over a cappuccino and a cheese sandwich the fire had made the herald stars front pagearson on the north side in the lower left corner interview with the de paul students interview with the takamokus worried daughter then in a separate paragraph with its own subhead v i warshawski whose apartment was the focal point of the fire has been investigating a problem involving forged securities at the priory of albertus magnus in melrose park ms warshawski the victim of an acidthrowing mugger two weeks ago was not available for comment on a connection between her investigation and the fire i ground my teeth thanks a bunch murray the heraldstar had already run the acid story but now the police were bound to read it and see the connection i drank some more cappuccino then flipped to the personal section of the classifieds a small message was waiting for me the oak has sprouted uncle stefan and i had agreed on this since hed been working with my certificates of acorn stock i had last looked at the personals on sunday today was thursday how long had the ad been running roger was home when i got back to the apartment he told me apologetically that he was all done in could i manage dinner alone while he went to bed no problem i slept all day i helped him into bed and gave him a backrub he was asleep by the time i left the room i pulled on long underwear and as many sweatshirts as i could manage then walked back to lake shore drive to retrieve my car a wind blowing across the lake cut through my pullovers and long underwear tomorrow id definitely stop at armynavy surplus for a new pea jacket i wondered about the tail bobby claimed he was going to slap on me no one had followed me to my car looking in the rearview mirror i didnt see any waiting cars and no one would loiter on the street in this wind i decided it must have been bravadoor someone had countermanded bobby the omega started only after severe grumbling we sat and shivered together the car refusing to produce any heat a fiveminute warmup finally persuaded the transmission to groan into gear while side streets were still piled with snow lake shore drive was clear after a few turgid blocks the car moved north briskly at montrose the heater finally kicked grudgingly into life at the evanston border i had stopped shivering and was able to pay more attention to traffic and road conditions the night was clear on dempster the heavy rushhour traffic was moving well i spun off onto crawford avenue and made it to uncle stefans a few minutes before seven before leaving the car i jammed the smith wesson into the front of my jeans where the butt dug into my abdomenthe pullovers made a shoulder holster impractical whistling through my teeth i rang uncle stefans bell no answer i shivered in the entryway a few minutes and rang again it hadnt occurred to me that he wouldnt be home i could wait in the car but the heater wasnt very efficient i rang the other bells until someone buzzed me inone in every building letting the muggers and buggers in uncle stefans apartment was on the fourth floor on my way up i passed a pretty young woman coming down with a baby and a stroller she looked at me curiously are you going to visit mr herschel ive been wondering whether i should look in on himim ruth silversteini live across the hall when i take mark for a walk at four he usually comes out to give us cookies i didnt see him this afternoon he could have gone out i could see her flush in the stairway light im home alone with the baby so maybe i pay more attention to my neighbors than i should i usually hear him leavehe walks with a cane you know and it makes a particular kind of noise on the stairs thanks mrs silverstein i trotted up the last flight of stairs frowning uncle stefan was in good health but eightytwo years old did i have any right to break in on him did i have a duty to do so what would lotty say i pounded loudly on the heavy apartment door put an ear to the panel and heard nothing no a faint buzz of noise the tv or radio shit i went back down the stairs two at a time propped open the outer door with a glove and jogged across the slippery sidewalk to the omega my picklocks were in the glove compartment as i dashed back into the building i watched mrs silverstein and mark disappear into a small grocery store up the block i might have ten minutes to get the door open the trick about prying open other peoples doors is to relax and go by feel uncle stefan had two locks a deadbolt and a regular yale i worked the deadbolt first it clicked and i realized with dismay that it had been open when i started on it id just doublelocked the door trying to breathe loosely i chivvied it the other way it had just slid back when i heard mrs silverstein come into the building at least judging from the sounds thats who it was someone talking briskly to a baby about the nice chicken daddy would have when he got back from his late meeting the stroller bumped its way to the fourthfloor landing the lower lock clicked back and i was inside i picked my way past an imari umbrella stand into the ornately decorated living room in the light of a brass lamp i could see uncle stefan lying across the leather desk its green dyed redbrown by a large congealing pool of blood oh christ i muttered while i felt the old mans wrist all i could think of was how furious lotty would be unbelievably a faint pulse still fluttered i leaped over chairs and footstools and pounded on the silverstein door mrs silverstein opened it at onceshed just come home coat still on baby still in stroller get an ambulance as fast as you canhes seriously injured she nodded matteroffactly and bustled into the interior of her apartment i went back to uncle stefan grabbing blankets from a tidy bed in a room off the kitchen wrapping him lowering him gently on the floor raising his feet onto an intricately cut leather footstool and then waiting waiting mrs silverstein had sensibly asked for paramedics when they heard about shock and blood loss they set up a couple of dripsplasma and glucose they were taking him to ben gurion memorial hospital they told me adding that they would make a police report and could i wait in the apartment please as soon as they were gone i phoned lotty where are you she demanded i read about the fire and tried phoning you yes well that can wait its uncle stefan hes been seriously wounded i dont know if hell live theyre taking him to ben gurion a long silence at the other end then lotty said very quietly wounded shot stabbed i think he lost a lot of blood but they missed the heart it had clotted by the time i found him and that was when about ten minutes ago i waited to call until i knew what hospital hed be going to i see well talk later she hung up leaving me staring at the phone i prowled around the living room waiting for the police trying not to touch anything as the minutes passed my patience ran out i found a pair of gloves in a drawer in the tidy bedroom they were several sizes too large but they kept me from leaving prints on the papers on the desk i couldnt find any stock certificates at allnot forged not my acorn shares the room while crowded with furniture held few real hiding places a quick search revealed nothing suddenly it occurred to me that if uncle stefan had made a forged stock certificate hed have to have tools lying around tools the police would be just as happy not seeing i sped up my search and found parchment blocks and tools in the oven i bundled them up into a paper bag and went to find mrs silverstein she came to the door cheeks red hair frizzled from heat she must have been cooking sorry to bother you again ive got to wait here for the police and ill probably have to go to the station with them mr herschels niece will be by later for some things would you mind if i told her to ring your bell and pick this bag up from you she was happy to help how is he what happened i shook my head i dont know the paramedics didnt say anything but his pulse was steady even though it was weak well hope for the best she invited me in for a drink but i thought it best not to give the police any ideas connecting the two of us and waited for them across the way two middleaged men finally arrived both in uniform they came in with guns drawn when they saw me they told me to put my hands on the wall and not to move im the person who called you im just as surprised by all this as you are well ask the questions honey the speaker had a paunch that obscured his gunbelt he patted me down clumsily but found the smith wesson without any trouble you got a license for this girlie yup i said lets see it mind if i take my hands off the wall hampers any movements dont be a wiseass get the license and get it fast this was the second cop leaner with a pockmarked face my purse was on the floor near the doorid dropped it without thinking when i saw uncle stefan and hadnt bothered to pick it up i pulled out by billfold and took out my pi license and my permit for the gun the stout cop looked them over oh a private eye what are you doing here in skokie girlie i shook my head i hate suburban police the bagels in chicago arent as good as the ones they make out here fat cop rolled his eyes we picked up joan rivers stu listen joan this aint chicago we want to put you away we can wont worry us none now just tell us what you were doing here waiting for you guys clearly a mistake the lean cop slapped my face i knew better than to react up here resisting arrest could stick and id lose my license come on girlie my partner asked you a question you going to answer it you guys want to charge me if so ill call my lawyer if not no questions the two looked at each other better call your lawyer girlie and well be hanging onto the gun not really a ladys weapon xviii in the slammer the d a was mad at me that didnt bother me too much mallory was furioushed read about the acid in the heraldstar i was used to mallorys rage when roger learned id spent the night in a skokie lockup his worry turned to frustrated anger i thought i could handle that but lotty lotty wouldnt speak to me that hurt it had been a confused night pockmark and fatso booked me around ninethirty i called my lawyer freeman carter who wasnt home his thirteenyearold daughter answered she sounded like a poised and competent child but there wasnt any way of telling when shed remember to give her father the message after that we settled down for some serious questioning i decided not to say anything since i really didnt have much of a story i wanted to tell i couldnt tell the truth and with the mood lotty was in shed be bound to screw up any embroidery i came up with pockmark and fatso gave way to some senior cops fairly early in the evening it must have been around midnight when charles nicholson came in from the das office i knew charles he was a figure in the cook county court system he liked to think he was an heir of clarence darrow and resembled him superficially at least as far as shaggy hair and a substantial stomach went charles was the kind of guy who liked to catch his subordinates making personal phone calls on county time wed never been what you might call close well well warshawski feels like old times you me a few differences and a table between us hello charlie i said calmly it does seem like old times even down to your shirt not quite meeting at the sixth button he looked down at his stomach and tried pulling the straining fabric together then looked at me furiously still your old flippant self i seeeven on a murderone charge if its murder one they changed the booking without telling me i said irritably and that violates my miranda rights better read the charge slip and doublecheck it no no he said in his mayonnaise voice youre right just a manner of speaking obstruction was and is the charge lets talk about what you were doing in the old mans apartment warshawski i shook my head not until i have legal advicein my opinion anything i say on that topic may incriminate me and since i dont have specific knowledge of the crime there isnt anything i can do to forward the police investigation that was the last sentence i uttered for some time charlie tried a lot of different tacticsinsults camaraderie highflown theories about the crime to invite my comments i started doing some squad exercisesraise the right leg hold for a count of five lower raise the left counting gave me a way to ignore charlie and the exercises rattled him id gotten to seventyfive with each leg when he gave up things changed at twothirty when bobby mallory came in were taking you downtown he informed me i have had it up to herehe indicated his neckwith your smartass dancing around telling the truth when you feel like it how dared youhow dared you give that acid story to ryerson and not tell us this morning we talked to your friend ferrant a few hours ago im not so dumb i didnt notice you cutting him off this morning when he started to ask if these were the same people who threw something acid you should be in cook county psychiatric and before the nights over youre either going to spill what you know or were going to send you there and make it stick that was just talk and bobby knew it half of him was furious with me for concealing evidence and half was plain mad because i was tonys daughter and might have gotten myself killed or blinded i stood up okay you got it although murray ran the acid story when it happened just get me out of the suburbs and away from charlie and ill talk and the truth warshawski you cover up anything anything and well have you in jail i dont care if i run you in for dope possession i dont do dope bobby they find any in my place its planted anyway i dont have a place his round face turned red im not taking it warshawski youre two sentences away from cook county no smartassing no lies got it got it bobby got the skokie people to drop charges and took me away technically i wasnt under arrest and didnt have to go with him i also wasnt under any illusions the driver was a likable young man who seemed willing to chat i asked him whether he thought the cubs were going to let rick sutcliffe go one blistering remark from bobby shut him up however so i discoursed alone on the topic my feeling is sutcliffe turned that team around after the allstar break so he wants five six million its worth it for another crack at the world series when we got to eleventh street bobby hustled me into an interrogation room detective finchley a young black cop whod been in uniform when i first met him joined us and took notes bobby sent for coffee shut the door and sat behind his cluttered desk no more about sutcliffe and gary matthews just the facts i gave him the facts i told him about rosa and the securities and the threatening phone calls i told him about the attack in the hallway and how murray thought it might be walter novick and i told him about the phone call this morning when i went back for my clothes no one is lucky forever and what about stefan herschel what were you doing there the day he was stabbed just chance is he all right no way warshawski im asking the questions tonight what were you doing at his place hes an uncle of a friend of mine you know dr herschel hes an interesting old man and he gets lonely he wanted me to have tea with him tea so you let yourself in the door was open when i got therethat worried me ill bet the girl across the hall says the door was shut and that worried her not standing openjust not locked bobby held up my collection of picklocks you wouldnt have used these by any chance i shook my head dont know how to use themtheyre a souvenir from one of my clients when i was a public defender and you carry them around for sentiment after what eight years as a pi come on lets have it you got it bobby you got the acid you got novick you got rosa talk to derek hatfield why dont you id be real curious who was backing the fbi off those securities im talking to you and speaking of hatfield you wouldnt know why his name was on the register at the stock exchange would you the night someone broke into tilford and suttons office you ask hatfield what he was doing there he says he wasnt i shrugged the feds never tell you anything you know that well neither do you and youve got less excuse to hold back why were you visiting stefan herschel he invited me yeah your apartment burned down last night so today youve been feeling chipper youll just go to tea in skokie damn it vicki level with me mallory was truly upset he doesnt hold with swearing around women finchley looked worried i was worried too but i just couldnt blow the whistle on stefan herschel the old man had got himself killed or close to it on account of the forgery i didnt want to get him arrested too at five bobby charged me with concealing evidence of a crime i was printed photographed and taken to the holding cells at twentysixth and california with some rather disgruntled prostitutes most wore highheeled boots and very short skirtsjail must at least have been a warmer place on a january night than rush and oak there was a little hostility at first as they tried to make sure i wasnt working any of their territories sorry ladiesim just here on a murder charge yeah my old man i explained yeah the bastard beat me but the last straw was when he tried to burn me i showed them my arms where the fire had scorched the skin lots of sympathetic clucking oh honey you did right man touch me that way i stick him oh yeah member when freddie tried to cut me i throw boil water on him they quickly forgot me as each tried to outdo the other with tales of male violence and bravado in handling it the stories made my skin crawl at eight though when the freddies and slims and jjshowed up to collect them they acted glad enough to see them home is where they have to take you in i guess freeman carter came for me at nine hes the partner in crawford meademy exhusbands highprestige firmwho does their criminal stuff its a constant thorn to dickmy exthat freeman does my legal work but not only is he good in a smooth waspy way he likes me hi freeman the other pimps got their hookers out an hour ago i guess im not very valuable merchandise hi vic if you had a mirror youd see why your street value has plummeted youre going to have a hearing in womens court at eleven just a formality and theyll release you on an ibond an ibond as in isolemnlysweartocomebackforthetrial is given to people the court knows as responsible citizens like me freeman lent me a comb and i made myself as presentable as possible we went down the hall to a small meeting room freeman looked as elegant as ever his pale blond hair cut close to his head smoothshaven his perfectly tailored navy suit fitted to his lean body if i looked only half as grubby as i felt i must be pretty disgusting freeman glanced at his watch want to talk they booked you because they felt you were withholding on stefan herschel i was i admitted how is he i called the hospital on my way over here hes in intensive care but seems to have stabilized i see i felt a lot better already you know he had a forgery rap back in the fifties well im afraid someone knifed him because he was playing boy detective on some stock forgeries but i cant tell bobby mallory until ive talked to the old man i just dont want to get him in trouble with the police and the feds freeman made a sour face if i were your pimp id beat you with a clothes hanger since im just your lawyer could i urge you to tell mallory all you know hes a good cop hes not going to railroad an eightyyearold man he might not but derek hatfield would in thirty seconds less and once the feds move in there isnt shit bobby or i or even youcan do freeman remained unconvinced as i told him about the forgeries and uncle stefans role in them but he swept me through the hearing with aplomb he kissed me goodbye afterward when he dropped me at the roosevelt road l stop and that is proof of devotion vic you are badly in need of a bath i rode the l to howard street caught the skokie swift and walked the ten blocks from the station to my car a bath a nap roger lotty and uncle stefan those were priorities in reverse order but i needed to get clean before i could face talking to anyone else the priorities got reversed a bitroger was waiting for me when i got back to the hancock he was on the phone apparently with ajax i sketched a wave and headed for the bathroom he came in ten minutes later as i was lying in the tub trying to lie in the tub it was one of those nasty modern affairs where your knees come up to your chin my apartment had a wonderful thirties bath long enough for a tall person to lie down in it roger closed the toilet and sat on it the police woke me at one this morning to ask me about your acid burn i told them everything i knew which was damned little i had no idea where you were what you were doing what danger you might be in i begged you yesterday morning not to do anything stupid but when i wake up at one in the morning and youre not here no notegoddamn it why did you do this i sat up in the tub i had an eventful evening saved an old mans life then spent five hours in a skokie jail and four in a chicago one i got one phone call and i needed it for my lawyer since he wasnt home only his kid i couldnt send messages to my friends and relations but damn it vic you know im worried sick about you and this whole businesshe waved an arm indicating frustration and incoherence why the hell didnt you leave me a note i shook my head i didnt think i was going to be gone long gosh roger if id known what i was going to find i would have written you a novel thats not the point you know its not we talked about this last night or two nights ago whenever the hell your place burned down you cant just slide off and leave everyone else gasping for air i was starting to get angry too you dont own me ferrant and if my staying here makes you think you do ill leave at once im a detective im paid to detect things if i told everyone and his dog rover what i was up to not only would my clients lose all confidence in me id be sandbagged everywhere i went you told the cops everything you knew if youd known everything i know a poor old man would be under arrest right now as well as in intensive care roger looked at me bleakly his face pale maybe you should leave vic i dont have the stamina for any more nights like this but let me tell you one thing wonder woman if youd shared what you were doing with me i wouldnt have had to tell the copsid have known that you didnt need their particular help i told them not to sandbag you but to protect you anger was tightening my vocal cords no one protects me roger i dont live in that kind of universe i wouldnt screw around with some business deal you were cutting just because there are a lot of dangerous and unscrupulous people dealing in your world you want to talk to me about your work ill listen and try to make suggestions if you want them but i wont try to protect you i got out of the tub well give me the same respect just because the people i deal with play with fire instead of money doesnt mean i need or want protection if i did how do you think id have survived all these years i was clenching and unclenching my fists trying to keep rage under control protection the middleclass dream my father protecting gabriella in a milwaukee avenue bar my mother giving him loyalty and channeling her fierce creative passions into a south chicago tenement in gratitude roger picked up a towel and began soberly drying my back he wrapped it around my shoulders and gave me a hug i tried to relax but couldnt vic i have to go screw around in some business deals youre righti glory in knowing i can come out on top in a real scrum if you sailed in and dislocated someones thorax or whatever you do id be furious i dont think i own you but the remoter you get the more i need something to grab hold of i see i turned around i still think it would be easier on both of us if i found another place to stay but illill try to keep in better touch i stood on my toes and kissed him gently the phone rang i went to the dryer where id left my clothes and pulled out fresh jeans and another shirt while roger picked up the bathroom extension for you vic i took it in the bedroom roger said he was leaving and hung up the caller was phil paciorek you still want your man with the nonaccent theres an archdiocesan dinner tonight at the hanover house hotelfarbers giving a party for ofaolin because mother shells out a million or so to the church every year were invited most of the people at the funeral will be there want to be my date an archdiocesan dinner thrills that meant a dress and nylons which meant a trip to the shops as anything even remotely suitable for the hanover house was still lying smokefilled in my suitcase since phil wouldnt be able to leave the hospital until seven he asked if id mind meeting him at the hotelhed be there as close to seventhirty as possible and ive called the archdioceseif im not there just give your name to the woman at the reception desk after that i tried taking a nap but i couldnt sleep lotty uncle stefan don pasquale were churning around in the foreground of my brain along with rosa and albert and agnes at noon i gave up on rest and tried calling lotty carol alvarado the nurse at lottys north side clinic answered the phone she went to find the doctor but came back with the message that she was too busy to talk to me right now i walked across the street to water tower and found a severely tailored crimson wool crepe dress on sale at lord taylor in front it had a scalloped neck in back the neckline dropped to a v closing just above my bra strap i could wear my mothers diamond drops with it and be the belle of the ball back at the hancock i tried lotty again she was still too busy to talk i got the morning paper and looked through the classifieds for furnished apartments after an hour of calling i found a place on racine and montrose that offered twomonth leases i packed the suitcase again mushing laundered clothes together with the smokestained ones then left a long note to roger explaining where i was moving and what i was doing for dinner and could we please stay in touch and tried lotty one last time still too busy the bellerophon had seen better days but it was well cared for for two fifty a month i had possession of a sitting room with a murphy bed a comfortable armchair a small tv and a respectable table the kitchen included a minuscule refrigerator and two gas burners no oven while the bathroom had a real tub in it good enough the room had phone jacks if the neighborhood vandals hadnt walked off with my phones i ought to be able to get service switched through i gave mrs climzak a check for the first months rent and left my old apartment looked forlorn in the winter sunlight manderley burned outbroken glass in the windows the takamokus print curtains sagging on their rods i climbed past the debris on the stairs through the hole in the livingroom wall the piano was still theretoo big to movebut the sofa and coffee table were gone charred copies of forbes and the wall street journal were scattered around the room the livingroom phone had been ripped out of the wall in the dining room someone had swiped all the liquor naturally most of the plates were gone thank god id never had enough money for crown derby my bedroom extension was still there buried under a pile of loose plaster i unplugged it from the wall and left stopped at the lincoln park post office to arrange forwarding for my mail and pick up what theyd held for me since the fire then gritting my teeth i drove north on sheffield to lottys storefront clinic the waiting room was full of women and small children a din combined of spanish korean and lebanese shrieks made the small space seem even tinier babies crawled on the floor with sturdy wooden blocks in their fists lottys receptionist was a sixtyyearold woman whod raised seven children of her own her chief skills were keeping order in the waiting room and making sure that people were seen in order either of appearance or emergency she never lost her temper but she knew her clientele like a good bartender and kept order the same way miss warshawski nice to see you we have a pretty full house todaylots of winters cold and flu is dr herschel expecting you mrs coltrain would not call anyone by her first name after years of coaxing lotty and i had given up no mrs coltrain i stopped by to see how her uncle was doing to find out if i can visit him mrs coltrain disappeared into the back of the clinic she came back with carol alvarado a few minutes later carol told me lotty was with a patient but would see me for a few minutes if id go into her office lottys office like the waiting room was furnished to set worried mothers and frightened children at ease she didnt need a desk she saidafter all mrs coltrain kept all the files in file cabinets instead a few comfortable chairs pictures a thick carpet and the ever present building blocks made the room a cheerful place today i didnt find it relaxing lotty made me wait half an hour i thumbed through the journal of surgical obstetrics i drummed my fingers on the table next to my chair did leg lifts and a few other stretches at four lotty came in quietly above her white lab coat her face was set in uncompromising lines i am almost too angry to speak to you vic fortunately my uncle has survived and i know he owes his life to you but he almost owes his death to you too i was too tired for another fight today i ran my hands through my hair trying to stimulate my brain lotty you dont have to work to make me feel guilty i do i should never have involved him in such a crazy dangerous business all i can say is ive taken my share of the knocks if id known what was coming i would have done my utmost to keep him from being attacked i laughed mirthlessly a few hours ago i had a blazing fight with roger ferranthe wants to protect me from arsonists and suchlike now youre fighting me because i didnt protect your uncle lotty didnt smile he wants to talk to you i tried to forbid thishe doesnt need any more excitement or strain but it seems to be more stress to keep him from you than otherwise the police want to question him and hes refusing until hes seen you lotty hes an old man but hes a sane man he makes his own choices dont you think some of your anger comes from that and from helping me involve him i do my best with my clients but i know i cant help all of them not a hundred percent dr metzinger is in charge of his case ill call and let him know youll be outwhen i gave up the argument and looked at my watch i could just make it and dress for dinner if i went now in half an hour she nodded and left xix dinner date ben gurion hospital lay close to the edens visible from the expressway it was easy to get to it was barely five oclock when i got out of the car in the hospital parking lot even after stopping to buy a pea jacket at an amvets store its always struck me as the ultimate insult to pay to park at hospitals they incarcerate your friends and relations in rooms that cost six or seven hundred dollars a day then put a little sting in by charging a few extra bucks to visit them i pocketed the lot ticket with ill humor and stomped into the lobby a woman at the information desk called the evening nurse in intensive care then told me i was expected to go on up five oclock is a quiet time in a hospital surgery and therapies are over for the day the evening visitors havent started arriving yet i followed red arrows painted on deserted hallways up two flights of stairs to the intensivecare unit a policeman sat outside the door to the unit he was there to protect uncle stefan the night nurse explained would i mind showing identification and letting him pat me down i thoroughly approved the caution at the back of my mind was the fear that whoever had stabbed the old man might return to finish the job the policeman satisfied medical hygiene had to be accommodated i put on a sterile mask and disposable gown in the changingroom mirror i looked like a stranger gray eyes heavy with fatigue hair windtangled the mask disguising my personality i hoped it wouldnt terrify a weak old man when i came out dr metzinger was waiting for me he was a balding man in his late forties he wore gucci loafers and had a heavy gold bracelet on his left wrist got to spend the money somehow i guess mr herschel has insisted so hard on talking to you we thought it best for you to see him he said in a low voice as though uncle stefan might hear and be disturbed i want you to be very careful though hes lost a lot of blood been through a very severe trauma i dont want you to say anything that might cause a relapse i couldnt afford to antagonize anyone else today i just nodded and told him i understood he opened the door to the intensivecare unit and ushered me through i felt as though i were being conducted into the presence of royalty uncle stefan had been isolated from the rest of the unit in a private room when i realized metzinger was following me into it i stopped i have a feeling what mr herschel has to say is confidential doctor if you want to keep an eye on him can you do it through the door he didnt like that at all and insisted on coming in with me short of breaking his arm which was a tempting idea there wasnt much i could do to stop him the sight of uncle stefan lying small in a bed attached to machines to a couple of drips to oxygen made my stomach turn over he was asleep he looked closer to death than he had in the apartment last night dr metzinger shook him lightly by the shoulder he opened his guileless brown eyes recognized me after a few bewildered seconds and beamed feebly miss warshawski my dear young lady how i have been longing to see you lotty has told me how you saved my life come here eh and let me kiss younever mind these terrible machines i knelt down next to the bed and hugged him metzinger told me sharply not to touch himthe whole point of the gown and gauze was to keep germs out i got to my feet uncle stefan looked at the doctor so doctor you are my good protector eh you keep the germs away and get me healthy quickly now though i have a few private words for miss warshawski only so could i trouble you to leave i studiously avoided metzingers face as he withdrew with a certain amount of ill grace you can have fifteen minutes remember miss warshawskiyoure not to touch the patient no dr metzinger i wont when the doctor had closed the door with an offended snap i pulled a chair to the side of the bed uncle stefani mean mr herschelim so sorry i let you get involved in this lotty is furious and i dont blame herit was thoughtless i could beat myself the wicked grin that made him look like lotty came pleasecall me uncle stefan i like it and do not beat your beautiful body my dear new niecevictoria is it not i told you to begin with that i am not afraid of death and so i am not you gave me a beautiful adventure which i do not at all regret do not be sad or angry but be careful that is why i had to see you the man who attacked me is very very dangerous what happened i didnt see your ad until yesterday afternoonive had sort of a wild week myself but you made a stock certificate he chuckled wearily yes a very fine one if i say so for ibm a good solid company one hundred shares common stock so last wednesday i finished him no them sorry with this injury my english goes a bit he stopped and breathed heavily for a minute i wished i could hold his hand surely a little contact would do him more good than isolation and sterility his papery eyelids fluttered open again then i call a man i know who it is maybe best you do not hear my dear niece and he calls a man and so on and on wednesday afternoon one week later i get a call someone is interested a buyer and he will be there thursday afternoon i rush to get an ad in the paper so in the afternoon a man shows up i know at once he is not a boss the manner is that of an underling maybe you call him a legman legman yes what did he look like a thug uncle stefan produced the slang word proudly he is maybe forty heavynot fat you know he looks croatian that thick jowl thick eyebrows he is as tall as you but not as beautiful maybe a hundred pounds heavier he stopped again to breathe and closed his eyes briefly i glanced surreptitiously at my watch only five more minutes i didnt try to hurry him that would only make him lose his train of thought well you were not there and i i had to play the clever detective so i tell him i know about the priory forgeries and i want a piece of that particular business but i have to know who pays who the boss is so we get into aa fight he takes my ibm stock he takes your acorn stock he says you know too much for your own good old man and pulls out the knife which i see i have acid at my side acid for my etching you understand this i throw at him so when he stabs me his hand is not quite true i laughed wonderful when youve recovered maybe youd like to join my detective agency ive never wanted a partner before but youd bring class to the operation the mischievous smile appeared briefly weakly he shut his eyes again its a deal dear victoria he said i had to strain to catch the words dr metzinger bustled in youll have to leave now miss warshawski i got up when the police talk to you give them a description of the man not anything else random burglar after your silver perhaps and put in a good word for me with lottyshes ready to flay me the lids fluttered open and his brown eyes twinkled weakly lotty was always a headstrong unmanageable child when she was six dr metzinger interrupted him youre going to rest now you can tell miss warshawski later oh very well just ask her about her pony and the castle at kleinsee he called as metzinger hustled me out of the room the policeman stopped me in the hallway i need a full report on your conversation for what your memoirs the policeman grabbed my arm my orders are if anyone talks to him i have to find out what he said i jerked my arm down and away very well he told me he was sitting home on thursday afternoon when a man came up the stairs he let him in mr herschels an old man lonely wants visitors more than he wants to suspect people hes got a lot of valuable stuff in that apartment and it probably isnt too much of a secret anyway they got into a tussle of sorts as much as a thug can be said to tussle with an eightyyearold man he had some jewelry cleaner in his desk acid of some kind threw it at him and got a knife in his side i think he can give you a description of sorts why did he want to see you metzinger demanded i wanted to get home more than i wanted to fight im a friend of his niece dr herschel he knows me through her knows im a private detective an old man like that would rather talk to someone he knows about his troubles than get caught in the impersonal police machinery the policeman insisted on my writing down what i had just told him and signing it before he let me go and your phone number we need a number where we can reach you that reminded mei hadnt gotten to the phone company i gave him my office number and left traffic on the edens was thick by the time i reached it it would be a parking lot where it joined the kennedy i exited on peterson and headed south on side streets to montrose it was sixfifteen when i got to the bellerophon setting my alarm for seven i pulled the murphy bed out of the wall and fell across it into a dreamless sleep when the alarm rang it took me a long time to wake up at first i thought it was morning in my old place on halsted i switched off the ringing and started to go back to sleep it dawned on me however that the bedside table was missing id had to reach over the side of the bed to the floor to turn off the clock this woke me enough to remember where i was and why i had to get up i staggered into the bathroom took a cold shower and dressed in the new crimson outfit with more haste than grace i dumped makeup from my suitcase into my purse pulled on nylons and boots stuck my magli pumps under my arm and headed for the car i had a choice of the navy pea jacket or something filled with smoke and chose the pea jacketid just be checking it after all i was only twenty minutes late to the hanover house and happened to arrive at the same time as phil he was too well behaved to look askance at my outfit kissing me lightly on the cheek he tucked my arm into his and escorted me into the hotel he took boots and coat from me to check the perfect gentleman id put my makeup on at traffic lights and run a comb through my hair before leaving the car remembering the great beau brummell who said that only the insecure primp once theyve reached the party i resisted the temptation to study myself in the floorlength mirrors covering the lobby walls dinner was served in the trident salon on the fourth floor smaller than the grand ballroom it seated two hundred people who had paid a hundred dollars each for the privilege of dining with the archbishop a gaunt woman in black collected tickets at the entrance to the salon she greeted phil by name her thin sour face coming close to pleasure at seeing him i guess its dr paciorek now isnt it i know how proud your parents must be of you and is this the lucky young lady phil blushed suddenly looking very young indeed no no sonia which table for us we were seated at table five in the front of the room dr and mrs paciorek were at the head table along with ofaolin farber and other welltodo catholics cecelia and her husband morris were at our table she was wearing a black evening gown that emphasized her twenty extra pounds and the soft flab in her triceps hello cecelia hi morris good to see you i said cheerfully cecelia looked at me coldly but morris stood up to shake hands with me an innocuous metals broker he didnt share the family feud against agnes and her friends for a hundred dollars we got a tomatobased seafood chowder the others at our table had already started eating waiters brought phil and me servings while i studied the program next to my plate funds raised by the dinner would support the vatican whose assets had been depleted by the recent recessionary spiral and the fall of the lira archbishop ofaolin head of the vatican finance committee was here to thank us in person for our generosity after dinner and speeches by farber and ofaolin and by mrs catherine paciorek who had graciously organized the dinner there would be an informal reception with cash bar in the george iv salon next to our dining room the overweight man on my left took a second roll from the basket in front of him but forbore to offer me any hoard the supplies i asked him what kind of business he was in and he responded briefly insurance before popping half the roll into his mouth splendid i said heartily brokerage company his wife a thin twittery woman with a wreath of diamonds around her neck leaned across him harold is head of burhop and calends chicago office how fascinating i exclaimed burhop and calends was a large national brokerage house second in size behind marsh and mclennan it so happens im working for ajax insurance right now what do you think the impact would be on the industry if an outside interest acquired them wouldnt affect the industry at all he muttered pouring a pint of thousand island dressing over the salad hed just received phil nudged my arm vic you dont have to do a suburban girl scout impersonation just because i asked you to dinner tell me what youve been doing instead i told him about my fire he grimaced ive been on call almost all week havent seen a paper i sometimes think the world could blow up and the only way id know would be by the casualties coming into er but you like what you do his face lit up i love it especially the research end ive been working with epileptics during surgery to try to map neuron activity he was still young enough to give an uneducated audience the full force of his technical knowledge i followed as best i could more entertained by his enthusiasm than by what he was actually saying how you get a verbal response from people whose brains are being operated on carried us through some decent halibut steak which phil ignored as he drew a diagram in pen on his cloth napkin cecelia tried to catch his eye several times she felt tales of blood and surgery were not suited to the dinner table although most of the guests were discussing their own operations along with their children or what kind of snowremoval equipment they owned when the waiters removed the dessert plates including phils uneaten profiteroles the room quieted so that his was the only voice that carried thats what they really mean by a physiological map he said earnestly a ripple of laughter made him blush and break off in midsentence it also drew the head tables attention to him mrs paciorek had been too busy entertaining archbishop ofaolin to look at her children during dinner since eating had been well under way when we arrived she probably never noticed phil and me at all now his exposition and the laughter made her turn slightly so that she could identify the source she saw him then me she froze her wellbred mask slipping slightly she glanced sharply at cecelia who made a helpless gesture mrs paciorek nudged archbishop ofaolin and whispered to him he too turned to stare at our table which was only fifteen feet or so away then he whispered back to mrs paciorek who nodded firmly instructions to get the swiss guard to throw me out phil was furiously stirring cream into his coffee he was also still young enough to mind very much being laughed at under the noise of scraping chairs as people rose for cardinal farbers postdinner benediction i patted his arm comfortingly and said remember the only real social sin is to care what other people think of you farber gave a brisk blessing for the meal we had just enjoyed and went on to talk about how the kingdom of heaven could only be tended on earth with the help of earthly things that god had given us an earthly creation to care for and that the work of the temporal church could only be carried out with material goods he felt especially blessed in being the archbishop of chicago not just the worlds largest archdiocese but also the most generous and loving he was gratified at the response chicago had made to the urgent needs of the vatican and here to thank us in person was the most reverend xavier ofaolin archbishop of ciudad isabella and head of the vatican finance committee well pleased with his praise the crowd clapped enthusiastically ofaolin stepped to the podium at a raised stand in front of the room commended his words to god in latin and began to speak once again the spanish accent was so thick as to be nearly incomprehensible people strained to listen then squirmed and finally began murmured private conversations phil shook his head i dont know whats wrong with him tonight he said the old boy usually speaks perfect english mother must have knocked him off balance i wondered again at the whispered exchange between her and ofaolin since it was impossible to follow the panamanian archbishop i let my mind wander applause roused me from a doze and i shook my head to try to wake up again completely phil commented sarcastically on my sleeping then said now comes the fun part you go around the reception detecting to see if you can find your mysterious caller and ill watch great maybe you can incorporate it into an article on searchandsort routines in the brain as we got up to follow the throng into the george iv salon mrs paciorek pushed herself against the tide of traffic and came up to us what are you doing here she demanded of me abruptly phil pulled my hand through his arm shes my dinner date mother i didnt think i could face the plattens and carrutherses without some moral support she stood fulminating her color changed dangerously but she had the sense to know she couldnt order me out of the hotel at last she turned to cecelia and morris try to keep her away from archbishop farber he doesnt need to be insulted she tossed over her shoulder phil made a sour face sorry about that v want me to stay at your side i dont want anyone else to be rude to you i was amused and touched not necessary my friend if theyre too rude ill break their necks or something and you can patch them up and come out looking like a hero phil went to get me a brandy while i started counterclockwise around the room stopping at small knots of people introducing myself chatting enough to get everyone to say a few words and moving on about halfway up the left side i ran into father pelly with cecelia and some strangers father pelly nice to see you he smiled austerely miss warshawski i hardly thought of you as a supporter of the archdiocese i grinned appreciatively you thought correctly young phil paciorek brought me how about yourself i hardly thought the priory could afford this type of entertainment we cant xavier ofaolin invited mewe used to work together and i was his secretary when he was sent to the vatican ten years ago and you keep in close touch thats nice he visit the priory while hes in town i asked idly actually hell stay with us for three days before he flies back to rome thats nice i repeated faced with cecelias withering glare i moved on phil caught up with me as i was nearing the knot around ofaolin nothing like an evening with the old gang to make you feel youre in kindergarten he said every third person remembers when i broke the windows at the church with my catapult he introduced me to various people as i slowly worked my way up to ofaolin someone was shaking hands with him and leaving just as i reached the group so phil and i were able to slip in next to him archbishop this is ms warshawski perhaps you remember her from my sisters funeral the great man favored me with a stately nod he wore his episcopal purple shirt under a black suit of exquisite wool his eyes were green from his irish father i hadnt noticed them before perhaps the archbishop would prefer to converse in italian i said addressing him formally in that language you speak italian like his english his italian accent was tinged with spanish but not so distortingly something about his voice sounded familiar i wondered if hed been on television or radio while he was in chicago and asked him that nbc was good enough to do a small interview people think of the vatican as a very wealthy organization so it is hard for us to bring our story of poverty and begging to the people they were kind enough to help i nodded chicagos nbc station gave a lot of support to catholic figures and causes yes the vatican finances have been much in the papers here particularly after the unfortunate death of signor calvi last summer was it my imagination or did he flinch a bit hasyour work with the vatican finance committee involved you at all with the banco ambrosiano signor calvi was a most loyal catholic unfortunately his ardor caused him to overstep the bounds of propriety he had switched back to his heavily accented english although i made one or two more attempts at conversation the interview was clearly over phil and i moved off to sit on a small couch i needed to rest my feet before tackling the other side of the room what was that about calvi and the banco ambrosiano he asked my spanish is just good enough that i could follow some of the italian you must have miffed him though for his english to go bad again like that possibly he certainly didnt want to talk about ambrosiano we sat in silence for a few minutes i gathered my wits for an assault on the rest of the party suddenly behind me i heard the voice again thank you so much mrs addington his holiness will be joining me in prayer for all of you generous chicago catholics i leaped to my feet spilling brandy down the front of the new crimson dress phil stood up in alarm what is it vic thats the man whos been calling me who is that who didnt you hear someone just promising the popes prayers who said that phil was bewildered that was archbishop ofaolin has he been calling you never mind no wonder you were so surprised by his accent though the voice of a man whose english has been carefully taught to avoid an accent irish or spanish or both i rejoined the group around the archbishop he stopped in midsentence when he saw me never mind i said you dont have to put the thick spanish back on again i know who you are what i dont understand is your connection with the mafia i found i was shaking so badly i could hardly stand this was the man who wanted to blind me i had just enough control not to jump him on the spot youre confusing me with someone else young woman ofaolin spoke coldly but in his normal voice the rest of the group around him stood like stonehenge mrs paciorek swooped up from nowhere dear archbishop she said cardinal farber is ready to leave ah yes ill come at once i must thank him for his most generous hospitality as he got ready to leave i said coldly just remember archbishop no one is lucky forever phil helped me back to the couch vic whats wrong what has ofaolin done to you surely you dont know him i shook my head i thought i did hes probably right though i must be confusing him with someone else i knew i wasnt though you do not forget the voice of someone who wants to pour acid in your eyes phil offered to drive me home to get more brandy to do anything and everything i smiled at him gratefully im okay just with the fire at my place and everything i havent had much sleep ill sit here for a while and then drive back to my apartment or whatever the bellerophon was phil sat next to me he held my hand and talked about general things he was a very likable young man i pondered again how mrs paciorek could have produced three such attractive children as agnes phil and barbara cecelias your mothers only success i said abruptly he smiled you only see mother at her worst shes a fine person in a lot of ways all the good she does for example she inherited that huge savage fortune and instead of turning into a gloria vanderbilt or barbara post shes used it almost exclusively for charity she set up trusts for us kids enough to keep us from wantmine paid my medicalschool tuition for example but most of it goes to different charities especially to the church corpus christi perhaps he looked at me sharply how do you know about that oh i said vaguely even members of secret societies talk your mother must be pretty active in it he shook his head were not supposed to talk about it she explained it to each of us when we turned twentyone so wed know why there wasnt going to be much of an estate to inherit barbara doesnt know yet we dont even discuss it among ourselves although cecelias a member but youre not he smiled ruefully im not like agneshavent lost my faith and turned my back on the church its just with mother so active ive had too much opportunity to see the venality of the organization it doesnt surprise meafter all priests and bishops are human and they get their share of temptation but i dont want them managing my money for me yes i can see that someone like ofaolin for example getting a chance to play ducks and drakes with the faithfuls money is he part of corpus christi phil shrugged but father pelly is i said with calm certainty yeah pellys a good guy hes hottempered but hes a fanatic like mother i dont think anyone could accuse him of working for his own selfinterest the room was starting to shimmer in front of me too much knowledge rage and fatigue made me feel as if i might faint with farbers and ofaolins departure the room was thinning rapidly of people i got up i need to get home phil reiterated his willingness to drive me you dont look in any shape to be on the road vic i see too many head and neck injuries in the emergency roomlet me drive you i declined firmly the air will wake me up i always wear my seat belt and im a careful driver i had too much to sort out i needed to be alone phil retrieved my boots and coat for me and helped me into them with anxious courtesy he walked me to the entrance of the lot where i was parked and insisted on paying the ticket i was touched by his good manners and didnt try to override him do me a favor he said as i turned to go into the garage call me when you get in im catching a train to the south sideshould be at my place in an hour id just like to know you got home safely sure phil i called and turned in to the garage the omega was parked on the third level i rode the elevator up keeping a cautious eye out for prowlers elevators are nasty places at night as i bent to unlock the car door someone grabbed my arm i whirled and kicked as hard as i could my booted foot rammed his shin and he gave a yelp of pain and fell back youre covered warshawski dont try to fight the voice came from the shadows beyond my car light glinted on metal i remembered in dismay that the farts in the skokie police had my gun but a fight is no time for regrets okay im covered i agreed levelly i let my magli pumps slide to the ground and judged distances hed have a hard time killing me in the dark but he could probably hit me i could have killed you as you unlocked your car the man with the gun pointed out as if reading my thoughts he had a heavy gravelly voice im not here to shoot you don pasquale wants to talk to you my partner will forgive you for kicking himhe shouldnt have tried to grab you we were told you were a good street fighter thank you i said gravely my car or yours ours were going to blindfold you for the drive i picked up my shoes and let the man take me to a cadillac limousine waiting on the far side of the floor with its motor running there was no point in fighting they wrapped a large black silk scarf around my eyes i felt like julius schmeese waiting for the firing squad gravel voice sat in the back with me his gun held lightly against my side you can put that away i told him tiredly im not going to jump you the metal withdrew i leaned back in the wellsprung plush seat and dozed i must have fallen asleep in earnest gravel voice had to shake me awake when the car stopped we take the blindfold off when youre inside he guided me quickly but not roughly along a stone path and up a flight of stairs exchanged greetings with a guard at the entrance and led me down a carpeted hallway gravel knocked at a door a faint voice told him to come in wait here he ordered i leaned against the wall and waited in a few moments the door opened come in gravel told me i followed his voice and smelled cigar smoke and a fire gravel untied the scarf i blinked a few times adjusting to the light i was in a large room decorated in crimsoncarpet drapes and chairs all done in matching velvets and wools the effect was opulent but not unbearable in an armchair by a large fireplace sat don pasquale i recognized him at once from his courtroom appearances although he appeared older and frailer now he might be seventy or more he was thin with gray hair and a pair of hornrimmed glasses he wore a redvelvet smoking jacket and held an enormous cigar in his left hand so miss warshawski you want to speak to me i stepped up to the fire and took an armchair facing his i felt a bit like dorothy in oz finally getting to meet the talking head you are a very courageous young lady miss warshawski the voice was old but heavy like parchment no man has ever fallen asleep while being driven to see me youve worn me out don pasquale your people burned down my apartment walter novick tried to blind me someone stabbed poor mr herschel im short on sleep now and i take it where i can he nodded very sensible someone told me you speak italian can we converse in that language please certo i said i have an aunt an old woman rosa vignelli two weeks ago she phoned me in deep distress the safe at the priory of albertus magnus for which she was responsible was found to contain forged stock certificates id learned most of my italian before i was fifteen when gabriella died i had to scramble for some of the words particularly a way to describe forgery don pasquale provided a phrase thank you don pasquale now owing to the fascists and their friends the nazis my aunt has very little family left in fact only her son and i remain so she turned to me for help naturally don pasquale nodded gravely in an italian family you turn first to one another for help even if the family is rosa and me soon after that someone telephoned me he threatened me with acid and told me to stay away from the priory and eventually in fact someone did throw acid on me walter novick i picked my next words with utmost care now naturally i am curious about those forged securities but to be truthful if they are going to be investigated and the facts about them discovered it will be the fbi that does it i dont have the money or the staff to do that kind of work i watched pasquales face its expression of polite attention didnt change my main concern is for my aunt even though she is a disagreeable old woman i made a promise to my mother you see a promise as she was dying but when someone attacks me then my honor is involved too i hoped i wasnt overdoing it don pasquale looked at his cigar measuring the ash he puffed on it a few times and carefully knocked the ash into a bronze cube at his left hand yes miss warshawski i sympathize with your tale but stillhow does it involve me walter novick has boasted of being under your protection now i am not certain but i believe it was he who tried to stab stefan herschel two days ago because this man is old and because he was helping me i am obligated to seek out his assassin that is two counts against walter novick if it were clear to everyone that he is not under your protection i could deal with him with a clear conscience just on the grounds of his stabbing mr herschel i would forget the attack on me and i would lose all interest in the securitiesunless my aunts name became involved in them again pasquale gave a little smile you are one woman working alone you are very brave but you are still alone with what do you propose to bargain the fbi has lost interest in the case but if it knew in which direction to look its interest might be aroused again if you never left this house the fbi would never know the parchment voice was gentle but i felt the hairs prickle along the back of my neck i looked at my hands they appeared remarkably small and fragile its a gamble don pasquale i finally said i know now who called to threaten me if your interests are tied to his then its hopeless one of these times someone will kill me i wont always make it out of the burning apartment or be able to break my attackers jaw i will fight to the end but the end will be clearly discernible to everyone but if you and my caller arebusiness acquaintances onlythen the story is a little altered youre righti have nothing to bargain with the heraldstar the chicago police even the fbi all these would vigorously investigate my death or even a tale of forgery if i told it but how many indictments have you avoided in the past i shrugged i appeal only to your sense of honor your sense of family to understand why ive done what ive done and why i want what i want to the myth of the mafia i thought to the myth of honor but many of them liked to believe it my only hope was that pasquales view of himself mattered to him the ash on the cigar grew long again before he spoke ernesto will drive you home now miss warshawski you will hear from me in a few days gravel voice or ernesto had stood silently by the door while we talked now he came to me with the blindfold unnecessary ernesto pasquale said if miss warshawski decides to tell all she knows she will be unable to say it once again the goosepimples stood out on my neck i curled my toes inside my boots to control the shaking in my legs trying hard to keep my voice level i bade the don goodnight i told ernesto to take me to the bellerophon by now phil paciorek was right i was in no condition to drive a car the strain of talking to pasquale on top of the other stresses of the day had pushed me over the edge of fatigue so what if driving me home showed ernesto where i lived if pasquale wanted to find me this would only cut a day or two off his time i slept all the way back when i got to the bellerophon i staggered up the stairs to the fourth floor kicked off my boots dropped the new dress on the floor and fell into bed xx going to the cleaners it was past eleven when i woke up again i lay in bed for a while reveling in the sense of rest trying to reconstruct a dream id had in the middle of my sleep gabriella had come to me not wasted as in the final days of her illness but full of life she knew i was in danger and wanted to wrap me in a white sheet to save me i had an urgent feeling that the dream held a clue to my problem or how to solve it but i couldnt grab hold of it i had very little time and needed whatever prodding my subconscious could give me don pasquale had said i would hear from him in a few days that meant i might have fortyeight hours to straighten matters out to the point that any action of his against me would be superfluous i got out of bed and took a quick shower the burns on my arms were healing well physically i was in condition to run again but i couldnt bring myself to put on my sweats and go into the cold the fire in my apartment had upset me more than i would admit to roger i wanted some security and running through winter streets didnt feel like a way to get it i pulled the clothes out of my suitcase the laundered ones still smelled of smoke i put them away in the closet that housed the murphy bed my mothers wineglasses i set on the little dining table that done id moved in i bundled up the remaining clothes to take to a dry cleaner and went downstairs mrs climzak the manager saw me and called to me as i was walking out the door she was a thin anxious woman who always seemed to be gulping for air she came out from behind the lobby counter and hurried over to me with a brown paper bag someone left these for you this morning she gasped i took the bag dubiously fearing the worst inside were my red magli pumps forgotten in don pasquales limousine last night no message but at least it was a friendly gesture after so much breathless protesting that i could have walked the four flights up to my room and back mrs climzak agreed to keep them downstairs for me until i returned she came running up behind me as i was going to the door to add and if youre taking those to a dry cleaner theres a good one around the corner on racine the woman at the cleaners informed me triumphantly that it would cost me extra to get the smoke out she made a great show of inspecting each garment clucking her teeth over it and writing it down on a slip with the laboriousness of a traffic cop writing a ticket at last impatient i grabbed up the clothes and left a second cleaner sharing a dingy storefront with a tailor several blocks down was more obliging the woman at the counter accepted the smoky clothes without comment and wrote up the ticket quickly she directed me to a lunch counter that served homemade soup and stuffed cabbage not the ideal choice for the days first meal but the piping hot fresh barley soup was delicious using their pay phone to check in with my answering service i learned phil paciorek had called several times id forgotten all about him murray ryerson detective finchley i called illinois bell and explained my situation they agreed to switch my number over to the bellerophon also to charge me for the stolen phone i called freeman carter and said id seen uncle stefan and would make a statement to the police if they would drop charges he agreed to look into it i called phil and left a message with the hospital that i would get back to him i saved murray and the police for later once downtown i retrieved my car and headed for the pulteney building the mail piled in front of my office door was horrendous sorting through it quickly for checks and letters i tossed the rest no bills until my life had stabilized a bit i looked around me affectionately bare but mine maybe i could move in a mattress and a little sink and stove and live here for a while the desk top was covered with a film of grime whatever pollution the l exudes had filtered under the window i filled an old coffee cup at the hall drinking fountain and scrubbed the desk with some kleenex good enough using one of the envelopes id just pitched i made out a to do list inspect mrs pacioreks private finances papers ditto for ofaolin ditto for pelly find out if walter novick had stabbed uncle stefan if yes bag him i couldnt figure out what to do with the first three items but it should be easy enough to take care of four five might follow i called murray at the heraldstar viyou aint dead yet he greeted me not for lack of trying i answered i need some photographs wonderful the art institute has some on sale i tried calling you last night wed like to do a story about stefan herschel and your arrest why talk to me just make it up like your story of a couple of days ago trade you photographs for a story who do you want walter novick you figure he stabbed herschel i just want to know what he looks like in case he comes after me again all right all right ill have your pictures at the golden glow around four and you give me half an hour just remember youre not bobby mallory i said irritably i dont have to tell you anything what i hear you dont tell mallory much either he hung up i looked at my watch two oclock time enough to think of a way to get at the papers i wanted to see i could disguise myself as an itinerant member of corpus christi and go knocking on mrs pacioreks door then while she was praying intensely i could find her safe crack the combination and and i could disguise myself not for mrs paciorek but for the priory if ofaolin was out there i could take care of him and pelly in one trip if the disguise worked it sounded like a lunatic idea but i couldnt think of anything better as you go along jackson street to the river you pass a number of fabric shops at hofmanstahls on the corner of jackson and wells i found a bolt of soft white wool when they asked how much i needed i had no idea i sketched the garment and we settled on ten yards at eight dollars a yard not exactly a bargain they didnt have belts and it took close to an hour of wandering around leather stores and mens shops to find the heavy black strap i needed a religiousgoods store near union station provided the other accessories as i walked back across the slushy streets toward the golden glow i passed a seedy print shop on an impulse i went in they had some photographs of old chicago gangsters i took a collection of six to mix in with the shots of novick that murray was bringing me it was almost fourthere wasnt time to get to the little tailor on montrose before meeting murray but if i didnt make it there today it would have to wait till monday and that was too late murray would have to come with me and talk in the car he obliged with ill grace when i came in he was happily absorbed in his second beer had taken off his boots and was warming his socks on a small fender next to the horseshoe mahogany bar while he bitterly pulled on his wet boots i picked up a manila folder from the bar in front of him in it were two shots of novick neither in sharp focus but clear enough to identify him both were courtroom shots taken when novick had been arrested for attempted manslaughter and armed robbery hed never been convicted pasquales friends seldom were i was relieved at not recognizing novicks face id been half afraid that he might have been the man id kicked last night if he was that close to pasquale there was no chance the don would turn him loose i led murray down the street to my car at a good clip damn it v slow down ive been working all day and just drank a beer you want your story come and get it ryerson he climbed into the passenger seat grumbling that the car was too small for him i put the omega in gear and headed for lake shore drive so how come you were visiting stefan herschel the day he got knifed whats he say about it damned hospital wont let us in to talk to him thats why im stuck asking you and i know what that meanshalf a story my gofer at the police station told me youd been booked for concealing evidence of a crime what crime thats just lieutenant mallorys flamboyant imagination he didnt like my being at mr herschels apartment and saving his life he had to charge me with something murray demanded to know what i was doing there i gave him my standard storyabout uncle stefan being a lonely old man and my just happening to drop in now when i saw him at the hospital youve talked to him murrays shout made the little cars windows rattle what did he say are you going there now did novick stab him no im not going there now i dont know if novick stabbed him the police story right now is that this was random housebreaking since novick runs with the mob i dont see him as a housebreaker unless he does his own thing on the side i dont know i explained about the silver collection and how eager uncle stefan was to shower people with tortes and hot chocolate if someone rang the bell hed just assume it was the neighborhood kids and let them in maybe it was the neighborhood kids poor old goon i had an inspiration you know you should talk to his neighbormrs silverstein she saw a lot of him i bet she could give you some good tips murray made a few notes still i dont trust you v its just too damned pat you being there i shrugged and pulled up in front of the cleaners thats the story take it or leave it we had to drive all this way so you could get to the cleaners thats your emergency youd better be planning on getting me back to the loop some emergencies are more obscure than others i took my parcel of fabric and went into the little store the tailoring part of the shop was a jumbled array of old spools of thread a singer that must have dated to the turn of the century and scraps and snippets of cloth the man huddled crosslegged on a chair in the corner hunched over a length of brown suiting might have gone back to as well although he jerked a sideways glance at me he continued to sew when hed finished whatever he was doing he folded the fabric tidily put it on a heaped table to his left and looked at me yes he spoke with a heavy accent could you sew something for me without a pattern oh yes young lady no question about it when i was a young man i cut for marshall field for charles stevens those were the days before you were born when they made clothes right there in the store i cut all day long and made with no patterns what is it you want i showed him my sketch and pulled the wool from its brown wrapping he studied the picture for a moment and then me oh that would be no problem no problem at all andcould i have it by monday monday oh the young lady is in a hurry he waved an arm in the direction of several heaps of cloth look at all these orders they thought in advance they bring their work in many weeks ahead of you monday my dear young lady i sat down on a footstool and negotiated in earnest at last he agreed to do it for double his normal fee payable in advance forty dollars i cannot do it for a penny less i tried to appear incredulous as if i thought i was being gouged the fabric alone had cost double that finally i pulled two twenties from my wallet he told me to stop in at noon on monday but next time no rushes murray had left a note under my windshield wiper informing me that hed caught a cab downtown and that i owed him sixteen dollars i tossed the paper in the trashcan and headed for skokie uncle stefan had been moved to a regular room that afternoon that meant i didnt have to go through a routine with nurses and metzinger just to see him however the police guard had also been removedif his attackers were ordinary b e men he wasnt in any danger according to the cops i bit my lip caught by my own story damn it unless i told the truth about the forgeries and the mob there was no way to convince the police that uncle stefan needed protection the old man was delighted to see me lotty had been by in the morning but no one else was visiting him i pulled out the photographs and showed them to him he nodded calmly just like hill street blues do i recognize the mug shots he selected novick from the pile without hesitation oh yes that face is not easy to forget even though this picture is not totally clear i have no doubt no question that is the man with the knife i stayed and talked with him for a while turning over in the back of my mind various possibilities for his protection if i just gave novicks picture to the police but if pasquale wasnt willing to let him go then hed get both me and uncle stefan without any compunction or difficulty i abruptly interrupted a reminiscence of fort leavenworth excuse me i cant leave you here without a guard and while i can stay until the end of visiting hours tonight its just too easy for someone to get in and out of a hospital if i call a security service i trust and get someone over here will you tell dr metzinger its your idea he may think youre a paranoid old man but he wont turn your guard out the way he will if i put it to him uncle stefan was disposed to be heroic and fought the idea until i told him the same hoods were gunning for me if they kill me and youre dead there isnt a soul on earth who can go to the police for me and our detective agency will vanish put as an appeal to his chivalry the idea was palatable the service i used was called all nightall right in a way its employees were as amateurish as their name three enormous brothers and two of their friends made up the entire staff and they only took jobs that appealed to them no north shore weddings for example id used them once when i had a load of rare coins i was returning to an afghani refugee jim streeter answered the phone when i explained the situation to him he agreed to send someone up in a couple of hours the boys are out moving someones furnitureone of their sidelines when they get back ill send tom up uncle stefan obediently rang for the night nurse and explained his fears to her she was inclined to be sarcastic but i murmured a few words about hospital safety and malpractice suits and she said she would tell doctor uncle stefan nodded approvingly at me you are a very tough young lady ah if only i had known you thirty years ago the fbi never would have caught me a gift shop in the lobby yielded a pack of cards we played gin until tom streeter showed up at eightthirty he was a big quiet gentle man seeing him i knew id stopped one hole at least temporarily i kissed uncle stefan goodnight and left the hospital checking carefully at each doorway mixing with a large family group leaving the building i inspected my car before opening the door as near as i could tell no one had wired it with dynamite driving down the edens what puzzled me was the connection between ofaolin and the forgeries he hires novick from pasquale how does he know pasquale how would a panamanian archbishop know a chicago mobster anyway he hires novick from pasquale to back me off the forgeries but why the only connection i could think of was his longterm friendship with pelly but that made pelly responsible for the forgeries and that still didnt make sense the answer had to be at the friary and i had to get through sunday somehow before i could find it back at the bellerophon i plugged my phone into the wall it seemed to work my answering service told me ferrant had tried phoning me as well as detective finchley i tried roger first he sounded subdued theres been a disturbing development in this takeover attempt or maybe its a relief someone has stepped forward and filed five percent ownership with the sec hed been closeted with the ajax board all day discussing it one of the other managing partners from scupperfield plouder would be flying in tomorrow roger wanted to have dinner with me and get my ideas if any i agreed to meet him if nothing else it would give me something to think about until monday while i ran water in the bathtub i made my other call detective finchley had left for the day but mallory was still at work your lawyer says youre ready to make a statement about stefan herschel he growled i offered to see him first thing monday morning what did detective finchley want i could get my gun back bobby said grudgingly theyd gotten the skokie police to send it down to them they were confiscating the picklocks though it hurt bobby physically to tell me about the gun he didnt want me carrying it he didnt want me in the detective business he wanted me in bridgeport or melrose park with six children and presumably a husband xxi deadline roger poked moodily at his steak by the way thanks for the note you left yesterday how was the archbishop there were two one was fulsome the other ugly tell me about this filing i had met him at the filigree and been moved by his total exhaustion we had drinks in the bar before dinner roger so worn that he hadnt felt like talking now he rubbed his forehead tiredly i am baffled totally and utterly baffled ive been dealing with it all day and i still cant understand it its like this if you own five percent or more of a companys stock you have to file with the sec and tell them what you mean to do with your holding you know you asked me a week or so ago about a woodsage company well theyre the ones who made the filing now they did it late yesterday just so they wouldnt have to answer a lot of questions or be in the journal or anything but of course our lawyers got all the material such as it was woodsage isnt a corporation that does anything apparently theyre just a group of people who buy and sell stocks for their mutual benefit figuring if they pool their investments they can do better than they would alone its not that unusual and theyre claiming they only bought so many ajax shares because they think the companys a good buy the trouble is we cant get any kind of line on who owns woodsage he ran his fingers through his long hair and pushed his plate away much of the steak uneaten the disclosure to the sec should include the owners shouldnt it i asked he shrugged the owners are the shareholders there is a board of directors but it seems to be made up of brokers including tilford and sutton the buyers must include their customers then i thought back to my burglary of their offices i dont have a list of all their customers and i dont know what it would tell you anyway the one strange thing about them is they do business for corpus christi corpus christi bought several million dollars of stock last fall it might have given them to woodsage roger had never heard of corpus christi not surprisingits a group that tries to stay secret i told him what id read about them in the journal because they do everything in secret maybe they dont publicize their ownership of a company like woodsage catherine paciorek is a memberher son let that fall inadvertently roger fiddled with the stem of his wineglass theres something i want to ask you he finally said abruptly its hard for me because weve gotten into difficulties about your detective work and my reaction to it but id like to hire you for scupperfield plouder id like you to try to find out whos behind woodsage now this business with corpus christi and mrs paciorekit gives you an inside edge on the investigation roger the sec and the fbi have the kind of resources you need for that sort of investigation i dont by tuesday or wednesday theyll have the information itll be in the public domain maybe but that may be too late were doing what we cansending mailings to shareholders urging them to support current management our lawyers are working madly but no ones getting results he leaned across the table earnestly and took my hand look its a lot to ask i realize that but you know mrs paciorek cant you talk to herfind out if corpus christi is involved in this woodsage thing at all roger the lady doesnt talk to me i dont even know what i could do to get her to see me he looked at me soberly im not asking you to do me a favor ill hire you whatever your normal fee is scupperfield plouder will double it i just cannot run the risk of omitting a course of action that might help if we knew who the owners were if we knew why they were trying to buy the company it could make a big difference to our being able to hold on to ajax i thought of the three dollars in my wallet the new furniture i was going to have to buy the fee to the streeter brothers for protecting uncle stefan and then my shoulders sank it was my fault uncle stefan was lying in the hospital needing protection after a couple of weeks of working on the forgeries i had done nothing but lose my apartment and my lifes possessions lotty my refuge wouldnt speak to me i had never felt so discouraged or incapable in all my years as an investigator i tried awkwardly to explain some of my feelings roger squeezed my hand i understand how you feel he grinned briefly i was the young hotshot coming over to manage the ajax operation show them how to do the job now our management are fighting for our lives i know its not my faultbut i feel futile and embarrassed that i cant do anything about it i made a wry face but returned his handshake so well bolster each others failing vanity i suppose but next week youve got to go to the fbi and the sec set up a meeting for me with them they wont talk to me otherwise just as long as you know its a most unlikely project ill try to think of a way to get catherine paciorek to talk to me he smiled gratefully you dont know what a relief this is to me vic just the idea that someone i can trust absolutely will be involved can you come in monday and meet the board the lawyers can give you a full picture on what they knowthree hours to say nothing maybe mondays full tuesday he agreed eight am i blenched slightly but wrote the time into my date book we left the filigree at nine and went to a movie i called the hospital from the theater to check on uncle stefan all was well there i wished someone cared enough for my safety to hire some huge bodyguards to protect me of course a hardboiled detective is never scared so what i was feeling couldnt be fear perhaps nervous excitement at the treats in store for me even so when roger asked me tentatively if i wanted to go back to the hancock with him i assented without hesitation by morning the heraldstar and the tribune had both picked up the woodsage story in their sunday business sections no one on the ajax board had been available for comment pat kollar the heraldstars financial analyst explained why someone would want to acquire an insurance company there wasnt much else to say about woodsage roger read the papers gloomily he left at two to meet his partners plane hell have the financial times and the guardian with him and ill get the new york times on my way to the car that way we can have a real wake surrounded by all the bad news at once want to stay to meet him i shook my head godfrey anstey would be sleeping in the apartments second bedroom twos company but threes embarrassing after roger left i stayed for a few minutes to call my answering service phyllis lording had phoned several times around noon somewhat surprised i dialed the chestnut street apartment phylliss high rather squeaky voice sounded more flustered than usual oh hi vic is that you do you have any time this afternoon by any chance whats up she gave a nervous laugh probably nothing only its hard to explain over the phone i shrugged and agreed to walk over when she met me at the door she appeared thinner than ever her chestnut hair was pulled carelessly from her face pinned on her head her swanlike neck seemed pitifully slender beneath the mass of hair the fine planes in her face standing out sharply in an oversize shirt and tight jeans she looked unbearably fragile she led me into the living room where the days papers were spread out on the floor like agnes she was a heavy smoker and a blue haze hung in the air i sneezed involuntarily she offered me coffee from an electric percolator sitting on the floor near the overflowing ashtray when i saw how brackish it was i asked for milk you can check in the refrigerator she said doubtfully but i dont think i have any the huge refrigerator held nothing except a few condiments and a bottle of beer i went back to the living room phyllis what are you eating she lit a cigarette im just not hungry vic at first i kept trying to make myself meals but id get sick if i ate anything now im just not hungry i squatted down on the floor next to her and put a hand on her arm not good phyl its not a way to memorialize agnes she blinked a few times through the smoke i just feel so alone vic agnes and i didnt have many friends in common the people i know are all at the university and her friends were brokers and investors her family wont talk to me her voice trailed off and she hunched her thin shoulders agness youngest sister would like very much to talk to you why dont you give her a call she was twenty years younger than agnes and didnt know her too well but she liked and admired her shes too young to know how to phone you without embarrassment after the way her mothers acted she didnt say anything for a few minutes then she gave her intense smile and a brief nod okay ill call her and start eating something she nodded again ill try vic we talked about her courses for a bit i wondered if she could get someone to take them for her a week while she went south for some sunshine she said shed think about it after a while she got around to the reason behind her phone call agnes and i shared a subscription to the new york times she smiled painfully and lit another cigaretteher fifth since id arrived forty minutes earlier she always went straight to the business section while i hit the book reviews she she teased me about it i dont have much of a sense of humor agnes did and it always got under my skin a bit since she died ive iveshe bit her lips and looked away trying to hide tears trickling down the inner corners of her face ive started reading the business section its its a way to feel im still in touch with her the last sentence came out in a whisper and i had to strain to hear her i dont think thats foolish phyl i have a feeling if it had been you who died agnes would plunge into proust with the same spirit she turned to look at me again you were closer to agnes in some ways than i could ever be you and she are a lot alike its funny i loved her desperately but i didnt understand her very well i was always a little jealous of you because you understood her i nodded agnes and i were good friends for a long time ive had times when i was jealous of your closeness with her she put her cigarette out and seemed to relax her shoulders fell back from their hunched position thats very generous of you vic thanks anyway in the times this morning i saw a story about a takeover bid for ajax you know the big insurance company downtown i know agnes was looking at that before she died and ive been scratching around at it too alicia vargasagness secretarysent me all her personal papers things shed kept notes on anything that was handwritten and didnt relate to company business i went through them all her latest notebook especially she kept themlike jonathan edwardsor proust she stood up and went to the coffee table where i could see some spiral college notebooks among stacks of harpers and the new york review of books id assumed they belonged to phyllis she took the top one and riffled through it quickly then folded it back to show me the page agness sprawling hand was difficult to read shed written in followed by rf ajax that wasnt too difficult to followshed first talked to ferrant about ajax on january other cryptic entries that week apparently referred to various things she was thinking about or working on one was a note to go to phylliss poetry reading for example then on the eighteenth the day she died was a heavily scored entry million cc for woodsage phyllis was looking at me intently you see woodsage didnt mean anything to me by itself but after i read the paper this morning and the cc agnes told me about corpus christi i couldnt help but think neither can i where the hell did she get that information phyllis shrugged she knew a lot of brokers and lawyers can i use your phone i asked phyllis abruptly she led me to a porcelaingold replica of the early telephones i dialed the paciorek number barbara answered she was glad to talk to me shed be really happy to hear from phyllis and yes her mother was home she came back a few minutes later to say in considerable confusion that mrs paciorek refused to talk to me tell her i just called to let her know that corpus christis ownership of woodsage will be in the heraldstar next week corpus christi she repeated doubtfully you got it five minutes passed i read the times story on ajaxmore words to say less than had been in the chicago papers i scanned more verbiage on the at t divestiture i looked at help wanted ads maybe i could find a better line of work seasoned professional not afraid of challenges that meant someone to work hard for low pay what do you season professionals with anyway finally mrs paciorek came on the line barbara gave me some garbled message her voice was tight its like this mrs paciorek the sec knows of course that woodsage has bought a fivepercent position in ajax what they dont know is that most of the money was put up by corpus christi and that most of corpus christis money comes from you the savage fortune you turned over to them securities law is not my specialty but if corpus christi is putting up the money for woodsage to buy ajax stock the sec is not going to be happy that it wasnt mentioned in your filing i dont know what youre talking about youve got to work on your answers when the papers get hold of you theyre not going to believe that for one minute if something called corpus christi is buying ajax stock i know nothing about it thats marginally better i conceded the problem is when agnesyour daughter you knowdied she left behind some notes showing a connection between corpus christi and woodsage if i turn the fbis attention to your lawyers im sure it would be able to get the name of the broker who handles the corpus christi portfolio that is presumably where agnes got her information in addition on a smaller scale it will be interested in the block transfers preston tilford handled there was silence at the other end while mrs paciorek marshaled her defenses i shouldnt have expected to force such a controlled woman into blurting out anything indiscreet at last she said my attorneys will doubtless know how to handle any investigation however harassing that isnt my concern well see about that but the police may want to ask you some questions too they may want to know to what lengths you would go to keep agnes from publishing corpus christis attempted takeover of ajax after a long pause she replied victoria you are obviously hysterical if you think you know something about the death of my daughter perhaps i will see you i started to say something then thought better of it the woman was going to talk to mewhat more did i need right now she wasnt free today but she could see me at her home tomorrow night at eight with my nerves in their current jangled state i didnt feel like going back to the bellerophon i explained the fire and my predicament to phyllis who instantly offered me her spare bedroom she drove with me to visit uncle stefan now feeling well enough to be bored in the hospital to my relief the doctors wanted to hold him a few more daysonce he got home he would be impossible to keep an eye on robert streeter the youngest brother was with him when we arrived apparently someone had tried to get into the room around midnight jim then on duty sensibly didnt try to chase him since that would have left the room unguarded by the time hed roused hospital security the intruder was long gone i shook my head helplessly one more problem i couldnt handle lotty arrived as we were leaving at the sight of phyllis her heavy black brows went up so vic is roping you into her masquerade as well lotty you and i need to talk i said sharply she gave me a measuring look yes i think that would be a good thing are these thugs with stefan your idea or his call me when youve climbed off your cross i snapped and walked away phyllis was too polite to ask about the incident we didnt speak much but had a pleasant meal at a little restaurant on irving park road before heading back to chestnut street cigarette smoke had permeated the bedclothes in the guest room the smell combined with my nervous tension made sleep difficult at three i got up to read and found phyllis sitting in the living room with a biography of margaret fuller w talked companionably for several hours after that i slept until phyllis stopped in to say goodbye before going to her eightthirty class she invited me to come back at night despite the stale air i accepted gratefully i thought i might be safer with a rental car than my own which was by now well known to any hoodlum in chicago trying to find me on my way over to the police station i stopped at a rental agency and got a toyota whose steering must have been used by the us weightlifting team while they trained for the olympics they told me they didnt have anything else that size and to take it or leave it snarling i took iti didnt have time to shop for cars lieutenant mallory wasnt in when i got to roosevelt road i gave my statement to detective finchley not having bobbys history with me he accepted what i had to say and returned the smith wesson freeman carter who accompanied me told me wed have a formal hearing in the morning but that my character was once more unblemishednot even a moving violation in the last three years it was afternoon when i reached my ancient tailor on montrose he had finished the robe for me it fit perfectly right hem length right sleeve length i thanked him profusely but he responded with more harsh words on young ladies who couldnt plan aheadhed had to work all day sunday for me i had to make a stop at the bellerophon to pick up the rest of my disguise mrs climzak came out breathlessly from behind the counter with my shoes shed never have taken them if shed known shed have to be responsible for them for two days if i was going to turn out to be the thoughtless type of tenant she didnt know if they could keep me and certainly not if i entertained men in the middle of the night i was turning to go upstairs but this seemed like a specific not a generic accusation what men in the middle of the night oh dont try to act so innocent miss warshawski the neighbors heard him and called the night clerk he got the police and your friend left dont pretend you dont remember that i left her midsentence and galloped up the stairs to the fourth floor i hadnt had time to make a mess of my shabby little room someone else had done it for me fortunately there wasnt too much to toss aroundno books except a gideon bible no food just my clothes the murphy bed mattress and the pots and pans in the kitchen i held my breath while i inspected the venetian glasses whoever had been here wasnt totally vindictive they stood unharmed on the little card table oh damn i shouted leave me alone i shuffled things together as best i could but didnt really have time to clean up didnt feel like cleaning up come to that what i felt like was taking to my bed for a week except i didnt have a bed anymore not my own anyway i lugged the heavy mattressback onto the bed and lay on it the cracks in the ceiling made a fine mesh they resembled my own incoherent thoughts i stared at them morosely for a quarter of an hour before forcing myself to abandon selfpity and start thinking the likeliest reason someone was searching my room was to find the evidence id told catherine paciorek about yesterday no wonder she hadnt wanted to see me last night she was getting someone to find me and find whatever document agnes had left behind very well that would make it easier to get her to talk when i saw her tonight i put catherine and the ransacking to one side now that i was thinking again i could cope changing into jeans and boots i put the robe into a paper bag with the rest of my disguise digging the component pieces out of the mess in the room my shoulder holster was wedged under the chest of drawers in the closet it took close to half an hour to find i looked nervously at my watch not sure what my deadline was but fearing that time was running very short indeed i still had to stop for some bullets but that delay was essential i wasnt going to the bathroom unarmed until this mess was straightened out xxii wandering friar a store in lincolnwood sold me three dozen bullets for twentyfive dollars despite what the gun haters may think it isnt cheap killing people not only is it not cheap its timeconsuming it was nearly three i didnt have time for lunch if i wanted to get to the priory on schedule stopping at a corner grocery i picked up an apple and ate it as i drove a bright winter sun reflected against the snow breaking into diamonds of glinting blinding color my dark glasses i suddenly remembered had been in a dresser drawer in the old apartment no doubt they were a lump of plastic now i shielded my eyes as best i could with the visor and my left hand once in melrose park i toured the streets looking for a park pulling in from the roadway i took off my pea jacket and pulled the white wool robe on over jeans and shirt the black leather belt tightened the gown at the middle the rosary i attached to the right side of the belt it wasnt exactly the real thing but in dim light i ought to be able to pass for a dominican friar by the time i got back to the priory and parked behind the main building it was almost fourthirty time for evening prayers and mass i waited until fourthirtyfive and went into the main hallway the ascetic youth sat hunched over a devotional work he glanced up at me briefly when i headed for the stairs instead of the chapel he said youre late for vespers brother but went back to his reading my heart was pounding as i reached the wide landing where the marble staircase turned back on itself up into the private upper reaches of the friary the area was cloistered not open to the public male or female and i couldnt suppress a feeling of dread as though i were committing some kind of sacrilege id been expecting a long open ward like a nineteenth century hospital instead i came on a quiet corridor with doors opening onto it rather like a hotel the doors were shut but not locked next to each making my task infinitely easier were little placards with the monks names printed in a neat scroll each man had a room to himself i squinted at each in turn until i came to one that had no name on it cautiously i knocked then opened the door the room contained only a bare single bed and a crucifix at the far end of the hall i came to a second nameless room which i opened in turn this was ofaolins temporary quarters besides the bed and crucifix the room held a small dresser and a little table with a drawer in the middle ofaolins panamanian passport and his airline ticket were in the drawer he was on a ten pm alitalia flight on wednesday fortyeight hours toto what the dresser was filled with stacks of beautiful linen handtailored shirts and a fine collection of silk socks the vaticans poverty didnt force her employees to live in squalor finally under the bed i found a locked attaché case i mourned my picklocks using the barrel of the smith wesson i smashed the hinges i hated doing anything so blatant but time was short the case was stacked with papers most in italian some in spanish i looked at my watch five oclock thirty minutes more i shuffled through the stack a number of papers with the vatican sealthe keys to the kingdomdealt with ofaolins fundraising tour of the states however ajaxs name caught my eye and i looked slowly through the papers until i found three or four referring to the insurance company i dont read italian as fast as i do english but these seemed to be technical documents from a financial house detailing the assets outstanding debt number of shares of common stock and names and expiration dates of the terms of the current board of directors the most interesting document in the collection was clipped to the inside cover of ajaxs annual report it was a letter in spanish to ofaolin from someone named raül diaz figueredo the letterhead embossed with an intricate logo and figueredos name as presidente was for the italopanama importexport company spanish is enough like italian that i could work out the gist after reviewing many us financial institutions figueredo wished to bring ajax to ofaolins attention the easiest objecttargetfor a plan of acquisition the banco ambrosiano assets resided happilyno safelyin panamanian and bahamian banks yet for these assets to befecund no productiveas his excellency wisely understands they must be usable in public works i sat back on my heels and looked soberly at the document here was evidence of what lay behind the ajax takeover and the connection with woodsage and corpus christi i looked nervously at my watch time enough to sort that out later i slipped the letter from the paper clip folded it and put it in my jeans pocket under the robe stacking the papers together as neatly as i could i put them back in the attaché case and slid the case under the bed the hallway was still deserted i had one more stop given the figueredo letter it was worth the significant risk of being caught father pellys room was at the other end of the hall near the stairs i cocked an ear no voices below the service must still be in progress i pushed open his door as spartan as the other rooms pellys nonetheless had the personal stamp of a place thats been inhabited for a long time by one person some family photographs stood on the little deal table and a bookcase was filled several layers deep i found what i was looking for in the bottom drawer of the dresser a list of chicago area members of corpus christi with their addresses and phone numbers i went through it quickly keeping one nervous ear strained for voices if worse came to worst i might be able to leave from the window it was narrow but we were only on the second floor and i thought i could squeeze through cecelia paciorek gleason was listed and catherine paciorek of course and near the bottom of the list rosa vignelli don pasquale was not a member one secret society was enough for the man i supposed as i stuck the list in the drawer and got up to leave i heard voices in the hallway outside and then a hand on the door it was too late to try the window i looked around desperately and slid under the bed the rosary making a faint clicking noise as i pulled my robes in around me my heart was pounding so hard that my body vibrated i took deep silent breaths trying to still the movement black shoes appeared near my left eye then pelly kicked them off and climbed onto the bed the mattress and springs were old and not in the best of shape the springs sagging under his weight almost touched my nose we lay like that for a good quarter of an hour me stifling a sneeze prompted by the cold steel pelly breathing gently someone knocked at the door pelly sat up come in gus someones been in my room and broken into my attaché case ofaolin id know his voice anywhere for the rest of my life silence then pelly when did you last look at it this morning i needed to write a letter to an address i had in there its hard to believe one of your brothers would do a thing like this but who it couldnt possibly be warshawski no indeed pelly asked him sharply if anything was missing not as far as i can tell and there wasnt anything that would prove anything anyway except for a letter figueredo wrote me if warshawski broke in pelly began if warshawski broke in it doesnt really matter ofaolin interrupted she isnt going to be a problem after tonight but if she shows the letter to someone in the meantime ill have to start all over again i should never have left you on your own to handle this business forging those securities was a lunatic idea and now he broke off no point rehashing all that lets just see if the letters missing he turned abruptly and left pelly pulled his shoes back on and followed him i got up quickly pulled the hood well around my face and cracked the door to watch pelly disappear into ofaolins room then trying to remain calm i went down the stairs with my head tucked into my chin a couple of brothers greeted me en route and i mumbled in response at the bottom carroll said good evening i mumbled and took off for the front door carroll said sharply brother then to someone else who is that i dont recognize him outside i hitched up my habit and ran to the back of the building started the toyota and drove it bumpily down the drive back to melrose park there i quickly divested myself of the robe at a dry cleaner telling them it was for augustine pelly in the car i sat laughing for a few minutes then soberly considered what id found and what it meant the letter from figueredo seemed to imply that they wanted to acquire ajax in order to launder banco ambrosiano money bizarre or maybe not a bank or an insurance company made a highly respectable cover for moving questionable capital into circulation if you could do it so the multitude of auditors didnt notice i thought of michael sindona and the franklin national bank some people thought the vatican had been involved in that escapade with the banco ambrosiano the connection was documented if not understood the vatican was part owner of ambrosianos panamanian subsidiaries so was it strange that the head of the vaticans finance committee would take an interest in the disposition of the ambrosiano assets ofaolin was an old friend of kitty paciorek mrs pacioreks sizable fortune was tied up with corpus christi ergo she was expecting me in a couple of hours i had some evidence evidence she wanted badly enough to get someone to search the bellerophon but did it link her to the woodsagecorpus christi connection strongly enough to make her talk i didnt think so thoughts of mrs paciorek reminded me of ofaolins last remark i wasnt going to be a problem after tonight the queasiness which seemed to be more and more a permanent resident returned to my stomach he might have meant theyd have ajax sewn up by tonight but i didnt think so it seemed more likely that walter novick would be waiting for me in lake forest mrs paciorek presumably had no scruples about doing such a favor for her old friend although she probably wouldnt have me killed while her husband and barbara were watching what would she try an ambush on the grounds between melrose and elmwood park north avenue forms a continuous strip of fastfood restaurants factories usedcar lots and cheap small shopping malls i selected one of these at random and found a public phone mrs paciorek answered using the nasal twang of the south side i asked for barbara she was spending the night with friends mrs paciorek said demanding in a sharp voice to know who was calling lucy van pelt i answered hanging up i couldnt think of a way to find out where the doctor and the servants were a jewelosco had a public photocopier which yielded a greasy gray copy of figueredos letter to ofaolin i bought a packet of cheap envelopes and a stamp from a stamp machine and mailed the original to my office i thought for a minute then scribbled a note to murray on one of the envelopes telling him to look at my office mail if i turned into a chicago floatfish folded in three it fit into another envelope which i mailed to the heraldstar as for lotty and roger what i wanted to tell them was too complicated to fit onto an envelope by now it was close to seven too late for me to have a proper sitdown meal the apple id had at three had been my only meal since breakfast though and i needed something to brace me for a possible fight at mrs pacioreks i bought a large hershey bar with almonds at the jewel and stopped at wendys for a taco salad not the ideal thing to eat in a moving car i realized as i joined the traffic on the tollway and the salad dribbled down the front of my shirt if mrs paciorek was planning to sic german shepherds on me theyd know where i was by the chili as i exited onto half day road i went over what i knew of the paciorek estate if an ambush was attempted it would be laid either by the front door or at the garage entrance in back of the house were the remains of a wood agnes and i had sometimes taken sandwiches out there to eat sitting on logs by a stream feeding lake michigan the property ended a half mile or so back of the house at a bluff overlooking the lake in the summer in broad daylight it might be possible to climb that bluff but not on a winters night with waves roaring underneath id have to come at the house from the side across neighboring lots and hope for the best i left the toyota on a side street next to arbor road lake forest was dark there were no street lights and i had no flashlight fortunately the night was relatively cleara snowstorm would have made the job impossible hunching down in my navysurplus pea jacket i made my way quietly past the house on the corner once in the backyard the snow muffled any sound of my feet it also made walking laborious as i reached the fence dividing the yard from its neighbor a dog started barking to my left soon it sounded as though all the dogs in suburbia were yapping at me i climbed over the fence and moved east away from the baying hoping to get deep enough to hit the paciorek house from behind the third lot was comparable in size to the pacioreks as i moved into the wooded area the dogs finally quieted down now i could hear the sullen roar of lake michigan in front of me the regular angry slapping of wave against cliff made me shiver violently with a cold deeper than that of freezing toes and ears totally disoriented in the dark i kept bumping into trees stumbling over rotting logs falling into unexpected holes suddenly i skidded down a small bank and landed with a jolt on my butt on some rocky ice after picking myself up and slipping again i realized i must be at the stream if i walked away from the roaring lake i should with luck be at the back of the paciorek house in a few minutes i had fought my way clear of the trees the house loomed as a blacker hole in the dark in front of me agnes and i had usually come out through the kitchen which was on the far left along with rooms for the servants no lights shone there now if the servants were in they were not giving any sign of it in front of me were french windows leading into the conservatorylibraryorgan room my fingers were thick with cold it took agonizing minutes to unbutton the pea jacket and take it off i held it over the glass next to the window latch with a numb hand i pulled the smith wesson clumsily from its holster tapped the jacket lightly but firmly with the butt and felt the glass give underneath i paused for a minute no alarms sounded holding my breath i gently knocked glass away from the frame stuck an arm through the opening and unlatched the window once inside the house i found a radiator pulling off boots and gloves i warmed my frozen extremities ate the rest of the hershey bar squinted at phosphorescent hands on my watchpast nine oclock mrs paciorek must be getting impatient after a quarter of an hour i felt recovered enough to meet my hostess pulling the damp boots back on my toes was unpleasant but the cold revived my mind slightly torpid from the hike and the warmth once outside the conservatory i could see lights coming from the front of the house i followed them through long marble passages until i came to the family room where id talked to mrs paciorek a couple of weeks ago as id hoped she was sitting there in front of the fire the needlepoint project in her lap but her hands still standing at an angle in the hail i watched her her handsome angry face was strained she was waiting for the sound that would tell her i had been shot xxiii lake forest party id been holding the smith wesson in one hand but she was clearly alone i put the gun back in the holster and walked into the room good evening catherine none of the servants seemed to be here so i let myself in she stared at me frozen for a moment i wondered if she really were having a stroke then she found her voice what are you doing here i sat down facing her in front of the fire you invited me remember i tried getting here at eight but i got lost in the darksorry to be so late whohow she broke off and looked suspiciously at the hallway let me help you out i said kindly you want to know how i got past walter novickor whoever you have waiting for me out front dont you i dont know what youre talking about she said fiercely then well go and find out i stood up again walking behind her i grabbed her under the armpits and pulled her to her feet she wasnt much heavier than i and had no fighting skills whatsoever she tried struggling with me but it wasnt an equal contest i frogmarched her to the front door now you are going to call whoever is out there to come in my right hand is now holding my smith and wesson revolver which is loaded and ready to shoot she opened the door angrily casting me a look of loathing she went to the shallow porch two figures broke away from the shadows near the driveway and came toward her leave she yelled leave she came in through the back the two men stood still for a minute i aimed the gun at the one nearer my right hand drop your weapons i shouted drop your weapons and come into the light at my voice they both shot at us i pushed mrs paciorek into the snow and fired the man on the right staggered tripped sprawled in the snow the other fled i heard a car door slam and the sound of tires trying to grab hold youd better come with me catherine while we see what kind of shape hes in i dont trust you alone in there with a phone she didnt say anything as i dragged her pumpclad feet through the snow when we came to the sprawled figure he pointed a gun at us dont shoot again you lunatic i cried youll hit your employer when he didnt put the gun down i let go of mrs paciorek and jumped on his arm the gun went off but the bullet sailed harmlessly into the night i kicked the weapon from his hand and knelt to look at him in the lights marking the driveway i made out his heavy slavic jawline walter novick i hissed i couldnt keep my voice quite steady we cant keep meeting in the dark like this as nearly as i could tell id hit his right leg just above the knee it should have been a bad enough wound to keep him from moving but he was strong and he was scared he tried scrabbling away from me in the snow i grabbed his right arm and yanked it up behind him mrs paciorek turned on her heel and headed for the front door catherine i yelled better call an ambulance for your friend im not sure ofaolin can get reinforcements out here in time to shoot me if you phone him first anyway she must have heard me but gave no sign a few seconds later the front door slammed shut behind her novick was cursing loudly if unimaginatively his voice slightly muffled by the wiring holding his jaw together i didnt want to leave him but i didnt want mrs paciorek summoning help either gathering the hit man by the armpits i started dragging him toward the house he screamed with pain as his right leg bumped along the ground i dropped him and knelt again this time looking him in the face we need to talk walter i panted im not leaving you here on the chance you can make it to the road for your buddy to find you not that hes likely tohes probably in dupage county by now he tried to hit me but the cold and blood loss were getting to him the blow landed ineffectually on my shoulder your working days are over walter even if they patch that leg up youre going to spend a long long time in joliet so well talk when you feel at a loss for words ill help you out i dont have anything to say he gasped hoarsely they havent madeacharge stick yet they wontwont do it now wrong walter stefan herschel is going to be your downfall youre slipping you didnt kill him hes alive hes already idd you from your photo he managed a contemptuous shrug mymy friendswill provehes wrong fury compounded of fatigue of lottys accusations of the attempt on my eyes rose in me i shook him enough to jar the injured leg and was glad when he yelped your friends i shouted at him don pasquale you mean the don didnt send you here did he did he when novick didnt say anything i picked him up by the shoulders and started dragging him toward the house again stop he yelled no no it wasnt the don itit was someone else i leaned over him in the snow who novick i dont know i grabbed his armpits all right he screamed put me down i dont know his name heshes someone who called me have you ever met him in person in the floodlights i saw him nod weakly a middleaged man he had met him once the day he stabbed uncle stefan this man had come with him to the apartment no uncle stefan might not have seen himhed waited in the hail until after the stabbing then gone in to collect the forged stocks he was fiftyfive or sixty green eyes gray hair but the voice novick especially remembereda voice youd recognize in hell he called it ofaolin i sat back on my heels and looked at the hit man sour bile filled my mouth i swallowed a handful of snow gagged swallowed again trying to force down the desire to kill novick where he lay walter youre a lucky man pasquale doesnt give a damn whether you live or die neither do i but youre going to live isnt that nice and if you swear in court that the man who ordered you out here tonight was behind the stabbing of stefan herschel ill see you get a good plea bargain wellforget the acid well even forget the fire how about it the don wont forget me this was in a thread of a voice i had to stick my ear close to his revolting face to hear it yes he will walter he cant afford to be tied to the forgeries he cant afford the fbi and the sec subpoenaing his accounts he isnt going to know you he still didnt say anything i pulled the smith wesson from my jeans belt if i shoot your left kneecap youll never be able to prove it didnt happen when you attacked me at the door you wouldnt he gasped he was probably right my stomach was churning as it was what kind of person kneels in the snow threatening to destroy the leg of an injured man not anyone i wanted to know i pulled the hammer back with a loud click and pointed the gun at his left leg no he cried no dont ill do it whatever you say but you get me a doctor get me a doctor he was sobbing pitifully toughest man in the mafia i put the gun away good boy walter you wont regret it now just a few more questions and well get you an ambulancekitty paciorek seems to have forgotten you novick eagerly told the little he knew hed never seen mrs paciorek before the man with the voice had called yesterday and told him to get out here at seven tonight to make sure no one saw him to shoot me as i walked up to the house from my car yes it was the man with the voice who hired him to throw acid at me how did he know you walter how did he know to get in touch with you he didnt know the don must have given him my number thats all i can figure he told the don he needed a good man and the don gave him my number you are a good man walter pasquale must be proud of you you came for me three times and all you got out of it was a broken jaw and a smashed up legim going to get you an ambulance youd best be praying your godfather forgets all about you because from what i hear he doesnt like failures too much i covered him with my coat and headed for the front door as i reached the steps a car pulled into the driveway not an ambulance i froze then jumped from the shallow porch to shelter in some evergreens running from the house to the garage the same place i saw from the trampled snow where novick had waited for me the garage doors opened electronically the car pulled in and stopped i peered around the edge of a tree a dark blue mercedes dr paciorek how much did he know about tonights escapade now was as good a time as any to find out i stepped into the garage he looked up in surprise as he locked the car door victoria what are you doing here i came out to see your wifei had some papers of agness she wanted to see someone was lying in wait out front here and took a shot at her ive hit him in the leg and i need to get an ambulance for him he looked at me suspiciously victoria this isnt your idea of a joke is it come and see for yourself he followed me to the front novick was dragging himself toward the road as fast as he could a feeble activity that had moved him ten feet or so you paciorek yelled stop novick continued to move we trotted over to him dr paciorek handed me the briefcase he was carrying and knelt to look at the hit man novick tried to fight with him but paciorek didnt need my help to hold him down after a few minutes feeling of the leg during which novick cursed more loudly than ever paciorek said briefly the bone is broken but there isnt much else the matter except cold ill get an ambulance and call the police you dont mind staying with him do you i was starting to shiver i guess not can you lend me your coat i gave him mine he gave me a surprised glance then took off his cashmere coat and draped it around my shoulders after the doctors bulky body vanished into the house i squatted down next to novick before you pass out lets get our stories straight by the time the lake forest police arrived we had agreed that hed gotten lost and come to the door looking for help mrs paciorek terrified had screamed that brought me to the scene with my gun out walter had taken fright at that and fired at me i shot him not very believable but i was damned sure mrs paciorek wouldnt contradict it the sirens sounded in the distance novick had fainted finally and i stood back to let the officials take over i was dizzy and close to fainting myself fatigue nausea at the depths of my own rage how like a mobster i had behaved torture threats i dont believe the end justifies the means id just been plain raving angry as wave on wave of policemen interviewed me i kept dozing off waking up keeping my wits together enough to tell the same story each time then dozing again it was one oclock when they finished and left dr paciorek had refused to let his wife talk i dont know what she told him but he sent her to bed the locals didnt argue that decision not with that much money behind it dr paciorek had let the police use his study as an interrogation room after they left he came in and sat in the leather swivel chair behind his desk i was sprawled in a leather armchair three parts asleep would you like a drink i rubbed my eyes and sat up a little straighter brandy would be nice he reached into a cabinet behind the desk for a bottle of cordon bleu and poured two hefty servings what were you doing here tonight he asked abruptly mrs paciorek wanted to see me she asked me to come out around eight she says you showed up unexpectedly his tone wasnt accusatory monday nights are when the lake county medical society gets together i usually dont go catherine asked me to leave her alone tonight because she was having a meeting with a religious group she belongs to she knows that isnt of much interest to me she says you showed up threatening her and brought that man along with you that she was struggling with you when your gun went off and hit him where did her religious friends go she says they had left before you showed up do you know much about this corpus christi outfit she belongs to he stared at his brandy for a while then finished it with one swallow and poured himself another shot i held out my snifter he filled it recklessly corpus christi he finally said when i married catherine her family accused me of being a fortune hunter she was an only child and that estate was worth close to fifty million i didnt care much about the money some but not much i met her in panamaher father was the ambassador i was working off my loan from uncle sam she was very idealistic was doing a lot of work in the poor community there xavier ofaolin was a priest in one of those shantytowns he interested her in corpus christi i met her because i was trying to keep dysentery and a lot of other unpleasant stuff under control in that shantytown a hopeless battle really he swallowed some more brandy then we came back to chicago her father built this house when he died we moved in catherine turned most of the savage fortune over to corpus christi i started becoming successful as a heart surgeon ofaolin moved on to the vatican catherine was genuinely idealistic but ofaolin is a charlatan he knew how to look good and do well at the same time it was john the twentythird who brought him to the vaticanthought of him as a real peoples priest after john died ofaolin headed quickly to where the money and power were we drank quietly for several minutes few things go down as easily as cordon bleu i should have spent more time at home he gave a mirthless smile the plaint of the suburban father at first catherine was pleased to see me at the hospital twenty hours a dayafter all it proved i shared her lofty ideals but after a while she burned out on suburban living she should have had her own career but it didnt go with her ideals of catholic motherhood by the time i saw how angry shed become agnes was in college and it was too late for me to do anything i spent the time with phil and barbara i should have spent with agnes and cecelia but i couldnt help catherine he held the bottle up to his desk lamp enough for two more he divided it between us and tossed the bottle into a leather wastebasket at his feet i know she blamed you for agnesslifestyle i need to know was she so angry with you that shed try to get someone to shoot you it had taken him a quarter bottle of good brandy to get that out no i said not that simple im afraid i have some evidence showing that corpus christi is trying to take over a local insurance company mrs paciorek is most anxious that that information not become public im afraid i had reasons for thinking someone might be waiting for me out front so i broke in through a window in your conservatory the police didnt search the back of the house or they would never have left i see he looked suddenly old and shrunken in his tailored navy suit what are you going to do about it im going to have to let the fbi and the sec know about corpus christis involvement i dont plan to tell them about tonights ambush if thats any consolation nor could i bring myself to tell him about agness note if shed been killed because of her investigation into the ajax takeover then in some way or other her mother bore responsibility for her death dr paciorek didnt need to hear that tonight he stared bitterly at the desk top for a long time when he looked up he was almost surprised to see me sitting there wherever hed been was a long way away thanks victoria youve been more generous than i had a right to expect i finished my own brandy embarrassed dont thank me however this ends its going to be bad for you and your children while im really most interested in xavier ofaolin your wife is heavily involved in corpus christi their money is being used in an attempt to take over ajax insurance when the facts come out shes going to be right up front on the firing line but wouldnt it be possible to show she was just ofaolins dupe he smiled bitterly which she has been since she first met him in panama i looked at him with genuine pity dr paciorek let me tell you the situation as i understand it the banco ambrosiano is missing over a billion dollars which disappeared into unknown panamanian companies based on a letter from a panamanian named figueredo to archbishop ofaolin it looks as though ofaolin knows where that money is hes in sort of a bind as long as he doesnt use it no one will know where it is once he starts to move it the game is up ofaolins no dummy if he can get some large financial institution like an insurance company under his control he can launder the money and use it however he wants michael sindona tried that on behalf of the mob with the franklin national bank only he was stupid enough to strip the banks assets so hes languishing now in a federal prison corpus christi in chicago has a huge endowment thanks to mrs paciorek ofaolin is a member and recruited your wife very well let them put together a dummy corporation call it woodsage and use that to acquire ajax stock once the connection comes out between corpus christi and the ajax takeoverand it will the sec is investigating like crazyyour wifes involvement will be frontpage news especially here in chicago but thats not criminal the doctor pointed out i frowned unhappily at last i said look i didnt want to tell you this particularly not tonight when youve had such a shock but theres agness death you see yes his voice was harsh she was looking into the takeover for one of the ajax officers she found out about the corpus christi involvement she was killed that night while waiting to meet with someone to discuss it his white stricken face was like an open wound in the room i could think of nothing to say to ease that pain at last he looked up and gave a ghastly smile yes i can see even if xavier is the main culprit catherine cant avoid her own responsibility for her daughters death no wonder shes been so his voice trailed off i got up i wish i could think of some comfort for you i cant but if you want my help please call me my answering service takes messages twentyfour hours a day i put my card on the desk in front of him and left i was boneweary and stiff id have gladly lain down in front of the familyroom fire and passed out but i willed my aching body down the front stairs to the street going by road it was only a fiveminute walk to my car instead of the half hour it had taken me crosscountry my watch said three when i moved the stiff toyota back onto the tollway i found a motel at the first southbound exit checked in and fell asleep without bothering to undress xxiv baiting the trap it was past noon when i woke again every muscle ached id remembered to put the smith wesson aside before going to sleep but not the holster my left side was sore from where the leather had pressed into my breast all night my clothes stank id fought walter novick in this shirt put in a heavy stint of crosscountry hiking and slept in it the smell bore acute witness to these activities i longed for a bath but not if it meant redonning my repellent apparel i picked up the toyota and maneuvered its clumsy steering down the expressway to the bellerophon mrs climzak gave me a darkling glance from behind the counter but forebore any criticism so i gathered no one had tried burglarizing my apartment in the night it was only after a long soak in the stained porcelain tub that wherever hed been was a long way away thanks victoria youve been more generous than i had a right to expect i finished my own brandy embarrassed dont thank me however this ends its going to be bad for you and your children while im really

forebore any criticism so i gathered no one had tried burglarizing my apartment in the night it was only after a long soak in the stained porcelain tub that i realized how hungry i was dry reclothed i stiffly descended the four flights of stairs what would the dons reaction be to losing novick would he be gunning for me or would he realize novick wasnt salvageable and cut his losses only the shadow knew just in case pasquale was pissed i braved mrs climzaks breathy protests and went past the front desk to explore the bellerophons nether regions the lobbys back entrance led to a hallway where her apartment was situated her mules flopping she scampered behind me like an angry hen miss warshawski miss warshawski what are you doing back here get out get out before i call my husband before i call the police her apartment door opened and the fabled mr climzak appeared in a tshirt and baggy trousers a days growth of beard helped hide his drinkreddened cheeks he didnt look as though he could throw me out but he might be alert enough to call the police just looking for the back door i told him brightly continuing down the passage as i undid the dead bolt mrs climzak hissed this is the last straw you will have to find other lodgings i looked at her before going outside i hope so mrs climzak i certainly hope so no hail of machinegun bullets strafed me in the alley nor were any suspiciouslooking cars hovering on the street i found a polish restaurant and ate heartily if not healthily of cabbage soup chicken dumplings and apple tart i felt decidedly more human over a second cup of coffee an idea began glimmering at the back of my brain preposterous it would need murrays cooperation and uncle stefans illinois bell povertystricken by the at t dismemberment had raised the price of pay phone calls to a quarter after fishing for change i reached murray at the desk of the herald star iii gave him a big huge story would he sit on it until it came to an end aint you dead yet warshawski what am i supposed to do in exchange for this big huge story run a couple of lines on the front page of the evening and morning editions im not the editori dont control what goes on the front page or even page sixtytwo of the middle section murray im shocked you told me you were an important newspaperman can it be you lied can it be i have to go to the tribune and talk to lipinski grumbling he agreed to meet me at the golden glow around five pm the schoolroom clock over the counter said twothirty time to check things out with uncle stefan another quarter to my answering service reminded me i hadnt told phyllis i wouldnt be back to her place last night or roger that id miss his board meeting and bobby wanted to see me to talk about walter novick not your jurisdiction i muttered what was that the operator said nothing any other calls dr paciorek wanted to talk to me hed left his paging number at the hospital for me frowning i put another quarter in the machine twentyfive cents gets you three tries clicked from operator to operator at the hospital i finally connected with dr paciorek victoria i was afraid you wouldnt get my message his normally controlled voice was rough and human could you come back to the house tonight i know its a lot to ask ofaolins coming outim going to settle this matter i rubbed my eyes with my free hand would this upset my other plans dr paciorek breathed anxiously in my ear while i considered maybe i could put a little advance pressure on the archbishop i guess so cant make it before eight though fine fine thanks very much victoria dont thank me for anything dr paciorek this story is not going to have a happy ending a long silence then i realize that and he hung up jim streeter met me at uncle stefans door the doctors say the old man can be releasetomorrow hes been trying to reach his niece i guess shes planning on taking him home with her what do you want us to do of course he would be going home with lotty i thought in irritation id better talk to him uncle stefan was delighted to see me delighted to be going home and why are you frowning my little niece arent you pleased for me oh certainly yes im very pleased how are you feeling fine chipper yes chipper he beamed proudly at producing this colloquial word every day i go for physical therapy and every day i am stronger walk farther all i need now is chocolate i grinned and sat on the bed i have a favor to ask of you please say no if you dont want to do it because theres some danger involved not a lot but some he cocked a lively eye at me and demanded details instead of going to lottys would you come home with me i need you to pretend youre dead for twentyfour hours then arise from the grave with a flourish lotty will be wutend he beamed no doubt if that means what i think it does console yourself with the thought that its me she wants to murder he patted my hand comfortingly lotty is a headstrong girl dont worry about her you didnt see a second man in your apartment the day you were stabbed did you he shook his head just thethe thug would you be willing to say that you saw him he was there you see just hovering outside until your thug had stabbed you if you say he was there my dear niece i believe you xxv knight takes bishop murray grudgingly agreed to run the story ill have to tell gil the whole tale he warned me gil was the front page editor i explained the entire situation to himajax the banco ambrosiano corpus christi murray finished his beer and signaled to the waitress for another sal was busy behind the bar with commuting drinkers you know its probably ofaolin who backed away the fbi from the case i nodded thats what i think between mrs paciorek and him theres enough money and power to strangle a dozen investigations id like to get derek out to the priory with me tomorrow but he doesnt listen to me at the best of times neither does bobby and today wasnt the best of times id spent a frustrating afternoon on the phone id had a long talk with bobby in which he read me the riot act for not fingering novick earlier he refused to listen to my story refused to send men out to the priory to question the archbishop or pelly and was aghast at the accusation against mrs paciorek bobby was a saltoftheearth catholic he wasnt taking on a prince of the church nor yet a princess derek hatfield was even less cooperative a suggestion that he at least block ofaolins departure for fortyeight hours was met with frosty contempt as so often happened in my encounters with derek i ended the discussion with a rude remark that is i made a rude remark and he hung up same thing really a conversation with freeman carter my lawyer was more fruitful he was just as skeptical as bobby and derek but at least he worked for me and promised to get some namesin exchange for a hundred and a quarter an hour ill be at the priory murray promised no disrespect but id like a dozen men with guns just remember miss warshawski the pen is mightier than the pencil murray said portentously i laughed reluctantly well tape it murray promised and ill have someone there with a camera itll have to do and youll take uncle stefan home with you murray grimaced only if you pay for the funeral when lotty finds out what ive done hed met lotty enough times to know what her temper was like i looked at my watch and excused myself it was close to six the time i was to call back freeman at his club before he left for a dinner meeting sal let me use the phone in the cube she calls an office a windowless room directly behind the bar with oneway glass overlooking the floor freeman was brisk but brief he gave me two names mrs pacioreks attorney and her broker and yes the broker had handled a twelvemilliondollar transaction for corpus christi to buy ajax shares i whistled to myself as freeman hung up worth a hundred twentyfive dollars i looked at my watch again time for one more call this time to ferrant still at his ajax office he sounded more tired than ever i talked to the board today and tried urging them to find my permanent replacement they need someone managing the insurance operations or those will go to hell and there wont be anything left to take over all my energy is going into meetings with legal eagles and financial wizards and i dont have time to do the only thing i do wellbroker insurance deals roger i think i may have a way out of the problem for you i dont want to tell you what it is because youd have to tell your partner and your board it may not work but if a lot of people know about it it definitely wont work roger turned this over when he spoke again his voice had more energy than id heard for some time yes youre right so i wont press you could i see you tonight dinner maybe a very late dinnersay ten oclock that suited his schedule he would be closeted with eagles and wizards for several hours yet can i tell them we may have a break coming our way as long as you dont tell them who you heard it from when i got back to the table murray had left a brief note torn from his steno notebook informing me he was off to talk to gil to try to make the last edition the one advantage the rented toyota had over my little omega was that its heater worked january was sliding into february without any noticeable change in the weather the thermometer had dropped below freezing new years eve and hadnt climbed above it since as i slid out of the underground garage and turned onto lake shore drive the car was already warm enough that i could take off my coat exiting at half day road i wondered how safe it was to drive right up to the pacioreks front door what if dr paciorek agreed with ofaolin that i should be bumped off it might save his wifes reputation what if ofaolin knocked him out with a crucifix and shot me the doctor met me at the door his face grave and pinched he looked as though he hadnt slept since i left him the night before catherine and xavier are in the family room they dont know youre herei didnt think xavier would stay if he knew you were coming probably not i followed him down the familiar hallway into the familiar hot living room mrs paciorek sat as usual by the fire ofaolin had pulled a straightbacked chair up to the couch on which she sat as dr paciorek and i came in they looked toward the door and let out simultaneous gasps ofaolin was on his feet and coming toward the door paciorek put out an arm strong through years of sawing people open and propelled him back into the room we need to talk his voice had recovered its firmness you and catherine havent been saying anything to the point i thought victoria could help us out ofaolin gave me a look that made my stomach jump hatred and destruction i tried to force down my own fury at the sight of himthe man who tried to get me blinded who burned my apartment now was not the time to try to strangle him but the urge was strong good evening archbishop good evening mrs paciorek i was pleased to hear my voice come out without a quaver lets talk about ajax and corpus christi and agnes ofaolin had himself back under control topics about which i know very little miss warshawski the accentless voice was supercilious xavier i hope you have a confessor with a lot of pull he narrowed his eyes slightly whether at my use of his first name or at the accusation i couldnt know how dare you talk to the archbishop like that mrs paciorek spat out you know me catherine brave enough to try anything it all comes with practice really dr paciorek held up his hands pleadingly now that youve all insulted each other could we get down to some real conversation victoria you talked last night about the link between corpus christi and ajax what evidence do you have i fished in my purse for the greasy photocopy of rául diaz figueredos letter to ofaolin i guess what i really have is ofaolins involvement in the ajax takeover you read spanish dont you the doctor nodded silently and i handed the photocopy across to him he read it carefully several times then showed it to ofaolin so it was you he hissed i shrugged i dont know what was me but i do know this letter shows you being advised that ajax was the best if not easiest takeover target youve got a billion dollars in banco ambrosiano assets sitting in panama banks you cant use themif you withdraw the money and start spending it the bank of italy is going to come down on you like lions on an early christian so you remembered michael sindona and the franklin national bank and realized what you needed was a us financial institution to launder money through and an insurance company is better than a bank in lots of ways because you can play all these games with loss reserves and your lifecompany assets and nobody will really be able to tell figueredo got someone to check out the available stock companies my guess is ajax looked good because its in chicago the money boys are myopic when something happens outside new york cityitll take them longer to notice whats going on with me so far catherine had gone quite pale her mouth was set in a thin line ofaolin however was at ease smiling contemptuously its a beautiful theory but if a friend of mine points out that ajax is a good takeover target that is not illegal and if i am taking it over that too is not illegal although where i would get such money is a good question but so far as i know i am not taking it over he sank back in his chair legs stretched out ankles crossed alas for the venality of the human condition i tried a contemptuous smile myself but suavity is not my long suit my attorney freeman carter spoke with yours this afternoon mrs paciorek freeman belongs to the same club as fuller gibson and fuller didnt mind telling him who handles the brokerage business for the paciorek trust and then it wasnt too difficult getting verification of the note agnes left for me corpus christi used twelve million to buy ajax shares in the name of the woodsage corporation no one said anything for a minute mrs paciorek made a strangled little noise and fainted falling over on the couch paciorek went to her side while ofaolin got up and strolled toward the door i stood in the doorway blocking his path he was half a foot taller than i and maybe forty pounds heavier but i was twenty years younger he tried to shove me aside with his left arm since his weight was forward on that side i grabbed the arm and pulled sending him sprawling on his face into the hall this small piece of violence unleashed the fury id been holding barely in check panting slightly i waited for him to climb to his feet he got up backing warily away from me i laughed slightly not scared are you xavier i curled my right fingers at the second joint and came in with my left elbow to his diaphragm he landed an inexpert blow on my shoulder while i used my crooked fingers to push at his eyes holding the back of his head with my left hand i pushed up with the right while he shoved at me and kicked not a fighter i might blind you i might kill you if you fight you up the pressure i felt an arm on my left shoulder pulling and shrugged it away but it pulled more insistently i came away gasping for air red rage swirling through my head let go of me let go of me victoria it was dr paciorek i felt a stinging on my face realized hed slapped me and came slowly back to the marble hallway he tried to blind me i panted he tried to burn me to death he probably killed agnes you should have let me kill him ofaolin was white except for his eyesthe skin around them was scarlet from the pressure of my fingers he straightened his clerical collar shes mad thomas call the police paciorek let go of my arm and i leaned against the wall as reality returned i remembered the other part of my plan oh yes stefan herschel died tonight thats another crime that this prince of peace is responsible for paciorek frowned who is stefan herschel he was an old man a master engraver who tried to interest xavier here in buying a forged stock certificate xavier stole the certificate but not before his buddy walter novick had stabbed the man walter is the man who was lying shot on your lawn last night he gets around is this true paciorek demanded this woman is a lunatic thomas how can you believe what she says the old man is dead apparently so how can you verify your story all of this is hearsay anyway an old man dead corpus christi buying ajax shares figueredo writing about ajaxs investment potentialhow does that implicate me in a crime paciorek was pale whether you are implicated or not catherine is thanks to you its her money that funds corpus christi here in chicago and its that money thats being used to buy ajax stock and now maybe because she was looking into that my oldest daughter is dead ofaolin i hold you responsible you got catherine involved in all this for years you have insisted i was catherines evil genius her rasputin ofaolin was haughty so it is no surprise to me that you blame me now he turned on his heel and left neither paciorek nor i moved to stop him paciorek looked wearier than ever how much of that is true how much of what i said irritably is corpus christi behind woodsage yes thats true and woodsage behind the ajax takeover bid yes they filed friday with the sec and agnes killed because of looking into it never will be proved probable i need a drink he muttered months go by and i have one glass of wine here i am drinking two days in a row he led me through the labyrinth to his study hows catherine catherine the name seemed to surprise him oh catherine shes all right just shock she doesnt need me in any event he looked in his liquor cupboard we finished the brandy last night didnt we i have some whiskey you drink chivas you have black label he pawed through the little cupboard no black label i accepted a chivas and sat in the leather armchair what about the old man the engraver i shrugged hes dead that makes ofaolin an accessory if novick can make the identification stick trouble is it wont be in time hell be on that plane to rome tomorrow at ten as long as he never comes back to chicago hell be home free and the ajax takeover he finished the whiskey in a gulp and poured another he offered the bottle to me but i shook my headi didnt want to be drunk for the drive back to chicago i think i can stop that how i shook my head its a small piece of sec law so small that xavier probably never noticed it i see he finished his second drink and poured himself a third there wasnt any point in watching him get drunk at the door i turned for a moment to look at him he was staring into the bottom of the glass but he sensed my departure without looking up he said you say agness death will never be proved but how sure are you theres no evidence i said helplessly he put the glass down with a snap dont when someone has a fatal heart condition i tell them i tell them these things are never certain and that gutsy people and lucky people beat the odds but without a scan i know whats happening as one professional to another how sure are you about agness death i met his brown eyes and saw with a twinge that tears swam in them as one professional to anothervery certain i see thats all i wanted to know thank you for coming up tonight victoria i didnt like to leave him in this state he ignored my outstretched arm picked up a journal lying on a corner of the desk and studied it intently i didnt tell him it was upside down xxvi loading the gun roger met me at grillons an old chicago tradition where waiters leave you alone instead of popping up every five minutes to ask if everything is to your satisfaction they rolled a huge joint of beef up to the table and cut off rare slices for us stilton flown in from melton mowbray just for the restaurant went well with a port despite my worries and the ugly scene id been through with ofaolin i felt good roger was bouyant youve given me something to look forward to vi i told the board that i had a privateinquiry agent looking into the matter and that he thought he had a way out they were most keen but since i didnt have any information i couldnt give them any i smiled tiredly and clasped his hand it was midnight when we finished the port and the waiter brought our check roger asked hesitantly if he could come home with me i shook my head regretfully not that i wouldnt like itthe company would be most welcome but its not much of a place and right now whats there is a shambles someone was pawing through it looking for a document and i just dont feel like sharing the mess is that the way an american girl tells someone to go to hell i leaned across the table and kissed him when i tell you to go to hell you wont have any doubts at all that thats what you heard i guess what im telling you is that im homeless and dont like it i feel disoriented and i need to be alone with it he nodded soberly people on my staff are always telling me i can deal with that i guess thats an americanism anyway i can deal with that when he offered to drive me i gratefully accepted abandoning the toyota in the underground garage if it wasnt still there in the morning no big loss it was after onethirty when he deposited me in front of the bellerophon courteously waiting until i was safely inside he waved and drove off mrs climzak had sat up for me as soon as i came in the door she came huffing over her face resembling an angry peony youre going to have to leave miss warshawski or whatever your name really is i want to mrs climzak i dont like the bellerophon any better than it likes me but well both have to stick it out until the end of the week this isnt funny she stamped her foot i was afraid some of the petals might start falling off you have disrupted your apartment you have strange men in at all hours of the night not disrupted mrs climzak you mean theres been an irruption in the apartment i dont think you disrupt apartments only meetings dont try to change the subject now tonight two men burst in and almost frightened my husband to death what did they doshow him a job application you get out of here by eight tomorrow morning and take those men with you what men i started to say then realized what she was talking about my heart began beating faster i wished i hadnt drunk so much at dinner but the smith wesson gently pushing into my side brought some comfort theyre still in the apartment you didnt call the police why should i she said in thin triumph i figured they were your problem not mine thanks mrs climzak dont call the mayors office for your goodcitizen medaltheyll call you pushing my way past her i went behind the lobby desk picked up the phone and dialed my room she was squawking and pulling at my arm but i ignored herid beaten up an archbishop today an old lady wasnt going to trouble me any after fifteen rings a gravelly voice i knew well answered ernesto its v i warshawski you going to shoot me if i come up to my room where are you warshawski weve been waiting here since eight oclock sorry i got carried away by religion he asked again where i was and told me to wait for him in the lobby when id hung up mrs climzak was shrieking that she was going to get her husband to call the cops if i touched that phone again i leaned over and kissed her would you really there are a couple of gangsters waiting to cart me off if you call the cops you might be in time to rescue me she gazed at me in horror and dashed off to the nether regions ernesto looking the picture of a corporate executive came through the stairwell door a seedy thin man in an illfitting chauffeurs uniform at his heels surely if they meant to shoot me they would have hidden outside and not broadcast their faces to the world like this surely yet my hands didnt believe me they started sweating and i was afraid they might be trembling so i stuck them into my pockets your rooms a mess warshawski if id known you were coming i wouldve cleaned up he ignored the sarcasm someones been searching it sloppy job you know that i told him i knew it and followed him into the cold night the limousine was parked around the corner ernesto and i sat in the backseat me not blindfolded this time i lay against the comfortable upholstery but couldnt sleep this has to work i told myself has to this cant be a summons to shoot me in revenge for wounding walter novick for that theyd just gun me down on the street jumbled with these thoughts was ofaolins contemptuous face as he left me tonight pacioreks despair and somewhere in the city a furious lotty hearing that uncle stefan was going home with murray was going to play the tethered goat for me on north avenue we turned into the parking lot of an enormous restaurant no wonder they hadnt blindfolded me nothing secret about this place a huge neon sign with a champagne glass bubbling over perched on top of the marquee underneath it flashing lights proclaimed this as torfinos restaurant italian food and wine when the limousine pulled up in front of the entrance a doorman sprang from nowhere to open the car for ernesto and me the driver took off whispering hoarsely the first sound id heard from him call when youre ready i followed ernesto through the restaurant empty of customers to a hallway behind the kitchen spare linoleum and green greasespattered walls gave it a common institutional look a bored young man stood guard at a closed door he moved to one side as ernesto approached behind the door lay a private office where the don sat talking on a phone gently smoking a large cigar he nodded at ernesto and waved a hand at me signaling me to come in like the dons library this office was decorated in red here the effect was cheap the curtains were rayon the seat covers vinyl the desk a mere box on four legs pasquale hung up and asked ernesto what had taken him so long in italian ernesto explained my long absence further someone else is interested in signorina warshawski her room has been carelessly searched and who would that be miss warshawski pasquale asked with grave courtesy i blinked a few times trying to readjust myself to the imaginary world of honor i thought you might know don pasquale i assumed it was done by your henchman walter novick at the request of mrs paciorek the don looked at his cigar measuring the ash then turned to ernesto do we know a walter novick ernesto ernesto gave a disdainful shrug he has run a few errands for you don he is the type who likes to grab at the coattails of the powerful pasquale nodded regally i regret that novick gave the appearance of being under my protection as ernesto said he had illusions above his abilities these illusions led him to use my name in a compromising way again he examined the ash still not ripe this novick is acquainted with many petty criminals a man like that frequently engages in foolish or dangerous exploits with such criminals in order to impress a man such as myself he gave a worldweary shrug i knew and he knew that such exploits were the acts of the childish butwhat would you the ash now proved ready for a gentle tapping among these criminals were some forgers novick conceived an act of staggering folly to engage these forgers to make fake stock certificates and put them in the safe of a religious house he paused to invite my comment on this staggering folly how don did these forgers know for which companies and in which denominations to make the fakes pasquale hunched a shoulder impatiently priests are guileless men they talk indiscreetly someone no doubt overheard them such things have happened before you would have no objection to my bringing this tale to derek hatfield he smiled blandly none whatsoever although it is merely hearsayi can see no benefit to my talking to hatfield myself and you wouldnt know the names of these forgers would you regrettably no my dear miss warshawski and you wouldnt know why these forgers used the priory would you one presumes miss warshawski because it was easy for them it is not of great interest to me i could feel sweat prickling on the palms of my hands my mouth was dry this was my chance i just hoped pasquale student of human terror that he was couldnt detect my nervousness unfortunately don you may have to take an interest pasquale didnt change position nor did he alter his look of polite attention but his expression somehow froze and the eyes glittered in a way that made cold sweat break out on my forehead his voice when he spoke chilled my marrow is that a threat miss warshawski out of the corner of one eye i could see ernesto whod been slouching in a vinyl chair come to attention not a threat don pasquale just for your information novicks in the hospital and hes going to talk and archbishop ofaolins going to say it was all your idea about the forgeries and attacking me and all that stuff he isnt going to know anything about it pasquale had relaxed slightly i was breathing more easily ernesto sank back in his chair and started looking at his pocket diary as you may know don the sec will not allow anyone with known mafia connections to own an insurance company or a bank so ofaolin is going to back away from novick as fast as he can hell leave on a ten oclock flight tomorrow night and let you handle the situation as best you can the don nodded with a return of his grave courtesy as always your comments are fascinating miss warshawski if i knew this ofaolinhe spread his hands deprecatingly meanwhile i am desolated by the discomfort walter novick has brought into your life he looked at ernesto a redleather checkbook materialized the don wrote in it would twentyfive thousand cover the loss to your apartment i swallowed a few times twentyfive thousand would get me a coop replace my mothers piano or enable me to spend the rest of the winter in the caribbean what did i want with such things however your generosity is fabled don pasquale yet i have done nothing to deserve it he persisted politely keeping my eyes on a poor reproduction of garibaldi over the pressedwood desk i steadfastly resisted pasquale finally gave me a measuring look and told ernesto to see that i got home safely xxvii luck of the archbishop at fourthirty in early february the sky is already turning dark inside the chapel of our lady of the rosary the candles created warming circles of light behind an ornately carved wooden screen separating the friars choir stalls from the secular mob the room was dim i could barely make out uncle stefans features but knew he was there from the comforting clasp of his hand murray was at my left beyond him was cordelia hull one of his staff photographers as father carroll began to chant the introit in his high clear tenor my depression deepened i shouldnt be here after making a complete fool of myself in as many ways as possible i should have retired to the bellerophon and pulled the covers over my head for a month the day had started badly lotty enraged at the fourparagraph story in the heraldstar announcing her uncles sudden relapse and death was not mollified by his decision to go home with murray according to murray the argument had been brief uncle stefan chuckling and calling lotty a hotheaded girl did not amuse her and she had switched to german to give vent to her fury uncle stefan told her she was interfering where it was none of her business whereat she tore off in her green datsun to find me i didnt have the advantage of knowing lotty as a headstrong little girl willfully riding her pony up the castle steps at kleinsee besides her accusations were too close to my nerve centers egotistical so singleminded i would sacrifice uncle stefan trying to solve a problem that had the fbi and the sec baffled but lotty i put my own body on the line too that arson at my apartment she contemptuously swept away my protest hadnt the police asked for full information hadnt i withheld it in my usual arrogant way and now i wanted someone to weep because i was suffering the consequences when i tried to suggest to uncle stefanand murraythat we drop the project and retire quietly murray had been angry in his turn not after all hed been through to sell gil on the project if i was too lilylivered all of a sudden to follow through on this he wasnt hed take uncle stefan to the priory himself and i could go sulk in my tent and enjoy it alone uncle stefan took me to one side really victoria by now you should know better than to pay the least heed to lotty when she is in such a tantrum if you are letting her overset you it is only because you are very tired he patted my hand and insisted that murray go to a bakery and buy some chocolate cake and none of that sara lee or davidson cake i mean a real bakery young man there must be one in your area so murray returned with a hazelnut chocolate cake and whipped cream uncle stefan cut me a large slice poured cream over it and stood watching me eat it with anxious benevolence so nichtchen now you are feeling better right i wasnt not really somehow i couldnt recreate the terror id felt earlier dealing with ofaolin all i could think of was father carrolls probable reaction to my antics in his chapel but at threethirty id followed uncle stefan into the backseat of murrays pontiac fiero we reached the chapel early and were able to get seats in the front row behind the wooden screen i was assuming that rosa hard at work on priory finances would attend the service but i didnt want to run the risk of her recognizing me even in the gloomy half light by turning around and peering around us people joined in the service knowing which chants permitted group singing which ones were solo performances the four of us sat quietly when the offertory announced the beginning of the mass my heart started beating faster shame fear anticipation all crowded together next to me uncle stefan continued to breathe calmly while my palms turned wet and my breath came in short gasping chunks through the rood screen i could see the priests forming a large semicircle around the altar pelly and ofaolin stood side by side pelly small intent ofaolin tall and selfassured the chief executive officer at an office picnic ofaolin wore a black cassock instead of the white dominican robe he was not part of the order we let the congregation file past us to receive communion when rosas ramrod back and castiron hair marched by i gently nudged uncle stefan we stood up together and joined the procession some half dozen priests were passing out wafers at the altar the procession split as people quietly went to the man with the fewest communicants in front of him uncle stefan and i moved behind rosa to archbishop ofaolin the archbishop wasnt looking at peoples faces he had performed this ritual so many times that his mind was far from the benevolent superiority of his face rosa turned to go back to her seat she saw me blocking her path and gave an audible gasp it brought ofaolin abruptly to the present his startled gaze went from me to uncle stefan the engraver grabbed my sleeve and said loudly victoria this man helped to stab me the archbishop dropped the ciborium you he hissed his eyes glittered youre dead so help me god youre dead a camera flashed cordelia hull on the job murray grinning held up his microphone any more comments for posterity archbishop by now the mass had come to a complete halt one of the more levelheaded young brothers had leaped to retrieve the spilled communion wafers from the floor before they were stepped on the few remaining communicants stood gaping carroll was at my side what is the meaning of this miss warshawski this is a church not a gladiators arena clear these newspaper people so we can finish the mass then id like to see you in my office certainly prior my face felt red but i spoke calmly id appreciate it if youd bring father pelly along too and rosa will be there my aunt rooted at my side now tried to make for the door i held her thin wiry arm in a grasp tight enough to make her wince were going to talk rosa so dont try to leave ofaolin started justifying himself to carroll shes mad prior shes dug up some old man to hurl accusations at me she thinks i tried to kill her and shes been persecuting me ever since i came out to the priory thats a lie uncle stefan piped up whether this man is an archbishop i couldnt say but that he stole my stocks and watched a hoodlum try to kill me that i know listen to him now the prior held up his arms enough i hadnt known the gentle voice could carry so much authority were here to worship the lord these accusations make a mockery of the lords supper archbishop you will have your turn to speak later he called the congregation to order and gave a pithy homily on how the devil could be at our side to tempt us even at the very gates of heaven and had everyone join in a group confession still holding on to rosa i moved away from the center of the chapel to one side as the congregation prayed i watched ofaolin head toward the exit behind the altar pelly standing near him looked wretched if he left now with ofaolin he made a public statement of complicity if he stayed behind the archbishop would never forgive him his choices flitted across his intense mobile face with the clarity of a stock quotation on an electronic ticker at length his cheeks flushed with misery he joined his brothers in the final prayers and filed silently with them from the chapel as soon as carroll was out of sight the congregation burst into loud commentary above the clatter i listened for a different sound it didnt come rosa started muttering invectives at me in a loud undertone not here auntie dear save it for the priors study with stefan and murray on my heels i guided my aunt firmly through the gaping chattering crowd to the hallway door cordelia stayed behind to get a few group photos pelly was sitting with carroll and jablonski rosa started to say something when she saw him but he shook his head and she shut up power in the word if we were all still alive at the end of the session i might try to hire him as her keeper as soon as we were seated carroll demanded to know who murray and uncle stefan were he told murray that he could stay only on condition that none of the conversation was either recorded or reported murray shrugged then there isnt much point in my staying carroll was adamant murray acquiesced i tried to get xavier to join us but he is getting ready to go to the airport and refuses to say anything i want an orderly explanation from the rest of you starting with miss warshawski i took a deep breath rosa said dont listen to her father she is nothing but a spitefilled you will have your turn mrs vignelli carroll spoke with such cold authority that rosa surprised herself by shutting up this tale has its roots some thirtyfive years ago in panama i told carroll at that time xavier ofaolin was a priest working in the barrio he was a member of corpus christi and a man of deep ambition catherine savage a young idealistic woman with a vast fortune joined corpus christi under his persuasion and turned most of her money into a trust for the use of corpus christi she met and married thomas paciorek a young doctor in the service she spent four more years in panama and developed a lasting interest in a seminary where dominicans could continue the work she and ofaolin had undertaken among the poor as i got well into my story i finally started relaxing my voice came out without a tremor and my breathing returned to normal i kept a wary eye on rosa toward the end of her stint in panama a young man came to the priory of san tomás who shared her passion and her idealism not to spin out the obvious it was augustine pelly he too joined corpus christi he too fell under xavier ofaolins influence when ofaolins ambition and acuity got him a coveted promotion to rome pelly followed and served as his secretary for several yearsnot a typical venue for a dominican friar when he rejoined his brothers this time in chicago he met mrs vignelli another ardent if very angry soul she too joined corpus christi it gave some meaning to an otherwise bitter life rosa made an angry gesture and if it is bitter whose fault is that well get to that in a moment i said coldly the next important incident in this tale took place about three years ago when roberto calvi prompted by his own internal devils set up some panamanian subsidiaries for the banco ambrosiano using over a billion dollars in bank assets when he died that money had completely disappeared we probably will never know what he meant to use it for but we do know where much of it is now as i sketched the transactions between figueredo and ofaolin and the effort to take over ajax i continued to strain for sounds in the background i stole a look at my watch six oclock surely that brings me to the forgeries prior that they played a role in the takeover i feel certain for it was to stop my investigation that ofaolin dug up a petty hoodlum named walter novick he got him to throw acid at me and to burn my apartment building down indeed it was sheer luck that kept seven people from being murdered by his mania to stop my investigation into the forgeries what puzzles me is rosas role and that played by her son albert i can only think that rosa didnt know the forgeries had been put in the safe by corpus christi until after she called me in to investigate suddenly and with uncharacteristic humility she tried to get me out of the case she wouldnt discuss it she mouthed pieties yet initially she was so fearful of an fbi frameup that she forced me to listen to repeated insults in order to clear her blameless character rosa could contain herself no longer insults why should i ask you for help what have i not suffered at the hands of that whore who called herself your mother rosa this was pelly rosa calm yourself you do the church no favor with these accusations rosa was beyond his influence the demon that had rocked her sanity two weeks ago was too close to her now i took her in oh how i was betrayed sweet gabriella beautiful gabriella talented gabriella her face contorted in an angry mimicry oh yes the darling of the family do you know what your precious gabriella did did she ever have the courage to tell you not she filthy whore she came to me i took her in from the goodness of my heart i was forty and my belly was swollen with child what did i want with a baby i hated men hated their foul hands touching me in the night i who kept myself pure and childless destroyed by the lusts of your uncle carrying my shame for all the world to see did she pity me not she while i worked my fingers to the bone for her she seduced my husband if i would divorce him he would take my child he would support me only let him live with his sweet talented gabriella spit was flecking her lips we all sat unable to think of anything that might stop the flow so i threw her into the street who would not have i made her promise to disappear and leave no word yes she had that much shame and what did carl do he shot himself shot himself because of a whore from the streets left me alone with albert that whore that shameless one she was screaming louder and louder repeating herself now i stumbled into the hallway to find a washroom as i staggered along catching the bile in my hands i felt carrolls arm around me guiding me to a tiny dark room with a sink i couldnt talk couldnt think heaving gasping for air choking up images of gabriella her beautiful haunted face how could she think my father and i would not forgive her carroll wiped my face with cold towels gradually the terrible shuddering stopped leading me to a small room he sat me on a sofa he disappeared for a few minutes then returned with a cup of green tea i gulped it gratefully i need to finish this conversation he said i need to find out why augustine did what he did for it must have been he who put the forged certificates in the safe your aunt is fundamentally a pitiable creature can you be strong enough to keep that in mind and help me end this story as fast as possible oh yes my voice was hoarse from gagging yes my weariness amazed me if i could forget this day and the sooner it ended the sooner it would go away i dragged myself up again shook off carrolls supportive arm followed him back into the study pelly murray and stefan were still there from the priors closed inner office rosas screams came in a mindshattering stream uncle stefan pale and shaking rushed to my side and began murmuring various soothing things at me in german i thought i heard the word chocolate and smiled in spite of myself murray said to carroll jablonski is in there with her hes called for an ambulance just as well carroll moved the rest of us back to the small room where hed given me tea pelly could scarcely walk his normally sunburned face was pale and his lips kept moving meaninglessly rosas demented outburst had shaken the remains of his selfconfidence the story he told carroll confirmed my analysis they needed money to acquire ajax mrs paciorek was supplying as much as she could but it wasnt enough besides they didnt want to get the sec involved too early by having all the purchases come from one source pelly knew about the five million in blue chip shares in the priory safe he wrote to ofaolin saying he would be glad to use them but didnt want to arouse suspicions by their disappearing several months later the forgeries arrived in the mail who created them he didnt know but presumably it was done under ofaolins direction pelly substituted them for the real ones in the safe after all the shares hadnt been used in a decade or more the chances were good that the ajax purchase would long since have become history when the deception was discovered unfortunately he was out of town when the chapter voted to sell the shares so they could build a new roof when he returned from his annual retreat in panama it was to find the priory in an uproar and rosa fired from her position as treasurer he called rosa and told her to dismiss me that corpus christi knew all about the forgeries and would protect her xavier came to chicago a few days later he muttered miserably unable to look at either me or carroll hehe took over things at once he was most annoyed with me for letting so much publicity escape over the forgeries especially because he said the amount was trivial compared to what we needed he was annoyed too thatthat warshawski here was still poking around in the situation he told me hed take over that he would seesee that she stopped i just assumed she was a catholicwarshawski you knowthat she would be persuaded by an archbishop i didnt know about the acid or the arson not until much later anyway the fbi investigation i croaked hoarsely how did ofaolin put the brakes on that pelly smiled wretchedly he and jerome farber were good friends and mrs paciorek of course among them they have a lot of influence in chicago no one spoke beyond the heavy silence we could hear the sirens of rosas ambulance carrolls face strained and griefstricken rebuked any comment augustine well talk later go to your room now and meditate you will have to talk to the fbi after that i dont know as pelly wrapped himself in what dignity he could i heard the sound i had been waiting for a dull roar an explosion muffled by distance and stone walls murray looked at me sharply what was that he and carroll got to their feet and looked uncertainly at the door i stayed where i was a few minutes later a young brother redhaired and panting hurled himself into the room the front of his white habit was streaked with ash prior he gasped prior im sorry to interrupt but youd better come down at the gates quickly murray followed the prior from the room a story he could use i didnt know what had happened to cordelia hull and her camera but no doubt she was close at hand uncle stefan looked at me doubtfully should we go victoria i shook my head not unless you have a taste for bomb sites someone just set off a radio bomb in ofaolins car i hoped to god he was on his own that no brother was with him yes archbishop no one is lucky forever xxviii the myth of iphigenia ferrant left for england the day of the first real thaw he had stayed long enough to install a proper vicepresident of special risks at ajax long enough to help me furnish my new apartment his check for stopping the takeover was the largest fee id ever collected it easily paid for a steinway grand to replace gabriellas old upright it didnt cover the cost of a coop but a few days after ofaolins death an envelope containing twentyfive crisp thousanddollar bills arrived in my office mail no note no return address it seemed churlish to try to trace it anyway id always wanted to own my own home roger helped me find a coop on racine near lincoln in a clean quiet little building with four other units and a wellcaredfor lobby for nearly a week after the bombing i spent most of my time in the federal building talking to the fbi talking to the sec when i wasnt there i was with mallory his pride was badly wounded he wanted to assuage it by getting my license revoked but my lawyer easily put a stop to that what hurt bobby the most was a letter he got from dr paciorek a suicide note really pouring out guilt and grief over the doctors wife and daughter they found catherines body in front of the family room fire his was in the study murray told me more about it than i wanted to know after that i didnt have anything to do except sleep and eat and furnish the new place i didnt like to think too much about rosa or my mother or the ugliness id found in myself that night with walter novick in the snow roger helped keep the thoughts at bay at least during the day he couldnt do much about my dreams after dropping him at the airport i felt empty and lonely and scared roger had kept some demons away now id have to deal with them maybe id do it some place else though take uncle stefan up on his offer to go to the bahamas for a week or fly to arizona and watch the cubs go through spring training i sat in front of the apartment for a while playing with the keys in the ignition across the street the door of a dark green datsun opened the car seemed familiar with its creased fender and scratched paint lotty crossed the street and stood in front of the omega looking unlike herself looking for once as small as a fivefoottall person should i climbed out of the omega and locked the door may we talk vic i nodded without speaking and led her into the building she didnt say anything else until we were inside my apartment i hung her coat on a hook in the small entryway and ushered her into the living room where a comfortable chaos was already starting to build on the new furniture stefan told me roger was leaving today i wanted to wait for him to go before i sought you out i have a lot to say to you a lot to unsay also can youwill youher clever ugly face contorted in a surprising spasm she steadied herself and started again you have been the daughter i never had vi as well as one of the best friends a woman could ever desire and i abused you i want your forgiveness i want to not to go back to where we were we cant i want to continue our friendship from here let me explainnot justify explainive never talked about my family and the war its too close to the bone my parents shipped my brother hugo and me to london in they were to follow but never made it out of vienna hugo and i spent the whole war wondering waiting later we learned they had died in buchenwald in my grandmother all my uncles and cousins of that whole large happy family at kleinsee only hugo and i remained stefanstefan is a lovable rogue if he were as hateful as your aunt though i would still need to protect him he and hugo and i are all that remain of that idyllic time when he was stabbedi went mad a little i couldnt admit that he chose his fate i couldnt admit that he had a right to do so i blamed you and it was very wrong of me my throat was tight and the first few times i tried speaking the words came out in a whispered choke lotty lotty ive been through hell and beyond this winter i have been so alone do you know the torment i have been through agnes died because i involved her in my machinations dr paciorek did you see what happened he killed his wife and shot himself and all because i chose to be narrowminded pigheaded bullying my way down a road the fbi and the sec couldnt travel lotty flinched vic dont torment me by throwing my angry words back at me ive been in that hell this winter too but mine was worse i created misery for my dearest friend
