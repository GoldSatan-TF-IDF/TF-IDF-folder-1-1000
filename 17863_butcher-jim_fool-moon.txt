fool moon book of the dresden files by jim butcher chapter i never used to keep close track of the phases of the moon so i didnt know that it was one night shy of being full when a young woman sat down across from me in mcanallys pub and asked me to tell her all about something that could get her killed no i said absolutely not i folded the piece of paper with its drawings of three concentric rings of spidery symbols and slid it back over the polished oakwood table kim delaney frowned at me and brushed some of her dark shining hair back from her forehead she was a tall woman buxom and lovely in an oldworld way with pale pretty skin and round cheeks well used to smiling she wasnt smiling now oh come on harry she told me youre chicagos only practicing professional wizard and youre the only one who can help me she leaned across the table toward me her eyes intent i cant find the references for all of these symbols no one in local circles recognizes them either youre the only real wizard ive ever even heard of much less know i just want to know what these others are no i told her you dont want to know youre better off forgetting this circle and concentrating on something else but mac caught my attention from behind the bar by waving a hand at me and slid a couple of plates of steaming food onto the polished surface of the crooked oak bar he added a couple of bottles of his homemade brown ale and my mouth started watering my stomach made an unhappy noise it was almost as empty as my wallet i would never have been able to afford dinner tonight except that kim had offered to buy if id talk to her about something during the meal a steak dinner was less than my usual rate but she was pleasant company and a sometime apprentice of mine i knew she didnt have much money and i had even less despite my rumbling stomach i didnt rise immediately to pick up the food in mcanallys pub and grill there arent any service people according to mac if you cant get up and walk over to pick up your own order you dont need to be there at all i looked around the room for a moment with its annoying combination of low ceilings and lazily spinning fans its thirteen carved wooden columns and its thirteen windows plus thirteen tables arranged haphazardly to defray and scatter the residual magical effects that sometimes surrounded hungry in other words angry wizards mcanallys was a haven in a town where no one believed in magic a lot of the crowd ate there look harry kim said im not using this for anything serious i promise im not trying any summoning or binding its an academic interest only something thats been bothering me for a while she leaned forward and put her hand over mine looking me in the face without looking me in the eyes a trick that few nonpractitioners of the art could master she grinned and showed me the deep dimples in her cheeks my stomach growled again and i glanced over at the food on the bar waiting for me youre sure i asked her this is just you trying to scratch an itch youre not using it for any anything cross my heart she said doing so i frowned i dont know she laughed at me oh come on harry its no big deal look if you dont want to tell me never mind ill buy you dinner anyway i know youre tight for money lately since that thing last spring i mean i glowered but not at kim it wasnt her fault that my main employer karrin murphy the director of special investigations at the chicago police department hadnt called me in for consulting work in more than a month most of my living for the past few years had come from serving as a special consultant to si but after a fracas last spring involving a dark wizard fighting a gang war for control of chicagos drug trade work with si had slowly tapered offand with it my income i didnt know why murphy hadnt been calling me in as often i had my suspicions but i hadnt gotten the chance to confront her about them yet maybe it wasnt anything id done maybe the monsters had gone on strike yeah right the bottom line was i was strapped for cash id been eating ramen noodles and soup for too many weeks the steaks mac had prepared smelled like heaven even from across the room my belly protested again growling its neolithic craving for charred meat but i couldnt just go and eat the dinner without giving kim the information she wanted its not that ive never welshed on a deal but ive never done it with anyone humanand definitely not with someone who looked up to me sometimes i hate having a conscience and a stupidly thorough sense of honor all right all right i sighed let me get the dinner and ill tell you what i know kims round cheeks dimpled again thanks harry this means a lot to me yeah yeah i told her and got up to weave my way toward the bar through columns and tables and so on mcanallys had more people than usual tonight and though mac rarely smiled there was a contentment to his manner that indicated that he was happy with the crowd i snatched up the plates and bottles with a somewhat petulant attitude its hard to take much joy in a friends prosperity when your own business is about to go under i took the food steaks and potatoes and green beans back to the table and sat down again placing kims plate in front of her we ate for a while myself in sullen silence and she in hearty hunger so kim said finally what can you tell me about that she gestured toward the piece of paper with her fork i swallowed my food took a sip of the rich ale and picked up the paper again all right this is a figure of high magic three of them really one inside the other like layered walls remember what i told you about magical circles kim nodded they either hold something out or keep it in most work on magic energies or creatures of the nevernever but mortal creatures can cross the circles and break them right i said thats what this outermost circle of symbols is its a barrier against creatures of spirit and magical forces these symbols here here here are the key ones i pointed out the squiggles in question kim nodded eagerly i got the outer one whats the next the second circle is more of a spell barrier to mortal flesh it wouldnt work if all you used was a ring of symbols youd need something else stones or gems or something spaced between the drawings i took another bite of steak kim frowned at the paper and then at me and then what would that do invisible wall i told her like bricks spirits magic could go right through it but mortal flesh couldnt neither could a thrown rock bullets anything purely physical i see she said excited sort of a force field i nodded something like that her cheeks glowed with excitement and her eyes shone i knew it and whats this last one i squinted at the innermost ring of symbols frowning a mistake what do you mean i mean that its just gobbledygook it doesnt mean anything useful are you sure you copied this correctly kims mouth twisted into a frown im sure im sure i was careful i studied her face for a moment if i read the symbols correctly its a third wall built to withhold creatures of flesh and spirit neither mortal nor spirit but somewhere in between she frowned what kind of creatures are like that i shrugged none i said and officially it was true the white council of wizards did not allow the discussion of demons that could be called to earth beings of spirit that could gather flesh to themselves usually a spiritcircle was enough to stop all but the most powerful demons or elder things of the outer reaches of the nevernever but this third circle was built to stop things that could transcend those kinds of boundaries it was a cage for demonic demigods and archangels kim wasnt buying my answer i dont see why anyone would make a circle like this to contain nothing harry i shrugged people dont always do reasonable sensible things theyre like that she rolled her eyes at me come on harry im not a baby you dont have to shelter me and you i told her dont need to know what kind of thing that third circle was built to contain you dont want to know trust me she glowered at me for a long moment then sipped at her ale and shrugged all right circles have to be empowered right you have to know how to switch them on like lights something like that sure how would a person turn this one on i stared at her for a long time harry she asked you dont need to know that either not for an academic interest i dont know what youve got in mind kim but leave it alone forget it walk away before you get hurt harry i am not save it i told her youre sitting on a tiger cage kim i thumped a finger on the paper for emphasis and you wouldnt need it if you werent planning on trying to stick a tiger in there her eyes glittered and she lifted her chin you dont think im strong enough your strengths got nothing to do with it i said you dont have the training you dont have the knowledge i wouldnt expect a kid in grade school to be able to sit down and figure out college calculus and i dont expect it of you either i leaned forward you dont know enough yet to be toying with this sort of thing kim and even if you did even if you did manage to become a fullfledged wizard id still tell you not to do it you mess this up and you could get a lot of people hurt if i was planning to do that its my business harry her eyes were bright with anger you dont have the right to choose for me no i told her ive got the responsibility to help you make the right choice i curled the paper in my fingers and crushed it then tossed it aside to the floor she stabbed her fork into a cut of steak a sharp vicious gesture look kim i said give it some time when youre older when youve had more experience you arent so much older than me kim said i shifted uncomfortably in my seat ive had a lot of training and i started young my own ability with magic far in excess of my years and education wasnt a subject i wanted to explore so i tried to shift the direction of the conversation how is this falls fundraiser going its not she said she leaned back wearily in her seat im tired of trying to pry money out of people to save the planet theyre poisoning or the animals theyre killing im tired of writing letters and doing marches for causes no one believes in anymore she rubbed at her eyes im just tired look kim try to get some rest and please please dont play with that circle promise me she tossed her napkin down left a few bills on the table and stood up enjoy your meal harry she said and thanks for nothing i stood up as well kim i said wait a minute but she ignored me she stalked off toward the door her skirt swaying along with her long hair she cut an impressive statuesque figure i could feel the anger bubbling off her one of the ceiling fans shuddered and let out a puff of smoke as she walked under it then whirled down to a halt she raced up the short flight of stairs and exited the bar banging the door shut behind her people watched her leave then glanced back to me speculation on their faces i sat back down frustrated dammit kim was one of several people i had coached through the difficult period surrounding the discovery of their innate magical talents it made me feel like crap to withhold information from her but she had been playing with fire i couldnt let her do that it was my responsibility to help protect her from such things until she knew enough to realize how dangerous they were to say nothing of what the white council would think of a nonwizard toying with major summoning circles the white council didnt take chances with things like that they just acted decisively and they werent always particular about peoples lives and safety when they did it i had done the right thing keeping that kind of information out of kims hands had been the right decision i had been protecting her from danger she didnt couldnt fully appreciate i had done the right thingeven if she had trusted me to provide answers for her as i had in the past when teaching her to contain and control her modest magical talents even if she had trusted me to show her the answers she needed to be her guide through the darkness id done the right thing dammit my stomach was soured i didnt want any more of macs delicious meal steak or no steak i didnt feel like id earned it i was sipping ale and thinking dark thoughts when the door opened again i didnt look up occupied as i was with brooding a famous pastime of wizards everywhere and then a shadow fell over me sitting here pouting murphy said she bent over and absently picked up the wadded scrap of paper i had tossed aside earlier tucking it tidily into her coat pocket rather than letting it lie about as clutter on the floor thats not much like you harry i glanced up at murphy i didnt have far to look karrin murphy wasnt much more than five feet tall shed gotten her golden hair cut from shoulder length to something far shorter and a little longer in front than in back it was a punky sort of look and very appealing with her blue eyes and upturned nose she was dressed for the weather in what must have been her athome clothes dark jeans a flannel shirt hiking boots and a heavy woodsmans jacket she was wearing her badge on her belt murphy was extremely cute for a grown adult who also held a black belt in aikido and had several marksmanship awards from chicago pd she was a real professional one who had fought and clawed her way up the ranks to become full lieutenant shed made enemies along the way and one of them had seen to it that she was put in charge of special investigations soon after hello there murphy i told her i took a swig of ale and said long time no see i tried to keep my voice even but im pretty sure she heard the anger in it look harry did you read the editorial in the tribune the one criticizing you for wasting the citys money hiring a charlatan psychic named harry dresden i guess you must have since i havent heard from you since it came out she rubbed at the bridge of her nose i dont have time for this i ignored her not that i blame you i mean not many of the good taxpayers of chicago believe in magic or wizards of course not many of them have seen what you and i have you know when we worked together or when i was saving your life her eyes tightened at the edges i need you weve got a situation you need me we havent talked for more than a month and you need me all of a sudden ive got an office and a telephone and everything lieutenant you dont need to track me down here while im having dinner ill tell the killer to be sure to operate during business hours next time murphy said but i need you to help me find him i straightened in my chair frowning theres been a murder something in my field murphy flashed a hard smile at me i hope you didnt have anything more important to do i felt my jaw grow tense no im ready i stood up well then she said turning and walking away shall we go chapter murphy declined to ride in the blue beetle my old volkswagen bug the beetle wasnt really blue not anymore one of the doors had been replaced with a green duplicate the other one with white when something with claws had shredded the originals the hood had been slagged by fire and my mechanic mike had replaced it with the hood from a red vehicle the important thing is that the beetle runs even if it doesnt do it very fast and im comfortable with the car mike has declared that the vw bug is the easiest car in the world to repair and so thats what i drive he keeps it running eight or nine days in ten thats phenomenal technology tends to foul up around wizardsflip on a light switch and itll be the time the bulb burns out drive past a streetlight and itll pick just then to flicker and die whatever can go wrong will automobiles included i didnt think it made much sense for murphy to risk her vehicle when she could have taken mine but she said shed take her chances she didnt speak as she drove her saturn down the jfk out toward rosemont i watched her uncomfortable as we went she was in a hurry taking a few too many chances cutting in and out of traffic and i put on my seat belt at least we werent on her motorcycle murph i asked her wheres the fire she glanced aside at me i want you out there before some other people show up press i couldnt quite keep a nasty slur out of the word she shrugged whoever i frowned at her but she didnt say anything elsewhich seemed typical murphy didnt speak much to me anymore we rode the rest of the way in silence exited the jfk and pulled into the parking lot of a halfcompleted little strip mall we got out of the car a jet came in low heading for ohare international airport only a few miles to the west i squinted at it for a moment and then frowned at murphy as a uniformed officer led us toward a building surrounded by police tape there was an abundance of light the moon overhead bright silver and almost a completely round circle i cast an enormous gangly shadow as i walked my duster flapping around my legs it towered beside murphys far smaller shadow ahead of me murphy i said arent we outside chicago city limits yeah murphy said shortly uh then arent we out of your jurisdiction technically people need help wherever they can get it dresden and the last several killings happened in chicago so we want to look at this firsthand i already worked things out with the local force its not really an issue several killings i said several as in more than one murphy slow down but she didnt instead she led me into a roomy building that proved to be under construction though all the exterior work was finished some of the windows were still covered with board i didnt see the sign on the buildings front doors until i got close the varsity i said reading it i thought marcone burned it down last spring mmmhmm murphy said glancing at me over her shoulder relocated and rebuilding chicagos resident crime lord gentleman johnny marcone was the robber baron of the mean streets he kept all the rough business inside the city proper leaving his legitimate interests out in the suburbs like here in rosemont last spring when i had confronted him in his club a previous incarnation of the varsity about a deadly new drug on the streets the place had wound up burning to the ground after the whole mess was over word got out that the drug dealer id taken out had been marcones enemy and that i had nuked him at the crime lords request i hadnt refuted the rumor it was easier to let people talk than to force marcone to make an issue of things inside the building the floors were rough unfinished someone had turned on a couple of halogen work lights and they cast the interior into brilliant clear white light there was drywall dust everywhere there were a few card tables set up with workmens tools left out on them in places plastic buckets of paint tarps and a sack of new paintbrushes waited for use off to one side i didnt notice the blood until murphy put her arm out in front of me to keep me from walking into it wake up dresden she said her voice was grim i stopped and looked down blood a lot of blood it began near my feet where a long splatter had reached out like an arm from a drowning man staining the dusty floor with scarlet my eyes followed the path of the long bloodstain back to a pool maybe an eighth of an inch deep surrounding a mound of ripped cloth and torn meat that must have been the corpse my stomach quailed threatening to eject the bites of steak id taken earlier that evening but i forced it down i walked in a circle around the body keeping my distance the corpse was i guessed that of a male in his thirties he had been a large man with a short spiky haircut he had fallen onto his side facing away from me his arms curled up toward his head his legs up toward his vitals a weapon a little automatic pistol lay seven or eight feet away uselessly out of the victims reach i walked around the corpse until i could see the face whatever had killed him it hadnt been human his face was gone simply torn away something had ripped his lips off i could see his bloodstained teeth his nose had been torn all the way up one side and part of it dangled toward the floor his head was misshapen as though some enormous pressure had been put upon his temples warping his skull in his eyes were gone torn out of his head bitten out there were the ragged slash marks of fangs all around the edges of the sockets i closed my eyes tightly i took a deep breath another a third that didnt help the body stank a sickly sewersmell that rose up from the torn innards my stomach wanted to roll up my throat out my mouth and onto the floor i could remember the other details even with my eyes closed and catalogued them neatly for later reference the victims jacket and shirt had been torn to bloody ribbons along his forearms in defensive wounds his hands and arms were a mass of pulped ripped meat the palms and fingers slashed to ragged lumps the curl of his body hid his abdomen from me but that was where the blood was pooling from spreading out like ink from a spilled bottle the stench only confirmed that he had been eviscerated i turned away from the corpse and opened my eyes staring down at the floor harry murphy said from the far side of the body the note of hardness that had been in her voice all evening was absent she hadnt moved while i had done my cursory examination i recognize him i said at least i think i do youll need to check dental records or something to be sure i could hear her frown in her words yeah who was he i dont know his name i always called him spike for the haircut he was one of johnny marcones bodyguards murphy was quiet for a moment then said succinctly shit what murph i looked back at her without looking down at spikes mangled remains murphys face was set in concern for me her blue eyes gentle i saw her wipe the expression away as quickly as a shadow crosses the floor a smoothing of lines that left her features neutral i guess she hadnt expected me to turn to her take a look around a little more she said then well talk what am i looking for i asked her youll know it she said then added in a whisper that i think she didnt intend me to hear i hope i turned back to my work and looked around the room off to one side one of the windows was broken near it was a table lying askew on the floor its legs warped and bent i walked over to it broken glass littered the ground around the collapsed table since the glass was on the inside of the building something must have come in through the window there was blood on several of the broken pieces of glass i picked up one of the larger ones and frowned at it the blood was dark red and not yet wholly dried i took a white handkerchief from my pocket folded the shard of glass into it and then slipped it into the pocket of my duster i rose and paced over the floor my eyes downcast studying the dust in one spot it was rubbed almost clean off the floor as though a struggle had taken place there without blood being spilled in another spot where the halogen lamps didnt quite reach there was a pool of silver moonlight below a window i knelt down beside it in the center of the pool was a paw print in the dust a paw print almost as big as my spread hand canine dots at the tips of the paw spoke of heavy nails almost claws i looked up through the window at the rounded silver shape of the almostfull moon oh hell i breathed oh hell murphy came toward me and watched me silently for a moment waiting i licked my lips stood up and turned to her youve got problems no kidding talk to me dresden i nodded then pointed at the window the attacker probably came in there he went after the victim attacked him got the gun away from him and killed him its the attackers blood on the window they struggled a while over there by that clean spot maybe and spike made a break for the door he didnt make it there he got torn to pieces first i turned toward murphy looking down at her solemnly youve had other murders happen in the same way probably about four weeks ago when the moon was last full those were the other killings you were talking about murphy glanced at my face for a moment keeping her eyes off mine and nodded her head yeah four weeks ago almost exactly but no one else picked up the full moon angle just me uhhuh then you should see this too i said i led her over to the window and showed her the paw print in the dust beneath it she regarded it in silence harry she said after a minute are there such things as werewolves she brushed a strand of hair back from her cheek a small and oddly vulnerable gesture she folded her arms over her stomach as though she were cold i nodded yeah not like you see in the movies but yeah i figure thats what you got going here she drew in a deep breath all right then all right what can you tell me what do i need to know i opened my mouth to speak but i didnt get a chance to say anything there was a brief bout of shouting outside and then the front doors of the building banged open murphy tensed and i saw her mouth set in a hard little line her back straightened and she stopped hugging herself putting her fists on her hips godammit she said how do those assholes get everywhere so fast i stepped forward so that i could see a quartet of people in suits came through the door fanned out in an almost military diamond formation the man in front was not quite as tall as me but still very tall six feet and three or four inches his hair was jet black as were his eyebrows while his eyes were a shade of grey as pale as wood smoke his dark blue suit fit him well and i had the impression that it concealed an athletic build in spite of the fact that he had obviously seen more than four decades a blue identification badge reading fbi in huge obnoxious letters dangled from one lapel secure the scene he said his voice deep tense lieutenant murphy what the hell are you doing on a crime scene out of your jurisdiction nice to see you too agent denton murphy said in a flat tone you get around fast i told you that you werent welcome on this investigation denton said his words crisp his grey eyes flashed and i saw a vein bulge rhythmically on his forehead his gaze shifted to me who is this har i started to say but murphys snort cut over my words no one she said she flashed me a look that said very clearly to shut up that annoyed the hell out of me harry dresden i said making the words loud and clear murphy and i exchanged a glare ah denton said the charlatan ive read about you in the tribune his clear tense gaze returned to murphy you and your psychic friend might want to step out of the way theres police work being done here the real kind where we worry about fingerprints fibers genetic matchessilly things like that murphys eyes narrowed along with mine but if the twin glares affected denton it didnt show in his face murphy and denton had a brief staring match her fury against his steely intensity agent benn denton called a woman not quite into her thirties with a shoulderlength mane of hair gone prematurely grey turned toward us from her intent contemplation of the corpse she had olive skin deep green eyes and a thin severe mouth she walked toward us with a sort of hardmuscled sensuality moving like someone who is capable of being fast and dangerous when necessary of the four fbi agents who had entered the room she was the only one obviously sporting a weapon her jacket was unbuttoned and i could see the straps of her shoulder rig against the white of her shirt yes sir benn said her voice was very quiet her eyes took up a position midway between murphy and me looking at neither of us while watching us both please escort these two civilians denton stressed the word from the crime scene benn nodded once but didnt say anything in reply just waited i gathered myself to go but paused murphy planted her feet and lowered her arms casually to her sides i recognized the stubborn outthrust angle of her jaw she had that look she got when she was behind on points in one of her martialarts tournaments murphy was ready to fight damn i had to get her cooled off before we could accomplish anything murphy i said quietly can we talk outside like hell murphy said whoever this killer is hes knocked off half a dozen people in the last month im here and im after this man the rosemont department has given their consent for me to be here murphy glared up at benn the fbi agent had her by a considerable margin of reach and muscle i saw benns eyes narrow her shoulders grow tenser do you have that in writing denton demanded the vein in his head throbbed more angrily and do you really think you want me reporting this to your superiors lieutenant dont push me denton murphy said her voice hot i winced look murphy i said i put a hand on her shoulder lets just go outside for a minute i squeezed just a little murphy turned back toward me she chanced a brief glance up at my eyes and then relaxed a little a flicker of uncertainty crossing her features she started to ease down and i let my breath out i definitely didnt want this dissolving into violence it wouldnt accomplish anything get them out of here denton said and there was a note to his voice that i didnt like benn didnt give us any warning she just moved fast and hard stepping toward murphy and flicking some sort of martialarts blow i wasnt familiar with toward her temple there was a quick blur of motion murphys hands got there before the blow landed and she turned somehow levering benns weight off from her legs and slamming the greymaned woman hard into a wall benns expression went from shocked and surprised to furious in the space of half a second her hand dipped into her jacket hesitated for half a second and then resumed motion she drew her gun with an experts precision smooth and quick without seeming hurried her green eyes blazed i threw myself at murphy colliding with her and driving her over and down as the gun went off louder than a close clap of thunder in the interior of the halffinished restaurant we landed in a heap on the dusty floor benn denton shouted he lunged for her heedless of the gun and got between the armed woman and us i could hear him talking to her in a low urgent voice you crazy bitch i shouted what is the matter with you the two other fbi guys and several patrol officers from outside came running murphy grunted and elbowed me in the gut urgently i grunted back and moved off of her both of us climbed to our feet unhurt what the hell happened demanded one of the officers an older man with thinning grey hair denton turned to the officer calm and cool misfire there was a misunderstanding and agent benns weapon accidentally discharged the officer rubbed at his scalp and eyed murphy is that true lieutenant like hell i said i pointed a finger at benn this crazy bi murphy jammed an elbow into my stomach and glared at me thats true murphy said while i rubbed at my gut it happened just like agent denton said an accident i stared at her murph give me a break this woman had an accident with her weapon murphy said voice hard could have happened to anyone murphy turned her glare on the aging officer and he blinked mildly at her then shrugged denton turned back to us and studied murphy intently for a second then he nodded roj george why dont you two make sure the lieutenant is all right and help her to her car sure sure phil said a skinny kid with red hair big ears and freckles uh mr dresden lieutenant murphy why dont we go outside and get some air im roger harris and this is agent wilson the other fbi guy a bulky overweight man in his late forties his hair receding and his gut overhanging his belt just beckoned us to follow him and walked toward the door murphy glared at denton for a moment then spun on her heel and stalked after the bulky wilson i followed her i cant believe that you all right why the hell didnt you tell them what she did i asked murphy sotto voce that bitch murphy said back not nearly as quiet she tried to sucker punch me she tried to ventilate you murph i countered murphy let out a breath between her teeth but kept walking i glanced back at the room behind us and saw spikes torn and mangled body being surrounded by more police tape forensics had arrived and the team was getting set to sweep the room denton was kneeling down beside benn who had her face in her hands and looked as though she were weeping denton was watching me his grey eyes calculating and expressionless filing me away under tall slender dark hair dark eyes hawkish features no visible scars i stared at him for a minute and got a hunch a solid intuition of which i was completely sure denton was hiding something he knew something and he wasnt talking dont ask me how i knew it but something about him about the way the veins bulged in his forehead or the way he held his neck so stiffly made me think so um the kid harris said i blinked and turned to him he opened the door for murphy and me and we walked outside maybe give deborah some slack shes really stressed out about these lobo killings she hasnt slept much the past month she knew one of the guys who got killed shes been tense ever since shut up harris the overweight agent wilson said his tone disgusted just shut up he turned to the two of us and said in a calm voice get the hell out of here i dont want to see either of you around a scene that isnt on your turf lieutenant murphy internal affairs has enough to do dont you think he turned and went back into the building the redheaded kid gave us an apologetic awkward smile and then hurried to catch up with the overweight agent i saw him shoot a glance back at me his expression thoughtful then he was gone the door shut leaving murphy and me on the outside away from the investigation and the evidence at the crime scene i looked up through the clear night at the almostfull moon werewolves jumping through windows at gangsters lackeys in unfinished restaurants a mangled corpse in the middle of a blooddrenched floor berserk fbi field agents drawing guns and shooting to kill a little kung fu a little john wayne and a few casual threats so far i thought my nerves jangling just one more night on the job chapter my stomach roiled around with disgust at the macabre sights inside the building and with tension at what had nearly happened one of my ears was still ringing from the sound of the gunshot i was starting to shake all over now the adrenaline rush fading and leaving me jumpy and wired i stuck my hands in my dusters pockets careful of the bloodstained shard of glass wrapped in my handkerchief and turned my face into the wind closing my eyes relax harry i told myself calm down breathe in and out and just keep doing it see you arent dead dead people dont breathe like that you arent spike all torn to pieces on the floor you dont have any bullet holes in you either youre alive and murphys all right and you dont have to look at that eyeless face anymore but i could see the torn body still behind my eyelids i could smell the ghastly stench of his opened innards i could remember the blood sticky on the dusty floor congealing thick with tiny flecks of drywall i tasted bile in my throat and fought to keep from throwing up i wanted to scream to run to wave my arms and kick something until i felt better i could understand agent benns reaction almost if she had been working a string of killings like the one id just seen you cant stare at that much blood for very long without starting to see more of it everywhere else i just kept taking deep breaths in and out the wind was cool and fresh in my face sharp with the smells of the coming autumn october evenings in chicago are chilly breezy but i love them anyway its my favorite time of year to be outside i eventually calmed down murphy must have been doing the same thing beside me making herself relax we both started walking back toward the car at the same time no words needing to be passed between us i murphy began and fell silent again i didnt look at her didnt speak im sorry harry i lost control agent denton is an asshole but he does his job and he was right technically speaking i didnt have any right to be on the scene i didnt mean to drag you into all this she unlocked the doors and got in the car i got in the passenger side then reached out and plucked the keys from her hand as she began to start the engine she quirked her head at me narrowing her eyes i closed my hands around the keys just sit down and relax for a while murph we need to talk i dont think thats a good idea harry she said this is the thanks i get for saving your life twice now youre going to hold out on me you should know how it works she said scowling but she settled back in her seat and looked out the windshield of the car we could see the police forensics and the fbi suits moving back and forth inside the building we were both quiet for a long time the funny thing was that the problems between murphy and me came from the same source as the problems with kim delaney earlier tonight murphy had needed to know something to pursue an investigation i could have given her the informationbut it would have put her in danger to do so id refused to say anything and when id pursued the trail by myself all the way to its end there had been some burning buildings and a corpse or two there wasnt enough evidence to bring any charges against me and the killer wed been after had been dealt with but murphy hadnt ever really forgiven me for cutting her out of the loop in the intervening months shed called me in for work several times and id given the best service i could but it had been cool between us professional maybe it was time to try to bridge that gap again look murph i said weve never really talked about what happened last spring we didnt talk about it while it was happening she said her tone crisp as autumn leaves why should we start now that was last spring its october give me a break murphy i wanted to tell you more but i couldnt let me guess cat had your tongue she said sweetly you know i wasnt one of the bad guys you have to know that by now hells bells i risked my neck to save you murphy shook her head staring straight forward thats not the point no then what is the point dresden is that you lied to me you refused to give me information that i needed to do my job when i bring you in on one of my investigations i am trusting you i dont just go around trusting people never have she took a grip on the steering wheel her knuckles whitening less than ever now i winced that stung whats worse she was in the right some of what i knew it was dangerous murph it could have gotten you killed her blue eyes fixed on me with a glare that made me lean back against the car door i am not your daughter dresden she said in a very soft calm voice i am not some porcelain doll on a shelf im a police officer i catch the bad guys and i put their asses away and if it comes down to it i take a bullet so that some poor housewife or cpa doesnt have to she got her gun out of its shoulder holster checked the ammo and the safety and replaced it i dont need your protection murphy wait i said hastily i didnt do it to piss you off im your friend always have been she looked away from me as an officer with a flashlight walked past the car shining the light about on the ground as he looked for exterior evidence you were my friend dresden now murphy shook her head once and set her jaw now i dont know there wasnt much i could say to that but i couldnt just leave things there in spite of all the time that had gone by i hadnt tried to look at things from her point of view murphy wasnt a wizard she had almost no knowledge of the world of the supernatural the world that the great religion of science had been failing to banish since the renaissance she had nothing to use against some of the things she encountered no weapon but the knowledge that i was able to give herand last spring i had taken that weapon away from her left her defenseless and unprepared it must have been hell for murphy to daily place herself at odds with things that didnt make any sense things that made forensics teams just shake their heads thats what special investigations did they were the team specially appointed by the mayor of chicago to investigate all the unusual crimes that happened in the city public opinion the church and official policy still frowned at any references to magic the supernatural vampires or wizards but the creatures of the spirit world still lurked about trolls under bridges cradlerobbing faeries ghosts and spooks and boogers of every kind they still terrorized and hurt people and some of the statistics id put together indicated that things were only getting worse not better someone had to try to stop it in chicago or any of its sprawling suburbs that person was karrin murphy and her si team she had held the position longer than any of her many predecessorsbecause she had been open to the idea that there might be more than was dreamt of in horatios books because she used the services of the countrys only wizard for hire i didnt know what to say so my mouth just started acting on its own karrin im sorry silence lay between us for a long long time she gave a little shiver finally and shook her head all right she said but if i bring you in on this harry i want your word no secrets this time not to protect me not for anything she stared out the window her features softened in the light of the moon and distant streetlights more gentle murphy i said i cant promise that how can you ask me to her face flashed with anger and she reached for my hand she did something to one of my fingers that made a quick pain shoot up my arm and i jerked my hand back by reflex dropping the keys she caught them and jammed one of them in the ignition i winced shaking my stinging fingers for a moment then i covered her hand with mine okay i said all right i promise no secrets she glanced at me at my eyes for a breath and then looked away she started the car and drove from the parking lot all right she said ill tell you ill tell you because i need every bit of help i can get because if we dont nail this thing this werewolf were going to have another truckload of corpses on our hands this month and she sighed because if we dont im going to be out of a job and youll probably end up in jail chapter jail i said jail hell murphy were you planning on mentioning this to me anytime soon she shot me an irritated scowl headlights of cars going the opposite way on the highway flaring across her face dont even start with me harry ive had a long month a dozen questions tried to fight their way out of my mouth the one that ended up winning was why didnt you call me in on the other killings last month murphy turned her eyes back to the road i wanted to believe me but i couldnt internal affairs started riding me about what happened with marcone and victor sells last spring someone got the idea that i was in cahoots with marcone that i helped to murder one of his competitors and took out the threeeye drug ring and so they were poking around pretty hard i felt an abrupt twinge of guilt because i was on the scene you had that warrant out for me and then had it rescinded and then there were all those rumors about me and marcone after the whole thing was over murphys lips compressed and she nodded yeah and if youd have tried to tell me about it it would have been throwing gasoline on the fire i rubbed at my forehead and it would have gotten me looked at harder too by whoever was investigating murphy she had been protecting me i hadnt even considered what those rumors marcone had spread might do to anyone besides myself way to go harry one thing youre not is stupid dresden she confirmed a little naive sometimes but never stupid ia couldnt turn anything up but there are enough people who are certain im dirty that along with the people who already dont like me they can screw me over pretty hard given the chance thats why you didnt make an issue out of what agent benn did i guessed youre trying to keep everything quiet right murphy said id get ripped open from ass to ears if ia got word of me so much as bending the rules much less tussling with one of the bureaus agents believe me denton might look like a jerk but at least he isnt convinced that im dirty hell play fair and this is where the killings come in right instead of answering she cut into the slow lane and slowed to a leisurely pace i half turned toward her in my seat to watch her it was while i did this that i noticed the headlights of another car drift across a couple lanes of traffic to drop into the slow lane behind us i didnt say anything about it to murphy but kept a corner of my eye on the car right murphy said the lobo killings they started last month one night before the full moon we had a couple of gangbangers torn to pieces down at rainbow beach at first everyone figured it for an animal attack bizarre but who knew right anyway it was weird so they handed the investigation to me all right i said what happened then the next night it was a little old lady walking past washington park killed the same way and it just wasnt right you know our forensics guys hadnt turned up anything useful so i asked in the fbi theyve got access to resources i cant always get to hightech forensics labs that kind of thing and you let the djinni out of the bottle i guessed something like that fbi forensics that redheaded kid with them turned up some irregularities in the apparent dentition of the attackers said that the tooth marks didnt match genuine wolves or dogs said that the paw prints we found were off too didnt match real wolves she gave a little shudder and said thats when i started thinking it might be something else you know they figured that someone was trying to make it look like a wolf attack with this whole wolf motif someone started calling the perpetrator the lobo killer i nodded frowning the headlights were still behind us just a crazy thought have you considered telling them the truth that we might be dealing with a werewolf here murphy sneered not a chance they hire conservatives for jobs at the bureau people who dont believe in ghosts and goblins and all that crap out there that i come to you about they said that the murders must have been done by some sort of cult or pack of psychos that they must have furnished themselves with weapons made out of wolf teeth and nails left symbolic paw prints around thats why all the marks and tracks were off i got carmichael to check up on you but your answering service said you were in minnesota on a call yeah someone saw something in a lake i confirmed what happened after that all hell broke loose three bums in burnham park the next night and they werent just dead they were shredded worse than that guy tonight and on the last night of the full moon an old man outside a liquor store then the night after that we had a businessman and his driver torn up in a parking garage ia was right there breathing down my neck the whole time too observing everything she shook her head with a grimace that last victim all the others were outside and in a bad part of town businessman in a parking garage doesnt fit that pattern yeah murphy said james harding iii one of the last of the redhot industrialists he and john marcone are business partners in some development projects up in the northwest and tonight we have another victim linked to marcone yeah murphy nodded im not sure whats scarier thinking that these are just regular animal attacks that theyre being done by a bunch of psychos with knives edged with wolf teeth or that theyre organized werewolves she let out a strained little laugh that still sounds crazy even to me yes your honor the victim was killed by a werewolf let me guess after the full moon it got quiet murphy nodded ia wrapped up with inconclusive findings and nothing much else happened no one else died until tonight and weve got four more nights of bright moonlight left if whoever they are sticks to their pattern you sure theres more than one i asked yeah murphy said theres bite marks or bitelike marks according to agent denton from at least three different weapons as far as all the lab guys are concerned it could be multiple perpetrators but theres no way for forensics to be sure unless its real werewolves were dealing with in which case each set of marks goes with a different set of teeth and were looking at a pack murphy nodded but theres no way im going to just come out and tell them that that would put the nails in my careers coffin uhhuh i said this is the part where you tell me about your job being in danger she grimaced they only need a good reason to get rid of me now if i dont catch these guys whoever they are politics will hang me out to dry after that itll be simple for them to get some charges going on me for complicity or obstruction and theyll probably try to get to you too harry weve got to catch the killer or killers or im history you ever get any blood or hair from the scenes i asked yeah some murphy said what about saliva murph frowned at me saliva it would be in the bite wounds she shook her head if theyve found it no one has said anything besides all the samples wont do us a lot of good without a suspect to match them against it wont do you a lot of good i corrected her something left blood on the window when it came through maybe thatll turn something up murphy nodded that would be great okay harry so you know whats going on now what can you tell me about werewolves i pursed my lips for a minute not much they werent ever anything i studied too hard i can tell you what theyre not mostly give me until morning though and ill put together a full report on them i glanced out the back window as murphy pulled off the jfk expressway the car that i thought had been following us exited as we did murphy frowned morning can you do it any sooner i can have it on your desk by eight earlier if you tell the night sergeant to let me in murphy sighed and rubbed at her eyes okay fine we got back to mcanallys and she pulled in next to the blue beetle behind us the car that had been following us also came into the parking lot jesus harry i cant believe im sitting here talking to you about werewolves killing people in downtown chicago she turned her face to me her eyes anxious tell me im not going nuts i got out of the car but leaned down to the window i dont think youre going nuts murph i dont know maybe the fbi is right maybe its not werewolves crazy things happen sometimes i gave her half of a smile which she answered with a faint snort ill probably be in my office dresden she said have that report on my desk by morning and then she pulled out of the parking lot turning quickly out onto the street i didnt get into the beetle instead i watched the car that had followed us into the parking lot it cruised around the far side of the lot then started down the row toward me and kept on going the driver a striking woman with shaggy dark brown hair peppered with grey did not turn to look at me as she went past i watched the car go frowning it left the lot turning the opposite way murphy had and vanished from sight had that been the same vehicle that had followed us down the jfk or had it only been my imagination my gut told me that the woman in the car had been following me but then again my instincts had cried wolf before i got into the blue beetle and thought for a minute i was feeling guilty and a little queasy still it was my fault murphy had gotten in trouble i had put her in the middle of extremely questionable circumstances by not telling her what was going on last spring the pressure she was under now was my responsibility i have what might be considered a very outofdate and chauvinist attitude about women i like to treat women like ladies i like to open doors for them pay for the meal when im on a date bring flowers draw out their seat for themall that sort of thing i guess i could call it an attitude of chivalry if i thought more of myself whatever you called it murphy was a lady in distress and since i had put her there it only seemed right that i should get her out of trouble too that wasnt the only reason i wanted to stop the killings seeing spike torn up like that had scared the hell out of me i was still shaking a little a pure and primitive reaction to a very primal fear i did not want to get eaten by an animal chewed up by something with a lot of sharp teeth the very thought of that made me curl up on my cars seat and hug my knees to my chest an awkward position considering my height and the comparatively cramped confines of the beetle what had happened to spike was as brutal and violent a death as anyone could possibly have maybe the thug had deserved it maybe not either way he was only one victim of many that had been torn apart by something that regular people shouldnt have to face i couldnt just stand aside and do nothing im a wizard that means i have power and power and responsibility go hand in hand i have a responsibility to use the power ive been given when there is a need for it the fbi was not in any sense prepared to deal with a pack of ravening werewolves stalking down victims in the midst of a chicago autumn that was more my department i let out a long breath and sat up again i reached into my dusters pocket for car keys and found the shard of glass wrapped up in my white handkerchief i unwrapped it slowly and found the bloodsmeared glass still there blood has a kind of power i could use the blood cast a spell that would let me follow the blood back to the person who had spilled it i could find the killer tonight simply let my magic lead me to him or them but it would have to be now the blood was almost dry and once it was i would have a hell of a lot more trouble using it murphy would be royally pissed if i took off without her she would probably assume that i had intended to follow the trail tonight purposely leaving her out of the loop but if i didnt follow the trail id lose the chance to stop the killer before another night fell it didnt take me long to make up my mind in the end saving lives was more important than keeping murphy from being pissed off at me so i got out of the beetle and opened the storage trunk at the front of the vw i took out a few wizardly implements my blasting rod the replacement for my shield bracelet and one other thing that no wizard should be without a smith and wesson chiefs special i carried all of these back to the front of the car with me and got out the shard of glass with smeared blood then i made with the magic chapter i got out the lump of chalk i always keep in my duster pocket and the circular plastic dome compass that rides a strip of velcro on my dashboard then squatted down my voluminous coat spreading out over my legs and ankles i drew a rough circle upon the asphalt around me with the chalk the markings were bright against the dark surface and almost glowed beneath the light of the nearly full moon i added an effort of will a tiny investment of energy to close the circle and immediately felt the ambient magic in the air around me crowd inward trapped within the confines of the design the hairs at the nape of my neck prickled and stood on end i shivered and took the shard of glass with its swiftly drying bloodstain and laid it down in the circle between the toes of my boots i began a low little chant of nonsense syllables relaxing focusing my mind on the effect i wanted interessari interressarium i murmured and touched the plastic dome of the compass to the damp blood energy rushed out of me swirled within the focusing confines of the circle i had drawn and then rushed downward into the compass with a visible shimmer of silver dustlike motes the compass needle shuddered spun wildly and then swung to the bloodstain on the dome like a hound picking up a scent then it whirled about and pointed to the southeast whipping around the circle to hover steadily in that direction i grinned in anticipation and smudged the chalk with my boot releasing the remaining stray energy back into the air then took up the compass and returned to the blue beetle the problem with this particular spell was that the compass needle would point unerringly at whomever the blood had come from until the sun rose the next morning and disrupted the simple magical energies i had used to make the spell but it didnt point out the swiftest way to get to the target only the direct direction in which he she or it lay traffic in chicago isnt ever what any sane person would call friendly or simple but i had lived there for a while and had learned to survive i drove past cook county hospital a virtual city of its own inside chicago and down past douglas park then turned south on kedzie the compass needle slowly aligned to point hard to the east as i traveled south and i wound up turning east on fiftyfifth toward the university of chicago and lake michigan it wasnt exactly a good part of town in fact as far as neighborhoods go in chicago it was pretty bad there was a high crime rate and a lot of the buildings were rundown abandoned or only infrequently used streetlights were out in a lot of places so when night closed in it was darker than most areas its always been a favorite haunt for some of the darker things that come crawling out of the nevernever for a night on the town trolls lurked about like muggers some nights and any new vampire that came through the city always ended up in this neighborhood or one like it searching for prey until he could make contact with bianca or one of the lesser vampire figures of the city i pulled over as the compass swung to point at what looked like an abandoned department store and i killed the engine the faithful beetle rattled to a grateful halt i got the map of the city out of the glove box and squinted at it for a moment washington park and burnham park where four of last months deaths had taken place were less than a mile away on either side of me i felt a little shiver run through me this sure as hell looked like the place to find murphys lobo killer i got out of the car i kept the blasting rod in my right hand the dashboard compass in my left my shield bracelet dangled on my left wrist my gun was in the left pocket of my duster within easy reach i took a moment to take a deep breath to clear my mind and to clarify what i wanted to do i wasnt here to bring the killer down whoever he was i was just locating him for murphy murphy could put the guy under surveillance and nail him the next time he tried to move even if i did capture him murphy couldnt exactly bring him up on charges based on the word of a professional wizard municipal judges would love having a cop appear before them and start spouting such crazy talk i spun my blasting rod around in my fingers grinned and started forward that was all right i didnt need the justice system to recognize my power to be able to use it there were boards over the front windows of the once department store i tested each one as i went past and found one that swung in easily i stopped and examined it carefully wary of any alarms that might be attached to it such as the string tied across the bottom lined with little jingle bells if i had pushed the wooden sheet any further inward i would have set it to jangling instead i slipped the string off the head of one of the nails it hung by lowered the bells carefully and slipped inside the dim confines of the abandoned store it was a skeletal place there were still the bones of shelves forming long aisles but now barren of merchandise empty fluorescent light fixtures dangled in forlorn rows from the ceiling and the powdered glass of shattered tubular bulbs dusted the floor beneath them light seeped in from the street mostly moonlight but more light came from the back of the store i checked my bloodstained compass the needle was pointing firmly toward the light i closed my eyes and listened a skill that isnt hard to pick up but that most people dont know how to do anymore i heard voices at least a pair of them talking in hushed urgent tones i crept toward the back of the store using the barren shelves to keep myself from being seen then i held my breath and peeked up over the top of the last row of shelves gathered around an old coleman lantern were several people all young of various shapes and sizes and both genders they were dressed in all shades of black and most wore jackets and bracelets and collars of dark leather some had earrings and nose rings one had a tattoo showing on his throat if they had been tall muscular folk they would have looked intimidating but they werent they looked like college students or younger some still with acne or toooily hair beards that wouldnt quite grow all the way in and the thinness of youth they looked awkward and out of place four or five of them were gathered behind and around a stout young man less than five and a half feet tall he had thick glasses and pudgy fingers and would have looked more at home with a pocket protector than with the spiked leather gloves on his fingers he stood with his hands on his hips glaring up at a railthin blonde girl at least a head taller than he the lines of her willowy body all awkward her long sad face set in an expression of anger her hair fell about her face and head in a ragged mane but her eyes sparkled with contained wrath another five or six of the young people were gathered behind her and everyone seemed tense and im telling you the young man snarled in a muted voice that we should be out there right now we cant allow ourselves to rest until weve found them all and torn them apart there was a murmur of agreement from the people behind him i swear billy the blonde said youre such a testosteroneladen idiot if we were out there right now they might catch on to us use your head georgia billy snapped back you think they havent figured it out by now they could take all of us out right this minute if they hit us they havent georgia pointed out she told us not to move again tonight and im not moving and if you try it so help me im going to tie your ankles to your ears billy growled actually growled though it sounded posed and forced and stepped forward you think you can handle me bitch he said bring it on georgias eyes narrowed i didnt sign on to this wolf thing to fight hapless losers like you billy dont make me start now she glared at the young people standing behind billy you know what she told us are you going to start going up against her word listen alphas billy said turning to look at those behind him and then at those backing his opponent ive led you for all this time ive done what ive promised to do are you going to stop trusting me i peered at the discussion and then lowered my head again back into the shadows holy iwasateenagewerewolf batman i checked my compass and it pointed firmly at the lit room the group gathered around the lantern were these the killers they looked more like a group of computer nerds geared up for leather night this was a start at least i could clear out now and let murphy know what i had seen id need to check around the building outside first see if any of the group had any cars parked nearby to be able to give murphy the license plate numbers hell we werent far from the university maybe some of them would have parking passes what is the meaning of this came a clear strident womans voice i craned my neck up to the edge of the shelf again a darkcomplected woman as tall as the longfaced blonde but older solid with muscle and moving with an animal surety had come into the room from a back door her brown hair was peppered with grey and it took me only a second to recognize the woman from the car in the parking lot outside of mcanallys my heart started to pound a little more quickly with excitement she had been following murphy and me after all she glared at the two groups of young people her eyes an almost eerie shade of amber that could barely be construed as brown have i taught you no better the woman demanded billy and georgia were both looking down at the floor uncomfortably the other young people had assumed similar postures like a group of children caught planning to go out after curfew this isnt a game someone followed me here theyre on to us if you start making mistakes now youll pay for them with your life the woman said stalking back and forth around the group i checked my compass the needle swung back and forth as she walked pointing solidly at her my heart leapt into my throat i considered this woman with her almost animal vitality her commanding presence and force of will this woman i thought might be a killer and she knew she had been followed how how in the hell had she known i was after her i looked up at her again excited only to find her staring intently at the thick patch of shadows around the shelves i hid behind one of the young people started to say something and the woman raised her hand for silence i saw her nostrils flare as she breathed in through her nose and she took a step in my direction i held my breath not daring to duck back down behind the shelves lest the motion give me away join hands snapped the woman now and then she turned to the coleman lantern on the floor and snuffed it out plunging the room into blackness there was a moment of confused murmuring a commanding hiss from the woman and then there was nothing but silence and the sound of shoes and boots moving over the tiles toward the back of the store they were getting away i rose blind and headed around the shelves toward them as quickly as i could trying to follow in retrospect it wasnt the smartest decision but i knew that i couldnt afford to let them get away the spell id wrought on my compass wouldnt last long not long enough to find the woman again much less any of her pack of young people i wanted to follow them out to get the license plates on their cars anything that would let me help murphy locate them after theyd run i miscalculated the length of my stride and bounced into the wall at the end of the aisle i sucked in a hiss of pain and reoriented myself following them using the darkness to conceal me as much as they did i could have made some light for myselfbut as long as no one could see no one would start shooting either i reasoned i moved out carefully listening and following the sounds i had only a seconds warning the sound of claws sliding on the old tile and then something large and furry slammed into my legs below the knee taking them out from under me and sending me heavily to the floor i let out a shout and swung my blasting rod like a baseball bat feeling it crack down solidly on something hard and bony there was a snarl a deep animal sound and something tore the rod from my hand and sent it flying away it clattered hollowly on the tile floor i dropped my compass scrabbled for my gun and got my feet underneath me backpedaling yelling my fear out into a wordless challenge i stood still for a moment staring at nothing breathing hard my gun heavy in my hand fear made my heart pound and as always anger followed hard on the heels of fear i was furious that i had been attacked id half expected something to try to stop me but in the dark whatever had been snarling had scared me a lot more than id thought it would nothing happened after a minute and i couldnt hear anything i reached into my shirt and drew out the silver pentacle that had been my mothers the fivepointed star upright within a circle the symbol of order symmetry balance of power i focused my will on it concentrating and the pentacle began to glow with a faint gentle lighthardly the blinding luminescence that came as the result of focusing power against a being of the nevernever but adequate enough to navigate by at least i moved toward the back room bluewhite light like moonlight pooled around me it was definitely stupid to keep going forward but i was angry furious enough to bumble my way through the back room of the department store until i saw the dark blue outline of an open doorway i headed for it tripping over a few more things along the way that i couldnt quite make out in the werelight of my amulet angrily kicking a few things from the path of my feet until i emerged into an alley behind the old building breathing open air able to see again in dim shapes and colors something hit me heavily from behind driving me to the ground gravel digging into my ribs through my shirt my concentration vanished and with it the light of my amulet i felt something hard and metallic shoved against the back of my skull a knee pressed into the small of my back and a womans voice snarled drop the gun or i blow your head off chapter call me crazy but im not big on defiance when ive got a gun rammed against my skull i carefully set the in my left hand down and moved my fingers away from it hands behind your back do it snarled the woman i did it i felt the cold metal of the handcuffs around my wrists heard the ratcheting sound of the cuffs closing around them the knee lifted off of my back and my attacker shoved me over with one leg snapped on a flashlight and shone it in my eyes harry she said i blinked and squinted against the light i recognized the voice now hi murphy this is going to be one of those conversations isnt it you jerk murphy said her voice harsh she was still only a shadow behind the flashlight but i recognized the contours now you found a lead and followed it and you didnt contact me those who live in glass houses lieutenant i said and sat up my hands still held tightly behind my back there wasnt time it was hot and i couldnt afford to wait or i might have lost it murphy grunted how did you find this place im a wizard i told her and waggled my arms as best i could magic what else murphy growled but hunkered down behind me and unlocked the cuffs i rubbed at my wrists after they were freed how about you im a cop she said a car tailed us back to mcanallys from the murder scene i waited until it was gone and followed it back here she stood up again you were inside did anyone go out the front no i dont think so but i couldnt see dammit murphy said she put her gun away in her coat they didnt come out the back there must be some way up to the roof she stood up and peered around at the closely packed buildings shining her flashlight around the roofs edge theyre long gone by now win some lose some i got to my feet like hell she said and turned and started into the building i hurried to catch up with her where are you going inside to look for stairs a ladder whatever you cant follow them i said falling into step beside her as she went into the darkened building you cant take them on not with just you and me them murphy said i only saw one she stopped and looked at me and i explained to her in terse terms what had happened since we parted in the parking lot murphy listened the lines at the corners of her blue eyes serious what do you think happened she asked when i was finished we found werewolves i said the woman the dark one with the grey in her hair was their leader group killers murphy said pack i corrected her but im not so sure that they were the killers they didnt seem i dont know cold enough mean enough murphy shook her head and turned to walk outside can you give me a good description i kept up with her good enough i guess but what do you want it for im going to put out an apb for the woman we saw and i want you to describe the kids you heard talking what do you need that for dont you have the plates off the car she was driving i already called them in murphy said rental probably taken out under a false id i think youve got the wrong people murph i said dont put out that apb why shouldnt i murphy asked someone follows me back to town from the scene of a murder not only that but you can confirm to me that they were the killer from the scene not in a court of law i know but you can give it to me and thats enough standard investigation will turn up the rest if we know where to look i held up my hand hold on hold on my spell didnt tell me that the woman was the killer only that it was her blood at the scene murphy folded her arms and glared up at me whose side are you on anyway you still dont get it murphy i said my own temper rising a little you dont start something with the kind of people who live in boogetyland unless youre willing to take it all the way right there right then if you start harassing a pack of werewolves setting the police after them youve just declared war youd better be ready to fight it murphy thrust her jaw out dont worry about me i can handle it im not saying you cant i said but whatever it was that tore apart spike back at marcones club wasnt the same thing that was with me in the dark back there i jerked my head at the main room of the department store oh yeah murphy said why not because it could have killed me and it didnt you dont think you could have taken care of yourself against a wolf harry in the dark i said murphy its been nearly a hundred years since the wolf went extinct in most of the united states youve got no idea none at all of how dangerous they can be a wolf can run faster than you can drive a car through most of chicago his jaws can snap your thighbones with one jerk a wolf can see the heat of your body in the complete dark and can count the hairs on your head from a hundred yards off by starlight he can hear your heart beating thirty or forty yards away the wolf that was there in the dark with me could have killed me easy it didnt it disarmed me even after id hit it and then it left that doesnt mean anything murphy saidbut she folded her arms over her stomach and glanced at the shadows around us with a little shiver maybe the killer knows you maybe it didnt want to risk killing a wizard maybe just maybe the wolf did it to throw you off maybe it spared you just so you would react in this way just to avoid suspicion maybe i admitted but i dont think so the kids i saw i shook my head dont put out the apb yet hold off on it until i can get you some more information look you pay me to give you my advice to be your consultant on the supernatural im your expert right listen to me trust me she stared up at my face her expression intent looking away quickly when her eyes met mine murphy had known me for a while you dont go looking into a wizards eyes without a darned good reason wizards see too much all right she said finally ill hold off on itbut only until tomorrow morning when i have that report if you cant show me anything by then im going ahead after the people we saw tonight her mouth quirked in a fierce little grin id have a hell of a time explaining what i was doing out at the crime scene in rosemont anyway the grin vanished leaving only ferocity but you will have that information for me dresden bright and early make no mistake i will catch the killer before anyone else dies i nodded to murphy in the morning i said you got it murphys flashlight flickered and then went out as the filament burst with an audible pop murphy sighed in the darkness nothing ever works right when youre here sometimes harry she said i really hate hanging out with you chapter i entered my apartment tossed my blasting rod which i had recovered from the abandoned department store into the corner next to my wizards staff and my sword cane and locked the door behind me it was one of those steelframe doors the antiburglar kind i bought it after a demon had come stomping into my apartment six months ago and wrecked my place my apartment is in the basement of a huge old rooming house that somehow managed to survive all the chicago fires its made almost entirely of wood and it creaks and groans when the wind blows which is all the time in this city and makes gentle soothing music its a place with a history the neighbors are quiet and my rent is cheapthough less so than it was before the demon trashed my place the apartment itself is devoid of electrical devices for reasons that should be evident by now there is a fireplace and a kitchenette off the main room a little bedroom adjacent to that and a bathroom inside the bedroom sunken windows are high on each of the four walls and one is on the wall of the bathroom i decorate in textures more than i do in colors there were thick rugs all over the bare stone floors layered on top of one another in most places demon acid had burned away most of my furniture and i had been obliged to scavenge secondhand stores for replacements i like furniture with a lot of old wood and soft cloth and i had made my purchases accordingly tapestries hung from my walls the oldest tapestries that i could find covering the bare stone in the ruddy firelight the oranges and browns and reds that constituted the primary colors of the decor didnt look half bad i went over to the fireplace and built up the fire october in chicago is a cold breezy month and my dank little haven is usually chilly until i get a fire going i dropped a few logs on the fire and mister made an appearance rubbing up against my leg and purring fondly staggering my balance off to one side been getting into the steaks again eh mister i said and rubbed the big grey cats ears mister is larger than a lot of dogs maybe one of his parents was part wildcat i found him in a dumpster one day when he was a kitten and he promptly adopted me despite my struggles mister had been an understanding soul and i eventually came to realize that i was a part of his little family and by his gracious consent was allowed to remain in his apartment cats go figure i fired up the woodburning stove and prepared a quick meal of spaghettios grilled chicken and toast mister shared in my meal and split a can of coke with me as usual and i tossed the dishes in the sink to soak before i went to my bedroom and put on my robe let the wizardry commence i went to a spot in the far corner and moved the rug there then lifted up the door in the floor beneath it revealing the steep stepladder that led down to the subbasement where i kept my lab i teetered down the stairs holding a lit candle that cast a golden glow on the cheerful havoc that is my laboratory tables lined the walls and the longest table filled most of the center of the room leaving a cramped walk space around it except for an area at the far side of the lab that i kept completely clear for my summoning circle a ring of bright copper set into the floor books notebooks defunct ballpoint pens broken pencils boxes plastic containers old butter bowls empty jelly jars and plastic baggies lay next to other containers of every size and shape that held the spices rare stones bones fur blood oddments jewelry and other ingredients useful to wizardly pursuits and studies i reached the bottom of the ladder stepped over a precariously balanced stack of comic books dont ask and started lighting the other candles that lay on dishes around the chilly room finally bending to light up the kerosene heater that i keep down in the lab in an effort to at least blunt the cold bob i said then wake up sleepyhead up on one of the shelves huddled in the midst of a thick stack of hardbacks was the bleached smooth form of a human skull its empty eye sockets gaping deep in those eye sockets there was a flickering of orange light which grew and solidified into twin points of lambent illumination sleepyhead oh thats rich harry with a sense of humor like that you could make a living as a garbage man anywhere in the country the skulls mouth gaped open in the parody of a yawn though i knew the spirit within bob didnt feel fatigue in the same way that living beings did i put up with his lip so to speakbob had worked for several wizards over the course of a dozen mortal lifetimes and he knew more about the nuts and bolts of magic than i ever would what are we doing now bob sniggered more weightloss potions look bob i said that was only to get me through a rough month someones got to pay the rent around here all right bob said smugly you going to get into breast enhancement then im telling you thats where the money is that isnt what magic is for bob how petty can you get ah bob said his eye lights flickering the question is how pretty can you get them you arent a halfbad wizard dresden you should think about how grateful all those beautiful women will be i snorted and started cleaning off a space on the center table stacking things up to one side you know bob some of us arent obsessed with sex bob snorted no easy feat for a guy with no nose or lips some of us dont take a real working body and all five senses for granted either harry whens the last time you saw susan i dont know i responded couple weeks ago were both pretty busy with work bob heaved a sigh a gorgeous woman like that and here you are down in your musty old lab getting ready to do more ridiculous nonsense precisely i said now shut up and lets get to work bob grumbled something in latin but rattled a few times to shake the dust off of the skull sure what do i know im just a pathetic little spirit right with a photographic memory three or four hundred years worth of research experience and more deduction capacity than a computer bob yeah bob almost seemed to smile just for that you get my best effort tonight harry maybe youre not such an idiot after all great i said i want to work up a couple of potions and i want to know everything you know about werewolves what kind of potions and what kind of werewolves bob said promptly i blinked theres more than one hell harry weve made at least three dozen different kinds of potions down here ourselves and i dont see why you wouldnt no no no i growled at bob werewolves theres more than one kind of werewolf eh more than one kind of what bob tilted his skull over to one side as though cocking an invisible hand to his ear bones werewolf werewolf there wolf bob replied solemnly his voice seething with a hokey accent there castle i blinked at him uh what the heck are you talking about its a joke harry stars almighty you never get out do you i eyed the grinning skull and growled in frustration dont make me come up there okay okay sheesh arent we grumpy tonight bobs jaws stretched in a yawn again im working another murder case bob and i dont have time to goof around murder mortal business is so complicated you never hear about murder charges in the nevernever thats because everything there is immortal bob just shut up and tell me what you know about werewolves if theres a bunch of different flavors tell me what they are i got out a notebook and a fresh pencil then a couple of clean beakers with alcoholflame burners to heat whatever liquid i put in them all right bob said how much do you know exactly nothing about werewolves my teacher never covered that with me bob barked out a harsh little laugh old justin had a lousy sense of just about everything he got what was coming to him harry and dont let anyone on the white council tell you any different i stopped for a moment a sudden rush of mixed feelings anger and fear and mostly regret washed through me i closed my eyes i could still see him my teacher dying in flames born of my will and anger i dont want to talk about it hell the council even suspended the sentence on you you were vindicated say i wonder what ever happened to elaine now there was a sweet piece of werewolves bob i said in a very quiet very angry voice one hand started to hurt and i saw that my fingers had clenched into a fist the knuckles turning white i turned my eyes to him glaring i heard the skull make a gulping sound and then he said right okay werewolves and uh which potions did you want i want a pickmeup potion a nights rest in a bottle and i want something that will make me imperceptible to a werewolf i reached for the notebook and my pencil first ones tough to do theres nothing quite like a decent nights sleep but we can make some supercoffee no problem he spouted out the formula to me and i noted it down as he went my handwriting too dark and angular i was still angry from the mere mention of my old masters name and the welter of emotions that rushed up with my memories of elaine wouldnt subside for an hour we all have our demons what about the second one i asked the skull cant really be done bob said wolves have just got way too much on the ball to hide from every one of their senses without doing some major work im talking like a greater ring of invisibility not just a shadowcape or something do i look like im made of money i cant afford that what about a partialhiding potion then oh like a blending brew look like an unobtrusive part of the background something like that i would think that would be the most useful really keep you from being noticed to begin with sure i said ill take what i can get no problem bob assured me and rattled off another formula which i jotted down i checked the ingredients list and thought that i had them all in stock among the countless containers on my shelves fine i can get started on these how much do you know about werewolves bob plenty i was in france during the inquisition bobs voice was dry but that is to be expected considering i started on the first potion the stimulant every potion has eight parts one part is a base liquid to hold the others and provide a medium for mixing five parts are symbolically linked to each of the five senses one is similarly linked to the mind and another to the spirit the basic ingredient to the stimulant potion was coffee while the base for the scentmasking potion was water i got them both to boiling lot of werewolfery going on then are you kidding bob said it was werewolf central we had every kind of werewolf you could think of hexenwolves werewolves lycanthropes and loupgarou to boot every kind of lupine theriomorph you could think of therrowhat i said theriomorph bob said anything that shapeshifts from a human being into an animal form werewolves are theriomorphs so are werebears weretigers werebuffaloes buffaloes i asked sure some native american shamans could do a buffalo but almost everyone does predators and until pretty recently wolves were the scariest predator anyone around europe could think of uh okay i said and theres a difference between types of werewolves right bob confirmed mostly it depends on how you go from human form to wolf form and how much of your humanity you retain dont burn the coffee i turned down the flame beneath the beaker of coffee annoyed i know i know okay then how do you get to be a wolf the classic werewolf bob said is simply a human being who uses magic to shift himself into a wolf magic like a wizard no bob said well sort of hes like a wizard who only knows how to cast the one spell the one to turn him into a wolf and knows how to get back out of it again most people who learn to be werewolves arent very good at it for a while because they keep all of their own humanity what do you mean well bob said they can reshape themselves into the form of a wolf but its pretty much just topology they rearrange their physical body but their mind remains the same they can think and reason and their personality doesnt changebut they dont have a wolfs instincts or reflexes theyre used to being sightoriented bipeds not smelloriented quadrupeds they would have to learn everything from scratch why would someone do something like that i said just learn to turn into a wolf i mean youve never been a peasant in medieval france harry bob said life was hard for those people never enough food shelter medicine if you could give yourself a fur coat and the ability to go out and hunt your own meat you would have jumped at the chance too okay i think ive got it i said do you need silver bullets or anything do you turn into a werewolf if you get bitten bah bob said no hollywood stole that from vampires and the silverbullet thing is only in special cases werewolves are just like regular wolves you can hurt them with weapons just like you can a real wolf thats good news i said stirring the potion what other kinds are there theres another version of a werewolfwhen someone else uses magic to change you into a wolf i glanced up at him transmogrification thats illegal bob its one of the laws of magic if you transform someone into an animal it destroys their personality you cant transform someone else without wiping out their mind its practically murder yeah neat huh but actually most personalities can survive the transformation for a little while at least really strong wills might manage to keep their human memories and personality locked away for several years but sooner or later theyre irretrievably gone and youre left with nothing but a wolf i turned from the potions to scribble in my notebook okay what else makes a werewolf the most common way back in france was to make a deal with a demon or a devil or a powerful sorcerer you get a wolfhide belt put it on say the magic words and whammy youre a wolf a hexenwolf isnt that just like the first kind no not at all you dont use your own magic to become a wolf you use someone elses i frowned isnt that the second kind then stop being obtuse bob chided me its different because youre employing a talisman sometimes its a ring or amulet but usually its a belt the talisman provides an anchor for a spirit of bestial rage nasty thing from the bad side of the nevernever that spirit wraps around a human personality to keep it from being destroyed a kind of insulation i said exactly it leaves you with your own intellect and reason but the spirit handles everything else i frowned sounds a little easy oh sure bob said its really easy and when you use a talisman to turn into a wolf you lose all of your human inhibitions and so on and just run on your unconscious desires with the talismanspirit in charge of the way the body moves its really efficient a huge wolf with humanlevel intelligence and animallevel ferocity i eyed bob and gathered up the other ingredients for the stimulant potion a morning donut for taste a cocks crow for hearing fresh soap for smell bits of a washcloth for touch and a beam of dawn sunshine for sight a todo list for the mind and a bit of bright cheerful music for the spirit and the potion was simmering along nicely bob said nothing while i added the ingredients and when i was finished i said most people dont have the strength to control a spirit like that id think it would influence their actions maybe even control them suppress their conscience yeah so so it sounds more like youd be creating a monster its effective bob said i dont know about the good or the evil of the thing thats something that only you mortals worry about what did you call this flavor again hexenwolf bob said with a strong germanic accent spell wolf the church declared war on anyone who chose to become a hexenwolf and burned a huge number of people at the stake silver bullets i asked bitten and turn into a werewolf would you get off this bitten and turn into a werewolf kick harry bob said it doesnt work that way not ever or youd have werewolves overrunning the entire planet in a couple of years fine fine i sighed what about the silver bullets dont need them all right i said and continued jotting down information to put together for murphy in a report hexenwolf got it what else lycanthropes bob said isnt that a psychological condition it might also be a psychological condition bob said but it was a reality first a lycanthrope is a natural channel for a spirit of rage a lycanthrope turns into a beast but only inside his head the spirit takes over it affects the way he acts and thinks makes him more aggressive stronger they also tend to be very resistant to pain or injury sickness they heal rapidlyall sorts of things but they dont actually shapeshift into a wolf give that boy a kewpie bob said theyre just people too but theyre awfully fierce ever heard of the norse berserkers those guys were lycanthropes i think and theyre born not made i stirred the stimulant potion and made sure it was at an even simmer and what was the last one loop what loupgarou bob said or that was the name etienne the enchanter used for them before he got burned at the stake the loupgarou are the major monsters harry someone has cursed them to become a wolflike demon and usually at the full moon that someones got to be really powerful too like a major heavyweight sorcerer or a demon lord or one of the faerie queens when the full moon comes they transform into a monster go on a killing spree and slaughter everything they come across until the moon sets or the sun rises a sudden little chill went over me and i shivered what else supernatural speed and power supernatural ferocity they recover from injuries almost instantly if they become hurt at all theyre immune to poison and to any kind of sorcery that goes for their brain killing machines sounds great i guess this hasnt happened all that often id have heard something by now right bob said not often usually the poor cursed bastard knows enough to shut himself away somewhere or to head out into the wilderness the last major loupgarou rampage happened around gevaudan france back in the sixteenth century more than two hundred people were killed in a little more than a year holy shit i said how did they stop it they killed it bob said heres where the silver bullets finally come in harry only a silver weapon can hurt a loupgarou and not only that the silver has to be inherited from a family member inherited silver bullets really why would that work and not regular silver i dont make the laws of magic harry i just know what they are and have an idea of when theyre changing that one hasnt changed i think maybe it has something to do with the element of sacrifice inherited silver i mumbled well well just have to hope that this wasnt a loupgarou i guess if it was a louper youd know bob said wisely in the middle of this town youd have a dozen people dead every time the full moon came around whats going on a dozen people are dying every time the full moon comes around i filled bob in on the lobo killings giving him all the information murphy had given to me and started on the next potion into the water went the ingredients plastic wrap for sight a bit of plain white cotton for touch a little deodorant for smell a rustle of wind for hearing a leaf of plain old lettuce for taste and finally i threw in a blank piece of paper for the mind and some elevator music for the spirit the ingredients were boring the potion looked and smelled boring perfect lot of dead people bob commented ill let you know if i think of anything good i wish i knew something else i want you to learn more i told him go out and see what else you can round up on werewolves bob snorted fat chance harry im a spirit of intellect not an errand boy but when i said the word out bobs eyes glittered ill pick you up some new romance novels bob i offered bobs teeth clicked a couple of times give me a twentyfourhour pass he said i shook my head forget it the last time i let you out you invaded a party over at loyola and set off an orgy bob sniffed i didnt do anything to anyone that a keg wouldnt have done but those people didnt ask for you to get into their systems bob no way you had your fun and im not letting you out again for a while oh come on harry no i said flatly it would only be one little night o no i said again bob glowered at me and demanded new romances none of those tatty used ones i want something off the bestseller list i want you back by sunrise i countered fine bob snapped i cant believe how ungrateful you are after everything ive done for you ill see if i can get someones name there might be a spirit or two who could get you some juicy information the orange lights that were his eyes glittered and then flowed out of the skull in a misty cloud of lambent illumination the cloud flowed up the ladder and out of my laboratory i sighed and set the second potion to simmering it would take another hour or two to cook the potions and then to shove the magic into them so i sat down with my notebook and started writing up my report i tried to ignore the headache that was creeping up the back of my neck toward the crown of my head but it did little good i had to help murphy nail the killer whoever it was while avoiding any trouble with the fbi otherwise she was out of a job and even if i didnt end up in jail i would be out of a living myself johnny marcones man had been killed and i would be a fool to think he would stand idly by and do nothing in response i was sure the gangster would rear his head sooner or later aside from all of that there was a monster of one kind or another lurking in the dark and the police and the fbi had been helpless to stop it that left only me harry dresden your friendly neighborhood wizard to step in and do something about it and if the killer figured out that i was getting involved he would doubtless start gunning for me next my troubles were multiplying hexenwolves werewolves lycanthropes loupgarou what will they think of next chapter the police headquarters downtown consists of a sprawling collection of buildings that have sprung up over the years as the need for law enforcement has increased they dont match and they come from a wildly varying selection of styles and designs but they have somehow adapted themselves into a cohesive wholemuch like the force itself special investigations operates out of a big rundown old building a huge cube that has managed to hold up solidly in spite of the years the grime the smog and the graffiti sprayed on its walls it has bars over the windows and the doors and sits hunkered amidst buildings much taller than it like a faithful old bulldog amidst a crowd of unruly children struggling to maintain peace and order the inside of the building is plain even dingy but they keep it clean the old warhorse of a desk sergeant eyed me as i entered the station his grey mustache bristling over an impressive jaw hiya bill i told him and held up the manila envelope i had under one arm bringing something up to murphy in si dresden he said warily and jerked a thumb toward the stairs behind him giving me permission to go i hadnt gotten much sleep the night before but i had showered and dressed nicely before i left the house in neat business clothes for once instead of my usual western shirt and blue jeans i kept the battered old duster though with my blasting rod dangling from a thong inside of it i took the stairs two at a time and passed a few cops along the way several recognized me and one or two even nodded but i thought i could detect a sense of uneasiness from each of them apparently i was carrying a distinct odor with the law at the moment i wrinkled up my nose the police had always known me as something of a nut the crazy guy who claimed to be a wizard but a useful nut who could provide good information and whose apparent psychic abilities had helped them on a number of occasions i was used to being seen as one of the good guys but now the cops were giving me the neutral professional glances that they would give to a potential criminal rather than the casual greetings one would give to a comrade in arms it was to be expected maybe since rumor had associated my name with johnny marcones but it was still disturbing i was muttering to myself and deep in my own sleepdeprived thoughts when i bumped into a tall lovely woman dark of hair and eye full of mouth long of leg she was wearing a tan skirt and jacket with a crisp white blouse her raven brows furrowed in consternation until she looked up at me and then her eyes glowed with a sort of friendly avarice harry she said her lips curving into a smile she stood up on her tiptoes and kissed my cheek fancy seeing you here i cleared my throat hi susan i said did that syndication deal go through she shook her head not yet but im hoping after those stories you gave me last spring people started taking me a little more seriously she paused drawing in a little breath it made her chest rise and fall most attractively you know harry if youre working with the police again and if you should happen to be able to let me in on whatever is going on i shook my head and tried to scowl at her i thought we agreed i wont poke into your business deals and you wont poke into mine she smiled up at me and touched a finger to my chest that was whenever we were out on a date harry she let her eyes wander down the length of my body and then back up or staying in on one susan rodriguez i never knew you were a lawyer as well as a journalist now youre getting nasty she said grinning seriously harry another exposé like last spring could make my career yeah well after last spring the city made me sign about two tons of nondisclosure agreements i cant tell you anything about the case so dont tell me about the case harrybut if you could mention say a nice spot in the street where i might stand and get some good pictures i would be very she leaned up and kissed my neck very the kiss traveled to my earlobegrateful i swallowed and cleared my throat then took a step back down the stairs away from her i closed my eyes for a second and listened to the thunder of my suddenly pounding heart im sorry i cant do that oh harry youre no fun she reached out and ran a hand over my hair then smiled to let me know that there were no hard feelings but lets get together soon all right dinner sure i said hey what are you doing down here this early she tilted her head considering me trade me ill show you mine if youll show me yours off the record even i snorted susan give me a break she let out a little sigh and shook her head ill call you about dinner all right she started down the stairs past me all right i said all right im bringing a report on werewolves to murphy werewolves she said her eyes lighting is that whos behind the lobo murders i frowned no comment i thought the fbi was keeping that under wraps you cant kill a dozen people and expect no one to notice susan said her voice sly i keep track of the city morgues god youre so romantic all right your turn give i was trying to talk to the investigator from the departments internal affairs word is that theyre putting pressure on murphy trying to clear her out of special investigations i grimaced yeah i heard that too why does it concern you and the arcane the most successful preternatural investigator the police department has gets hung out to dry even if people dont believe it murphy does a lot of good if murphy gets fired and i can show how the numbers of mysterious crimes and unexplained deaths go up after she leaves maybe i can get people to listen to papers like the arcane and to people like you i shook my head people dont want to believe in magic anymore or things that go bump in the dark for the most part theyre happier not knowing and when not knowing gets someone killed i shrugged thats where people like me and murphy come in susan eyed me doubtfully all i need is something solid harry an eyewitness account a photograph something you cant photograph anything really supernatural i pointed out the energies around things like that will mess up cameras besides the stuff im dealing with right now is too dangerous you could get hurt what if i shot from a long way off she pressed used a telephoto lens i shook my head no susan im not going to tell you anything its for your own good as much as for mine she pressed her lips together fine she said her tone crisp and went on down the stairs i watched her go dismayed it seemed i was making a habit of excluding people from certain brands of information not only were my job and my freedom on the line and murphys job toonow it seemed that my love life or what passed for it was in danger as well i took a moment to try to sort through my thoughts and feelings on susan and gave it up as hopeless susan was a reporter for the midwestern arcane a tabloid circulated widely from chicago it usually ran headlines about elvis and jfk singing duets in atlantic city or on similar topics but once in a while susan managed to slip in something about the real world of the supernatural the one that people had forgotten about in favor of science she was damned good at her job absolutely relentless she was also charming gorgeous funny and sexy as hell our dates often ended in long passionate evenings at my place or hers it was an odd relationship and neither one of us had tried to define it i think maybe we were worried that if we did we would change our minds and write it off as a bad idea i continued up the stairs my mind a tired muddle of bloodspattered corpses savage beasts angry exapprentices and sultry dark eyes there are times when my work is hard on my love life but one thing im not is a boring date the doors to the si office swung open just before i reached for them and i drew up short agent denton of the fbi was there tall and immaculate in his grey suit he stopped too and looked at me holding open the door with one arm there were bags under his grey eyes but they were still calculating assessing and the veins in his forehead bulged with hypertension mr dresden he said and nodded to me agent denton i replied keeping my tone polite even friendly excuse me i need to get something to lieutenant murphy denton frowned a little and then glanced at the room behind him before coming all the way out into the hall and letting the door swing shut maybe now isnt the best time for you to see her mr dresden i glanced up at the clock on the wall it was five minutes before eight she wanted it early i stepped to one side to go around him denton put a hand on my chestjust that but he was strong he might have been shorter than me but he was carrying a lot more muscle he didnt look at my eyes and when he spoke his voice was very quiet look dresden i know what happened last night didnt look good but believe me when i say that ive got nothing against lieutenant murphy shes a good cop and she does her job but shes got to follow the rules just like everyone else ill keep that in mind i told him and started to move again he kept up the pressure against my chest theres an agent from internal affairs in there with her right now hes already in a bad mood from being hassled by some reporter do you really want to go in there and make him start asking all sorts of questions i glanced at him frowning he lowered his hand from my chest i didnt go around him yet you know about the investigation shes under denton shrugged a shoulder its to be expected all things considered too much of what has happened in the past looks suspicious you really dont believe do you i asked him you dont believe that im a real wizard you dont believe in the supernatural denton straightened his tie what i believe doesnt matter mr dresden what is important is that a lot of the scum out there believe in it it affects the way they think and operate if i could make use of your advice to solve this case i would the same as any other law officer he glanced at me and added personally i think you are either slightly unstable or a very intelligent charlatan no offense none taken i said my voice wry i nodded to the door how long will murphy be busy denton shrugged if you like ill take the report in to her drop it on her desk you can go down the hall and call her it doesnt matter to me but i dont mind helping out a straight cop i thought it over for a second and then passed the folder to him i appreciate it agent denton phil he said for a second he almost smiled but then his face resumed its usual tense expression do you mind if i take a look at it i shook my head but i hope you like fiction phil he flicked the folder open and studied the first page for a moment expressionless he looked up at me you cant possibly be serious it was my turn to shrug dont knock it ive helped murphy out before he glanced over the rest of the report the look of skepticism on his face growing more secure ill give this to murphy for you mr dresden he said then nodded to me and turned to walk toward the si office oh hey i said casually phil he turned to me and lifted his eyebrows were both on the same team here right both of us looking for the killer he nodded i nodded back what is it that youre not telling me he stared for a long moment and then blinked slowly the lack of reaction gave him away i dont know what youre talking about mr dresden he said sure you do i told him you know something you cant or wont tell me right so why not just put it out on the table now denton glanced up and down the hall and repeated in precisely the same tone of voice i dont know what youre talking about mr dresden do you understand i didnt understand but i didnt want him to know that so i just nodded again denton nodded back turned and went into the si office i frowned puzzling over dentons behavior his expression and reaction had conveyed more than his words but i wasnt sure exactly what except for that one flash of insight the night before i was having trouble reading him some people were just like that very good at keeping secrets with their bodies and motions as well as with their mouths i shook my head went to the pay phone down the hall dropped in my quarter and dialed murphys number murphy she said dentons dropping off my report i didnt want to wander in on you with internal affairs hanging around there was a note of relief in murphys voice subtle but there thank you i understand the investigator is in your office now isnt he right murphy said her tone neutral polite professional and disinterested murphy keeps a great poker face when its necessary too if you have any questions i should be at my office i said hang in there murph well nail this guy there was the sound of a deeper voice dentons and then the slap of a folder hitting the surface of murphys desk murphy thanked denton and then spoke to me again thank you very much ill be right on it then she hung up on me i hung up the phone myself and realized that i was vaguely disappointed that i hadnt gotten to really speak to murphy that we hadnt had the chance to exchange our usual banter it bothered me that i couldnt just walk into her office anymore made me feel a little queasy and tense inside i hate politics but it was there and as long as i was being held in any amount of suspicion i could get murphy in trouble just by being around brooding all the while i stomped down the stairs and out the front door of the station toward the visitor parking where the blue beetle waited for me i had gotten in and was preparing to coax it to life when i heard footsteps i squinted up into the morning sunshine at the skinny form and big ears of the redheaded young fbi agent from the scene in rosemont last night i rolled down the window as he stepped up to my car he glanced around his face anxious and then knelt down beside the window so that he could not be easily observed hi there agent harris he said roger harris right i said can i help you agent harris i need to know mr dresden i mean i wanted to ask you last night but i couldnt but i need to ask you now he glanced around again restless as a rabbit when a fox goes by and said are you for real a lot of people ask me that agent harris i said ill tell you what i tell them try me and see he chewed on his lip and looked at me for a minute then nodded a jerky little nod his head bobbing all right he said all right can i hire you my eyebrows went up in surprise hire me what for i think i think i know something about the lobo killings i tried to get denton to let us check it out but he said that there wasnt enough evidence wed never be able to get a surveillance put on them on who i asked wary the last thing i needed was to be getting involved in any more shady goingson on the other hand as an independent operator i could sometimes go poking my nose where the police couldnt if there was a chance that i could turn up something for murphy or find the killer and stop him outside of legal channels entirely i couldnt afford to pass it up theres a gang in chicago harris began no kidding i asked affecting puzzlement it was lost on the kid yeah they call themselves the streetwolves theyve got a really rough reputation even for this town a spooky reputation even the criminals wont go near them they say that the gang has strange powers streetwolf territory is down by the fortyninth street beach he stared at me intently down by the university i filled in and by the parks where last months murders took place he nodded eager as a puppy yeah right down there you see what im getting at i see kid i see i told him and rubbed at my eye denton couldnt go there and look around so he sent you down here to get me to do it the kid flushed his skin turning bright red until his freckles vanished i uh dont worry about it i told him you didnt do a bad job with the act but youve got to get up pretty early in the morning et cetera harris chewed on his lip and nodded yeah well will you do it i sighed i guess you cant go on record as paying my fee can you it wasnt really a question well no officially you are a suspect source as a consultant i nodded i thought so can you do it mr dresden will you i was regretting it even before i spoke all right i said ill check it out but in exchange tell denton i want any of the information that the fbi or the chicago police has on me harris paled you want us to copy your files yeah i said i could get them through the freedom of information act anyway i just dont want to spend the time and postage do we have a deal or not oh god denton would kill me if he found out he doesnt like it when someone bends the rules he chewed his lip until i thought it would fall off you mean like hes doing by sending you here to me i shrugged suit yourself kid thats my price you can find my number if you change your mind i coaxed the beetle to life and it rattled and coughed and started running all right he said all right deal he offered me his hand i shook it sealing the bargain and got an uneasy feeling as i did harris walked away from the beetle as quickly as he could still looking around nervously that was stupid harry i told myself you shouldnt be getting yourself into anything more complicated than you already have i was right but the potential gains made the risk worth it i could possibly find the killers stop them and additionally find out why the cops had a bug up their collective ass about me it might help me to work things out with murphy it might even help me get her out of the trouble she was having cheer up harry i told myself youre just going to go poke around a biker gangs lair ask them if they happen to have killed some people lately what could possibly go wrong chapter a block from the fortyninth street beach there was a rundown garage the sort of place you only find in the worst sections of big cities the building consisted of corrugated metal on a steel frame oxidating in the rain and the mist rising off the lake so that gobbets of rust ran down the walls in streaks and pooled on the sidewalks in uneven puddles on one side of the garage was a vacant lot on the other what looked like the sort of pawn shop where crooks traded in their spare guns and knives for a few extra dollars when things were tight a faded sign hung askew over one of the garage doors reading full moon garage i pulled the beetle into the gravel parking lot and parked a few feet from the building thank god its not too obvious or anything i muttered and killed the engine it died with a new moaning note to its usual rattle i got out of the car squinted at the building and headed toward it i didnt have my gun with me but i did have my blasting rod my shield bracelet and a ring on my right hand in which i had stored up about as much energy as someone twice my size could put into a solid punch gravel crunched under my shoes as i walked and rare autumn sunshine glared in my eyes and cast a long shadow behind me i wasnt sure who to expect inside if anyone the people id seen with the darkhaired woman the night before the rather nerdy bunch of young people clad in imitation bikerleathers didnt seem to be the sort of folk to inspire fear in other criminal toughs as the streetwolves apparently had but maybe there was a connection maybe the darkhaired woman from last night was linked with the streetwolves somehow as well as with the young people i had seen what had the stout young man billy called them the alphas what then had the alphas been biker thugs in training that sounded ridiculous even to me but what if those young people had been lycanthropes like the ones bob had told me about what if they were being trained somehow as junior members of the streetwolves until they could be brought in as full werewolves presuming the streetwolves themselves were lycanthropes or werewolves that is sometimes a biker gang is just a biker gang there might be no connection to the alphas at all my head spun a little trying to sort out the possibilities all in all it was far better to hope that the building was empty and that i wouldnt have to deal with anyone werewolves or otherwise i would much rather just poke around and find something incriminating inside something that i could bring back to murphy and denton that would point them in the correct direction there was a regular door beside the pair of big rollup garage doors both of them were closed i tried the regular door and it opened easily enough so i went on inside there were no windows and the only light in the garage fell into it from the open door behind me hello i called into the darkness i tried to peer around but saw nothing other than dim shapes and outlines what might have been a car with the hood up a couple of those rolling toolcabinets there was a dull reflection of glass windows off to one side where there might have been an office i stepped to one side of the doorway squinting and waited for my eyes to adjust there was a quiet sound a dull rustle of clothing dammit i reached a hand into my duster wrapping my fingers around my blasting rod and listened i could hear the sound of breathing in the room from multiple sources in a variety of directions there was a scuffling sound shoes on the concrete floor im not a cop i said into the darkness i had the feeling that might be important for them to know my name is harry dresden i just want to speak to the streetwolves the room dropped into dead silence no moving no breathing nothing i waited tense and ready to run take your hand out of your jacket a male voice said and keep your hands where i can see them weve heard of your kind wizard weve heard of you youre with the cops youre late on the gossip i said wryly im playing doubles with johnny marcone now didnt you know there was a snort from the dark like hell thats just marcones story we know the real deal with you wizard christ i wished the police were as savvy as these neerdowells ive heard a few things about you all too i said not much of it is too friendly some of it might even be considered a little weird there was a rough laugh what do you think they say about you dresden get your hands where i can see them now there was the clickclack of a pump shotguns action i swallowed and took my hand slowly off my blasting rod then held both of my hands innocuously out in front of me palms up i willed strength through my shield bracelet as i did drawing its protective energies about me all right i said come up where i can see you you dont give the orders here the male voice snarled i do i pressed my lips together and drew in a breath through my nose i just want to talk to you about what said the voice i tried to come up with something something believablebut im not much of a liar so i told them the truth some dead people last month more dead last night the voice didnt answer me for a moment i licked my lips and kept going there were fake wolf tracks around the murder scenes and the feds think someone used a weapon lined with wolf teeth to tear the victims up you wouldnt know anything about that would you there was a flurry of mutters around the room low voices in hushed tones all around me a dozen maybe more i got a sudden sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach if these people were the murderers if they were responsible for last months deaths i was in big trouble and if they were real werewolves if they could shapeshift and come after me before i could clear out of there i was as good as dead shield bracelet or no i choked down a surge of panic and forced myself not to turn and run for the door kill him someone said from the darkness off to my left a female voice with a deep growling tone to it there was an answering chorus of mewling sounds from the dark around me repetitions of kill him kill him kill him my eyes were starting to adjust to the lack of light i could see them now the shapes of people restlessly pacing their eyes glowed like dogs eyes in the glare of headlights both men and women moved around me though i couldnt tell their ages there were blankets and pillows made into pallets on the floor thrown aside while their occupants had risen the female voice i had heard continued to chant kill him kill him kill him while the others followed her lead the air grew tight and heavy with a kind of energy i had never sensed before a power that was gaining momentum as they chanted a feral raging current directly in front of me not fifteen feet away stood the large shape of a man holding a shotgun stop it he snarled turning his head toward the others in the room i could see his body responding as the energy grew growing tenser more ready fight it hold it in dammit you cant let it loose here there will be cops all over us when his head turned i darted toward the doorway i kept my left palm up and turned out toward the leader the one with the shotgun and held on to my shield as hard as i could my motion triggered a frenzied howl from the others in the room and they came surging toward me like a dozen creatures with one controlling mind the shotgun roared and threw a flash of white light over the room showing me a frieze of halfdressed or naked men and women hurtling toward me their faces twisted with grimaces of berserk anger the force of the blast slammed into my shield it wasnt quite enough to shatter the protective field but it made my bracelet grow warm and shoved my opposite shoulder hard against the wall i stumbled thrown off balance one of the men a heavyset fellow with his shoulders covered in tattoos got between me and the door i ran at him and he spread his arms to grab me assuming i would try to go past him instead i drove my fist at his nose as hard as i could i dont carry a lot of power on my own when i punch but when i added in the kinetic energy stored in the ring my fist became a battering ram of bone and flesh flattening the mans nose in a gout of blood and sending him sprawling to the ground six feet away i was through the door in a flash and felt the suns welcome heat on my back i pelted toward the beetle my long legs covering the ground quickly stop stop the leader shouted and i cast a glance over my shoulder to see him an older man with greasy hair beginning to go grey he planted his feet in the doorway facing inside holding the shotgun across his body and shoving at the people trying to get past him i threw myself into the beetle and jammed my key in the ignition the car wheezed and rattled but didnt start dammit my hands were trembling but i kept trying to get the car going using every trick i knew to coax the engine to life while watching the door the leader of the streetwolves was still there fighting to hold the frenzied group inside they were screaming and howling but he shoved them away clubbed them down with the shotgun like wild dogs the muscles in his shoulders and back straining parker screamed one of them the woman who had begun the killing chant let me through he swatted her down with the butt of the shotgun without hesitation then parker turned his head toward me and i met his eyes there was a swimming moment and then i was past his eyes to what lay behind them fury overwhelmed me naked lust for meat for the hunt i needed to run to kill i was invincible unstoppable i could feel the power in my arms and hands feel the raw energy of the wild coursing through me sharpening my senses to animal keenness i felt his emotions like they were my own fury beneath rigid control the ocean beating at a tide wall the fury was directed at me dresden at the man who had invaded his territory challenged his authority and driven his people out of control endangering them i saw that he was the leader of the lycanthropes called the streetwolves men and women with the minds and souls of beasts and that he was aging was not as strong as he once had been others like the woman earlier were beginning to challenge his authority todays events might tear him from leadership and he would never live through it if parker was to live i had to die he had to kill me pure and simple and he had to do it alone to prove his strength to the pack that was the only thing that kept him from coming at my throat that very second worse he didnt know a damned thing about the last months killings and then the moment was past the soulgaze over parkers face was stunned he had seen me in much the same way i had seen him i dont know what he saw when he looked upon my soul i didnt want to know what was down there i recovered from it before he did and fumbled at the keys again the beetle coughed to life and i pulled out and onto the street swerving wildly before gathering speed and heading back uptown as quickly as i could i shook the entire way my shoulders so tight with fear and reaction that i could hear my collarbones creaking with strain i could still hear the mewling chants of kill him kill him in my head those things in that garage had not been people they had looked like people but they werent and they scared the hell out of me while sitting at an intersection i slammed my hand on the steering wheel abruptly angry stupid harry i said how could you have been so stupid why in the hell did you go wandering in there like that do you realize how close those neanderthal freaks came to tearing you apart i glared ferociously out my side window at an old lady in a business suit who was staring at me as though i were a ranting madman which i suppose was what i looked like i stopped myself from glaring at her took a deep breath and tried to calm down a couple of blocks later i was able to start thinking straight again parker and the streetwolves were not responsible for the murders last month that didnt make them any less dangerous they were lycanthropes the kind bob had told me about and i could see now why they had been feared people with the souls of beasts possessed of a ferocity so great that it could transform them into something inhuman without altering a single cell of their bodies they lived in a pack and parker was their leader i had challenged his dominance in my clueless bumbling way and now he couldnt afford to let me live or he would be killed himself so now i had to worry about someone else coming after me trying to kill me not only that all of this trouble had come gratis without giving me any lead on the true culprit of the lobo killings maybe it was a good time to leave town for a while i brooded over that for a block or so and then shook my head i wouldnt run i had made this trouble for myself and i would get out of it myself i had to stay to help murphy find the killer and to help save lives before the full moon rose again and if parker wanted to kill me wellhed find that doing in a fullfledged wizard is no easy task i gripped the steering wheel grimly if it came to it i would kill him i knew i could do that technically i suppose parker and his lycanthropes werent human the first law of magic thou shalt not kill wouldnt necessarily apply to them legally i might be able to make a case for the use of lethal magic to the white council i just wouldnt be safe from myself i wouldnt be safe from the loathing i would feel using a tool made of lifes essence its energy to bring an end to life magic was more than just an energy source like electricity or petroleum it was power true but it was a lot of other things as well it was all that was deepest and most powerful in nature in the human heart and soul the ways in which i applied it were crude and clumsy in comparison to magic in its pure form theres more magic in a babys first giggle than in any firestorm a wizard can conjure up and dont let anyone tell you any different magic comes from what is inside you it is a part of you you cant weave together a spell that you dont believe in i didnt want to believe that killing was deep inside of me i didnt want to think about the part of me that took a dark joy in gathering all the power it could and using it as i saw fit everything else be damned there was power to be had in hatred too in anger and in lust in selfishness and in pride and i knew that there was some dark corner of me that would enjoy using magic for killingand then long for more that was black magic and it was easy to use easy and fun like legos i parked the beetle in the lot of my office building and rubbed at my eyes i didnt want to kill anybody but parker and his gang might not give me any choice i might have to do a lot of killing if i was going to live i tried not to think too much about what sort of person it might be who survived i would burn that bridge when i came to it i would go up to my office and hold business hours for the rest of the day i would wait for murphy to call me and give her any aid that i could i would keep my eyes and ears open in case parker or any of his gang came after me there wasnt much more i could do and it was frustrating as hell i went up to my office unlocked it and flipped on the lights gentleman johnny marcone was seated at my desk in a dark blue business suit and his hulking bodyguard mr hendricks was standing behind him marcone smiled at me but it didnt touch the corners of his eyes ah mr dresden good we need to talk chapter marcone had eyes the color of old faded dollar bills his skin was weatherworn with an outdoorsmans deep tan creases showed at the corners of his eyes and mouth as though from smiling but those smiles were rarely sincere his suit must have cost him at least a thousand dollars he sat at ease in my chair my chair mind you and regarded me with professional calm from behind him mr hendricks looked like an allstar collegiate lineman who hadnt been smart enough to go into the pros hendrickss neck was as big around as my waist and his hands were big enough to cover my faceand strong enough to crush it his red hair was buzz cut and he wore his illfitting suit like something that he planned to rip his way out of when he turned into the hulk i couldnt see his gun but i knew he was carrying one i stood in the doorway and stared at marcone for a minute but my gaze did nothing to stir him marcone had met it already and taken my measure more than i had taken his my eyes held no more fear for him get out of my office i said i stepped inside and closed the door now now mr dresden marcone said a fathers reproof in his tone is that any way to talk to a business partner i scowled im not your partner i think youre scum the worst criminal this city has one of these days the cops will nail you but until then i dont have to put up with you here in my own office get out the police marcone said a hint of correction in his voice would be best off run by private agencies rather than public institutions better pay better benefits easier to bribe corrupt manipulate i injected marcone smiled i took off my duster and dropped it over the table in front of the door the one covered in pamphlets with titles like witches and you and want to do magic ask me how i untied my blasting rod from its thong and set it calmly on the table in front of me i had the satisfaction of seeing hendricks tense up when he saw the rod he remembered what i had done to the varsity last spring i glanced up are you still here marcone folded his hands in front of him i have an offer to make you mr dresden no i said marcone chuckled i think you should hear me out i looked him in the eyes and smiled faintly no get out his fatherly manner vanished and his eyes became cold i have neither the time nor the tolerance for your childishness mr dresden people are dying you are now working on the case i have information for you and i will give it to you for a price i felt my back stiffen i stared at him for a long minute and then said all right lets hear your price marcone held out his hand and hendricks handed him a folder marcone put the folder down on the battered surface of my old wooden desk and flipped it open this is a contract mr dresden it hires you as a consultant for my firm in personal security the terms are quite generous you get to name your own hours with a minimum of five per month you can fill in your salary right now i simply want to formalize our working relationship i walked over to my desk i saw hendrickss weight shift as though he were about to jump over the desk at me but i ignored him i picked up the folder and looked over the contract im not a legal expert but i was familiar with the forms for this kind of deal marcone was on the up and up he was offering me a dream job with virtually no commitment and as much money as i could want there was even a clause that specified that i would not be asked or expected to perform any unlawful acts with that kind of money i could live the life i wanted i could stop scraping for every dollar running my legs off working for every paranoid looney who wanted to hire me to investigate his greataunts possessed cow i could catch up on reading finally do the magical research id been itching to do for the past few years i wouldnt live forever and every hour that i wasted looking for ufos in joliet was one more hour i couldnt spend doing something i wanted to do it was a pretty damned tempting deal it was a very comfortable collar do you think im an idiot i said and tossed the folder down on my desk marcones eyebrows went up his mouth opening a little is it the hours shall i lower the minimum to one hour per week per month it isnt the hours i said he spread his hands what then its the company its the thought of a drugdealing murderer having a claim on my loyalty i dont like where your money comes from its got blood on it marcones cold eyes narrowed again think carefully mr dresden i wont make this offer twice let me make you an offer john i said i saw the corner of his cheek twitch when i used his first name tell me what you know and ill do my best to nail the killer before he comes for you what makes you think im worried mr dresden marcone said he let a fine sneer color his words i shrugged your business partner and his pet bodyguard get gutted last month spike gets torn to bits last night and then you crawl out from under your rock to dangle information in my face to help me catch the killer and try to strongarm me into becoming your bodyguard i bent down and rested my elbows on the surface of the desk then lowered my head until my eyes were a few inches from his worried john his face twitched again and i could smell him lying of course not mr dresden but you dont get where i have in life by being reckless just by being soulless right marcone slammed his palms down on the desktop and stood i rose with him enough to stand over him and to keep my eyes on his i am a man of business mr dresden would you prefer anarchy in the streets wars between rival crime lords i bring order to that chaos no you just make the chaos more efficient and organized i shot back stick whatever pretty words you want onto it but that doesnt change the fact that youre a thug a fucking animal that should be in a cage nothing more marcones normally passionless face went white his jaw clenched over words of rage i pressed him hard my own anger spilling out with a passion gone out of control i poured all of my recent frustration and fear into venomous words and hurled them at him like a handful of scrap metal whats out there john what could it possibly be did you see spike did you see how theyd torn his face off did you see the way theyd ripped his guts open i did i could smell what he had for dinner can you just imagine it happening to you next john dont call me that marcone said his voice so quiet and cold that it set my momentum back on its heels if we were in public mr dresden id have you killed for speaking that way to me if we were in public i told him youd try i drew myself up and glared down my nose at him ignoring hendrickss looming presence now get the hell out of my office marcone straightened his jacket and his tie i presume mr dresden that you are going to continue your investigation with the police department of course marcone walked around my desk past me and toward my door hendricks followed in his wake huge and quiet then in my own interests i must accept your offer and aid the investigation however i might look up the name harley macfinn ask about the northwest passage project see where they lead you he opened the door why should i believe you i asked him he looked back at me you have seen the deepest reaches of my soul mr dresden you know me in a way so profound and intimate that i cannot yet fathom its significance just as i know you you should know that i have every reason to help you and that the information is good he smiled again wintry just as you should know that it was unwise to make an enemy of me it need not have been this way i narrowed my eyes if you know me so well you should know that theres no other way it could be he pursed his lips for a moment and did not try to refute me pity he said a true pity and then he left hendricks gave me a pigeyed little glare and then he was gone too the door shut behind them i let out a long shaking breath and slumped against my desk i covered my face with my hands noticing as i did that they were shaking too i hadnt realized the depth of the disgust in me for marcone and what he stood for i hadnt realized how much it had sickened me to have my name associated with his i hadnt realized how much i wanted to launch myself at the man and smash him in the nose with my fists i stayed that way for a few minutes letting my heart beat hard catching my breath marcone could have killed me he could have had hendricks tear me apart or put a bullet in me right therebut he hadnt that wasnt marcones way he couldnt eliminate me now not after working so hard to spread the word throughout the underworld that he and i had some sort of alliance he would have to be more indirect more subtle having hendricks scatter my brains out on the floor wasnt the way to do it i thought over what he had said and the implications of his acceptance of the deal id offered he was in danger something had him scared something that he didnt understand and didnt know how to fight that was why he had wanted to hire me as a wizard i take the unknown and i turn it into something that can be measured i take that cloak of terror off of things make people able somehow to deal with them marcone wanted me to stand by him to help him not be afraid of those things lurking in the dark hell it was only human i winced i wanted to hate the man but disgust maybe anger was as far as i could go too much of what he said was true marcone was a businessman he had reduced violence in the streetswhile sending the number of dollars made by criminals in this town soaring he had protected the citys flesh while siphoning away its blood poisoning its soul it changed nothing nothing at all but to know that the man i knew the tigersouled predator the businessman killerto know that he was frightened of what i was about to go up against that scared the hell out of me and added an element of intimidation to the work i was doing that hadnt been present before that didnt change anything either its all right to be afraid you just dont let it stop you from doing your job i sat down on the desk forced thoughts of blood and fangs and agonizing death from my mind and started looking for the name harley macfinn and the northwest passage project chapter the demon trapped in the summoning circle screamed slamming its crablike pincers against the unseen barrier hurling its chitinous shoulders from side to side in an effort to escape the confinement it couldnt i kept my will on the circle kept the demon from bursting free satisfied chauncy i asked it the demon straightened its hideous form and said in a perfect oxford accent quite you understand i must observe the formalities then it took a pair of wholly incongruous wireframe spectacles from beneath a scale and perched them upon the beaklike extremity of its nose you have questions i let out a sigh of relief and sat down on the edge of the worktable in my lab i had cleared away all the clutter from around the summoning ring in the floor and id have to move it before i could clamber up out of my lab but i didnt like to take chances no matter how comfortable chaunzaggoroth and i were with our working relationship there was always a chance that i could have messed up the summoning there were rules of protocol that demonic beings were obliged to followone of them was offering resistance to any mortal wizard who called them another was doing their best to end the life of the same wizard should they be able to escape the confines of the circle all in all squeezing information from faeries and spirits of the elements was a lot easier and saferbut bob had turned up nothing in his search among the local spirits they werent always up on information to be had in the city and bob now resided in his skull again exhausted and unable to help any further so id gone to the underworld for assistance they know when youve been bad or good and they make santa claus look like an amateur i need information about a man named harley macfinn chauncy and about something he was working on called the northwest passage project chauncy clacked his pincers pensively i see presuming i have this information what is it worth to you not my soul i snorted so dont even start with that look i could dig this up myself in a few days chauncy tilted his head birdlike ah but time is of the essence yes come now harry dresden you do not call upon me lightly the possible dangers both from myself and from your own white council are far too great i scowled at him technically i said im not breaking any of the laws of magic im not robbing you of your will so im clear of the fourth law and you didnt get loose so im clear of the seventh law the council can bite me the bone ridges above chauncys eyes twitched surely that is merely a colorful euphemism rather than a statement of desire it is chauncy pushed the glasses a bit higher up on his nose the moral and ethical ramifications of your attitudes are quite fascinating harry dresden i am continually amazed that you remain in the councils good graces knowing full well that most of the council would look the other way while their enforcers killed you should they learn that you have willfully brought a demon into this world you still summon me not once but a halfdozen times your attitudes are much more contiguous with those of many of my brethren in the world below and i should throw in with your side accept the dark powers et cetera et cetera i finished for him with a sigh hells bells chauncy why do you keep on trying to sucker me into signing on with downbelow eh chauncy shrugged his bulky shoulders i admit that it would give me no small amount of status to gather a soul of your caliber into our legions he said additionally it would free me from the onerous duties which make even these excruciating visits to your world seem pleasant by comparison well you arent getting my soul today i told him so make me a counteroffer or we can call a close to the negotiations and i can send you back the demon shuddered yes very well let us not be hasty harry dresden i have the information you need additionally i have more information of which you are not aware and which would be of great interest to you and which i judge additionally may help to preserve your life and the lives of others given the situation i do not think the price i will ask inappropriate i wish another of your names i frowned the demon had two of my names already if he gained my whole name from my own lips he could use it in any number of magical applications against me that didnt particularly disturb medemons and their ilk had great difficulty in reaching out from the nevernever the spirit world beyond the physical one we inhabited with sorcery but chaunzaggoroth was a popular source of information among wizards who went to the underworld in need of it what bothered me was the possibility that one of them would get it chauncy was correctthere were a lot of people on the white council who would be happy to see me dead if one of them got my name there was the chance that they would use it against me either to kill me or to magically force me to do something that would openly violate one of the seven laws and have me brought to trial and killed on the other hand chauncy never lied to me if he said he had information that could save peoples lives he had it and thats all there was to it hell he might even know who the killer was though a demons grasp of individual human identity was somewhat shaky i decided to gamble done i said all pertinent information on the subject of my inquiry in exchange for another of my names chauncy nodded once agreed all right i said lets have the information on macfinn and the northwest passage project very well chauncy said harley macfinn is an heir to a considerable fortune made in coal mining and railroads at the turn of the twentieth century he is one of the ten richest men in the country known as the united states he served during the police action in vietnam and when he returned to this country he began divesting himself of business interests merely accruing capital his favorite color is red his shoe size is we can skip the little details unless you think they will be really relevant i said i could hear about his favorite food and his problems in middle school all day and it wouldnt help anything i got out my notebook and started taking notes as you wish chauncy assented the object of his endeavors for the past several years has been the northwest passage project the project is an effort to buy enormous tracts of land beginning in the central rocky mountains of the american southwest and moving northwest into canada to provide for an enormous migratorysized preserve for north american wildlife he wants to make his own private playground out of the rocky mountains i blurted no harry dresden he wishes to acquire the lands that are not already owned by the government then donate them provided the government guarantees that they will be used as a part of the northwest passage project he has considerable backing from environmentalist groups throughout the country and support in your capital as well provided he can get the land wow i said impressed you said he has a lot of support who wants to stop him industrial interests still looking to expand into the northwest chauncy said let me guess james harding iii was one of them i said already writing it down how did you know chauncy asked he was killed by a werewolf last month along with his bodyguard several other people died as well chauncy beamed you are a clever man harry dresden yes james douglas harding iii was exceptionally interested in blocking macfinns efforts to acquire property he came to chicago to have negotiations with macfinn but died before they were complete i closed my eyes for a minute thinking okay harding comes to town to talk to macfinn hardings in cahoots with marcone so maybe marcone is hosting the talks harding and his bodyguard get etallup by a werewolf so macfinn is the werewolf in question chauncy smiled a rather intimidating expression macfinn is a member of an ancient family line from an island known as ireland his family has a notable history sometime in the murky past legend would have it the man known as saint patrick cursed his ancestor to become a ravening beast at every full moon the curse came with two addenda first that it would be hereditary passing down to someone new each and every generation and second that the cursed line of the family would never ever die out lasting until the end of days i wrote that down as well a catholic saint did that chauncy made a sound of distaste i am not responsible for the sorts of people the other side employs wizard or the tactics they use considering the source i think ill note it as a biased opinion your folk have done a thousand times worse i said well true chauncy admitted but we tend to be quite honest about the sort of beings we are and the sorts of things we stand for at least i snorted all right this is making a lot more sense now macfinn is a loupgarou one of the legendary monsters hes trying to do some good in his spare time make the big park for all the furry critters but harding puts himself in the way macfinn goes on a killing spree and wipes him out i frowned except that harding was the last person to be murdered last month you would have thought that if macfinn was going to lose it harding would be the first to go i peered at chauncy is macfinn the murderer macfinn is a murderer chauncy said but among humankind he is one of many and not the most monstrous is he the one who killed marcones bodyguard the other people last month my information on that point is inconclusive harry dresden chauncy said his black eyes gleamed perhaps for the price of another name i could inquire of my brethren and give you a more precise answer i scowled not a chance do you know who murdered the other people last month i do chauncy said murder is one of the foremost sins and we keep close track of sins i leaned forward intently who was it chauncy laughed a grating sound really harry dresden in the first place our bargain was for information regarding macfinn and the northwest passage project in the second i could not tell you the answer to such a direct question and you know it there is a limit to how much i may involve myself in mortal affairs i let out a breath of frustration and rubbed at my eyes yeah yeah all right chauncy what else can you tell me only that harley macfinn was planning to meet with john marcone tomorrow night to continue the talks wait a minute is marcone the major opponent to the project now correct chauncy said he assumed control of a majority of the business interests shared with harding upon hardings death so marcone had a fantastic motive to have harding killed it broadened his financial empire and put him in a position to gouge macfinn for as much money as he possibly could chauncy adjusted his wireframe spectacles your reasoning would seem to be sound i thumped my pencil on my notebook staring at what i had written yeah but it doesnt explain why everyone else got killed or who did it unless marcones got a pack of werewolves in his pocket that is i chewed on my lip and thought about my encounter at the full moon garage or streetwolves is there anything else chauncy asked his manner solicitous yes i said where can i find macfinn eight eightyeight ralston place i wrote it down but thats right here in chicago in the gold coast where did you expect a billionaire to live when he was in chicago harry dresden now i seem to have lived up to all of my obligations i expect my payment now chauncy took a few restless steps back and forth within the circle his time on earth was beginning to wear on him i nodded my name i said is harry blackstone dresden i carefully omitted copperfield from the words while leaving the tones and pronunciation the same harry blackstone dresden chauncy repeated carefully harry as in harry houdini blackstone the stage illusionist i nodded my dad was a stage musician when i was born he gave me those names they were always his heroes i think if my mother had survived the birth she would have slapped him for it i made a few more notes on my page getting ideas down on paper before they fled from memory indeed chauncy agreed your mother was a most direct and willful woman her loss was a great sadness to all of us i blinked startled and the pencil fell from my fingers i stared at the demon for a moment you you knew my mother you knew margaret gwendolyn dresden chauncy regarded me without expression or emotion many in the underworld were familiar with her harry blackstone dresden though under a different name her coming was awaited with great anticipation but the dark prince lost her in the end what do you mean what are you talking about chauncys eyes gleamed with avarice didnt you know about your mothers past mr dresden a pity that we didnt have this conversation sooner you might have added it into the bargain we made of course if you would like to forfeit another name to know all about your mothers past her his voice twisted with distaste redemption and the unnatural deaths of both mother and father i am certain we can work something out i gritted my teeth in a sudden rush of childlike frustration my heart pounded in my ears my mothers dark past i had expected that she was a wizardess but i had never been able to prove anything one way or another unnatural deaths my father had perished in his sleep of an aneurism when i was young my mother had died in childbirth or had they a sudden burning desire to know filled me starting at my gut and rolling outward through my bodyto know who my mother was what she had known she had left me her silver pentacle but i knew nothing of the sort of person she was other than what my gentle and toogenerous father had told me before his death what were my parents like how had they perished and why had they been killed did they have enemies lurking out there somewhere if so had i inherited them my mothers dark past did that explain my own fascination with the darker powers my somewhatlessthansterling adherence to the rules of the white council that i considered foolish or inconvenient i looked up at the demon and felt like a sucker i had been set up he had intended all along to dangle this information in front of me as bait he wanted to get my whole name if he could or more i can show them to you harry blackstone dresden as they really are chaunzaggoroth assured me his voice dulcet youve never seen your mothers face i can give that to you youve never heard her voice i can let you hear that as well you know nothing of what sort of people your parents wereor if you have any other family out there family harry blackstone dresden blood every bit as tormented and alone as you are i stared at the demons hideous form and listened to his soothing relaxing voice family was it possible that i had a family aunts uncles cousins others like me perhaps moving through the secret societies of the wizards hidden from the view of the mortal world the price is comparatively low what need have you for your immortal soul when your body is finished with it what harm to pass on to me only one more name this is not information easily gained even by my kind you may not have the chance to garner it again the demon pressed his pincers against the barrier of the conjuring circle his beaklike maw fairly trembled with eagerness forget it i said quietly no deal chaunzaggoroths jaw dropped open but harry blackstone dresden he began i didnt realize that i was shouting until i saw him flinch i said forget it you think im some kind of simp for you to sucker in darkspawn take what you have gained and go and feel lucky that i do not send you home with your bones torn from your body or your beak ground into dust chaunzaggoroths eyes flashed with rage and he hurled himself against the barrier again howling with blood lust and fury i extended my hand and snarled oh no you dont you slimy little shit head the demons will strained against mine and though sweat burst out on my forehead i came out ahead once more chaunzaggoroth began to grow smaller and smaller howling out his frustrated rage we are watching you wizard he screamed you walk through shadows and one night you will slip and fall and when you do we will be there we will be waiting to bring you down to us you will be ours in the end he went on like that until he shrank to the size of a pinpoint and vanished with a little imploding sound i let my hand drop and lowered my head breathing hard i was shaking all over and not only with the cold of my laboratory i had badly misjudged chaunzaggoroth thought him a somewhat reliable if dangerous source of information willing to do reasonable business but the rage the fury the frustrated malice that had been in his final offer those last words had shown his true colors he had lied to me deceived me about his true nature played me along like a sucker and then tried to set the hook hard i felt like such an idiot the phone began to ring upstairs i stirred into sudden motion shoving stacks of things out of my way pushing past them and over them to reach the stepladder stairs that led up to my apartment i hurried up them my notebook in one hand and caught the phone on its fifth ring my apartment was dark night had fallen while i had interviewed the demon dresden i said puffing harry murphy said her voice weak weve got another one son of a bitch i said im coming give me the address i set down the notebook and held my pencil ready to write murphys tone was numb eight eightyeight ralston place up in the gold coast i froze staring at the address i had written down on the notebook the address the demon had given me harry murphy said did you hear me i heard i told her im coming murph i hung up the phone and headed out into the light of the full moon overhead chapter eight eightyeight ralston was a townhouse in the gold coast the richest area of chicago it was set on its own little plot surrounded by trees that hid the house from view almost entirely high hedges worked around the house in a small garden added to the concealment as i drove up the white pebble drive and parked the beetle at the rear of a small fleet of police cars and emergency vehicles the strobing blue lights were almost comforting by now id seen them so many times that it felt in an unsettling way like a homecoming murphy had called me in earlyi didnt see the forensics van yet and only now were officers putting up yellow tape around the property i got out of my car dressed in my jeans buttondown shirt and boots again my old black duster flapping around my calves the wind was brisk cold the moon was riding high overhead barely visible through the citys haze of pollution a chill ran down my neck and i stopped looking at the rows and rows of elegantly illuminated hedge sculptures flower beds and rows of shrubbery around me i was abruptly certain that someone was out in the darkness i could feel eyes on me i stared out at the night sweeping my gaze slowly around i could see nothing but i would have bet money that there was someone out there after a moment the sense of being watched faded and i shivered i shoved my hands in my pockets and walked quickly toward the townhouse dresden someone called and i looked up to see carmichael coming down the front stairs of the townhouse toward me carmichael was murphys right hand in special investigations shorter than average rounder than average slobbier than average and with piggier eyes than average carmichael was a skeptic a doubter and a razorsharp cop he came down the stairs in his soupstained old tie and shirtsleeves its about fucking time jesus christ dresden he wiped a hand over his sweating brow i frowned down at carmichael as we went up the stairs side by side thats the nicest greeting youve ever given me i think i said you change your mind about me being a fake carmichael shook his head no i still think youre full of shit with this wizardmagic business but christ almighty there are times when i wish you werent you never can tell i said my voice dry wheres murphy inside carmichael said his mouth twisting with distaste you go on up the stairs the whole place belongs to this guy murphy figures you might know something im going to stay here and bog down the feds when they show i glanced at him she still worried about looking bad for internal affairs carmichael grimaced those assholes in ia would be all over her if she kicked the feds out christ almighty i get sick of city politics sometimes i nodded agreement and started up the stairs hey dresden carmichael said i looked over my shoulder at him expecting the familiar jeers and insults he was studying me with bright narrow eyes i hear things about you and john marcone whats the deal i shook my head no deal hes lying scum carmichael studied me intently and then nodded you aint much of a liar dresden i dont think you could keep a straight face about something like this i believe you but you dont believe me when i say im a wizard i asked carmichael grimaced and looked away do i look like a fucking moron to you huh you better get upstairs ill make some noise when denton and the stepford agents get here i turned to go and saw murphy standing at the head of the stairs in a crisp grey business jacket and slacks with sensible low heels and jewelry the color of steel her earrings seemed to be little more than bright beads of silver in her ears which i had never really noticed when she had worn her golden hair long murphys earlobes were cute shed kill me just for thinking it about time dresden get up here her voice was hard angry she vanished from the top of the stairway and i took the rest of the stairs two at a time to catch up with her the apartment though it was too big for the word to really apply was brightly lit and smelled very faintly of blood blood has a sweet sort of metallic odor it makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up and mine snapped to attention at once there was another smell as well maybe incense of some kind and the fresh scent of the wind i turned down a short hall at the top of the stairs and followed murphy into what was apparently a master bedroom where i found the source of all the scents there was no furniture inside the master bedroomand it was huge large enough to make you wince at how far youd have to go to get to the bathroom in the middle of the night there was no carpeting there were no decorations on the walls there was no glass in the huge singlepane window letting in the october wind the full moon shone down through it like a picture in a frame what the room did have was blood there was blood all over scattered in droplets and splashed in spurts against one wall the scarlet footprints of something like a large wolf led in a straight line toward the shattered window in the center of the room were the remains of a greater circle of summoning its three rings of symbols carefully wrought in white chalk upon the wooden floor burning sticks of incense interspersed among the symbols of the second ring what was left of kim delaney lay naked and supine on the bloodstained floor a few feet from the circle the expression of shock and surprise on her face wouldnt change until rigor set in her dark onceglittering eyes stared up at the ceiling and her lips were parted as though in the middle of an apology a large wheelsection of flesh beneath her chin was missing and with it kims larynx and trachea bloody red meat was showing the ragged ends of arteries and torn sections of muscle and pale white bones gleamed at the bottom of the wound long rakes down her body had opened her like a ziploc bag leaving her covered in scarlet something went click in my head someone threw some kind of switch that just turned off my emotions entirely and immersed me in a surreal haze i couldnt be seeing this it simply couldnt be real it had to be some sort of game or hoax in which the actors would start giggling in a few moments unable to contain the mirth of their prank i waited but no one started giggling i wiped at my forehead with my hand and found cold sweat there my fingers began to shake murphy said her voice still tight with anger apparently the incense set off the fire alarm in the hall when the fire department got here no one answered so they came on in they found her up here around eight oclock she was still warm eight oclock when i had been talking to the demon moonrise behind me murphy closed the door to the bedroom i turned to her away from the grisly corpse there was anger in every inch of her in the way she glared at me murph i said i dont know if i can do this whats there to figure murphy said theres a monster in the middle of the circle i figure its one of those loupgarou from your report i figure its harley macfinn the owner of this house someone who knows hes going to go nuts when the moon rises the girl tries to hold the monster inside the magic circle right something goes wrong when macfinn goes furry he gets out of the circle wastes her then leaves uhhuh i said without turning around to look at kims body again it makes sense and i told her what i had learned from the demon about harley macfinn the northwest passage project and his antagonism with marcones business interests murphy listened to me in utter silence when i was finished she nodded and turned to leave the room follow she said shortly i followed almost on her heels i didnt turn around to see the room again before i left she led me down the hall into another bedroom this one furnished and neatly kept come here she said moving to a dresser i did and she handed me a photograph of a middleaged starkly handsome man his skin deeply tanned the bones of his face gaunt and sharp he was smiling beside him in the picture was the ambereyed woman from the department store where id run across the alphas she was also smiling her teeth were very white very even and her dark skin and silverpeppered hair went well with the man beside her i chewed on my lip for a second trying to think thats harley macfinn murphy said matches the picture on his drivers license i didnt turn up any id on the woman next to him though she studied my face critically she matches the description of the woman you said you saw in the department store though the one who followed us back from the scene in rosemont is that her i nodded yeah thats her murphy nodded took the picture from me and set it back on the dresser follow she said again and walked out i stared after her what was wrong with murphy had the scene unsettled her so much i shook my head still stunned from what i had seen from too many facts coming together all at once slambang in my brain murph wait i said stop a minute whats going on she didnt answer me just shot me a glare over her shoulder and continued walking i hurried to catch up with her we went down what looked like a servants narrow spiral staircase down into the basement she led me to the back of a storage room and pushed open a heavy steel door there that opened onto a small stark chamber all of concrete with no other exits in the center of the chamber was another threering summoning circle but this ones symbols had been made from silver and set into the concrete of the floor short bars of what looked like a mixture of silver and obsidian were interspersed around the second circle creating what would if the circle was functional be a very formidable barrier but the symbols had been marred torn broken several from the critical inner ring had been pried up from the floor and were simply missing some of the bars had been broken the circle as it was was nonfunctional and worthlessbut whole it would have served to contain harley macfinn when he shifted into his beast form the room was a prison he had created for himself something to contain the fury of the beast inside of him but someone had intentionally marred the circle made the prison useless and i abruptly understood kim delaneys request she had to have known harley macfinn maybe through her environmental activism she must have learned of his curse and wanted to help him when i had refused to help her she had attempted to recreate the greater summoning circle upstairs in the bedroom to hold in macfinn once the moon rose as i had warned her would happen she had failed she hadnt had the knowledge necessary to understand how such a construct would function and consequently she hadnt been able to make it work macfinn had killed her kim was dead because i had refused to share my knowledge with her because i hadnt given her my help i had been so secure in my knowledge and wisdom withholding such secrets from her had been the action of a concerned and reasoned adult speaking to an overeager child i couldnt believe my own arrogance the utter confidence with which i had condemned her to death i started to shake harder too many things pressing against my head my heart i could feel the pressure somewhere inside of me that switch on the inside of my head quivering getting ready to flick back beneath a tide of raging anger fury regret selfhatred i took deep breaths and closed my eyes trying not to let it happen i opened my eyes and looked up at murphy god i needed to talk to her i needed a friend i needed someone to listen to tell me it would be all right whether it was the truth or not i needed someone to let me unload on them to keep me from flying apart she regarded me with cold angry eyes karrin i whispered she drew from her pocket a crumpled piece of paper she unfolded it and held it up to me so that i could see kim delaneys graceful handwriting the sketch of the summoning circle that she had brought to me in mcanallys the sketch i had refused to tell kim about the sketch i had crumpled into a little ball and tossed on the floor and which murphy had picked up absently just to get the trash out of peoples way and i realized why there was so much anger in murphys eyes i stared at the sketch karrin i began again stars above youve got to listen to me i took the sketch from her hands my fingers trembling harry she said in a calm tone you lying bastard and on the word she drove her fist into my stomach hard doubling me over the motion put my head within easy reach and her fist took me across the jaw in a right cross that sent me to the floor like a lump of wet pasta stars dancing in my vision i was only dimly aware of her taking the sketch back from me she twisted my arms painfully behind my back and snapped her handcuffs around my wrists you promised me she said her voice furious you promised no secrets you lied to me all along you played me like a sucker the entire while godammit dresden youre involved in this and people are dying murph i mumbled wait she grabbed my hair jerked my head back and slammed me across the jaw again nearberserk anger lending her strength my head swam and blackness closed over my vision for several seconds no more talking no more lies i heard her say and she dragged me to my feet shoved my face and chest against a wall and began searching me for weapons no more people torn up like meat on a block you have the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law she took my blasting rod my shield bracelet the energy ring even my lump of chalk her voice went on hard cold and professional letting me know my rights i closed my eyes and leaned against the stone wall next to my head it was the softest thing in the room i didnt try to fight or to explain what was the point chapter walking down stairs with your hands fastened behind your back is more difficult than you would think you depend upon your arms for balance whether you realize it or not with my hands cuffed at the small of my back and murphy walking me up the narrow servants staircase and then down the front stairs of macfinns building in front of a gaggle of staring police officers my balance was gone as we came down i could hear arguing voices you want to get in my face about this carmichael demanded look im doing my job my boss said no one was to go up so no one goes up do i need to use shorter words or what i looked up to see denton towering over carmichael the veins in his forehead athrob his three associates spread out in a fan behind him you are interfering with a duly appointed officer executing his duties denton snarled get out of my way detective carmichael or do you want to get added to internal affairs todo list along with your boss its all right ron murphy said im done with my business up there anyway carmichael looked up at me and stared his mouth opening denton and his crew looked too i saw dentons face twist in surprise and then close again hedging out any emotion from his expression roger the redheaded kid who worked for denton was staring at me openly his jaw dropped benn the woman who had attacked murphy last night regarded me with an almost bored expression and wilson the overweight one let out a satisfied snort lieutenant carmichael said you sure about this he was arguing with the most recently deceased last night i can connect him to at least one resident of the house as well as some of the decorations there im taking him in for obstructing and for conspiracy to commit murder put him in the car carmichael and then get your ass upstairs murphy gave me a sharp push toward carmichael and i stumbled carmichael caught me so lets go denton murphy said and turned and stalked away denton gave me an expressionless glance and stepped after murphy beckoning his companions to follow carmichael shook his head and walked me to one of the police cars fuck dresden and here i was getting ready to throw in on your side guess im just a sucker for the underdog carmichael unlocked the back of the car and put his hand on the back of my head as i bent down to get into it watch your head christ what happened to your jaw i sat down in the back of the car and looked straight ahead i didnt answer him carmichael stared at me for a while and then shook his head well have someone drive you downtown as soon as the scene is secure you can get in touch with your lawyer then i kept my eyes forward and still didnt answer him carmichael studied me some more then stood and shut me into the car i closed my eyes i have felt low before in my life have experienced events that left me broken and groveling and wishing i was dead that was pretty much how i felt now too it wasnt that i hadnt found the killerive been beaten before taken the blow on the chin and come out fighting the next round i can roll with the punches as well as anyone but i hated feeling that i had betrayed a friend i had promised murphy that i would keep no secrets from herand i hadnt not really but i had been stupid i should have been putting pieces together more quickly more instinctively perhaps i had some excuse in that i had been distracted by nearly having my head blown off at the full moon garage that i had been distracted by my soulgaze upon the streetwolves leader and the knowledge that he wanted to kill me but it wasnt a good enough excuse to clear things with murphy i wasnt sure anything would have been i felt alone i felt frustrated i felt like shit and i felt worse a moment later when i looked out the car window at the full moon and realized something that i should have put together an hour beforethe real killer or killers were still out there macfinn couldnt have been responsible for all of the deaths the previous month two of the murders had occurred on the nights before and after the full moon if macfinns curse was indeed to become a ravening beast during the full moon he could not have murdered either of last months victims or spike at the varsity last night which begged the question who had done the killings i didnt have any answers if the darkhaired woman who had led the alphas was indeed connected with macfinn could she have been responsible something wolflike had attacked me in the abandoned department store when all the lights had been outhad it been her one of the alphas perhaps that would explain how the other murders happened but if it had been true why hadnt the killer finished me off while i was floundering in the dark virtually helpless more and more questions and no answers not that it mattered to me now a nice quiet jail cell didnt sound too bad once i thought about it at least it would keep the criminal element off of my back provided they didnt shut me up with a fourhundredpound con named hump or anything and then an odd feeling crept over me derailing my train of thought once more the hairs on my neck were standing up someone was watching me i looked around there was no one in sight all of the police were inside the house i was alone in the back of the patrol car with my hands bound i was helpless and alone and i suddenly became very aware of the fact that harley macfinn had yet to be found or apprehended he was still lurking in the night unable to keep from tearing apart anyone he saw i thought of spikes torn corpse of poor kim delaney covered in her own blood upstairs in the townhouse i added imaginary and far more horrible images of half a dozen other victims stacking scene upon scene of blood and death in my mind within a few seconds i broke out in a cold sweat and looked out the other window directly into a pair of brilliant feral amber eyes i yelled and flinched away lifting my legs to kick should something come rushing through the vehicles window instead the door opened and the darkhaired ambereyed woman from the department store said be quiet mr dresden or i will not be able to rescue you i blinked at her over my upraised knees huh rescue you mr dresden get out of the car and come with me and quickly before the police return she peered past me toward the house there is not much time are you crazy i demanded i dont even know who the hell you are i am harley macfinns fiancée miss west she said i am called tera i shook my head i cant leave id be buying more trouble than you could imagine her amber eyes glinted you are the only one who can stop my fiancé mr dresden you cannot do that from a jail cell im not the lone ranger i snapped in reply im a hired consultant and i dont think the city is going to foot the bill for this sort of thing tera wests teeth showed if money is your concern i assure you that it is not a problem mr dresden time presses will you come or not i studied her face she had clean striking features exceptional more than attractive there were crowsfeet at the edges of her eyes though they were the only sign of age on her that i could see there was along the edge of her forehead at the hairline a long slender purpling bruise you i said it was you who attacked me in the department store i hit you and you took my rod away from me she glared at me yes she said youre a werewolf and you she said are a wizard and we have no more time she crouched a bit lower staring past me i looked in that direction and saw denton and his cronies exiting the townhouse engaged in an animated discussion your friend she said the police detective is close to finding my fiancé do you really want her to be the one to face him is she prepared to deal with what she will find or will she die as the others did dammit the bitch no pun intended was right i was the one who was capable of actually doing something about macfinn if murphy was the one to catch up to him first people would get killed she was a fantastic cop and was becoming more adept at dealing with the supernatural but she wasnt able to handle a major werewolf berserker i turned back to tera if i go with you youll take me to macfinn she stopped in the midst of turning to leave when i can at dawn if you think you can create the circle hold him in when the moon again rises if you can help him i nodded once my decision was made i can i will she who was called kim delaney said the same thing tera west said and spun on her heels to head away from me crouched low to the ground i rolled out of the backseat and followed tera west out into the shrubberies and garden shadows around the building away from the police cars and the lights someone shouted in surprise somewhere behind me then there was a cry of stop i just stood and ran as fast as i could to get out of the lights and the line of sight of any possible shooters apparently the one shout was all the warning i was going to get gunfire erupted behind me as i ran bullets tore up the dirt next to my feet i think i started screaming without slowing down hunching my shoulders and ducking my head as best i could i was maybe five feet away from the sheltering shadows behind the hedges when something slammed into my shoulder and threw me through the hedge and out the other side i landed in a roll and stumbled halfway back to my feet there was a second of screaming confused input from my shoulder as though my joints could suddenly hear a welter of sound feel a broad variety of sensation and texture beneath my skin and then my shoulder went numb entirely and my vision started spinning i reached out a hand to support myself as i started to falland remembered that my wrists were still cuffed behind me i went into the turf felt the grass against my cheek hes down hes down came a cold female voiceagent benns i thought take him there was no warning of presence just the feeling of someone jerking me up to my feet by my duster i felt teras hand slide beneath my jacket then vanish as she pressed it to the numbed area of my arm you are not bleeding badly tera said her voice calm you were shot in the shoulder not the leg run or die then she turned and started making her way through the hedges some encouragementbut i had a hunch i would be feeling a lot worse a few minutes from now so i swallowed the sickly taste of fear and loped after tera west as best i could we started a game of shadowhaunted hideandseek in the little garden tera and me against the agents behind us she moved like a wraith in utter silence smooth and steady in the black shadows and silver light of the moon overhead she immediately cut into the hedges taking lefts and rights every few paces she did not slow down for me and i was somehow very certain that macfinns fiancée would not stop and wait for me should i fall she wouldnt hesitate to leave me behind if i could not keep the pace i did it for a while it wasnt even too hard oh i felt a little out of breath a little hampered by the handcuffs but other than that it was almost as though i hadnt been shot aside from the trickling warmth i could feel sliding down my ribs and over my belly endorphinswhat a rush our pursuers plunged into the maze of hedges shrubs and statuary but my guide seemed to have an uncanny knack for avoiding them she kept to the darkest parts of the garden as we went checking behind her to make sure i was keeping the pace i wasnt sure how much time passed that way ghosting through the darkness while our pursuers struggled to coordinate their efforts and remain quiet at the same time but it couldnt have been long ive read somewhere that the initial shock of gunshot injuries always wears off after a few momentsbesides i was out of shape i couldnt have kept up with tera west for long she was that fast that good my shoulder began to pound double time to my laboring heart as we emerged from the last of the hedges to the street outsideand the eightfoot wrought iron fence that surrounded the property i slid to a halt and stumbled against the fence wheezing tera looked over her shoulder her amber eyes bright beneath the moon she was breathing through her nose silently the crouched run having not tired her in the least it seemed i cant climb the fence i said the pain from my shoulder was starting to become very real nowit felt like a runners cramp only higher up theres no way not with my hands cuffed tera nodded once i will lift you she said i stared at her through a growing haze of pain then sighed youd better hurry then i said im about to pass out she took the words in stride and said lean against the fence keep your body stiff then she seized my ankles i did my best to follow her directions and she heaved straining with effort for a second nothing happened and then she started very slowly to move me up my good shoulder against the fence she kept pressing my ankles higher until i bent forward at the waist scrabbled with my legs for a secondand then tumbled gracelessly to the ground on the far side of the fence i hit the ground and as i did a nuclear weapon went off in my shoulder white fire blinding heat i sucked in a breath and tried not to scream but some sound must have escaped there was a shout from somewhere behind me and the sound of voices converging on our position tera grimaced and turned to face the oncoming voices hurry up i gasped climb it and lets go she shook her head a stirring of dark hair no time they are here i gritted my teeth until they creaked and got my feet underneath me she was right the oncoming voices were close someone benn again i thought shouted out orders not to move if tera tried to clamber over the fence now shed be a perfect target at the top the pursuers were too close tera didnt stand much chance of escaping and if she didnt i wouldnt make it far id be caught and in more trouble than everand macfinn would be on a rampage with no one to oppose him i blinked sweat out of my eyes and knelt down as my blood pattered to the sidewalk little curls of steam came up where it hit the cold concrete i took a breath and drew in every bit of will i could summon drew in the pain and my fear and sick frustration and shoved it all into a hard little ball of energy ventas veloche i murmured ubrium ubrium i repeated the words in a breathless chant curling my fingers in toward my palm as i did the curls of steam from my blood began to thicken and gather into dense tendrils of mist and fog back along our trail where more of my blood had spilled more fog arose for a few seconds it was nothing just a low and slithering movement along the groundand then it erupted forth billows of fog rising to cover the ground as the energy rushed out of me covering tera from my sight and causing shouts of confusion and consternation to come from the law officials pursuing us i dropped to my side overwhelmed by pain and fatigue there was a whisper of sound a creak of wrought metal and then a light thump as tera west landed beside me invisible in the fog though she was only a few feet away she moved toward me and then i saw her expression her eyes wide with wonder the first emotion i had seen on her face wizard she whispered dont wear it out i mumbled and then everything went black chapter i woke up someplace dark and warm but then i opened my eyes and it wasnt dark anymore just dim i was in a hotel room a cheap one lying on my back in a double bed heavy curtains were drawn but cheap curtain rods sagged in the middle and let light in from outside i felt that i had been lying there for a while i took a deep breath and it made my shoulder begin a dull pounding throb i moaned before i could think to keep quiet im not a wimp it just hurt that bad my throat was parched my lips chapped i turned my head which made my jaw ache where murphy had socked me my left shoulder was covered in thick white bandages and wrapped firmly in tape it looked clean and neat except for the bruises that i could see spreading out toward my chest and down my arm from beneath the bandages as a side note i noticed that i was naked and the list of candidates for who could have undressed me was awfully short beyond my shoulder on the nightstand beside the bed was a pile of miscellany a book entitled sas survival manual lay open to a page with several black and white illustrations of bandaging techniques beside it were some empty cardboard boxes whose labels declared them to have once contained cotton gauze wrapping medical tape that sort of thing a brown bottle of hydrogen peroxide lay on its side atop a hacksaw with a nicked blade a paper sack sat on the floor beside the bed its top folded closed i moved my right hand up to rub at my aching head one bracelet of murphys handcuffs hung around my wrist the chain swinging from the base of the bracelet where it had apparently been severed by the hacksaw the other bracelet was down on my left wrist i could feel it as a dull throbbing band around the lower part of my arm i did my best not to move too much but the pain didnt go away after a few minutes i decided that my wound wasnt going to start hurting any less so i sat up slowly rising wasnt too much more trouble though my legs shook a little i made it to the bathroom and made use of the facilities then splashed water on my face with my right hand this time she didnt surprise me i heard her move out of the darkness of the back corner of the room i glanced up into tera wests ambercolored eyes in the mirror and said tell me i didnt get lucky last night her expression never blinked as though the insinuation had flown past her she was still dressed in the same clothes and still held herself with the same relaxed composure she had always displayed you were very lucky she said the bullet went through the muscle and missed the bone and the artery you will live i scowled i dont feel so lucky tera shrugged pain is to be endured it ends or it does not i saw her consider my back and then lower portions you are in reasonably good condition you should be able to withstand it i felt a hot rush of blood to my face and i fumbled for a towel and awkwardly slung it around my hips are you the one who bandaged me and uh i made a vague gesture with the fingers of the hand that was holding the towel and preserving my modesty she nodded i am and i have procured clothing for you that is not soaked in blood you must dress so that we may help my fiancé i turned to face her and tried out my best glower she didnt twitch an eyebrow what time is it she shrugged late afternoon the sun will set soon and the moon will rise soon after we have no time to waste if we are to reach him before the change do you know where he is she shrugged again i know him i let out a breath and slowly walked past her i went to the paper bag on the floor next to the bed inside it i found a pair of enormous purplish sweatpants and a white tshirt with old glory flying on it in rippling metallic colors subtitled invest in americabuy a congressman i wrinkled up my nose at the sweatpants liked the shirt and fumbled myself into the clothing ripping off price tags as i went where are we i asked a hotel in east chicago she said i nodded how did you pay for it i used cash macfinn told me that the police can track the plastic cards i squinted at her yeah they can i rubbed a hand over my head and went to the mirror again to study myself i was walking more easily nowthe pain wasnt any less but i was beginning to get more used to it do you have any ibuprofen anything like that drugs she said no she picked up a set of rentalcar keys and turned toward the door stop i told her she turned to me her eyes narrowed we are going now she said we are not going i replied until i have a few answers her eyebrows furrowed and she glared at me then she turned and walked out of the room letting in a brief flood of orangetinted sunlight before the door slammed behind her i considered the door for a moment then i sat down on the bed and waited perhaps three minutes passed then she reappeared now she said we will leave i shook my head i told you no not until i get some answers macfinn will answer your questions tera told me now you must leave this place i snorted and folded my arms over my chest my shoulder took fire and i wobbled on the bed before i lowered my left arm again i left the right one folded across my chest but it just didnt have the same effect where is macfinn why did he kill marcones business partner and his bodyguard or did he kill them at all you will leave this pl tera began who are you why did the pair of you mess up the first circle the one in your basement how did you know kim delaney tera west snarled and seized me by the front of my shirt you will leave this place now she said glaring into my eyes why should i i snarled and for once i didnt avert my eyes i stared into her gleaming amber eyes and braced myself for the impact of looking into her soul and for her to peer into mine instead nothing happened that in itself was enough to make my jaw drop incredulously i continued the stare and she didnt blink didnt turn awayand didnt fall into soulgaze with me i shuddered in reaction what was going on why didnt the gaze begin there were only two kinds of people whose eyes i could meet for more than a second or two the people who had already met my eyes in a soulgaze were one kind inhuman beings from the nevernever were the other i had never looked upon tera wests soul before i remembered a soulgaze every time it happened the experience wasnt the sort of thing you could forget that only left one conclusion whoever she waswhatever she was tera west wasnt human we will leave now she growled i felt a surge of defiant grumpiness course through me why should i i whispered back because i have called the police and told them that you are here that you are acting irrational and dangerous and that you possess a weapon they will be here momentarily i think that the police might be feeling threatened given all the recent deaths they will be likely to shoot you rather than take chances she let go of my shirt with a little push and stalked out of the room i sat on the bed for about five seconds then i rose and hobbled after her taking time to snatch my duster from where it was draped over a chair there were holes in the upper left arm one in the front of the sleeve one in the back and it was crusty with dried blood that didnt much show against the black canvas it was disgusting but hey it was mine the boots and socks i had been wearing last night were next to it and i snagged them too outside it was late afternoon the streets and highways would soon be crowded with commuters going home from work tera had rented a beatup old car probably from an independent rental business rather than from one of the major chainsgood move on her part it would draw things out while the police methodically went through agency after agency looking for someone of her description and they always started with the big places first i studied her as she got in the car she was tall and lean and pretty in a knifeedge sort of way her eyes moved around constantlynot nervously or randomly but with the cool precision of someone making herself aware of everything surrounding her at all times her hands were scarred longfingered and strong the bruise on her head where i had smacked her with my blasting rod the night before no two nights before i had lost a day sleeping in the hotel room was probably hurting like hell but she didnt seem to notice it she drove us out onto the streets of east chicago one of the distant suburbs of the big city down at the south end of lake michigan finally turning off into a quiet drive beside a sign that read wolf lake park tera west made me nervous she had appeared from nowhere to save me from the back of a police car true but what were her intentions was she really trying to help her fiancé keep from falling victim to his family curse again or were the two of them working together to remove anyone who could rebuild the magical circle that could contain macfinn and render him harmless that would make sense given that once kim delaney was dead they came after me on the other hand that didnt fit with a lot of the other facts macfinn if he was truly a loupgarou changed into a beast only during the nights of the full moon at least half a dozen people had been killed when the moon was waxing full but not yet all the way there or after it had been full for three nights already and was waning back toward half full again and tera west wasnt a werewolf a werewolf was a human being who used magic to turn into a wolf she had looked upon my eyes and not been drawn in therefore she wasnt a human being could she be some kind of shapeshifter from the nevernever macfinns partner in crime killing on the off nights to keep suspicion from falling on him some sort of being with which i was unfamiliar most of my background on the paranormal was western european in origin i should have been reading more books on native american beliefs south american spooks and haunts african legend east asian folklorebut it was a little late for such regrets if tera west was a monster and wanted me dead she could have killed me alreadyand she surely would not have bothered to clean and dress my injury of course that begged the question what did she really want and that question led the way to many more who were the young people i had seen her with that first evening what was she doing with them did she have some kind of cult of followers like vampires sometimes built up or was it something else entirely tera pulled over onto a little gravel lane drove a quarter mile up it and pulled off into the weeds get out she said he will be here somewhere the bouncing car ride had come to an end mercifully and the sun was still solidly above the horizon with moonrise not for at least an hour after sunset so i ignored the pain and pushed my way out of the car to follow her into the woods it was darker underneath the ancient oaks and sycamores and quiet birdsong came to us but from far away as though the birds were choosing the better part of valor in remaining where the sun could still touch the tree branches the wind sighed through the woods sending leaves spinning down in all shades of gold and orange and russet adding to the thick crunchy carpeting under our feet our steps sounded out distinctly as we moved ahead through the leaves and the cool wind made me grateful that i had thought to drape my duster over my shoulders i studied the usually quiet tera she was walking with exaggerated motions planting her feet down solidly with each step as though intentionally trying to make noise once or twice she stepped out of her way to tread on a branch snapping it with a dry popping sound i was too tired and sore to go to any such effort i just walked and it made more noise than she did who says i cant do anything right we hadnt gone more than a few hundred yards when tera abruptly tensed crouching her eyes scanning all around there was a whistling sound and then a bent sapling jerked upright dragging a noose around teras ankles and hauling her across the rock and leafcovered floor of the woods with a yelp of surprise i blinked at her and then something came up out of the leaves rose right up like hamlets dad from the stage floor but instead of bemoaning his fate and charging me with avenging him he slugged me across the jaw on the same side of my face that already sported dark purple bruises and sent me spinning to the ground stunned i landed badly but on my unwounded side and rolled out of the way as a muddy naked foot stomped down at my head i grabbed on to it and jerked with more desperation than strength and the foots owner fell down beside me instead of being slowed he slapped his arms at the ground as he hit it in much the same way murphy did when practicing falls then he rolled as i struggled to my hands and knees and slid a hard strong forearm beneath my throat locking it there with the other hand and pressing back against my windpipe got you i got you snarled my attacker i struggled against him but he was bigger than me stronger than me he had me down and he hadnt been shot or beaten up anywhere near as often as i had in the last fifteen hours or so i didnt stand a chance chapter so there i was being strangled by a ranting halfnaked madman in the middle of the woods with a shewerewolf dangling from a rope snare somewhere nearby my gunshot wound hurt horribly and my jaw throbbed from where my buddy the cop had brutalized it the night before ive had worse days thats the great thing about being a wizard i can always tell myself honestly that things could be worse i stopped trying to struggle against the man who was choking me instead i grabbed his wrist and prepared to do something foolish magic is a kind of energy it is given shape by human thoughts and emotions by imagination thoughts define that shapeand words help to define those thoughts thats why wizards usually use words to help them with their spells words provide a sort of insulation as the energy of magic burns through a spell casters mind if you use words that youre too familiar with words that are so close to your thoughts that you have trouble separating thought from word that insulation is very thin so most wizards use words from ancient languages they dont know very well or else they make up nonsense words and mentally attach their meanings to a particular effect that way a wizards mind has an extra layer of protection against magical energies coursing through it but you can work magic without words without insulation for your mind if youre not afraid of it hurting a little i drew in my will my exhausted fear and focused on what i wanted my vision swam with dots of color the man on my back snarled and growled incoherently and spittle or foam dribbled onto the side of my face dried leaves and mud pressed against the other side of my face things started going black then i ground my teeth together and released my will with a burst of sudden energy two things happened first a rush of blinding thought brilliant and wild and jangling went through my head my eyes swam with color my ears with phantom sound my senses were assaulted with a myriad of impressions the sharp scent of the earth and dry leaves the rippling scratch of a centipedes legs fluttering up the skin of my forearms the sensation of warm sunlight against my scalp dozens of others i couldnt identifythings with no basis in reality they were a side effect of the energy rushing through my head the second thing that happened was a surge of electricity gathered from the air around me to my fingertips gripped on my attackers wrist and surged up through his arm and into his body he convulsed against my back out of control and the strength of his own reaction threw him off of me and to his back on the leaves jerking and flopping his face stretched in a tightlipped expression of shock and fear i wheezed in a breath stunned and shaking then scrambled back to my feet only to stagger against a tree i huddled there watching my attackers convulsions fade into a numb paralysis finally he just stared at the sky his lips open his chest heaving in and out i studied the man a little more closely he was big he was really big at least as tall as me and twice as broad he was dressed only in a pair of cutoff blue jeans and those looked like they were ill fit he was in a condition best described as overwhelmingly masculine hairychested and muscled like a professional wrestler there was grey in his hair and beard and there were lines on his face putting his age at well into maturity it was his eyes that showed me the most about him they burned green wild and haunted fastened on the distant sky now but heavy with the weight of too much terrible knowledge it couldnt have been easy to live with a curse like his there was a scrambling sound a muffled thump and i looked up to see macfinns noose trap hanging empty the rope swinging back and forth my eyes tracked down to earth to find an indistinct shape stir in the leaves and then resolve itself into tera wests long limbs and practical clothes she gathered her legs beneath her and crossed at once to macfinn her chest heaving her eyes vague and distant macfinn she said macfinn youve killed him she snarled and her eyes snapped up to mine bright and burning with amber anger i could have sworn i saw her face start to change her bared teeth begin to grow into fangs maybe that was just the effect of the magic on my perceptions though or a primitive lizardbrain sort of reaction to tera rising to her feet and charging toward me with a howl there was murder in her eyes i hadnt gotten beaten up twice shot and nearly strangled to get taken out by a misguided werewolf bitch i gathered in my dizzy spinning will and extended my good hand toward the charging woman flicking my wrist in a circle vento giostrus i trumpeted the winds howled down from the trees and whipped into a savage circle of moving air lifting up dried leaves sticks and small stones the miniature cyclone picked the charging tera up off the ground and hurled her a good twenty feet through the air into the branches of a pine tree it also hurled out a cloud of rocks and small debris forcing me to seek shelter behind a tree trunk how embarrassing it was a little more wind than i had wanted thats the danger of evocation of that instantaneous kablowie sort of magic control can be somewhat tricky all i had wanted was something to spin tera around and then to plop her down on her ass instead rocks hammered against the tree trunk and zipped by rattling against the trees all around in an almost deafening clatter the wind shook the trees tore branches from them and cast half a ton of dirt and dust into the air in a choking cloud the wind died after about half a minute leaving me choking and coughing on dust and dirt i peered around the edge of my tree to see what i could see the trees had been cleaned of their autumn colors in a fiftyfootwide circle leaving only stark branches behind where the bark had been brittle or dry the cyclone had torn it from the trees leaving pale gleaming wood flesh visible the leaves on the ground were gone as well as were six or eight inches of topsoilwind erosion gone berserk a few stones newly naked could be seen in the torn earth as could the roots of some of the trees and a number of startled worms macfinn was sitting up evidently recovered from the jolt id given him his face was pasty and stunned as he looked around him his chest rose and fell in uneven jerks there was a rustle and then i caught sight of tera west tumbling to the ground from the branches of the pine tree she landed with a thump and sat there coughing and staring her mouth hanging open in surprise she blinked at me and nervously scooted a few inches backward over the ground see there i wheezed raising a hand and pointing at macfinn hes breathing hell be all right my mind was still spinning from my unshielded magic attack on macfinn i caught the strong scent of wildflowers and stagnant water and felt what i was sure were the scales of a snake slithering across the palms of my hands while something with wings and glittering multifaceted eyes hovered at the edge of my vision vanishing whenever i tried to look at it i tried to shove everything that didnt make sense out of my way to ignore it but it was difficult to sort the false impressions from the ones that were in front of me tera rose and made her way toward the fallen man she knelt down over macfinn and wrapped her arms around him i closed my eyes and wheezed until my head began to slow down a little i focused on all the pain that was lurking in the midst of the confusion pain in my shoulder my throat my jaw gave me a concrete foundation a place that i knew was stable if unpleasant i fastened on it concentrated until i began to get less woozy once the pain returned in force i wasnt sure i wanted to be less woozy but i opened my eyes anyway macfinn had his arms around teras shoulders and she was kissing him as if she were trying to inhale him i felt vaguely voyeuristic ahem i said maybe we should get somewhere out of the open they disengaged slowly and tera helped macfinn to rise to his full impressive height he made her look like a slip of a girl but he leaned against her a little as he stood he studied me and i kept my eyes away from his i didnt want to see what was inside of him kims dead macfinn said isnt she it wasnt a question but i nodded yeah last night the big man shuddered and closed his eyes dammit he whispered dammit all there was nothing you could do tera said her voice low she knew the risks and you must be harry dresden macfinn said he glanced at the burns on his wrist where my magic had taken him sorry about that i didnt see tera with you i didnt know who you were i shrugged dont worry about it but can we get out of the open last thing we need is a couple of runners or bikers to come back and report us to the police macfinn nodded at me all right lets go tera gave me a last wary look and then turned with macfinn to help him farther back into the woods i followed them macfinns camp turned out to be hidden in the overhang of a bank of earth heavily laced with the roots of the ancient trees above it that held it in place and kept it from simply spilling into a mound of mud there was a small fire built at the back of the shelter the bank afforded well shielded from sight macfinn made his way to the fire and settled down before it twilight would cast the sheltered camp into deep darkness but for now it was only shady and out of the wind the fire had made the place warm comfortable it didnt feel like we were within fifteen miles of the third largest city in the country tera settled down beside macfinn her manner restless i remained standing though the throbbing in my arm made me wish i was lying down in a bed somewhere instead of huddling in the middle of a small but genuine forest all right macfinn i said you want my help and i want to keep more people from being hurt but i need some things from you he peered up at me his green eyes calculating i am hardly in a position to bargain mr dresden what you need i will give you i nodded answers ive got about a million questions dark will come in less than two hours moonrise is only slightly more than an hour after that we dont have much time for questions time enough i assured him why did you come here i woke up about five miles from here this morning macfinn said looking away from me as he did staring at the fire ive got several stashes hidden around the city just in case this is one of the older ones the damp had gotten to the clothes and all i had was these he gestured at the jean shorts do you remember what you did the words had an edge to them but at least i didnt say do you remember murdering kim delaney who says i cant be diplomatic macfinn shuddered pieces he said just pieces he looked at me and said i didnt mean to hurt her i swear to you then why is she dead the words came out flat cool tera glared at me but i watched macfinn for his answer the curse he said quietly when it happens when i changehave you ever been angry mr dresden so angry that you lost control that nothing else mattered to you but acting on your anger once i said maybe you can understand part of it then macfinn said it comes on me and theres nothing left but the need to hurt something to act on the rage i tried to tell kim that the circle wasnt working that she had to get out but she wouldnt listen i heard the frustration in his voice and his hands clenched into fists she wouldnt listen to me it frustrated you i said and when you changed he nodded its how i came back from nam everyone else in my platoon died but me i knew the full moon was coming and i knew that i hated them hated the soldiers who had killed my friends when i changed i started killing until there wasnt anyone left alive within maybe two miles i stared at macfinn for a long moment i believed that he was telling me the truth that he didnt have much control if any over his actions when he transformed though it occurred to me that if he wanted someone dead he could probably point his monsterself in the right direction before he lost control note to self do not cut macfinn off in traffic all right i said why come here why to wolf woods why not to one of the other stashes he smirked at the flames where else would a werewolf run mr dresden someplace a little less freaking obvious i shot back macfinn shook his head the fbi doesnt believe in werewolves they arent going to make the connection maybe i conceded but there are smarter people than the fbi looking for you now i dont think we should stay here for long macfinn glanced at me and then around him as though listening for pursuers you might be right he admitted but im not going anywhere until my head stops spinning you dont look so good either ill make it i said all right then how did you know kim delaney from her activist functions i assume macfinns face went pale at the mention of her name but he nodded originally we came to know of her talents about a year ago she told us how you were helping her control her abilities she was helping me indirectly with the northwest passage project then last month i asked her for her help why did you do that macfinn glanced warily at tera and then back at me someone broke my circle i hunkered down on my heels resting my aching arm on my knees someone broke your circle the one in the basement yes macfinn said i dont know who im not at home a lot we found it broken when we went downstairs before moonrise last month and you asked kim to fix it macfinn closed his eyes and nodded she said she could she told us she would be able to make a new circle one that would keep me from i chewed on my lip as his voice trailed off last month you were meeting with marcones business partner right negotiations over the project i didnt kill him macfinn said quickly he died the night after the full moon i couldnt have made the change and done it then and the other two nights i made sure i was well away from human beings i didnt kill anyone the second two nights either i was alone your fiancée could have done those killings i said and flicked a glance at tera west she glared at my eyes for a moment and then looked away she didnt macfinn said his tone cool lets go back a bit i said someone messed up your circle to do that they would have had to know about your curse right and they would have had to get into your house so the question is who could do those things and then the question is who would have done it and why macfinn shook his head i dont know he said i just dont i dont have much contact with the supernatural mr dresden i keep my head down i dont know anyone else who can make the change except for her he put his hand over that of the woman beside him a suspicion took root in my mind someplace dark and sneaky i studied tera as i spoke to macfinn you want to hear a theory i said i didnt wait for him to answer presuming youre telling the truth i figure someone else did the killings the night before the full moon last month some gangsters in town then they made sure that you would be the one going berserk the next three nights by fucking up your circle why would they do that macfinn asked to set you up they kill some people maybe just for kicks maybe for a good reason and then they lay the blame at your feet someone like me or the white council comes poking around and they go straight to you youre notorious like a convicted felon they find you over the body with a bloody knife metaphorically speaking and youre the one to burn at the stake literally macfinn studied my face for a moment or you think that there might be another reason i shrugged maybe you are the killer you could be trying to make it look like someone is setting you up to me and the council the police cant prove shit against you under the mundane justice system and using this deception clears you with the supernatural community so you moan and pose and say woe is me i am only the poor cursed guy and meanwhile a bunch of people end up dead people who were standing in the way of your completing the northwest passage project macfinn showed me his teeth you think the world wouldnt be better off without people like marcone and his lickspittles good word lickspittles i replied keeping my voice bland that doesnt really concern me right now macfinn men like marcone know the risks and take their chances what bothers me is that a bunch of other people are getting dead and they dont really deserve it why would i be killing innocents macfinn demanded his voice growing tight clipped innocents like kim i said im a wizard not a saint im allowed to be vindictive macfinn went pale and looked down maybe youre doing it as a smoke screen maybe you cant help it or hell maybe you really are just a poor cursed guy and someones using you like a puppet theres no way for me to tell right now assuming im not lying macfinn grated who would have an interest in setting me up i shook my head thats the milliondollar question id say that it was johnny marconehe stands to benefit if you cant oppose his business interests in the northwest as i understand it the northwest passage would pretty much put nails in the coffin of a lot of industry up in that direction macfinn nodded grimly it would so that gives him a good motive but how did he know about your curse and how did he pull off ruining the circle it doesnt sound like him he would just have your brakes fail or maybe arrange for you to meet a couple of big men in a dark alley its just his way i shrugged who else would be doing it can you think of anyone macfinn shook his head ive always been lucky been able to hold myself in lock myself up or been able to go far away out into the wilds where no one would find me so that when i changed no one would be killed thats why you were backing the northwest passage i guessed a place for you to go in safety when the full moon comesa really big nopeople zone macfinn glanced aside at tera who was staring stoically into the distance that and other reasons his jaw tightened and he looked back to the fire you dont know what its like mr dresden to live with yourself i rubbed at my mouth and chin with my good hand i needed a shave i studied macfinn and tera for a moment trying to make up my mind was macfinn telling me the truth was he just a victim someone being used by a faceless villain still at large or was he lying to me if he was lying if all of this had been his design what purpose would he have had in luring me out here killing me of course getting rid of the only wizard who could pen up his monstrous form that was after all exactly what he would have done if i hadnt have been able to shock him silly but did that even make sense what would he gain by removing me if i never stood in his way in the first place careful harry dont get too paranoid not everyone is planning and plotting and lying but i had to wonder about tera west a nasty scenario was laying itself out in my mind what if the dear sweet fiancée was tired of hubby what if she had done the before and aftermoon killings then set up her sweetiekins to take the fall for her she could get rid of macfinn and marcones partner all in one fell swoop leaving her and marcone alive marcone could have found out about macfinn from tera and about the weakness of his circle from tera as well tera wasnt human not even a little she was something else maybe a being of the nevernever who knew how her mind worked and then there was the group of young people tera seemed to be in charge of how did they fit into this what was she using them for i went fishing how are georgia and billy tera i asked my tone conversational she blinked her mouth worked for a second and then she answered fine they are well she pressed her lips together clearly desiring the conversation to end i watched macfinn his face registered confusion and then he looked between tera and me uneasily he didnt know who the hell i was talking about and she didnt seem to want to let macfinn in on what was apparently a secret aha little miss werewolfshapeshifterthing what are you plotting i was going to press her harder when macfinn and tera both looked up at exactly the same time out toward the woods i stared at them like a moron for a couple of seconds my mind still running along trails of thought tracing potential lies possibilities then i shook that out of my brain and listened both of you along that way murphy said from somewhere in the distance downslope ron take your three and fan out until were even with the feds then we sweep west up the hill christ murphy carmichael said we dont owe the feds shit if theyd have showed up on time wed have been out here hours ago if we hadnt got that report about the west woman in the hotel room we still wouldnt be here can it carmichael murphy snapped pictures of macfinn and the woman have been passed out and you all know what dresden looks like spread out and nab them you dont even know if theyre here carmichael protested ill bet you sex to donuts that they are carmichael murphy said her voice dripping sweet venom and that should tell you how certain i am carmichael muttered something under his breath and then growled orders to his men to fan out as murphy had indicated dammit macfinn snarled how did they know i was here where else would a werewolf go to hide i sniped shit how do we get out wind tera said she and macfinn both came to their feet or fog can you do one of those again i grimaced and shook my head i dont think so im worn out id probably make a mistake and that could kill someone if you dont tera said we will all be captured or killed you cant solve all your problems by magic i snapped hes right macfinn said quietly we split up the first one discovered makes a lot of noise puts up a fight and gives the others a chance to get away no i said macfinn youve got to stay with me i can make the circle with some sticks and dirt if necessary but if im not there i cant hold you in when the curse takes hold later tonight macfinns teeth showed again no time to argue mr dresden he said indeed there is not said tera and then she took off at a dead run macfinn hissed a curse and grabbed for her as she ran but missed tera flew on into the woods rushing silently down the slope on an angle that would take her past the edge of the pursuers line she was noticed after only a few steps shouts going up from three or four throats bitch macfinn cursed and he started after her i seized his arm my fingers clamping on his bicep hard enough to make him stop and stare at me his green eyes fierce and wild split up i said looking back down the hill if were lucky they wont even know that we were here but tera knows what shes doing i said if the police nail us theres no way youre going to be able to hold it in tonight we go now and we meet at the nearest gas station to the park all right from down slope came the sounds of running men a warning call and then a gunshot for teras sake i hoped that agent benn wasnt down there macfinn clenched his jaw and then ran up the slope on an angle down below us there were more shouts more shots fired and a short sharp cry of pain call me crazy but those sounds added to all the other things that had happened that day were just too much for me to handle i turned cradling my wounded arm against me and stumbled up the hill into a long loping run i kept my head down watching my feet only looking up often enough to make sure that i didnt run into a tree and fled chapter i made it out of the park exhausted and barely able to keep from screaming with pain i stopped at the first gas station i could find so i could take off my boots old and comfortable as they were cowboy boots were not meant for running crosscountry i leaned against the side of the building by the pay phones away from the street and sat down on the sidewalk my body throbbed with pain slowing as my heart and breathing did i gave macfinn an hour but he didnt show up no one did i got restless fast could both macfinn and tera west have been captured murphys cops may not have looked like much but i knew they were tough and smart it wasnt out of the realm of possibility i rummaged in my dusters pockets came up with enough change to make a phone call then made my painful way to the phone midwestern arcane this is ms rodriguez susan said when she picked up the phone her voice sounded tired stressed hi susan i said my shoulder twinged and i gritted my teeth pulling my duster around me a little more tightly the evening was bringing a cold wind and grey clouds and the sweats and cotton tshirt tera west had given me werent enough to keep out the chill harry she said disbelievingly my god where are you the police are looking for you they keep calling here something about a murder misunderstanding i said and leaned against the wall the pain was getting worse as chills soaked in and i started to shiver you sound terrible susan said are you all right can you help me there was a pause on the other end of the line i dont know harry i dont know whats going on i dont want to get into any trouble i could explain it i offered struggling to keep my words clear through the pain but its sort of a long story i dropped a subtle emphasis on that last word sometimes it scares me how easy it is to get people to do what you want them to do if you know something about them story eh susan said i could hear the sudden twinge of interest in her voice sure murder violence blood monsters give you the whole scoop if you can give me a ride you bastard she breathed but i thought she was smiling i would have come to get you anyway sure you would have i said but i felt a smile on my own lips i told her the address of the gas station and hoped that the feds hadnt taken the time to get a wiretap for susans phone give me half an hour susan said maybe more depending on traffic i squinted up at the sky which was rapidly darkening both with oncoming dusk and heavy brooding clouds times important hurry if you can just take care of yourself harry she said worry in her voice then she hung up the phone i did too and leaned back against the wall i hated to draw susan into this it made me feel cheap somehow weak it was that whole problem with chivalry that i had i didnt want a girl to be riding to my rescue protecting me it just didnt seem right and i didnt want to endanger susan either i was a murder suspect and the police were looking for me she could get in trouble for aiding and abetting or something like that on the other hand i didnt have much choice i didnt have any money for a cab even if i could get one this far from the city i didnt have a car i was in no shape to walk anywhere my contacts in the persons of macfinn and tera west were gone i had to have help and susan was the only one i thought i could trust to do it if there was a story involved shed go to hell itself to get it and i had used that against her to lever her into helping me i didnt like it that i had id thought better of myself i ducked my head against the cold and shivered and wondered if id done the right thing it was while i was leaning against the wall waiting that i heard a scrabbling sound around the corner of the gas station i tensed and waited the sound repeated itself a definite pattern of three short movements a signal warily i made my way to the back of the building ready to turn and run as best i could tera west was there behind the building crouched down between several empty cardboard boxes that smelled of beer and the garbage bin she was naked her body a uniform shade of brown without an ounce of excess fat on her her hair was mussed and had leaves and bits of twig caught in it her amber eyes looked even more alien and wild than usual she rose and came toward me evidently unconscious of the cold she moved with a feral sort of grace that made me all too aware of her legs and her hips even though i was battered fatigued and brooding wizard she greeted me give me your coat i snapped my eyes back up to hers then slipped out of my duster though my shoulder screamed with pain as i pulled the coat off of it and my body sent up an entirely different round of complaints as the cold wind gleefully cut through the thin clothes i wore beneath the duster tera took the coat and slid into it wrapping it around her and buttoning it closed the sleeves were too long and the coat dangled to her ankles but it covered her lean strong body well enough i found myself faintly regretful that id had it with me what happened i asked her she shook her head the police do not know how game runs or how to chase it one grabbed me i made him let go she glanced around us warily and raked her fingers through her hair trying to comb out leaves and sticks i led them away from you and macfinn changed and made my way back to the camp i followed macfinns trail where is he she bared her teeth the federal people caught him they took him away hells bells i breathed do you know where into a car she responded no i said growing frustrated do you know where the car went she shook her head but they had an argument with the one called murphy murphy had more people with her more guns macfinn went where murphy wanted him to go downtown i said murphy would want him in holding down at the station hell its on the same floor as special investigations tera shrugged her expression hard as you say we dont have much time i said for what there is nothing more to be done we cannot reach him now macfinn will change when the moon rises murphy and the police people will die like hell i said ive got to get to the station before it happens tera studied me with narrowed eyes the police are hunting for you as well wizard if you go there you too will be locked in a cage you will not be allowed to go to macfinn i wasnt planning on asking permission i said but i think i can get inside i just have to get to my apartment the police will be watching it tera said they will be waiting for you there and in any case we have no car and no money how will you reach chicago before moonrise there is nothing more to be done wizard there came the crunch of tires around the side of the gas station and i peeked around the corner susans car was just coming to a halt raindrops were starting to come down and to make little impact circles on her tauruss windshield i felt a little surge of defiant energy theres our ride i said follow i relished throwing the terse command at tera and she stared at me i turned my back on her and stalked over to the car susan leaned across and threw open the passenger door then blinked at me in surprise she blinked again when tera slipped in front of me threw the passenger seat forward and slid into the backseat with a flash of long lean legs then regarded susan with unreadable distant eyes i pushed the seat back and settled into place it was a real effort to shut the door and a small sound of discomfort escaped my mouth when i looked at susan she was staring at me and at my arm i looked down and found that the bandage and a part of the tshirts sleeve were soaked through with blood the purple bruises had spread a few inches it seemed and showed beneath the shirts sleeve good lord susan gasped what happened i got shot i said doesnt it hurt susan stammered still stunned is this female always so stupid tera asked i winced susan turned in the seat and glowered at tera and i looked back to see tera narrow her eyes and bare her teeth in what one could hardly say was a smile it hurts i confirmed susan take us to my place but dont stop when you get there just drive past slowly ill tell you everything on the way susan gave tera one last skeptical glance particularly taking in my bullettorn duster and teras bare limbs this better be good dresden she said then she slapped the car into gear and started driving with irritated haste back toward the city i wanted to collapse into sleep but i made myself explain most of what had happened over the past couple of days to susan editing out mentions of the white council demons that sort of thing susan listened and drove and asked intent questions fastening gleefully on to the information concerning the northwest passage project and johnny marcones links to the businesses opposing it rain started coming down in a steady murky veil and she flicked on the windshield wipers so youve got to get to macfinn susan said when i was finished before the moon comes up and he transforms youve got it i said why dont you call murphy tell her whats going on i shook my head murphy isnt going to be in the mood to listen she busted me and i fled arrest shed have me in a cell before i could say abracadabra but its raining susan protested we wont be able to see the moon tonight wont that stop macfinn from changing i blinked at the question and glanced back at tera she was watching the buildings pass out the side window as the streetlights started flickering on she didnt look at me but shook her head no such luck i told susan and with these clouds i cant even tell if the sun has gone down yet much less how much time we have before moonrise susan breathed out slowly how are you going to get to macfinn then ive got a couple things at my apartment i said drive on by lets see if theres anyone watching the old place susan turned the car down my street and we rolled slowly through the rain the old boarding house huddled stoically beneath the downpour its gutters gurgling and spouting streams of water the streetlights glowed with silver haloes as the rain came down a bit down from my building a plain brown sedan was parked and a couple of shadowy forms could be seen inside it when susan drove past thats them i said i recognize one of them from murphys unit susan let out another breath and drew the car around the corner parking it along the street is there any way to sneak into your place a back door i shook my head no theres only the one door in and you can see the windows from here i just need the police to not be looking for a few minutes you need a distraction tera said i will do it i looked over my shoulder i dont want any violence she tilted her head to one side her expression never changing very well she said for macfinns sake i will do as you say open the door i stared at her fathomless eyes for a second searching for any signs of deception or betrayal what if tera was the killer she had known about macfinn and was able to transform in one fashion or another she could have committed the murders last month as well as the one two nights past but if so why had she seemingly sacrificed herself so that macfinn and i could escape why had she come to find me then again macfinn had been captured and her words at the gas station may have been calculated to make me give up trying to help him if one looked at them from a certain point of view what if she was trying to take care of both macfinn and me by throwing us to the mundane legal system my head spun with pain and weariness paranoid harry i told myself youve got to trust someone somewhereor else macfinn goes furry and murphy and a lot of other good people die tonight there wasnt much choice i opened the door and we both got out of the car what are you going to do i asked tera instead of answering the ambereyed woman stripped off my duster and handed it back to me leaving herself nude and lovely under the rain do you like to look at my body she demanded of me careful how you answer this one buster susan growled from the car i coughed and glanced back at susan keeping my eyes off of the other woman yeah tera that will work fine i guess wait for twenty slow breaths she said there was a note of amusement in her voice pick me up at the far end of this block then she turned on a bare heel and glided into the darkness between streetlights in a graceful lope i frowned after her for a moment and then drew my duster back on you dont have to look quite so hard susan said is she the humaninterest angle for this story i winced holding my wounded arm close to my side and leaned down to meet susans eyes i dont think shes human i said then i stood and started walking down the street slowing my steps so that i didnt round the corner until teras prescribed time limit had elapsed even when i did i walked quickly like someone hurrying home out of the rain my hands in my pockets keeping my head down against the grey downpour i crossed the street toward my apartment building glancing at the sedan as i did the cops werent watching me they were staring at the pool of light beneath the streetlight behind them where tera spun gracefully through the steps of some sort of gliding dance moving to a rhythm and a music i could not hear there was a primal sort of intensity to her motions raw sexuality feminine power coursing through her movements her back arched as she spun and whirled offering out her breasts to the chill rain and her skin was slick and gleaming with water i tripped over the curb on the far side of the street and felt my cheeks start to flame as i hurried down the steps to my apartment i unlocked the door and went inside shutting it behind me i didnt light any candles relying upon my knowledge of the house to move around the two potions were in their plastic sports bottles on the counter where i had left them i grabbed up my black nylon backpack from the floor and threw the bottles into it then i went into my bedroom and grabbed the blue coveralls with the little red patch over one breast pocket stenciled with mike in bold letters my mechanic had accidentally left them in the trunk of the blue beetle the last time the beetle was in the shop i added a baseball cap a first aid kit a roll of duct tape a box of chalk seven smooth stones from a collection of them i keep in my closet a white tshirt and a pair of blue jeans and a huge bottle of tylenol zipped up the backpack and headed back out again at the last moment i took up my wizards staff from the corner by the door something flashed past my legs moving out into the night and i almost jumped out of my skin mister paused at the top of the stairs to look back at me his cat eyes enigmatic and irritated and then vanished into the darkness i muttered something under my breath and locked the door behind me then headed out once more my heart rattling along too quickly to be comfortable tera was on her hands and knees in the middle of the pool of light behind the sedan her damp hair fallen all around her face her lips parted facing the two plainclothes officers who had gotten out of the car and were speaking to her from several feet away her chest was heaving in and out but having seen her in action i doubted that it was merely from the exertion of her dancing looked nice though the policemen were sure as hell staring i gripped my staff in hand along with the backpack and walked away down the street again it didnt take long to make it back to susans car and she immediately wheeled the vehicle around the block without comment susan hardly had begun to slow down when tera appeared from between a couple of buildings and loped over to the car i leaned forward opened the door and she got into the backseat i threw her the extra clothes i had picked up and she began to dress without comment it worked i said we did it of course it worked tera said men are foolish they will stare at anything female and naked shes got that right susan said under her breath and jerked the car into motion again oh we are going to talk about this one mister next stop special investigations outside the battered old policebuilding downtown i pulled the baseball cap a little lower over my eyes and drank the blending potion it didnt really have any taste to it at all but it twitched and bubbled all the way down my gullet until it hit my stomach i gave the potion a few seconds to work and shifted my hands on the handle of my wizards staff even though the end of it was shoved into a wheeled bucket it still didnt look much like the handle of a mop and even though i was dressed in the dark blue coveralls they were ridiculously short on me i did not look much like a janitor thats where the magic came in if the potion worked i would look like background to any casual observers a part of the scenery that they wouldnt glance at twice so long as they didnt give me an intense scrutiny the potions power should be able to keep me from being noticed which would let me get close to macfinn which would let me put the containment circle around him and keep his transformed self from going on a rampage of course if it didnt work i might just end up studying the inside of a jail cell for a few yearsprovided the transformed macfinn didnt tear me apart first i tried to ignore the pain in my shoulder the nervous tension in my stomach i was rebandaged tylenoled and as reasonably refreshed as i could possibly have been without drinking the potion i had brewed just for that purpose if i could have had both potions going in my system without them making me too ill to move i would have downed the refresher potion the moment i got my hands on it but without the blending potion there was no way i could get inside to macfinn i could only hope that id find a use for it eventually id hate the effort to go to waste i waited impatiently in the rain sure for a moment that i had messed something up when making the potion that it wasnt going to have any effect at all and then i felt it start to work a sort of grey feeling came over me and i realized with a start that the colors were fading from my vision a sort of listless feeling came over me a lassitude that advised me to sit down somewhere and watch the world go by but at the same time the hairs on the back of my neck prickled up as the potions magic took effect i took a deep breath and walked up the stairs of the building with my bucket and my mop pulled open the doors and went inside shadows shifted and changed oddly all greys and blacks and whites and for a second i felt like an extra on the set of casablanca or the maltese falcon the solid old matron of a sergeant sat at the front desk thumbing through a glossy magazine a portrait done in colorless hues she glanced up at me for a second and tinges of color returned to her uniform her cheeks and her eyes she looked me over casually sniffed and lowered her face to her magazine again as her attention faded so did the colors from her clothing and skin my perceptions of her changed as she paid attention to me or did not i felt my face stretch in a victorious smile the potion had worked i was inside i had to suppress an urge to break into a softshoe routine sometimes being able to use magic was so cool i almost stopped hurting for a few seconds from sheer enjoyment of the special effects i would have to remember to tell bob how much i liked the way this potion worked i kept my head down and moved past the desk sergeant just one more janitor coming in to clean up the police station after hours i picked up the bucket and my mop and went up the stairs toward the holding cells and the special investigations offices on the fifth floor one cop passed me on the stairs and didnt so much as look at me his uniform and skin remained entirely devoid of color i grew more confident and moved with more speed i was effectively invisible now all i had to do was find macfinn trick my way into seeing him and save murphy and all the other police from the monster macfinn would becomebefore they arrested me for trying to do it and time was running out chapter ever wish you had an almanac i did that night i had no idea what time the moon was supposed to rise and i hadnt exactly had time to run to the library or a bookstore i knew that it was supposed to happen an hour or so after sundown but the way the clouds rolled in had made it uncertain exactly when sundown had happened did i have twenty minutes ten an hour or was i already too late as i climbed the stairs i thought about being alone in the building with macfinn after he had changed for all my vaunted wizards knowledge i had no real idea of his capabilities although after seeing kims body i had something of an idea of what he could do bob had said that loupgarou were fast strong virtually immune to magic what could i do against something like that i just had to pray that i would be able to get the circle up around macfinn before i had to find out i checked the bucket to make sure i still had the chalk and the stones i would need to construct the greater circle around macfinn you didnt necessarily have to make them out of silver and gold and whatnot mostly you just had to understand how the construct channeled the forces that were being employed if you knew that you could figure out how to make it out of less pure materials the very best wizards dont need much more than chalk table salt and a wooden spoon to pull off some remarkable stuff my thoughts were rambling now panic making them scamper around like a frightened chipmunk that was bad i needed focus direction concentration i drove my legs a little harder went up the stairs as fast as i dared until i came out on the fifth floor the door to special investigations was ten feet away down the hall the holding cells were down the hall and around the corner and i started that way at once what do you mean you cant find him murphys voice demanded as i walked past the office door just that the men on his apartment said that they kept a real good eye on the place but that he got in and out again without them seeing anything carmichaels voice was tired frustrated murphy snorted christ carmichael is dresden going to have to walk right into the office before you can find him i hurried on past the door and down the hall tempting as it was to listen to a conversation about myself without the participants knowing i just didnt have time i wheeled my wobbling squeaking bucket down the hall half jogging in my hurry holding was set up unsurprisingly behind bars there was a swinging barred door that the station guard had to buzz to open if you didnt have the key beyond that was a sort of antechamber with a couple of wooden chairs and not much else besides a counter with a window made of bulletproof glass the jailer sat behind the glass at his desk his expression baggy eyed and bored past the jailers window was another door made of steel with a tiny little window which led into the row of cells the jailer had the controls to that door at his desk as well i went to the first barred door kept my head down and rapped on the metal slats i waited for a while but nothing happened so i rapped on the bars again it occurred to me that it would add a nice touch of irony if the same blending potion that got me into the building also kept me from being noticed by the jailer and let inside i rapped on the bars again harder this time with the shaft of my wooden mop it took some determined rapping to get him to look up from his magazine but he finally did and peered at me through thick glasses his colors swirled and gained a bit of tint before settling back toward grey he frowned at me glanced back at a calendar on the wall and then pushed the button the barred door buzzed and i shoved it open with my bucket wheeling inside with my head down youre early this week the jailer said his eyes back on the magazine out of town on friday trying to get done sooner i replied i kept my voice in a monotone as grey and boring as i could manage to my surprise it came out as i intended it im usually not much of a liar or an actor so the potion must have been helping me on some subtle and devious level one thing ill say for bob hes annoying as hell but he knows his stuff whatever sign here the jailer said in a bored tone and shoved a clipboard and a pen at me through a slot at the base of the plexiglas window he turned a page in his magazine showing me a picture of an athleticlooking young woman doing something anatomically improbable with an equally improbable young man i hesitated how in the hell was i supposed to sign in and out i mean bobs potion may have been good but it wasnt going to change a signature after id put it on the paper i glanced at the inner door and then at the clock on the wall to hell with it i didnt have time to hang around i went over to the counter and scribbled something unreadable on the admissions sheet have any trouble tonight i asked the jailer snorted turning his magazine to the right by ninety degrees just that rich guy they brought in earlier he was yelling for a while but hes shut up now probably coming down off of whatever he was on he collected the clipboard gave it a perfunctory glance and hung it back up on its peg beside a bank of blackandwhite monitors i leaned closer to the monitors sweeping my eyes over them each was apparently receiving a signal from a security camera because each one of them displayed a scene that was exactly the same except for the actors in ita small cell maybe eight feet by eight with bars serving as one wall smooth concrete for the other three a bunk a toilet and a single door maybe two thirds of the monitors had a strip of masking tape stuck to the lower righthand corner of the screen with a name like hanson or washington written in black marker i frantically scanned the bank of monitors until in the lower corner i found the one that said macfinn i looked at his monitor the video was blurred flecked with snow and static but i could see well enough what had happened the cell was empty concrete dust drifted in the air the wall of bars was missing apparently torn from the concrete and allowed to fall away i could see the scraps of macfinns denim shorts lying on the floor of the cell hells bells i swore softly there was a flicker of motion on another monitor the one next to macfinns the tape at the bottom of the screen read matson and a starvedlooking unshaven man in a sleeveless white undershirt and blue jeans could be seen curled up on the bunk his back pressed to the rear corner of the cell his mouth was open and his chest straining as though he was screaming but i could hear nothing through the thick security door and the concrete walls there was a flicker of motion a huge and furry shape on the camera out of focus and matson threw up his skinny arms to protect himself as something huge and quick shoved its way between the bars like a big dog going through a rotten picket fence and engulfed him there was a burst of static and violent motion and then a spattering of black on the grey walls and floor of the cell as though someone had shaken up a cola and sprayed the walls with it then the huge form was gone and left behind was a ragged quivering doll of torn flesh and bloodsoaked clothing matson stared up at the security camera his dying eyes pleading with mineand then he jerked once and was gone the entire thing had taken perhaps three or four seconds my eyes swept over the other security monitors as a sick sort of fascination settled over me prisoners were straining to the front of their cells shouting things out trying to get enough of a look to see what was going on i realized that they couldnt see what was happeningthey could only hear they wouldnt be able to look out and see the transformed macfinn until he was at the bars of their cell fear sick and horrible and debilitating swam over me and tangled up my tongue the creature had gone through the bars of the cell as though theyd been made of cheap plastic and it had killed without mercy i stared at matsons dead eyes at the ruined mess of what had been his guts at the detached pieces of meat and bone that had once been his right arm and leg stars above harry i thought to myself what the hell are you doing in the same building with that thing on another monitor there was a replay of what had happened seconds before and an aging black man named clement went down beneath the creature screaming as he died seeing what was happening set off some primal ancient fear something programmed into my head a fear of being found in my hiding place of being trapped in a tiny space from which there was no escape while something with killing teeth and crushing jaws came in to eat me that same primitive naked part of me screamed and gibbered and shouted at my rational mind to turn around right now to turn around and run fast and far but i couldnt let it go on i had to do something look i said and pointed at the monitor my finger trembled and my voice came out as a ghost of a whisper i tried again jabbing my finger at the monitors and half shouting look at the jailer he glanced up at me tilted his head and frowned i saw some colors start to bleed into his face but that didnt matter now i continued to point at the monitors and tried to step closer to them look look at the screens my god man by now my voice was coming out in a high panicky tone i pressed as close to the monitors as i could yelling excited i should have known better of course wizards and technology simply do not mixespecially when the wizards heart is pounding like the floor of a basketball court and his guts are shaking the monitors burst into frantic displays of static and snow flickering images sometimes visible sometimes not the guard gave me a disgusted look and turned around to glance at the monitors he blinked at them for a second while a man named murdoch died in flickering poor reception what the hell is wrong with those things now the jailer complained and took off his glasses to clean them theres always something going wrong with the damn cameras i swear it isnt worth the money they cost to keep on fixing them i frantically backed up from the monitors theyre dying i said god youve got to let those men out of there before it kills them the man nodded uhhuh tell me about it just goes to show you how smart the city is right i stared at him for a second and he put his glasses back on to give me a polite bored smile his colors had gone back to black and white and i must have looked like a dull humdrum old janitor to him once again the potion had blended my words into something that the guards brain would accept without comment and let pass just boring everyday conversation like you have with people ninety percent of the time the potion was fantastic way way too good look at the monitors i screamed in frustration and fear hes killing them the monitors wont stop you doing your job the guard assured me ill just buzz you in and with that he pressed a button somewhere behind the plexiglas window and the security door that led into the hallway of cells made a humming sound clicked and swung three or four inches open screams poured out of the cells high sounds that you wouldnt think could come from a mans throat panicked and terrified there was a horrible wrenching sound a screech of protesting metal and one of the screams peaked at a shivering violent pointthen dissolved into a strangled mishmash of sounds of tearing and snapping and popping of gurgling and thudding and when they were finished something something big with a cavernous resonating chest snarled from not ten feet beyond the security door i shot a glance to the guard who had stumbled to his feet and was grabbing for his gun he headed out of his station opening a door that led into the antechamber presumably to investigate no i shouted at him and threw myself at the security door i sensed rather than saw something else on the other side of the wall heading for the exit i could hear its breath feel its massive motion through the air and i hurled my shoulder against the door slamming it forward just as something huge and strong thrust a paw through the doorway the edge of the steel security door slammed forward onto the paw a member that was neither wholly a paw nor a hand but somewhere in between tipped with huge black claws and drenched in wet dark blood i heard the creature on the far side of the door only three inches of steel away snarl in a fury and hatred so pure as to be painful to hear then it started shoving at the door the first shove was tentative but though i strained with all my strength it still slapped me back a foot across the floor my boots slipping on the tile that pawhand turned and the talons sank into the steel door in a sudden snapping motion as the thing took hold of it and started wrenching it back and forth in berserk anger help me i shouted at the guard struggling to force the door closed the jailer blinked at me for a second then flooded with color you he said my god what is happening help me close this door or were both dead i snarled continuing to push forward with every ounce of strength i could summon on the far side of the door the loupgarou gathered its weight and hurled itself against the door again just as the guard rushed forward to help me the door exploded inward throwing me back like a doll past the guard who stumbled back through the door that led behind the counter where hed been sitting and fell to the ground my upper back hit the barred door that led out into the hallway eliciting an instant flash of hot agony from my wounded shoulder there was a snarl and then the creature that had been harley macfinn came through the doorway the loupgarou was a wolf in the same way that a velociraptor is a birdsame basic design vastly different outcome it must have been five or five and a half feet tall at the tip of its hunched shoulders it was wider than a wolf as though a wolf had been squashed down with an extra five or six hundred pounds of muscle its pelt was shaggy jetblack and matte except where fresh blood was making it glisten its ears were ragged upright focused forward it had a muzzle that was too wide to belong to anything natural a mouthful of teeth and macfinns blazing eyes done in monochrome grey the whole stained with blood that looked black beneath the influence of the blending potion its limbs were disproportionate though i couldnt say whether they looked too long or too shortjust wrong everything about it was wrong screamed with malice and hate and anger and it carried a cloak of supernatural power with it that made my teeth hurt and my hair stand on end the loupgarou came through the door swept its monochrome gaze past me then turned to its left with unholy grace and flung itself at the jailer the man got lucky he looked up and saw the creature as he was regaining his feet then convulsed in a spastic reaction to the sight of the fanged horror the reaction threw him a few inches out of the loupgarous path he scrambled back behind the counter and out of my sight the loupgarou turned to pursue the jailer behind the counter slowed because it had to shoulder its way between the counter and the wall making the counter buckle outward into the room the jailer got to his feet gun in hand took a creditable shooting stance and emptied the pistols clip into the loupgarous skull in the space of maybe three seconds filling the little antechamber with the sound of thunder and drowning out the cries of the prisoners in their cells in the hall beyond the monster kept coming the bullets bothered it no more than a fly ramming the forehead of a professional wrestler it rose up as the guard screamed no no no nonononononono and then it fell upon him claws and fangs slashing the jailer tried to turn to run where there was no place left to go and the thing turned its head and sank its jaws into the small of the mans back releasing a spray of blood the jailer screamed and grabbed frantically at the console but the loupgarou shook its head violently from left to right tore him from the console and hurled him to the floor behind the counter i didnt see the guard die but i saw the way the blood flew up over the hunched gnarled shoulders of the loupgarou to decorate the walls and the ceiling i felt silently grateful when the bent and warping panes of plexiglas became obscured with scarlet it was sometime right around then as paralyzing agony seared through my shoulder and terrified prisoners screamed and cried out to god or allah to save them that i noticed that a new noise had been added to the din the guard had tipped off the alarm when he had scrambled at the console and it was hooting enthusiastically cops were going to come running and one of the first was going to be murphy the loupgarou was still savaging the jailers body and i hoped for his sake that the man wasnt still alive my best option would have been to slip into the cell block close the security door behind me and hope the creature went out into the building at large within the cell block i would have time to put up a warding barrier something that would keep the monster from coming through the door or the walls to get at me and the prisoners in there i could fort up there wait for morning and live through the night almost certainly it was the smart thing to do it was the survivable thing to do instead i turned to my staff at the other side of the little room and held forth my hand vento servitas i hissed forcing out tightly focused will and a sudden current of air simultaneously threw my staff to me and slammed shut the door to the cells giving the trapped prisoners what little protection it offered i caught the staff in my outstretched hand and turned to the barred gate that held me shut in the antechamber with the loupgarou i thrust my staff in between the bars and leaned against it as though to pry the bars apart had it been only wood and muscle involved i might have snapped the ancient ash but a wizards staff is a tool that helps him to apply forces to manipulate them and maneuver them to his will so i leaned my will and my concentration on the staff at the same time i did my body and worked on multiplying the force i was applying to the steel bars forzare i hissed forzare the metal began to strain and buckle behind me the loupgarou started thrashing around i heard the shattering of plexiglas and shot it a look over my shoulder the scant protection offered by the potion collapsed colors flooding my vision the black of its muzzle warmed to a scarletsmeared wash of dark brown stained with wet scarlet its fangs were ivory and crimson its eyes became a brilliant shade of green it cut through the blending potion with the ferocity of its stare and focused on me with an intensity that sent every instinct in my body screaming that death was here that it was about to jump down my throat and rip me inside out forzare i shouted shoving against the staff with every ounce of strength i had the bars bowed out in the middle parted to an opening perhaps a foot wide and twice as long the counter exploded outward as the loupgarou came through it showering me with debris and minor painful cuts i dove through the opening heedless of my shoulder conscious only of the beast closing in behind me my body sailed through with more grace than i could have managed under less panicked circumstances almost as though the rush of air moving before the charging creature had helped lift me through and then something closed on my left foot and i simply lost all sensation in it i fell short to the floor bumping my chin hard enough to draw blood from the corner of my tongue i looked over my shoulder to see the loupgarou with one of my boots held in its jaws its broad head shoved through the opening in the bars and caught there it was shaking its body back and forth but its paws were smeared with scarlet blood and its feet slipped left and right on the tile floor incredible strength or no it couldnt get the leverage it needed to tear the bars apart like tissues i heard myself making desperate animal sounds struggling in a panic writhing the alarm was howling all around me now and i could hear shouts and running footsteps dust was falling down around the edges of the bars and i could see that the loupgarou was slowly tearing them from their mountings in the floor and ceiling despite its bad footing i twisted my foot left and right horrid images of simply losing it at the ankle flashing in my mind and then abruptly shot forward several feet along the floor i glanced down at my leg and saw a bloodstained sock before i scrambled up and started running for my staff behind me the loupgarou howled in frustration and began to throw itself about it must have scraped enough of the blood off of its paws because it then tore through the wall of bars in two seconds flat and rushed after me i took up my staff and spun to face the creature planting my feet on the floor holding the ash wood before me tornarius i thundered thrusting my staff upward and the thing threw itself at me in a rush of power and mass my aim was to reflect the loupgarous own power and momentum back against it force equals mass times acceleration et cetera but i had underestimated just how much power the thing had it overloaded my limits and we split the difference the creature slammed against a solid force in the air that canceled its momentum and flung it to the floor approximately equal force was also applied to mebut i was probably a fifth of the mass of the loupgarou i was flung back through the air like a piece of popcorn in a sudden wind all the way to where the hall turned the corner to lead down to special investigations i hit the floor before i hit the wall thankfully bounced rolled and slapped into the wall at last grateful to be at a stop and aching all over i had lost my staff in the tumble the tile floor was cool against my cheek i watched the loupgarou recover itself focus its burning eyes on me and hurtle down the hallway i was in so much pain that i could appreciate the pure beauty of it the savage unearthly grace and speed with which it moved it was a perfect hunter a perfect killer fast and strong relentless and deadly it was no wonder that i had lost to such a magnificently dangerous being i hated to go but at least i hadnt gotten beaten by some scabby troll or whining angstridden vampire and i wasnt going to turn away from it either i drew in what was to be my last breath my eyes wide on the onrushing loupgarou so i could clearly see as murphy looked down at me with crystalblue eyes that saw right through the potions remaining effects she gave me a hard glance and placed herself between me and the onrushing monster in a shooters stance raising up her gun in a futile gesture of protection murphy i screamed and then the thing was on us chapter i tried to make my stunned body respond to get to my feet to unleash every ounce of magic at my command to protect murphy and to hell with the consequences i failed the loupgarou hurtled down the hallway moving faster than i could have believed something so massive could move its claws gouged into the tile floor like it was soft clay the walls shook around the beast as though its very presence was enough to make reality shudder bloodstained drool spilled from its foaming jaws and its green eyes blazed with hellish fury murphy standing at her full fivefeetandchange tall was shorter than the loupgarou its eyes on level with hers she was wearing jeans again hiking boots a flannel shirt rolled up past the elbows a bandana around her throat she was without makeup or jewelry her earlobes curiously naked and vulnerable without earrings her punky little haircut fell down around her eyes and as she raised her gun she thrust out her lower lip and puffed out a breath flipping her bangs up out of her vision she started shooting when the loupgarou was about thirty feet awayuseless the thing had laughed off bullets fired into its skull at pointblank range i noticed three things at that point first murphys gun was not the usual heavycaliber colt semiautomatic she carried it was smaller sleeker with a telescopic sight mounted at its rear second the gun made a sharp little bark bark bark rather than the more customary wham wham wham third when the first bullet hit the loupgarous chest blood flew and the creature faltered and buckled as though surprised when the second and third shots slammed into its front leg the limb slipped and went out from under it the loupgarou snarled and rolled its momentum to the side put its head down and simply smashed its way through the wall and into the room beyond murphy and i were left in the dustclouded hallway the escape alarm whooping plaintively in the background murphy dropped down next to me and i told aunt edna id never get any use out of those earrings she muttered christ dresden youre covered in blood how bad is it i felt her slip her hand inside an enormous tear in the blue jumpsuit that i hadnt seen before and run her palm over my chest and shoulders checking the arteries there youre under arrest by the way im okay im okay i panted when i could breathe what the hell happened how did you do that murphy rose up lifted the gun to half raised and stalked toward the hole the loupgarou had left in the wall we could hear crashing sounds heavy thumps and furious snarling somewhere on the other side you have the right to remain silent what do you think happened moron i read your report i make my own loads for competition shooting so i ran off a few silver bullets last night but theyre only in twentytwo caliber so im going to have to put one through his eye to take him out if that will do it twentytwo i complained still breathless couldnt you have made some thirtyeights some fortyfours bitch and whine murphy snarled at me you have the right to an attorney i dont make my loads for work and i didnt have the materials for it be happy with what you have i scrambled to my feet and leaned against the wall by the ragged hole there was the sound of running feet moving toward us down the hall i cant believe youre arresting me whats through that wall records archives murphy said leveling the target pistol at the hole a bunch of big old file cabinets and computers everyone who works there went home hours ago hows that thing react to tear gas send some in there and ill tell you i muttered and murphy shot me a dire look just stay down dresden until i can get you locked up somewhere safe and get a doctor to look at you murph listen to yourself were stuck in a building with one of the nastiest creatures around and youre still trying to arrest me get some perspective you made your bed jerk now lie in it murphy then raised her voice without turning her head from the hole in the wall carmichael down here i want four on the doors going out of records and the rest with me rudolph get down here and get dresden back to the office out of the way she glared at my wrists where the handcuffs shed put on me the night before still dangled christ dresden she added in a mutter what is it with you and my handcuffs police most of them plainclothes guys from special investigations came pouring into the hall some of them had pistols some of them had pumpaction riot guns my vision blurred and swirled between grey tones and technicolor and adrenaline made my nerves jangle and jerk the potion must have been wearing off most potions only lasted for a couple of minutes anyway i took inventory the loupgarous teeth had scored my foot through the boot it hurt and my sock was soaked in blood i would leave little red footprints on the floor when i started walking i could taste the blood in my mouth from where i had bitten into my tongue and i either had to spit or swallow i swallowed no comments please my back was mostly numb and what wasnt numb hurt like hell my wounded shoulder naturally was pounding so hard that i could barely stand bastard chewed up my good boot i muttered and for some reason the statement struck me as incredibly funny maybe i had just seen too much for the evening but whatever had caused it i sailed into panting wheezing gales of laughter carmichael dragged me back his round face was red with exertion and tension and his foodstained tie was loose around his throat he passed me into the custody of a young goodlooking detective who i didnt recognize he must have been the rookie at si i leaned against the young man and laughed helplessly take him back to the office rudolph carmichael said keep him there out of the way as soon as this is under control well get him to a doctor jesus christ rudolph said his eyes wide his short dark hair coated with drifting dust he had a tense panicky voice and in spite of his youth he was panting twice as heavily as the veteran carmichael you saw it on the security monitors right what that thing did to sergeant hampton carmichael grabbed rudolph by the front of his shirt and shook him listen up rook he said his voice harsh its still there and it can do it to us just as quick as to hampy shut your hole and do what i told you rright rudolph said he straightened and started jerking me back down the hall away from the records office who is this guy anyway carmichael glared at me hes the guy who knows if he comes to and says something listen to him then he picked up a riot gun and stomped over to where murphy was getting set to lead a group through the hole in the wall after the loupgarou she was going over instructions that if she went down one of the men was to pick up her gun and try to put out the things eyes with it the rookie half dragged and half led me around the corner and down the hall to the special investigations office i stared down at my feet as he did at the trail of bloody footprints behind me giggling something was nagging at me somewhere behind the madness of the laughter where a diffident rational corner of my mind was waiting patiently for my consciousness to take notice of an important thought it had isolated something about blood this isnt happening rudolph chanted to himself along the way this isnt happening sweet jesus this is a trick for the new guy a prank got to be he stank of sour sweat and fear and he was shaking horribly i could feel it in my biceps where he held me i think it was his terror that let me see through my own hysteria fight it down and shove it under control again he hauled me through the door into the special investigations office and i stumbled to the battered sunken old couch just inside the door i gasped for air while the rookie slammed the door and paced back and forth his eyes bulging wheezing for air this isnt happening he said my god this isnt happening hey i managed after a minute struggling to sort out all the input raging through my bodytears bruises maybe a sprain or two a little bit of chill where shock was lurking and aching sides from the laughter of all things the rookie didnt hear me hey rudy i said louder and the kid snapped his eyes over to me as though shocked that id spoken water i told him need some water water right rudolph said and he turned and all but ran to the water fountain his hands were shaking so hard that he crushed the first two paper cones he took from the dispenser but he got the third one right youre that guy the fake wizard i rasped back to him harry dresden dresden right the kid said and came back over to me with the paper cone i took it and splashed the contents all over my face it was a cool shock something else to draw me back from the land of giggles and throbbing nerve endings and i clawed for all the sane ground i could get then i handed the cone back to him one more for the inside he stared at me as though i was mad and whos to say right and went to get another cone cup of water i drank the second one down and started sorting through my thoughts blood rudy i said something about blood god the rookie panted the whites of his eyes glaring it was all over hampton blood all over the room splashed on the plexiglas and the security camera blood goddamn blood everywhere what the fuck is that thing just one more tough bad guy but it bleeds i said then fastened on the idea my brain churning to a ponderous conclusion it bleeds murphy shot it and put its blood all over the floor i gulped down the rest of the water and stood it bleeds and i can nail it i lifted my fist to shake it defiantly over my head and strode past the stunned rudolph hey he said feebly maybe you should sit down you dont look so good and youre sort of under arrest still i cant be under arrest right now i said back to him i dont have the time i limped down the rows of desks and partitions to murphys office its a little tackedon office with cheap walls of wooden paneling and an old wooden door but it was more than anyone else in the disfavored department had there was a paper rectangle taped neatly to the door where a name placard would be on any other office in the building which read in neat block letters of black ink lt karrin murphy special investigations the powers that be refused to purchase a real name plaque for any director of sisort of their way of reminding the person they stuck in the position that they wouldnt be there long enough to matter underneath the neat paper square at an angle was a red and purple bumper sticker that said trespassers will be killed and eaten i hope she didnt leave her computer on i mumbled and went into murphys office i took one look around the neatly organized little place and stepped in to pluck my blasting rod bracelet amulet firearm and other accoutrements id had in my possession when id been arrested from the table next to the computer the computer was on there was a cough from the monitor as my hand passed near it and a little puff of smoke then a bright spark from somewhere within the plastic console of the hard drive i winced and collected my things putting on the shield bracelet with fumbling fingers ducking my head into the loop of my pentacle amulet stuffing my pistol into the jumpsuits pocket and taking my blasting rod firmly in my right hand the side of the body that projects energy you didnt see that rudy okay the rookie had a stunned look on his face as he stared at me and at the smoking computer and monitor what did you do nothing never came close didnt do anything thats my story and im sticking to it i muttered you got that paper cup right then all we need is a stuffed animal he stared at me whwhat did you say a stuffed animal man i roared at him dont mess with a wizard when hes wizarding i let out a cackle that threatened to bring the wild hysteria that still lurked inside of me back in full force and banished it with a ferocious scowl poor rudolph bore the brunt of both expressions got a little more pale than he already was and took a couple of steps back from me look carmichael still keeps a couple of toys in his desk right for when kids have to wait on their parents that sort of thing uh said the rookie i uh i brandished my blasting rod go look maybe the kid would have taken any excuse at that point but he seemed willing enough to follow my instructions he spun and ran out into the main room and started frantically tearing open desks i limped out of murphys office and glanced back at the bloody footprints i left on the pukegrey carpet behind me with my soaking sock the room was getting colder as i lost more blood it wasnt serious but it was all the way at the bottom of my considerably long body and if i didnt get the bleeding stopped before too much longer it was bound to cause problems i was going to bend over and try to get a better look at my wounded foot but when i started to i swayed and wobbled dangerously and thought it would be a better thing to wait until someone else could do it i stood up and took a few deep breaths something nagged me about this entire deal something that was missing but id be damned if i could figure out what it was rudy i called get that animal yet the rookies hand thrust up from one of the partitioned cubicles with a battered stuffed snoopy doll will this work perfect i cheered woozily and then all hell broke loose chapter from out in the hallway there came a scream that no human throat could have made a sound of such fury and insane anger that it made my stomach roil and my guts shake gunfire erupted not in a rattling series of individual detonations but in a roar of furious thunder bullets shot through the wall somewhere near me and smashed out a couple of windows in the special investigations office i was on my last legs exhausted and terrified half crazy i hurt all over there was no way i was going to have the focus the strength i needed to go up against that monster easier to run to plan something out to come back when i was stronger i could win a rematch its tough to beat a wizard who knows his enemy who comes prepared to deal with it it was the smart thing to do but ive never been known for my rational snap judgment i gripped the blasting rod and started sucking in all the power i could reach scooping up my recent terror reaching down into the giggling madness scraping up all the courage i had left and pouring it into the kettle with everything else the power came rushing into me purity of emotion complex energies of will and raw hardheadedness all combining into a field an aura of tingling invisible energy that i could feel enveloping my skin shivers ran over me overriding the pain of my injuries the ecstasy of power gathering my sensations into its heady embrace i was pumped i was charged i was more than human and god help anyone who got in my way because he would need it i drew in a deep steadying breath and then i simply turned to the wall pointed my rod at it and snarled fuego power lanced out through the rod in a flood of scarlet light that charred a sixfoot circle of wall into powder and ash and sent it flying i stepped through it wishing for my duster for a second just for the cool effect it would have the hallway was a scene out of hell two officers were hauling a third down the hall toward me while three more with shotguns fired wildly around the corner i dont think the rescuers had taken the time to note that the body they were dragging away from the combat had no head attached to it one of the cops screamed as the riot gun he held ran empty and something i could not see jerked him forward around the corner and out of my vision there was a horrible shriek a splash of blood and the two remaining shooters panicked and fled up the hall and toward me the loupgarou came around the corner after them hauling one of the men down and ripping its claws across his spine with a simple savage motion that left the man quivering on the bloody tiles and hardly made the beast miss a step it set its eyes on the next man one of the plainclothes si detectives and hamstrung him with a slash of its jaws the beast left him howling on the tiles and hurtled toward the retreating pair still frantically dragging their corpse away i stepped forward between the fleeing men and the beast and lifted the blasting rod i dont think so bub the loupgarou crouched down its massive body moving with unholy grace its head and forequarters soaked in blood i saw its eyes widen and its muscles bunch beneath its dark brown pelt power gathered at my fist red and brilliant and the length of my blasting rod turned an incandescent white energy seethed through me as i prepared to release hell on earth at the monster my teeth ached and my hair stood on end i tensed every muscle i had holding it all back until i could put every scrap of strength i had into the strike and then there was the barkbarkbark of murphys little target pistol and the loupgarous rear flank twitched and threw out little bursts of blood its head whipped to one side back down the short hallway and its body followed suit faster than a serpent there was a surge of enormous muscles a howl of rage and then the thing was gone i spat a curse and ran down the hall after it the hamstrung officer lay on the floor screaming and the other man the one whod had his spine ripped out was choking and twitching unable to draw in a breath red anger flooded me rage that i realized with some dim part of my mind was as much a part of the beast and its bloodmaddened frenzy as it was of me i rounded the corner in time to see murphy standing in front of a litter of bodies take a last shot at the loupgarou and then it snarled and she vanished underneath its bulk no i screamed and ran forward carmichael beat me to it his round belly had been ripped open there was blood all over his cheap suit though his foodstained tie had somehow remained untainted his face was grave pale and set with the sort of intensity that only a dying man can have he held a bent and twisted riot gun in his hands and he hurled himself onto the loupgarous back as though he werent sixty pounds overweight and long past his agile years he wedged the riot gun between the loupgarous jaws but the beast turned and slammed carmichael into the wall with a sickening crunch of bone and a gout of blood from the mans mouth murphy slithered out from between the beasts paws on her shoulder blades and buttocks her cute little cheerleaders face set in a berserkers fury she jammed the end of her little gun beneath the things chin i saw her hands convulse on the trigger but instead of a flash of light and a dead loupgarou there was only the whooping of the alarm and a look of shocked surprise on murphys face the gun had run empty murphy i shouted roll she saw me with the blasting rod and her eyes flew wide the loupgarou shook its shoulders free of carmichaels corpse and bit completely through the riot gun thrashing its head left and right murphy scuttled sideways across the tiles and through the hole in the wall the beast had made earlier it took one snap at her and then whipped its head around to snarl at me i saw the crimson light reflected in its eyes as i focused every bit of fury in the world on the tip of my rod and shouted fuego i saw the reflected image in the beasts eyes brighten to nuclearwhite in front of a tall lean figure of black shadow saw the flood of energy as big around as my hips rush down the hall like a lance of red lightning and hammer into the beast sound rushed along with it a mountains roar that made the gunshots and screams of the evening seem like a childs whispers in comparison the power lifted the loupgarou hurtling it over the wounded figures moaning on the floor down the hall into holding through the security door through the cell door immediately across from it then through the brick exterior wall of the building and out into the chicago night but it wasnt over yet the lance of power carried the loupgarou across the street through the windows of the condemned building across from the station and through a series of walls within each one shattering with a redbrick roar before the red fire died away i could see the far side of the building across the street and the lights of the next block over through the hole the loupgarou had made i stood in a bloodsplattered hallway filled with the moans of the wounded and the wail of the escape alarm the sounds of emergency vehicles drifted into the building through the ragged hole in the wall a slender young black man stood up from the floor of the cell the loupgarou had smashed through and gawked at the hole in the wall then followed the destruction back down the hallway to where i stood damn he said and it had the same hushed tone to it as a holy word murphy struggled out of the hole in the wall to pitch down on the floor of the hallway gasping i could see the bulge of bone warping out the skin of her lower arm where it had been snapped somehow she lay white faced and gasping staring at carmichaels crushed body for a moment i couldnt do anything but stand there gawking there was another hole in the wall where the loupgarou must have crashed back into the hall putting itself between the two groups of policemen where they couldnt risk shooting at it without hitting one another or maybe they had some of the men who were down looked as though they had bullet wounds and from outside over the sirens and the moans and the noise of a city night i heard a long furious howl youve got to be kidding me i breathed my limbs felt like bruised jelly but i turned to limp back around the corner and found rudy there staring a paper cup in one hand and the snoopy doll in the other i took both from him and stalked back into the hallway to the second hole the loupgarou had made i found what i was looking for at onceblood on the inside of the hole in the wall where the beast had plowed through it the loupgarous blood was thicker darker than human fluids and i scooped it into the paper cup before going back into the hallway i swept clean a place with my foot set down my blasting rod got out my chalk and drew a circle on the ground rudolph approached me his head jerking back and forth between grisly corpses and splashes of blood you my god what are you doing i slapped the snoopy down in the middle of the circle then smeared the beasts blood over its eyes and mouth over its ears and nose thaumaturgy i said wha magic i clarified grimly make a symbolic link between a little thing i nodded at the snoopy doll and a big thing make it happen on the smaller scale and it happens on the larger scale too magic rudolph echoed i glanced up at him go downstairs send the emergency people up here rudy go on send them up here to help the wounded the kid twitched his eyes from the bloody snoopy back to me and jerked his head in a nod then he turned and fled down the hallway i turned my attention back to the spell i was working i had to keep the rage and anger i felt away from the working of my magic i couldnt afford to flood my spirit with grief fury and thoughts of vengeance for the dead men for their deaths for the pain that would be visited on their families but god as my witness i wanted nothing more than to try to set that thing on fire and hear it burn somewhere outside i tried to remind myself that it wasnt macfinns fault he was under a curse and not to blame killing him wouldnt bring back any of the dead men in these bloody hallways but i could keep any more men from dying tonight and i could do that without killing him in retrospect it was just as well that i didnt try to murder macfinn magic like that takes a lot of energycertainly more than i had i would probably have killed myself in the effort to finish off the loupgarou not to mention that the council would get their feathers ruffled by the concepteven though technically macfinn wasnt a human being at the moment killing monsters isnt nearly as much of an issue with the council they dont hold with equalopportunity mercy instead as my vision started to fade i began to chant nonsense syllables in a low musical refrain focusing the energy i would need inside the circle i had closed around me it wasnt until later that i would realize that i was babbling a chant of ubriacha ubrius ubrium to the peanuts theme music i tore off a strip of my own bloodied jumpsuit and bound it across the snoopys eyes its ears i bound up the ends of its fuzzy cute little paws then its mouth as though muzzling it i felt the spell grow and prepare itself and when it was ready i released the power and broke the circle feeling it flow out into the night following the blood back to the loupgarou winding itself about the creature blinding its eyes fouling its ears lashing around its jaws and forcing them shut crippling its taloned paws the spell would hamper and confuse the beast hopefully drive it to ground where no one could disturb it keep it from venting its rage upon the people of the city and it would last until dawn the energy flowed out of me left me feeling empty exhausted dizzy and then people were all around me emergency folk in uniforms cops and paramedics and firemen oh my i stood up from my circle grabbed my blasting rod and shambled off blindly i walked past carmichaels corpse stunned murphy was rocking back and forth over it weeping shaking while a man tried to slide a blanket over her shoulders she didnt notice me carmichael looked relaxed in death i wondered for a minute if he had a family a wife who would miss him hed died saving murphy from the beast hed died a hero it seemed so empty to me at that moment meaningless to be a hero i felt burned on the inside as though the fire i had hurled at the creature had scoured away all the gentle feelings that had been there and left a fallow ground behind where only red emotions could flourish i stumbled past murphy and carmichael and turned to walk out of the building dimly realizing that in the confusion i might actually have fair odds of making it back outside where tera and susan would be waiting in the car no one tried to stop me the stairs were tough and for a minute i thought i might just lie down and die on the first landing but a helpful old fireman lent me a hand down to the first floor asking me several times if i needed a doctor i assured him that i was fine and prayed that he didnt notice the handcuffs still dangling from either wrist he didnt he was as wide around the eyes as everyone else stunned outside was chaos police were struggling to establish some sort of order i saw a couple of news vans rolling up the street while other people crowded around trying to see i stood in the door dismayed trying to remember how to walk down the steps and then someone warm and gentle was at my side taking some of my weight i let her have it and closed my eyes i smelled susans hair when i inhaled and it made me want to wail and hold on to her to try to explain what i had seen to try to clean the stains from inside my head all that came out was a little choking sound i heard susan speak to someone else and another person got on the other side of me helped me down the stairs tera i thought i dimly remember them guiding me through the hectic area in front of the police station around ambulances and shouting men around policemen who were trying to get the bystanders to move away i heard susan explain to someone that i was drunk finally there was quiet and then we were moving among cars in a parking lot cool light gleaming on cool metal shapes cool rain coming down on my head my hair i tilted my face up to feel the rain and everything swam crazily ive got you harry susan murmured against my ear just relax ive got you just relax and so i did chapter i awoke in a dark place it was like the inside of a warehouse or a big underground garage all black with a smooth even floor and a pool of bleak sterile radiance in the middle of it that came from a source i could not see or identify i felt like hell and looked down to see myself covered in scratches bruises welts blood bandages and illfitting clothing i wore none of my implements or devices and there was a curious sense of distance between me and the pain of my injuriesi was more than aware of them but they seemed to be something that was merely noted in passing and unimportant to my life as a whole i stood just outside the circle of light and it seemed to me proper that i move forward into it i did and as i did there appeared in the circle opposite me me myself only better groomed dressed in a mantled duster of black leather not the sturdy if styleless canvas that i wore my doubles pants and boots and shirt were all black as well and they fit him as though tailormade rather than offtherack his eyes were set deep overshadowed by severe brows and glittering with dark intelligence his hair was neatly cut and the short beard he wore emphasized the long lines of his face the high cheekbones the straight slash of his mouth and the angular strength of his jaw he stood as tall as i as long limbed as i but carried with him infinitely more confidence raw knowledge and strength a faint whiff of cologne drifted over to me cutting through my own sour sweat and blood smells my double tilted his head to one side looked me up and down for a long minute and then said harry you look like hell and you look like me i said and limped toward him peering my double rolled his eyes and shook his head hells bells you make me sick with how thick skulled you are sometimes he took steps toward me mirroring my own movements i dont look like you i am you i blinked at him for a few seconds you are me how does that work youre unconscious moron my double said to me we can finally talk to one another oh i get it i said youre evil harry lurking inside good harry right and you only come out at night give me a break my double said if you were that simple youd be so insufferably boring youd probably blow your own head off im not evil harry im just subconscious harry im your inner voice bub your intuition your instinct your basic animal reactions i make your dreams and i decide which nightmares to pop in the old psychic vcr at night i come up with a lot of the good ideas and pass them along to you when you wake up so youre saying youre wiser than me smarter than me i probably am in a lot of ways my double said but thats not my job and its not why im here i see so what are you doing here then youre going to tell me how im going to meet three spirits of harry past present and future i asked my double snorted thats good that really is the banter thing i cant do the banter very well maybe thats why youre in charge of course if i was in charge more often youd get laid a lot morebut no thats not it either can we speed this along im too tired to keep on guessing i complained no joke jerk thats why youre asleep but we dont have long to talk and there are some issues we need to work through he said issues in the british manner issewwws issues to work through i said what am i my own therapist now i turned my back on my double and started stalking out of the lighted circle ive had some weird dreams but this has got to be the stupidest one yet my double slipped around me and got in my way before i could leave the circle of light hold it you really dont want to do this im tired i feel like shit im hurt and what i really dont want is to waste any more time dreaming about you i narrowed my eyes at my double now get out of my way i turned to my right and started walking toward the nearest edge of the circle my double slipped in front of me again apparently without needing to cross the intervening space it isnt that simple harry no matter where you go there you are look ive had a long night i know my double said believe me i know thats why its important to get some of this out now before it settles in before you blow a gasket on your sanity man im not worried about that i lied im as solid as a brick wall my double snorted if you werent getting pretty close to crazy would you be talking to yourself right now i opened my mouth closed it again shrugged okay youve got a point ive got more than that my double said things have been happening to you so quickly that you havent had time to think you need to work through some of this and then you need to do some hard thinking fast i sighed and rubbed at my eyes all right then i said what do you want to hear my double gestured and there was murphy as she had appeared in the hallway of the police station the flesh of her bicep tented out by the broken bone her face pale spotted with blood and streaked with tears and hopeless anguish murph i said quietly and knelt down by the image stars above what have i done to you the image the memory didnt hear me she just wept silent bitter tears my double knelt on the other side of the apparition nothing harry he said what happened at the police station wasnt your fault like hell it wasnt i snarled if id have been faster gotten there sooner or if id told her the truth from the beginning but you didnt my double interjected and you had some pretty damned compelling reasons not to ease up on yourself man you cant change the past easy for you to say i snarled no it isnt my double said quietly concentrate on what you will do not what you should have done youve been trying to protect murphy all along instead of making her able to protect herself shes going to be fighting these kinds of things harry and you wont always be there to babysit her instead of trying to play shepherd you need to play coach and get her into shape to do what she needs to do but that means telling her everything my double said the white council the nevernever all of it the council wont like it if i tell her and they hear about it they might consider her a security risk and if you dont make her able to understand what shes fighting somethings going to eat her face some dark night murphys a big girl the council had better be careful if they decide to go messing with her my double considered murphy for a moment you should ask her out sometime too i should what i said you heard me youre repressing big time man this is all getting way too freudian for me i said and stood up intending to walk away again i was confronted with an image of susan as she had appeared on the steps to the police station tall in her heels and dress suit elegant and beautiful her face stretched with worry think shes going to get a good story out of this my double asked oh thats below the belt thats not why shes seeing me maybe maybe not but youre asking yourself that question arent you my double gestured to himself and to me demonstratively shouldnt that make you ask a few more questions like what i asked like how come you dont trust anyone my double said not even someone like susan who has been going out on a limb for you tonight he lifted a longfingered hand and stroked at the short beard with his fingertips im thinking this has to do with elaine how about you and then there she was a girl of elegant height perhaps eighteen or nineteen years of agegawky and coltish all long legs and arms but with the promise of stunning beauty to add graceful curves to the lean lines of her body she was dressed in a pair of my blue jeans cut off at the tops of her muscled thighs and my own tshirt tied off over her abdomen a pentacle amulet identical to my own if less battered lay over her heart between the curves of her modest breasts her skin was pale almost luminous her hair a shade of browngold like ripe wheat her eyes a startling stormcloud grey in contrast her smile lit up her face made her eyes dance with secret fires that still even after all the years made me draw in a sharp breath elaine beautiful vital and as poisonous as any snake i turned my back on the image deliberatelybefore i could see it change into the elaine that i had last seennaked festooned in swirling paints that lent a savage aura to her skin her lips had been stained brilliant wet red curving around twisting rolling phrases as she chanted in the midst of her circle its sigils meant to focus pain and fury into tangible power that had been used to hold a foolish young man helpless while his mentor offered him one last chance to sip from a chalice of fresh hot blood thats been over for a long time i said my voice shaking my double answered me quietly it isnt over it isnt over yet harry as long as you hold yourself responsible for justins death and elaines fall it still colors everything you think and do i didnt answer myself shes still alive my double said you know she is she died in the fire i said she was unconscious she couldnt have lived through it youd have known if she died and they never found a second set of bones she died in the fire i screamed shes dead until you stop pretending my double said appearing before me and try to face reality youre not going to be able to heal youre not going to be able to trust anyone which reminds me my double gestured and tera west appeared as i had seen her crouched behind the garbage bin at the rear of the gas station naked her body lean feral leaves and bits of bracken in her hair her amber eyes gleaming with cold alien intelligence why in the hell are you trusting her i havent had much choice i snapped in case you havent noticed things have been sort of desperate lately you know shes not human my double said you know she was at the scene of the crime at marcones restaurant where spike was torn up you know she has some kind of hold on a group of young people the favorite targets of the creatures of the nevernever in fact you can be pretty damn sure that she is a shapeshifter of one kind or another who isnt telling you the whole truth but still comes asking for your help like i can throw stones for not telling the whole truth i said hngh my double said in answer but you havent confronted her about what she isnt telling you those kids who the hell were they and what were they doing what is she getting them into and why was she keeping it a secret from macfinn he didnt recognize the names when you dropped them all right all right i said i was going to talk to her anyway as soon as i wake up my double chuckled if things are that leisurely these murders are still happening and theyre starting to pile up are you serious about doing something about them you know that i am my double nodded firmly im glad we agree on something lets look at some facts macfinn couldnt have committed all the murders most particularly he couldnt have committed the most important murderthe industrialist marcones partner he and his bodyguard were killed the night after the full moon and spike was wiped out the night before the full moon macfinn doesnt have any control over his shapeshifting he couldnt have been the one to pull off those murders so who could have i asked his fiancée the men were ripped apart by an animal but the fbi lab said that it wasnt a true wolf that did it werewolves are slightly different from real wolves my double said how do you know that i demanded im the intuition remember my double said think about it if you were going to change yourself into a wolf do you think you could hold that image in your head perfectly exact do you think you could make all the millions of subtle tiny changes in skeletal and muscular structure magic doesnt just worka mind has to direct it shape it your emotions your feelings toward wolves would color it too change the image and the shape ask bob next chance you get im sure hell tell you im right okay okay i said ill buy that but the fbi said that there was more than one set of tooth marks and prints too macfinn explains some of them during last months full moon he probably killed some people when his circle went kablooey and the group tera hadthey called themselves the alphascould explain the rest of them if they were shapeshifters now youre catching on my double said approval in his tone youre smarter than you look do you think they were behind spoiling macfinns containment circle the fancy one with all the silver and stuff they had the knowledge to do it through tera tera could have let them in providing opportunity my double said but they didnt have a motive i said why would they have done it because tera told them to maybe i frowned and nodded she is a creature of the nevernever who knows whats going through herits head it doesnt necessarily have to be understandable by human logic my double shook his head i dont buy that i saw the way she looked at macfinnand how she sacrificed herself to divert the fbi and the police so that he could escape your instincts are telling you that she is in love with macfinn and that she wouldnt act against him yeah you told me that about elaine too i shot back another pang of memory going through my chest that was a long time ago my double said defensively ive had time to get keener since then and less easy to distract all right i sighed so where does that leave us i dont think weve run into the real killers yet the ones who ruined macfinns circle and whacked the mob guys on the nonfullmoon nights i squinted at my double you think so he nodded and stroked his beard again unless the alphas are doing it without tera knowing and they look a little too brighteyed and bushytailed to be doing that i think its someone else entirely someone trying to set up macfinn and take him out of the picture but why maybe because they didnt want him putting the northwest passage project through or gee maybe because hes a freaking werewolf harry and someone caught on to it and wanted him dead you know that there are organizations who would do thatsome of the venatori umbrorum members of the white council others who are in the know but you dont think ive seen them yet i dont think youve picked them out from the background my double said keep your eyes open all right which brings us to the next topic of discussion does it my double nodded threat assessment youve got all kinds of things staring you right in the face and youre not noticing them i dont want you to get killed because youre too distracted he glanced to one side frowned and said were almost out of time we wouldnt be if you werent such a wiseass bite me my double said dont forget marcone you pissed him off by not taking the deal he offered you he thinks the killers are coming after him next and he might be right hes scared and scared people do stupid thingslike trying to off the only man in town who has a chance of stopping whats going on let me worry about marcone i said i am you and im worried next is the cops some of murphys people are dead there is going to be hell to pay once she gets that arm fixedand someone is going to remember that you were around and with your luck they wont remember that you kept even more people from dying you see murphy and the police again youd better be careful or youre going to get shot to death resisting arrest ill be careful i said one more thing my double said you have forgotten about parker and the streetwolves entirely parker needs you dead if hes going to remain in control of his people yeah youd have thought hed have been more on the ball than this exactly my double said youve been hiding and away from your apartment for a whilebut you show up in public again and you can bet that parker will be on your trail and think he knew the real deal between you and marcone and hes a petty thug in chicago theres probably a connection between them and youve been too dumb to think of it stars above i muttered its not as if the situation is very complicated no pressure right at least youre willing to deal with it now instead of just closing your eyes and pretending that they cant see you be careful harry its a real mess and youre the only one who can clean it up who are you my mother i asked my double snapped his fingers that reminds me right your mother he broke off glancing up and around him an expression of frustration coming over his face oh hell and then someone was shaking my unwounded shoulder shaking me roughly awake i blinked open my eyes in shock and all the pains of my body came flooding back into me with renewed energy and agony my brain reeled for a few minutes trying to shift gears i was sitting in the passenger seat of susans car we were rolling down an expressway somewhere but rain was clouding the view of the skyline so that i couldnt orient myself to where we were the glowing numbers of the dashboard clock said that it was only a few minutes after nine id had less than half an hours sleep there was an old beach towel wrapped around my wounded foot and my face felt cool as though someone had wiped it clean is he awake susan said her voice high and panicky is he awake im awake i said blearily blinking open my eyes sort of what this better be good it is not good tera said from the backseat if you have any power left wizard you should prepare to use it we are being followed chapter i rubbed at my eyes and mumbled some vague curse at whoever was following us okay okay give me a minute harry susan said im almost on empty i dont know if we have a minute it never rains i moaned tera frowned at me it is raining now she turned to susan i do not think he is coherent i snorted and looked around blearily its a figure of speech hells bells you really dont know anything about humans do you are you sure theres someone following us tera glanced back at the traffic behind us two cars back and three cars behind that one two vehicles are following us how can you tell i asked tera turned those odd amber eyes back to me they move like predators they move well and i feel them i narrowed my eyes feel them on an instinctual level tera shrugged i feel them she repeated they are dangerous the taste of blood was still in my mouth annoying input like static on a phone of all the people who might be chasing me in cars i could only think of a few who would trigger the supernatural senses of an inhuman being i thought that it might be a pretty good idea to listen to what my dapper double had to say susan i said i want you to get off the expressway her dark eyes flashed beneath the streetlights as she looked at me then down at her fuel gauge i have to in the next couple of miles anyway what do you want me to do pull off and get to a gas station she flashed me another nervous look and i had the time to note that she was gorgeous like some sort of latin goddess of course i might have been a little less than entirely objective then what she said i checked my foot and idly took off my remaining boot so that my hips would be parallel with the floor while i was standing call the police what susan exclaimed and guided her car off the freeway and down an exit ramp i felt around in the jumpsuits tool pouch until i came out with the little sports bottle with my second potion in it just do it i said trust me on this one wizard tera said her voice still utterly calm there is no one but you who can help my fiancé i shot tera an annoyed glance ill meet you where you hold your cub scout meetings harry susan said what are you talking about she pulled the car down the exit ramp onto a oneway access road i understand what youre doing tera said i would do the same for my mate mate susan said indignantly mate i am most certainly not his i didnt get to hear the rest of what susan said because i grabbed my blasting rod in one hand the potion in the other opened the door to the car unfastened my seat belt and rolled out onto the shoulder of the road i know i know it sounds really stupid in retrospect even to me but it made a sort of chivalrous cockamamie sense at the time i was pretty sure that parker and his cronies in the streetwolves were shadowing us and i had a precise idea of how dangerous they could be i had to assume that they were even worse during the full moon susan had no idea of the level of danger she was in and if i stayed near her i would only draw her more deeply into it and terai still didnt trust tera i wasnt sure that i wanted her fighting at my back i wanted to deal with my pursuers myself to deal with my own mistake myself and not to make an innocent bystander like susan pay for it so i uh sort of threw myself out of the passenger seat of a moving car dont look at me like that im telling you it made sense at the time i held out my arms and legs in a circle as though i were trying to hug a barrel and then scrape scrape rip bumpitybumpitybumpity whip whip whip and thud everything whirled around the whole while i managed somehow to keep my sense of direction to maintain my momentum largely in a roll and to angle myself toward the dubious comfort of the thick weeds at the side of the access road by the time i came to a stop i was among freshly crushed plants all damp and cold from the rain the smell of mud and gas and asphalt and exhaust clogging up my nose there was pain pain everywhere spreading out from my shoulder and my foot whirling dizziness blackness that rode on my eyelids and tried to force them down i struggled to remember exactly what i had planned on doing when i had thrown open the door to susans car it came to me in a moment and i jerked the squeeze top of the sports bottle open with my teeth and then crushed the plastic bottle forcing the potion inside it out through the narrow nozzle and into my mouth eight ounces of cold coffee i thought dimly yum it tasted like stale cardboard and tooold pizza and burned coffee beans but as it went down my gullet i could feel the power in the brew spreading out into me active and alive as though i had swallowed a huge hyperkinetic amoeba my fatigue quite simply vanished and energy came rushing into me like it sometimes does at the end of a really good concerto or overture the pain receded down to levels that i could manage the soreness lifted out of my muscles and my cloudy cloggy thought processes cleared as though someone had flushed my synapses with jalapeno my heart rate surged and then held steady and i came to the abrupt conclusion that things just werent as bad as i had thought they were i pushed myself up using my bad arm just to spite the injury that agent benn had dealt me and brushed myself off my jumpsuit was torn and there was fresh blood on it scrapes from the asphalt and darkening bruises on my arms and legs that i could already seeannoying little bastards i held them in contempt i shook my shield bracelet loose around my left wrist took my blasting rod in my right hand and turned toward the access road i drew in a breath smelling the odor of the rain on the asphalt and more distantly the crisp clean scent of autumn almost buried by chicagos stink i considered how much i loved the autumn and composed a brief poem about it as i watched traffic force susans car along and out of sight i turned my head to view a pair of cars cut frantically across traffic and cruise down the access road the lead car was a twoton pickup one of the really big ones and parker sat behind the wheel looking around wildly until his eyes lit upon me standing there in the tall weeds beside the road i smiled at him and contemplated his shocked expression to my own satisfaction then i drew in a breath and my renewed will with it lifted the rod in my right hand murmured a phrase in a language i didnt know and blew the tires off his fucking truck they all went at once in one satisfying thump complete blowouts resulting from a sudden heating of the air inside the tiresa pretty slick spell to pull on the fly heating up the air inside of the tires of a moving vehicle the truck slewed left and right and i could see parker frantically rolling the steering wheel in an effort to maintain control two people sat in the cab with him faces i didnt recognize from here and they evidently didnt believe in seat belts they were tossed about the inside of the truck like toys the truck careened off the road in a spray of gravel went past me into the weeds hit some sort of ditch and went into a ponderous roll there was an enormous crunching sound car wrecks when they happen for real and not on television are surprisingly noisy they sound like someone pounding empty trash cans out of shape with a sledgehammer only louder parkers truck tumbled over twice crunched into the side of a hill and lay on its passenger side well then i said with a certain amount of professional pride that should take care of that i spoke too soon there was a brittle grinding sound and the windshield of the truck exploded into a hectic spiderweb pattern the sound repeated itself and the safety glass shattered outward followed by a foot wearing a heavy black combat boot more glass flew outward and then people started crawling out of the pickup battered and bloodied besides parker there was the lanternjawed lout whose nose i had flattened a few days ago his nose now swollen and grotesque and the bloodthirsty woman who had led the group into their berserk fit of lust they were all dressed in the same variants of denim and leather and cuts and bruises from the tossing theyd had were much in evidence parker led them out of the truck looked back at it stunnedand then he looked at me i saw fear flicker in his eyes and it brought out a satisfied surge within my own pounding heart served him right the jerk i spun my rod around once in my fingers started whistling a bit from the overture to carmen and walked toward them through the grass annoyed that i was limping and that i was dressed in a ridiculous blue jumpsuit that left inches of my arms and legs bare flatnose saw me and grunted out some sort of neanderthal noise of surprise he drew a handgun from inside his jacket and it looked tiny in his hands without preamble he started squeezing off shots at me i lifted my left hand forced more of my boundless energy through the shield bracelet and sang a few phrases in what i supposed could have been taken for italian to verbally encase the spell i continued walking forward as bullets bounded off the shield before my hand in cascades of sparks and i even had enough breath left over to keep on whistling carmen parker snarled and slashed at flatnoses wrist with the edge of his hand in a martialartsstyle movement i heard a bone break very clearly but flatnose only jerked his hand back toward his body and flashed parker a scowl remember why were here the shorter man said hes mine hello there mr parker i called cheerfully i suppose that the image i presented as i walked toward them would have been comicexcept for all the blood and the big smile i felt spreading over my face it seemed to have a somewhat intimidating effect on the streetwolves at any rate the woman snarled at me and for a second i could feel a wild savage energy the same that had surrounded the frenzying lycanthropes at the full moon garage starting to build in the air around me i gave the bitch an annoyed look and slashed my hand at the air drawling disperdorus i forced out an effort of will i might have found daunting on another night one when i was feeling a little less allpowerful and the woman jerked back as though i had slapped her in the mouth the energy she had been gathering fractured and flew apart as though it had never been she stared at me growing tense and nervous and reached a hand toward a knife in a case at her hip lets have none of that nonsense as i was saying i continued hello there mr parker i know why youre here heard about the ruckus on a police scanner and came down by the station looking for me right hate to disappoint you but im not going to allow you to kill me flatnose scowled and said how did you know th parker shoved the heel of his hand across flatnoses mouth in a sharp blow and the big man shut up mr dresden parker growled he eyed me up and down what exactly makes you think you can stop me from killing you i had to smile at the man i mean you have to smile at idiots and children oh i dont know i chuckled maybe because the second you step out of line im going to wreck you a whole hell of a lot worse than that truck and because in just a couple of minutes the police are going to be arriving to sort you out there was a momentary flash of dimness where the streetlight seemed to fade the rain to grow very cold and then it was gone again i blinked a little blood out of my eyes and renewed my smile mustnt let the children see weakness parker snarled his thin lips into a smile he had bad teeth the cops are after your ass too dresden he said i dont believe you once theyre here im going to mysteriously disappear i said just like well gosh magic but you guys are i forgot what i had been going to say for a moment there was something nagging at the back of my mind a detail i had forgotten i can smell your blood wizard parker said very quietly god you got no idea what it smells like parker didnt move but the woman let out a little mewling sound and pressed against flatnoses side her eyes were focused intently on me get a good whiff i managed to say its the last time youll smell it but my smile was gone a creeping vine of uncertainty was beginning to crack the wall of confidence i had been enjoying the rain was getting colder the lights dimmer my extended left arm began to ache starting at the wounded shoulder and my hand shook visibly pain started leaking in again from every part of my battered body sanity returned in a rush the potion the potion was giving out on me i had pushed myself way too hard while the first euphoria was going over me dispelling the intimate aura of rage and lust that the woman had begun to gather over them had been a feat i would never have considered in a stable frame of mind there were too many unknowns my heart was laboring along now and i started panting i couldnt get enough breath to slow down my rocketing heartbeat parker and his two companions grew tense together all at once with no visible signal passing between them i could feel that wild energy again coursing down to the lycanthropes from beyond the rain clouds overhead i swear to you i could see the cuts on their body from the crash closing up before my eyes flatnose rolled the wrist that had just been broken flexed his fingers at me and gave me a grim smile okay harry i told myself keep calm do not panic all you have to do is to hold them here until the cops get here and then you can bleed to death in peace or get to a doctor whichever hurts less you know parker i said and my voice had a fluttering quaver to it a fast desperate quality i didnt really mean to show up at your garage hell i wouldnt have been there at all if dentons goon hadnt turned me on to the idea that doesnt matter now parker said his voice had a quiet certain tone to it and he had visibly relaxed he smiled at me and showed me more of his teeth thats all in the past then parker took a step forward and i panicked i jammed the rod at him and snarled fuego i funneled my will through it and to hell with what the council thought of me killing someone with magic nothing happened i stared in disbelief first at parker and then at the blasting rod my fingers went numb as i looked at them and the runeengraved ash rod fell to the ground though i tried a clumsy grab to catch it instead my weight came down on my torn foot and the ripped muscles went into a sudden cramp that sent fresh agony up through my leg it buckled and pitched me forward into the weeds and the mud the last wisps of my shield vanished as i fell my magic had failed me altogether parker laughed a low and nasty sound nice trick got another one more i rasped and fumbled at the jumpsuits tool pouch parker walked slowly toward me confident relaxed and moving like a man thirty years younger than he my fingers were aching with cold torn from the asphalt numb from all the pain and scrapes and bruises but the handle of my chiefs special was easy enough to find i drew it out thumbed back the hammer and pointed it up at parker his eyes widened and his weight settled back on his heelsnot quite retreating but not coming any closer either from three feet away even down in the mud it would be tough to miss him and he knew it i didnt pick you for the kind to carry a gun he said the rain plastered his greasy hair down over his eyes only on special occasions i said back i had to delay him if i could hold him in place just for a few minutes the cops would show up i had to believe that they would because if they didnt i was dead meat maybe literally stop where you are he didnt he took a step toward me so i shot him the gun roared and the bullet smacked into his right kneecap it exploded in a burst of blood and flying chips of bone and the leg went out from under him hurling him to the muddy ground he blinked once surprised but the pain he must have been feeling didnt seem to register he scooted back a couple of feet and stared at me for a second reassessing me parker then drew his legs beneath him and ignoring his ruined knee hunkered down on his heels and rested his elbows on his thighs as if we were old friends keeping his hands in plain sight youre tougher than you look we tried to catch you at your apartment you know he said as though i hadnt just shot him but the cops were all over it police band said youd gotten arrested but i guess you got away we paid the jailer to let us know when they rounded you up he grinned his snaggletoothed grin and looked almost friendly hell kid we were hanging around in a bar two blocks from the station for almost two days just hoping to be there when they brought you up the steps driveby he pointed his finger at me in a bangbang motion and let his thumb fall forward sorry to disappoint you i mumbled i was working hard not to give in to the shakes the cold or the darkness i knew he was up to something but there was too much to deal withtoo much injury too much exhaustion too much blood on my hands i squinted past him to see flatnose and the woman still in the same spot both of them watching me with the intent look of hungry animals parker chuckled and instead everything goes to hell at the station gunshots explosions sounds like a war inside which was fun to watch and then we see you stumbling out of the middle of it right there in front of the cop station with a cute little piece on either side helping you down the stairs we just rolled out right after your ass i hope youre insured parker shrugged truck wasnt mine he plucked up a long blade of grass and traced it over the ruin of his knee painting it red with his blood before crushing it up in his fingers most of my people are out by the lake tonight they got to let off some steam during the full moon damn but i want to take you out right there in front of all of them you got a real badass reputation kid cant have everything you want i said i blinked rain or blood from my eyes parkers smile widened you know kid i think theres something you dont know in the distance i could hear the sound of sirens speeding down the freeway toward me hot damn i thought i finally did something right oh yeah i asked daring to feel a satisfied thrill of victory parker nodded and looked off to one side there were two cars behind you and something smashed down on my right hand making it go numb and sending the gun to earth i looked up and had time to see another of the lycanthropes from the garage lift a lead pipe wrapped in electrical tape and bring it down hard at me the woman screamed and rushed toward me she had steeltoed boots flatnose lumbered after her and was content to use the barrel of his pistol as a dumb club parker just sat there squatting on his heels and watched them i could see his eyes my blood spattered onto his cheek i dont like thinking about what they did they didnt want to kill me they wanted to hurt me and they were good at it i couldnt fight i couldnt even curl up into a ball there wasnt that much spirit left in me i could hear myself making choking sounds gagging on my own blood sobbing and retching in pathetic agony i would have screamed if i could have you hear stories about men who keep silent through all the torture and agony that anyone inflicts on them but im just not that strong they broke me at some point the mind says no more and it gets the hell away from all that pain i started going there to that awayplace and i wasnt sorry to do it at all i could dimly hear parker shoving people off of me once i stopped moving he broke a few more of their bones and they backed off with snarls of rage he was walking on the leg again already though my shot must have torn the joint to pieces at his orders they picked me up and carried me to another car just lugged me along like a sack of broken parts duct tape went around my wrists and ankles knees and elbows and mouth then they threw me in the trunk parker reached up to close the lid i didnt have enough energy to move my eyes i just stared out letting them focus wherever they would i saw a face behind the wheel of a car going past on the access roadjust a sedan something that would blend in with all the other cars in the city the face was young strained sprinkled with freckles the hair red the ears big roger harris fbi dentons redheaded lackey the sedan rolled by without even slowing and harris didnt look over at me didnt break his surveillance i wasnt the only one it seemed who was being followed that night parker slammed shut the trunk leaving me in darkness the car started going just as the sirens began to arrive at the access road my captors car bounced along and made a casual getaway leaving me in an agony more thorough sickening and acute than any i had felt before and behind the gag i started laughing i couldnt help it i laughed and it sounded like i was choking on raw sewage the pieces had all fallen into place chapter theres a point after which one cannot possibly continue doing complicated things like thinking and keeping ones eyes open blackness ensues and everything stops until the body or the mind is ready to function again the blackness came for me and i welcomed it when i started to wake up i smelled motor oil that in itself boded ill i was seated upright and an upright metal beam pressed into my back i felt something constricting my wrists and my ankles duct tape still perhaps there was cold concrete floor beneath me i was aching everywhere and stiff but there was something soft over me a blanket maybe i wasnt as cold as i might have been my first emotion was a vague surprise that i was still alive the second was a cold nasty little shiver i was a prisoner and as long as i was survival was by no means certain first things first then make it certain find out where i was devise a plan and get my skinny wizard ass out of there after all it would be a real pity to die when id finally put tabs on who had gotten me into this messas well as who was responsible for the recent killings that couldnt be attributed to macfinn and probably who had set him up as well to that end i opened my eyes and tried to get a look at my surroundings i was in the enemys stronghold the full moon garage it was dim inside and from what i could hear it was still raining without there was a dirty but warm blanket over me which came as something of a surprise there was also a little stand with a mostly empty plastic bag of what i took to be blood dripping down a plastic tube that vanished behind me out of my sight and presumably ended at my arm i wiggled my feet out from beneath the blanket my legs had been ducttaped together above and below the knee and at the ankle my bitten foot had been wrapped in clean bandages then covered in my bloodied sock in fact i found a number of clean bandages on various cuts and scrapes and i could smell faintly as though my nose had been given a while to get used to it the sharp medicine smell of disinfectant i couldnt feel murphys sawedthrough handcuffs on my wrists and found myself vaguely missing them at least theyd been familiar if not comfortable so not only was i alive but i was in considerably better shape after presumably several hours of sleep and medical attention but that didnt explain who had done this to me or why i looked around the dimness of the garage my eyes were now adjusted to it but even so there were pockets of shadows too deep to see into an lshaped ribbon of yellow light showed beneath the door to the managers office and the sound of rain on the corrugated roof was a low soothing roar i closed my eyes trying to orient myself to determine what time it was from the feel of the air and the sound of the rain late afternoon early evening i couldnt tell for sure i coughed and found my throat dry but functional my hands were bound and i didnt have any way of making a circle without a circle i couldnt use any delicate magic to free myselfall i had access to was the kaboom sort of power which while great against nasty loupgarou and other monsters isnt much good for getting rid of several layers of duct tape resting within half an inch of my own tender skin magic was out did i ever tell you about my dad he was a magiciannot a wizard mind you but a magician the kind you see at oldfashioned magic shows he had a black top hat a white rabbit a basket of swords and everything he used to travel around the country performing for the kids and the old folks barely making enough to scrape by after mom died during childbirth dad had the job of raising me all by himself and i guess he did the best he could he meant well i was real young when he died i refused to believe chaunzaggoroths insinuations until i had looked into them further of a brain aneurism but i learned a thing or three about what he did before then hed named me after three magicians after all the first of which was houdini himself and one of houdinis first rules was that the means to escape was always within your grasp positive attitude its a fact that a human being can escape from just about everything given enough time the only question was how much time did i have left the duct tape was strong and it was fastened tightlybut it was also cheap easy to transport and simple to apply even though it was wound about me in multiple layers it wasnt the best thing for holding people or else the cops would use duct tape and not handcuffs and manacles it could be beaten so i started looking for ways to beat it a little writhing showed me that my hands werent fastened as tightly as they could have been i could feel a sharp pain in my forearm and guessed that was from the iv they had to loosen the tape on my arms to get the needle into my forearm i wiggled my shoulders which set the wounded one to aching fiercely the tape put pressure on my wrists and tore the hair from my arms with an audible ripping sound and i clenched my teeth over this particular torment it hurt and it took me the best part of ten minutes but i got my wrists and hands free i ditched the iv needle while i was at it imagining some deadly fluid flowing down the tube into my veins then i flexed my arms repeatedly and got them free my fingers were numb stiff not really responding but i started fumbling at the tape on my legs as best i could trying to get tears started so that i could just flex my legs and get the whole thing to go at once it took more effort than i thought it would but i finally flexed my legs thankful that the jumpsuit kept me from losing stripes of hair from my thighs and calves if not from my ankles my legs were much stronger than my arms so snapping the layers of duct tape on them was a lot simpler and quicker just not simple or quick enough before id gotten out of the last loop of duct tape there was a clickclack and the office door swung open accompanied by a murmur of low voices and a tinny din of oldtime rockandroll music i panicked i couldnt runmy ankles were still bound by the time i got free and struggled to my feet theyd be on me so i did the next best thing i whipped the blanket up and over me snaked my hands back behind the pole grabbing up the iv needle as i went and concealing it in my hand and bent my head far forward as though i were still asleep i still dont get why we cant just put a bullet in him and dump him said a harsh voice with no nasal tone at allflatnose stupid parker growled his voice like sandpaper one we dont do it without having the others here to see and two we dont do it until marcones had a chance to see him marcone flatnose said with a sneer in his voice whats he want with him good question i thought i kept my head down my body relaxed and tried to think sleepy thoughts marcone was coming here who cares parker answered i made sure hed live through the day either way i wanted him here tonight no skin off my teeth flatnose grunted chicago sees a lot of mobsters marcones just one more but one call from him and this wizard character gets a reprieve who is this guy huh the freaking governor always thinking with your balls parker said his voice calm marcone isnt just a mobster running chicago is just his sideline see hes got business all over the country and he owns people from here to the governors mansion to washington and back and hes got more money than god he can set us up take us out have the police on our ass anytime he wants you dont screw with someone like that lightly there was a pause and then flatnose said maybe or maybe lanas right maybe youre getting soft marcone isnt one of us he doesnt give us orders the parker i knew ten years ago wouldnt have thought twice of telling marcone to fuck off parkers voice became resigned dont do this man you were never good enough even when we were young the parker you knew ten years ago would have gotten all of us killed by now ive kept you in cash in dope women whatever you wanted so settle down i dont buy it flatnose said back i think lanas right and i say we off this skinny son of a bitch right now i felt myself tense and prepared to make a run for it hopeless or not id rather get killed trying to get away than trying to pretend i was asleep back down parker said and then there was a scuffling noise of boots on old concrete i heard a couple of grunts and an abrupt yelp and smelled sour sweat and stale beer as flatnose was forced to his knees less than a foot away he kept making small noises of pain thick with tension as though parker was holding him in some kind of lock i forced myself to relax not to just stagger up and start running but i felt a bead of sweat trickle down my face parker snarled over flatnoses whimpers i told you you were never good enough challenge me again in public or alone it doesnt matterand i will rip your heart out the way he spoke the threat was eerie not with the hissing villainous emphasis one would expect but in a calm measured almost bored tone as though he were mentioning switching out a carburetor or changing a light bulb there was a rippling sort of sound and flatnose let out a howl of pain that dissolved into a string of doglike whimpers i heard parkers boots move a few steps away now get up he said call tullys and get the others back here before the moon rises well have blood tonight and if marcone isnt polite enough well have a lot more i heard flatnose make his way to his feet and shuffle off in a slow and haphazard fashion he vanished into the office and closed the door behind him i waited for a few moments hoping that parker would wander off and i could make my escape but he didnt dammit i was running out of time if i waited until the rest of the lycanthropes returned to the garage id never be able to get away the numbers would be stacked too high if i was going to make a break for it logically the time was now of course i was still bound by the time i got my legs free parker would be on me and i had just listened to him disable a man twice his size and threaten to rip his heart out hed meant it too i could tell when i had looked inside of him i had seen a dark and angry place the source of all that power and force of will he could tear me to pieces with his bare hands literallyand what was worse he would i had to have a head start if i was going to run i could make him mad maybe antagonize him into going to get a baseball bat or another roll of duct tape for my mouth then i could run make a clean getaway the one problem with that plan was that he might just rip my heart out on the spotbut nothing ventured nothing gained i didnt have time to be picky so i lifted up my head enough to squint at him in the semidarkness and said you certainly have a way with people you must have read a book or something my voice startled him and he spun with the reflexes of a nervous cat he stared at me for a long minute before starting to relax so youre alive its just as well i suppose mostly i was just tired thanks for the sack time he showed me his teeth no problem checkout is in a couple hours that scared me enough to make a rational man pee but i only shrugged no problem good thing your people cant hit they might have made me uncomfortable parker laughed a rough laugh you got balls kid ill give you that at least until lana gets her teeth into them later this wasnt going at all well i had to find some way to piss him off not make him laugh hows the knee parker narrowed his eyes a lot better it didnt quite heal up before sunrise but i figure itll only take an hour or so after the moon comes up i should have aimed higher i said parkers jaw clenched down a little too late now kid game over enjoy it while you can i hear your people are getting a little sick of you do you think lana will be the one to tear your balls off when they put you down his boot came out of nowhere and hit me in the side of the head it threw me hard to my right and if i hadnt clenched my arms at the last minute it would have thrown me to the floor and revealed my lack of bonds you just dont know when to keep quiet do you wizard what have i got to lose i shot back at him i mean hell it isnt as though all of the people that looked up to me have turned against me right it isnt as though im getting too old to manage wh shut up parker snarled his eyes taking on an eerie greenish cast in the darkness a trick of the light and he kicked me again this time in the stomach my breath went out in a whoosh and i fought to continue speaking waking up stiffer every morning eating less maybe not as strong as you used to be right not as fast got to beat up on old dogs like flatnose there because if you try one of the younger ones theyll take you down the plan was working beautifully now all that i needed was for him to stalk out of the room to calm down or to fetch an instrument of mayhem or some more duct tape anything instead parker just spun on his heel picked up a tire iron and turned back to me lifting it high fuck marcone he snarled and fuck you wizard his muscles bunched beneath his old tshirt as he raised the iron above his head his eyes gleamed with the same sort of animalistic fury i had beheld in the other lycanthropes the night before his mouth was stretched in a feral grin and i could see the cords in his neck standing out as he wound up to give me the deathblow i hate it when a plan falls apart chapter i clenched my teeth and kicked my legs the duct tape around my ankles gave way but it was too late to do me any good i didnt have time to get my weight beneath me to run but i made the gesture in any case just one of those things you do when youre about to die i guess mr hendricks came a very hard very calm voice if mr parker does not put down the tire iron in the next second or two please shoot him dead yes sir mr marcone hendrickss rumbling basso answered i looked over to my right to see gentleman johnny marcone standing at the door in a grey italian business suit hendricks stood in front of him and a bit to one side in a much cheaper suit holding a pumpaction shotgun with a short barrel its stock worked into a pistol grip in his meaty paws the gaping black mouth of the barrel was leveled at parkers head parkers face snapped around to focus on marcone at the same time as mine did parkers jaw clenched and his eyes narrowed to furious slits his weight shifted from one foot to the other as though he were preparing to throw the tire iron thats a twelvegauge riot gun mr parker marcone said im fully aware of your rather special endurance at this time of the month mr hendrickss weapon is loaded with solidslug ammunition and after several rounds have torn literal pounds of flesh from your body and ruptured the majority of your internal organs i am reasonably certain that even you would perish marcone smiled very politely while hendricks clicked the safety off of the weapon and settled his feet as though he expected firing the gun to knock him down please marcone said put down the tire iron parker glanced back at me and i could see the beast raging in his eyes wanting to howl out and bathe in blood it terrified me made me go cold right through my gut and down through my loins there was more fury and rage there than any of the other members of the streetwolves had demonstrated their own berserk losses of control had looked like a childs tantrum next to what i saw in parkers eyes but he controlled it he lowered his arm slowly and took two steps back from me and i felt my breath whisper out in a sigh of relief i wasnt dead yet my kick hadnt quite dragged the blanket off of me and i was still settled with my back against the steel post they didnt know that i was loose underneath the rough wool it wasnt much of an advantage but it was all i had i needed to find a way to use it and fast my people are coming parker growled if you try more of that heavyhanded shit ill have you torn apart they are coming marcone agreed placidly but they are not yet here their motorcycles have all suffered flat tires quite mysteriously we have time to do business i heard his shoes cross the concrete floor toward me and i looked up at him marcone met my eyes without fear a man in his mature prime his hair immaculately greying at the temples his custommade suit displaying a body kept fit in spite of the advancing years his eyes were the faded green of dollar bills and as opaque as mirrors hi john i said youve got good timing marcone smiled and you have a way with people dresden he said glancing at the silent parker with unveiled amusement you must have read a book im already reasonably certain as to your reaction but i thought i would give you another chance another chance to what i received a phone call today marcone said a harley macfinn somehow discovered my personal number he was quite irate he said that he knew that it was me who had destroyed his circle and set him up and that he was going to deal with me tonight id say youve had it then john harley can be fairly destructive i know i saw the news programs from the station last night a loupgarou is he i blinked how did you marcone waved a hand the report you gave to lieutenant murphy such things have to be paid for and thus copied and filed and copied and filed it wasnt hard to obtain a copy for myself i shook my head money isnt going to buy off harley macfinn quite marcone said and my parents god rest their souls were in no position to leave me anything much less articles of silver or id deal with him myself i have no idea who told him that i had wronged him or why but it seems perfectly clear that he believes it which brings us to you mr dresden he reached into that expensive italian jacket and drew out a folded sheaf of papersthe contract id seen before i want to make a deal with you i stared at him in silence the same stipulations as before marcone continued in addition i will promise you give you my personal oath that i will see to it that the pressure is taken off of lieutenant murphy i do have some friends in the mayors office and im certain something could be worked out i started to tell him to go to hell but bit back the words i was trapped at the moment if i ran parker would probably lose it and tear me apart and if he didnt marcone would just point his finger and the hulking mr hendricks would put me down with a twelvegauge slug and murphy in spite of recent misunderstandings was my friend or maybe it was more accurate to say that in spite of what had gone on lately i was still murphys friend saving her job getting the pressure from the politicians off of herisnt that why i had gotten involved in this to begin with wouldnt murphy thank me for helping her no i thought not like that she wouldnt want that kind of help magic she could accept help from money generated by human suffering graft and deception was a different story marcone looked good in his grey suit and his perfect hair and his manicured hands but he wasnt my own hands werent cleanbut they were free things were desperate and getting worse the longer i waited maybe i could pull off enough magic to get myself out of this i drew in a breath and focused on a pile of loose tools and metal parts on a workbench twenty feet away i gathered together threads of will feeling the pressure build with a sort of skewed intangibility to it something i hadnt ever felt before i focused on my goal on the rush of air that would lift the tools and parts and hurl them at marcone parker and hendricks like so many bullets and i prayed that i wouldnt catch myself in the edges of it by accident and get myself killed id be breaking the first law of magic if one of them died and i might have to deal with the white council later but hells bells i did not want to die on that concrete floor my head pounded but i pushed the pain aside focused and breathed out vento servitas the energy i had gathered whispered out of me the tools jumped and rattled in placeand then fell still again fire erupted behind my eyes the pain was blinding and i sucked in a breath and bowed my head forward struggling not to fall to one side and reveal my lack of ducttapedness oh stars it hurt like hell and i clenched my teeth to keep from crying out my chest heaved and strained to give me enough breath i blinked tears out of my eyes and straightened again facing marcone i didnt want him to see the weakness i didnt want him to know that my magic had failed interesting marcone said glancing at the workbench and then back at me perhaps youve been working too hard he suggested but im still willing to make the offer mr dresden otherwise you understand i have no interest in your wellbeing and i will be forced to leave you here with mr parker and his associates if you do not come to work for me youll die i glared up at marcone and gathered in a breath to spit out a curse at him to hell with him and his whole stinking breed of parasites polite and smiling bastards who didnt care about the lives they ruined the people they destroyed so long as business continued as usual if i was going to die here i was going to lay out a curse on marcone that would make the grimmest old fairy tales you ever heard sound like pleasant daydreams and then i glanced at parker who was glaring suspiciously at marcone and stifled the curse as well i lowered my head to hide my expression from marcone i had an idea he dies anyway parker growled hes mine you never said anything about him leaving with you marcone stood his mouth settled in a tight smile dont start with me parker marcone said ill take what i want to take last chance mr dresden this wasnt part of the deal parker said i need him ill kill you before i let you take him parker put one hand behind his back as though scratching at an itch i glanced over toward the office door behind him and saw flatnose crouched there in the doorway mostly shielded by the door and unnoticed perfect you neednt worry parker marcone said his tone satisfied he wont accept my offer hed rather die i lifted up my head and kept my expression as blank as i could give me a pen i said marcones mouth dropped open and it was an intense pleasure to see the surprise on his face what he said i enunciated each word carefully give me a pen ill sign your contract i glanced aside at parker and said more loudly anything to get away from these animals marcone stared at me for a moment and then reached toward his pocket i could see his eyes see him searching my expression the gears were spinning in his head as he tried to work out what i was doing parker let out a sudden scream of rage and hurled the tire iron at hendricks who dodged to one side too quickly for a man his size and lifted his weapon the office door exploded open and flatnose threw himself onto the big man they both went down to the concrete struggling for possession of the shotgun the wizards mine parker howled and threw himself at marcone marcone moved like a snake in his zilliondollar business suit and made a curved knife appear in his hands he swept it in an arc that was followed by a spray of blood from parkers wrist and the lycanthrope howled i got up and ran like hell toward the door my legs were shaky and my balance wasnt great but i was moving again and i thought i had a fair chance of getting away over to my left there was the roar of the shotgun going off and a wet red spray that went all over one wall and the ceiling i didnt stop to see who had been killed just jerked open the door agent phillip denton stood five feet away from me in the cold mist of autumn rain the veins in his forehead were throbbing and his short hair was frosted by the mist he was flanked by the potbellied agent wilson in his rumpled suit his mostly bald head shining and by the lean savagelooking woman benn her dark skin even darker in the evenings gloom and the glow of streetlights her sensuous mouth peeling back into a startled snarl denton blinked in surprise and then narrowed his intensely grey eyes the wizard mustnt escape he said his voice calm and precise kill him benns eyes gleamed and she hissed something under her breath while reaching a hand into her jacket wilson did the same i brought my forward momentum to a sudden halt fell and started scrambling back into the building but instead of drawing guns out of their jackets they changed it happened fast nothing like you see in the movies one moment there were two human beings standing there and the next there was a flicker of shadow and a pair of enormous gaunt wolves one the grey of benns mane one the same brown as wilsons receding hairline they were huge six feet long not including the tail and as high as my belly at their shoulders their entirely human eyes shone as did their bared fangs denton stood between them his eyes gleaming with some dark breed of joy and then he hissed throwing his hands toward me as though thrown by the motion both wolves hurtled forward i flung myself back through the door and slammed it closed there were heavy thuds as the wolves hit the door behind me i saw a motion to my right and threw myself down just before hendricks pulled the trigger the riot gun belched forth flame and huge sound and blew a hole the size of my face in the door behind me i could still hear parkers furious snarling somewhere in the dark and i scrambled forward behind the bulk of a car and then ran toward the back of the cavernous garage staying low outside there was the sudden thunder of a dozen engines and the sharp heavy sounds of gunfire evidently the streetwolves had returned i stumbled through the darkness and tried not to make enough sound to give someone a chance to shoot me the door flew open at the front of the garage letting in a flood of dim light that didnt help me much i heard people screaming i reached the back corner and sank down into it then grabbed at something that turned out to be a toolbox i came out with a heavy wrench and gripped it tightly i was alone id hurt myself using too much of my magic while on the gogo potion and i didnt have anything left to throw now except for the wrench in my hands i was unarmed all around me in the garage there were the sounds of gunshots and screams and thuds of flesh as the animals fought for control of the jungle and it was only a matter of time before one of them stumbled across a weakened and exhausted wizard named harry dresden talk about frying pans and fires chapter it couldnt possibly get any worse than this i thought i cowered in the corner clutching my captured wrench like a childs teddy bear with no way out and full of the knowledge that my magic had failed me oddly that thought troubled me more than probable death a lot more death was something that happened to everyoneonly the timing is different for each of us i knew that i would eventually die hell i even knew that i might die horribly but i had never thought that the magic would fail me more accurately i had never guessed that i might fail it i had pushed too hard and my body wouldnt conduct the power i needed to utilize the forces i was accustomed to commanding granted maybe i should have started with something smaller than a large and violent telekinesis but the indication was there that i had burned out some internal circuitry it might not ever come back it was a loss of identity i was a wizard it was more than just a job more than just a title wizardry was at the core of my being it was my relationship with my magic the way i used it the things it let me do that defined me shaped me gave me purpose i dwelled on these things while death danced over the concrete floor clutching them like a sailor clinging to the wreckage of his ship trying to ignore the storm that blasted it to pieces i noted peripheral details from my pathetic hiding place marcone made a break for one of the garage doors only to be pinned down behind a rusted truck by gunfire from some of the streetwolves hendricks joined him and a moment later the truck roared to life and crashed out through the garage door and into the gravel parking lot hendricks in the rear of the truck fired several blasts from the big shotgun back into the building while the streetwolves sent rounds skewing off after the truck the real battle though took place between the streetwolves and the fbi it was largely a gunfight denton was armed with his fbiissue automatic and what looked like an uzi submachine gun he cut down three of the lycanthropes with a swath of fire from the automatic weapon as he came in through the door and the two great wolves with him hurtled into the darkness screams and savage snarling erupted from the shadows and i could hear more of the lycanthropes dying being torn apart by the enormous wolves that had once been agents benn and wilson parker screamed orders somewhere in the dark half incoherent with rage denton reached into his jacket for a fresh clip for the uzi and i saw something across his belly that i noted for future reference should i have any future i watched the killing and i hid and i prayed that there would be an opportunity to flee toward the open doors of the garage before denton or parker noticed me it went on forever oh i knew in some rational part of my brain that only seconds were going by but it felt like days i was terrified and my head and my body hurt and i couldnt use magic to protect myself there was a sound near my ankle and my heart leapt up out of my throat i flinched violently away from it the sound repeated itself in a continuous scrabble of noise the floor i noticed was rough dirt and broken concrete in this corner where the foundation platform was flawed the scrabbling noise came from the very base of the wall where the dirt was stirring and moving something was trying to dig its way beneath the wall and into the garage practically right underneath my butt i felt a chill of fear followed swiftly by anger at the thing that had added to an already overabundant flow of adrenaline i clutched my makeshift weapon in hand and moved to crouch over the source of the disturbance lifting it in preparation to strike at whatever came through i saw it in the dimness and there was no mistaking the shape a paw a huge canine paw scrabbled at the earth digging out a shallow hole beneath the wall frustrated by bits of concrete that got in the way between shots i could hear animal sounds outside panting whimpers of eagerness it seemed whatever was out there wanted to dig its way inside and wanted it bad dig this i muttered and swung the wrench down on the paw hard there was an instant yelp of pain and the paw jerked its way back out from beneath the corrugatedmetal wall it was followed by a snarl and the paw appeared again whereupon i slammed the wrench down on it once more with similar results i heard a furious snarling sound from the other side and i released a small surge of vindictive satisfaction by leaning down close enough to the hole to say hah bring another one in here and ill give you the same i heard sounds outside for a moment then a crunch of gravel and tera wests smooth unmistakable voice wizard she hissed stop that i blinked startled and leaned down close to the hole tera is that you how did you know it was me you are the only man i ever met tera growled who would smash the paws that are trying to free you from certain death i flinched at another burst of gunfire from the far side of the garage i am going to tell them to dig again do not strike at their paws them i demanded them who but she didnt answer me instead the scrabbling sounds began again i looked over my shoulder at the rest of the room i saw streetwolves moving swiftly out through the door and the gaping hole marcone had left in the garage door when he escaped in a flash of automatic muzzleflare i saw denton standing over the form of a lanky woman and firing down into it apparently making absolutely certain that she would never rise again i had enough time to recognize lanas face now screwed up with pain rather than blood lust her body jerked and twitched as denton emptied the remainder of the clip into her and then everything went dark again by my feet the scrabbling sounds continuedand then broke off in a yelp i heard a series of vicious snarls and yelps from the halfdug hole beneath the wall and i cursed tera i whispered as loudly as i dared whats going on there was only more growling for answer and a sharp yelp that carried to the far side of the garage i threw myself flat behind the toolbox and a pile of junk just before a flashlight beam swept over the corner where i had been hiding its that bitch denton snarled rogers got her outside there was a whispering sound and a tingling feeling along my spine then a throaty sensual female voice purred parkers still in here so is that wizard i can smell them dammit denton growled the wizard knows too much wilson go help roger what about me lover the female voice said a husky laugh added to the end agent benn sounded like shed just had too much sex drugs and rock and roll and was hungry for more you and i stay in here ill cover the doors flush them toward me there was a mewling sound of pleasure from the woman come with me she urged change you know you love it so much you know how good it feels i could visualize dentons veins throbbing smarter for one of us to cover the door with a gun but there was a sort of heavy reluctance to his tone fuck smart benn purred come with me change its not why we did this not why we made the bargain benn made another sound utterly sexual in nature it doesnt matter now taste it she urged him taste the blood the light wavered and dropped from the corner where i hid i chanced a look up agent benn spattered in gore stood before denton in the wash of his flashlight from the floor she had three of her fingers pressed together and was sliding them between his lips denton was shaking and his eyes were squeezed tightly closed he suckled at her fingers something frighteningly erotic in the motion one of the huge gaunt beasts from earlier wilson i supposed stood nearby watching the pair of them with gleaming eyes denton made a growling sound and grasped benn by her mane of greying hair jerking her chin up so that he could nuzzle and lick at the blood smeared over her throat she laughed and arched into him her hips undulating against him in urgent motions change she moaned change do it there was a howl of rage and flash of motion and parker staggered from the darkness one arm dangling uselessly a heavy knife in his other hand and defiance and insane anger in his glazed eyes denton and benn looked up and then they reached to their waists flickered and changed into a pair of the nightmaresized wolves their eyes glowing in the ambient light jaws dropping open to reveal lolling tongues and vicious fangs parker lurched forward greasy hair flying and the three wolves leapt on him i stared in a sort of sickened fascination the wolves buried him under a mound of fangs and fur and blood and absolute fury he screamed the knife flailing and then it was cast aside out of his hands to land spinning on the floor not far from me parker tried to fight tried to struggle up and kick but it was hopeless there were flashes of blood and he screamed again and went still and then the wolves started to eat him they bit off chunks of muscle and gulped them down ripping aside clothing to get to more meat they snarled and snapped at one another and one of the males mounted the female even as she continued to tear at the body burrowing her muzzle down through the layers of stomach muscle to get at the vitals my gorge rose and if id had anything in my stomach i would have emptied it onto the concrete floor instead i turned back to the halffinished hole in the floor and started digging at it with my wrench frantic i didnt want to be the next thing on the menu there were more yelps from outside more growls and i opened the hole up enough that i thought i might be able to get out i flattened myself down and wormed my way into the dirt the corrugated metal scraping at my back my wounded shoulder paining me again i jerked my way out into the open air to find myself in an alley behind the garage dimly lit by a distant streetlight there were wolves everywhere three wolves smaller than the ones i had seen before were spread in a loose ring about a great russetfurred beast with batlike ears the great wolfs coat was spattered with blood and two of the smaller wolves lay nearby yelping in pain stirring weakly blood matting their coats tera was a part of the ring around the great beast as well naked and lean a length of pipe held in either hand when the great wolf turned toward one of the others the rest would begin to close in around him and he would spin jaws flashing trying to pin down one of those who encircled him you took your time wizard tera snarled without looking back at me i got to my feet wrench in hand and shook my head to clear it of cold sweat tera i said weve got to get out of here denton and the others will be coming go she responded help macfinn we will hold them the great russet wolf lunged at her and she skittered back cooly staying a hairs breadth from his fangs she fetched him a sharp blow across the nose with more speed than i could have believed and a contemptuous snort the three smaller wolves rushed the great beast and he spun to drive them back and away from him drawing a yelp from one that wasnt swift enough to entirely evade his jaws you cant stop them all i said theres three more like this one there are pack on the ground she snarled and jerked her head toward the wounded wolves we do not abandon our own i let out an acid curse i needed tera she could confirm everything help me sort out all my facts make sure that i understood what was going on she was offering to give her life for me to stay and occupy denton and the others for as long as she and her compatriots could but i had seen enough people dying already tonight i wasnt going to accept another loss on my behalf and i was abruptly more furious than afraid id been run around and treated like a piece of baggage or a choice item on the menu for long enough id flailed around in the dark and been helpless and ineffective for way too long too many people had been hurt too much suffering caused by creatures of magic and the night things that i should have been handling it didnt matter to me at that moment that i couldnt work any of my spells against them i might not have any magic available to me but that didnt make me any less of a wizard one of the magi the wise thats the true power of a wizard i know things knowledge is power with power comes responsibility that made the entire thing pretty simple i clutched the wrench in my hand took a deep breath and threw myself forward at the great wolfs back the huge wolf sensed me coming spun with abrupt speed and met me in the air it slammed me down to the concrete and bent its jaws toward my throat i heard tera cry out and she and the other wolves moved forwardbut they would never have been able to get to the thing before it killed me that wasnt the point i jammed the wrench into the wolfs jaws feeling some teeth tear at one of my fingers as i did the wolf snarled and jerked the wrench out of my hands it spun end over end away from me and the great beast turned back toward me its eyes glowing i had time to watch it all in great detail the wolfs power its speed simply shocked me it was huge quick and i didnt have a prayer against it the distant streetlight gleamed off of its reddened fangs as its muzzle sped toward my throat chapter the wolfs fur was speckled with drops of blood that had beaded on it like rain the gravel in the alley shone in the halflight from the distant street lamps the wolfs muzzle a little shorter and broader than i had seen on wild kingdom was drawn back black lips from fangs striped white and red like peppermints its eyes were blue rather than any proper lupine shade and gleamed with a sort of demented awareness i had time to see all those details because i didnt need my eyes for what i wanted to do i thrust my hands into the beasts pelt as he went for my throat and wormed my way down between his forelegs with my buttocks fingers digging until i felt what i was looking forthe sharp metal edges of a belt buckle down against the skin almost flush to the surface as the wolfs jaws came toward my throat i furiously worked the buckle feeling skin rip and tear from the wolfs hide as i jerked it open and then threw my arm to one side clutching hard at the trailing strap and abruptly a wolfpelt belt was sliding out from beneath the grey suit jacket of roger harris the forensic specialist for the local fbi office the kid with the red hair and the big ears he crouched over me for a second blinking in stunned amazement at me blood on his mouth and lips hexenwulf jerkoff i snarled and slammed my knee up into his groin it hit home hard harris gasped and rolled off me reaching into his jacket but i didnt let him get his gun i stayed with him keeping too close to him to let him move his arms freely grabbed him by those big ears and started slamming his head repeatedly against the gravel he struggled against me for a few seconds but id taken him by surprise his skull banged against the rocks over and over and after a halfdozen solid blows he stopped struggling i released his ears with a little jerk and looked up at tera and the wolves they were closing in around him like a pack of sharks around a wounded dolphin and i could read the blood in their eyes in the bared fangs and in the whiteknuckled grip of teras hands on her lead pipes i felt a sudden surge of frustration bad enough to have bloodthirsty animals roaming all over the cityi didnt need more of them on my team everyone back off i snarled hes ours tera answered me in kind he hurt those of the pack then why dont you get them some help instead of wasting your time on this guy i said his blood is ours tera said and the wolves confirmed this with a chorus of angry growls he cant hurt you now killing him wont make your friends any better and the lost time might finish them you do not understand wizard tera snarled and the wolves echoed her in a chorus white fangs showing it is our way i stood up slowly to my full height i understand i said in a very low and even voice that you do not want to make me any more angry than i already am i met teras eyes and stared hard my jaws ached from clenching theres been enough killing take him out now and youre no different than he is wrong tera said i would be alive and he dead not if you cross me you wont be we held the tension for a moment glaring at one another i saw uncertainty waver across her face she didnt know that i was out of gas magically speaking and she had seen me do too many impressive things with my powers to want to defy me lightly she blinked first and looked away from me with a sullen sound in the back of her throat as you wish wizard she said we dont have the time to waste fighting one another the rest of his pack is coming and we have wounded to tend to i nodded and swept my gaze around at the three wolves around me anybody else i challenged they all backed away from me and didnt meet my eyes all right then i said and stooped to recover harriss gun and the wolfpelt belt do you have transportation out of here yes tera said georgia one of the wolves a leggy lanky palebrown beast shuddered and paced in a circle making small whimpering sounds a moment later there was a whisper of power the shewolf shivered and went still her head bowed and then she shook herself and all that palebrown hair faded from paler skin leaving me staring at the lanky darkblonde girl i had seen in the department store a few days ago sans all the black leather georgia rose to her feet and said ill have her bring the van around on the next street can you get them to it her expression was tense her eyes a little wide yes tera said everyone come back to yourselves the other two ambulant wolves began to pace in a slow circle gathered their own power and their own transformations commenced until they stood before me as a pair of naked young menone of them the short stout boy who had been arguing against georgiabillyand the other a face i recognized but couldnt name tera took charge of the situation while i held harriss gun and kept watch down the alley she and the two young men made a litter for one of the wolves out of harriss jacket and the other tera simply picked up with a flexion of wiretight muscle and carried though it must have weighed a hundred and fifty pounds the wounded wolves yelped piteously and tera and the two young men cast dark glances at the downed harris while they headed down the alley and over toward the beach leaving me alone with the kid i hunkered down beside him and slapped his face until his eyes rolled open he blinked once and then jerked as though he was about to sit up i stuck the barrel of the semiautomatic in the hollow of his throat and said in a calm voice hold still he froze staring up at me with wide eyes im going to ask some questions kid i think ive got the answers already but youre going to talk to me quietly and honestly or i demonstrate pointblank bullet impact for you right here and now got it harriss mouth twitched a few times before he managed to speak if you kill me he said denton wont stop until youre dead give me a break roger i said back in a reasonable tone denton wants me dead anyway i could kill you now and it wouldnt make any difference in what he has to do roger licked his lips and rolled his eyes about without moving his head as though hoping for rescue how did you know about the belt i saw dentons inside and i saw that before you all changed you had to reach inside your jackets for something i figure that first night agent benn was reaching into her jacket to touch the belt and tear murphys head off when she got mad but she managed to remember not to do it in time and drew her gun instead right harriss head twitched in a slight nod the bargain i said youre hexenwulfen so youve made a bargain with someone to get the power to change to get the belts who is it i dont know harris said and his eyes widened god i dont know denton handled all of it i narrowed my eyes at him and drew back the hammer on the gun please he squealed breathless i dont know i swear to god denton handled all of that he just came to us asked us if we wanted to back him if we wanted to nail some of the scum that kept getting away from the law and i told him i did jesus i didnt know it was going to lead to this lead to what roger i asked my tone frosty start from the beginning and make it quick marcone he said eyes on the gun it was all about marcone denton wanted to take him down you mean kill him his eyes flickered up to me he told us there was no other way to get to him that he was doing more to poison this city than anyone alive and he was right marcones bought enough influence in this town to stay clear of city police forever and he carries weight on the national level too the bureau has had more than one investigation on him called off hes untouchable so you planned to use the belts to kill him he nodded but there would be evidence no one would believe hed just been mauled by wild dogs there would be a full investigation forensics the works i understood and nodded so you needed someone to make it a neat package let me guess the streetwolves harris showed his teeth a gang of felons and troublemakers with a wolf motif murder of a criminal figure by persons with a wolf motif no one would bother to check the figures on that one its obvious and we get one more dangerous group off the street yeah roger except that theyd be innocent of that particular crime did you think of that innocent like those other people who died the nights around the full moon last month you killed them you and the rest of dentons team he closed his eyes his face going pale and he shuddered the change when when youre changed when youre a beast its so incredible so much speed power your body just sings with it i tried coke once in college and it was nothing compared to this the blood his tongue flicked out again over his bloodstained lips a thirsty motion this time rather than a nervous one i think im starting to see denton didnt tell you about that part about how your thoughts are influenced he probably didnt know himself and when youve done it once harris nodded emphatically you just cant stop man it gets to where youre pacing the room at night and its better than sleep when you get finished hunting you feel so alive he opened his eyes again staring up at me pleading i didnt mean to kill those people we started off with criminals some gangsters dealing drugs we were just going to scare them but it was too much they screamed and ran and we were after them and we killed them and my god dresden it was beautiful and it happened again i said a couple of times innocent people just poor schmucks in the wrong place at the wrong time harris turned his head away from me and nodded denton said that we could salvage it he said that we could pin those killings on the streetwolves as well make everyone think they had done it and we just went along with him i shook my head that doesnt explain why you dragged macfinn into this denton the kid said it was all him he said there was someone else we could also set up to take the blame to be certain wed be in the clear that he had the man for it we broke into macfinns house and there was all this occult stuff we messed up some of it and left and the next night more people were dead and more the next night thats when we went after that slime marcones business partner and wasted the bastard and his goon and then you laid low for a month harris swallowed and nodded denton took the belts he hid them from us hed held out better than anyone and my god poor benn was so far gone it was like she wasnt even human anymore wilson wasnt much better but we lasted out the month and then you killed marcones bodyguard at the varsity harriss eyes flared yes you should see his record the things we know he did but that we cant get through a court my god dresden he had it coming maybe maybe not who are we to judge who are we not to harris demanded the power was in our hands we had a responsibility to use it for the good to do our jobs hell dresden if youre such a dogooder you should be helping us not getting in the way these men are untouchable and you know it i shifted my weight uncomfortably i dont agree with your methods with setting people up to take the blame for your killings harris sneered like macfinn has never killed anyone hell hes a murderer now isnt he after that scene at the police station anyone would be convinced he was a killer except me i said macfinn would never have been there if you hadnt messed up the circle that held him yeah harris said a spiteful frustrated edge to his tone except you you got to poking around in our business christ that crazy report to murphy even talked about the belts that was when denton started taking you seriously if you had any brains at all youd pull that trigger and get the hell out now before denton and the others come out of the haze and come after you because you know way too much why the streetwolves i said instead of shooting him why send me off to check them out denton figured theyd kill you harris spat and get you out of our hair i nodded it figured that someone else had been trying to kill me the whole while and i hadnt really noticed and he knew that they were after me after i got away from them the first time yeah and had me tailing them so we could find you and make sure you were dead when i saw you in the back of that car i figured you were so we planned the hit on the streetwolves to go down tonight before macfinn went after marcone howd you know about that i asked harris snorted marcone told us the snake called asking for police protection i almost smiled did he get it hell no harris answered me he lifted his chin and balled his hands into fists and i felt him tighten up beneath me im done talking he said if you arent going to sign on with us then get the hell out of here or pull the trigger but quit wasting my time im not done talking i said and i jammed the gun crosswise over the kids throat strangling him youre going to give denton a message for me im sick of dancing around tell him that hell get his shot at me at moonrise at marcones place harris squirmed beneath me making rasping gagging sounds his eyes widened at my words it doesnt take a genius to figure out that hell try to be there when macfinn shows up i said that hell want to make sure everyone there is dead so that hes the only one who can report what happened you tell him that ill be there and tell him that hes not going to get away with it do you understand me kid i let up on the pressure and harris croaked out a vague affirmative i rose away from him keeping the gun in one hand and the belt in the other i saw his eyes flicker to the belt tracking its movement with a tense strained sort of hunger why tell me the kid asked why warn us i stared down at him for long seconds before i answered him in a quiet voice because i dont like what youre doing what you are you arent using the power youve been given its using you youre turning into animals youre using savagery and fear to try to uphold the peace now its your turn to see what its like to be afraid harris rose to his feet his red hair askew blood drying on his mouth and backed several paces from me his eyes darting around my belt he said i want my belt forget it kid i told him the smartest thing you can do is go lock yourself in your room and stay there until all of this is over because one way or another you arent using this belt again his face whitened and he took a step toward me i pointed the gun at him and he froze his hands balling into fists you wont get away with this he said his voice thick with tension moonrise i told him then turned on my heel and walked quickly from the alley although my sock feet on the gravel combined with my limp probably spoiled the badass image thirty feet down the alley tera appeared from the shadows and fell into step beside me close enough to support me if i should fall you were wrong wizard she said i looked down at her and she met my gaze with her soulless amber eyes how so they have not become animals she looked over her shoulder her eyes narrowed animals do not do what they have done animals kill to eat to defend themselves or their own and to protect their territory not for the joy of it not for the lust of it she looked back up at me only humans do that wizard i grimaced but couldnt really refute her i guess youre right of course tera said we walked in silence for a moment you will try to help my fiancé ill try i said but i cant let his curse claim any more lives she nodded her eyes dark he would want it that way he thinks of others before himself he sounds like a good man she shrugged but there was a sudden worried weight in her shoulders and these others the fbi they will try to stop you yes and when they do i cant let them go on like they have theyre out of control i dont think they can stop themselves from killing now i didnt look down at tera just focused on taking steps one at a time when they do i said when they do i guess im going to need to get very human chapter tera and i walked toward the shores of lake michigan there along fortyninth street idled a big old van its engine rattling its headlights came on as we approached and the driver got out to roll open the side door for us harry she said oh god what did they do to you she hurried over to me and then i felt susans warmth against me as she slid one of my arms over her shoulder and pressed up against my side she was wearing jeans that showed off her long legs and a dark red jacket that complemented her dark skin her hair was tied back into a ponytail and it made her neck look slender and vulnerable susan felt soft and warm beyond belief and smelled clean and delightfully feminine and i found myself leaning against her all the aches and pains that had faded into the background came throbbing back to the forefront of my awareness in comparison to her soft warmth and gentle support i liked the way susan felt better than the way i did they beat him tera explained but they kept him alive as i told you they might your face looks like a sack of purple potatoes susan said her dark eyes studying me the lines in her face deepening you say the sweetest things i mumbled they loaded me into the van where georgia billy and the other alphas were crouched two of the young people a boy with blinking watery blue eyes and a girl with mousy brown hair lay on their backs gasping quietly clean white bandages had been wrapped around their wounds georgia had evidently been the attending medic all of the alphas were dressed in plain dark bathrobes rather than in their birthday suits and i felt an oddly grateful feeling toward them for it things were weird enough without needing to ride around in a van with a bunch of naked somewhat geeky college students i put my seat belt on and noted the bruises on my hands and forearmsugly dark purpleandbrown splotches so thickly scattered over my skin that in places i couldnt tell where one stopped and the next began i sat down and leaned against the window pillowing my head on my right hand what are you doing here with these people i asked susan when she got into the drivers seat driving she said i was the only one old enough to rent the van i winced ouch tell me about it she said and started the engine after you jumped out of the car and i finished with my heart attack we called the police just like you said tera went to look for you and told me that the police had shown up too late and that the streetwolves had taken you how did that truck crash like that bad luck someone made all their tires explode at the same time susan gave me an arch look and started up the van those bastards just lie still harry you look like a train wreck well get you to someplace quiet food i said im starving tera can you keep track of moonrise i will she said the clouds are moving away i can see the stars fantastic i mumbled and then i went to sleep ignoring the jostling of the van i didnt wake up until the smell of fried grease and charred meat made me look up at the drivethru window of a fastfood burger joint susan paid for everything in cash passing paper sacks to everyone i snagged a golden paper crown from one of the bags and idly joined it into a circle and put it on my head susan blinked at me then let out a brief laugh i am i intoned with an imperious narrowing of my eyes the burger king susan laughed again shaking her head and tera gave me a serious level gaze i checked the status of the young people in the back of the van and found them even the wounded ones hungrily wolfing no pun intended down the food tera caught the direction of my glance and leaned toward me puppies she said as though the word should explain more than it did they were not hurt so badly as they thought they will hardly have scars to show for it thats good to know i said and sipped at my cola and chomped down steaminghot french fries but what im really interested in i said is in knowing why your blood was in marcones restaurant the night before the full moon tera took the hamburger patty off of the bun and started nibbling on it holding it in her fingers ask another time no offense i said but im not so sure theres going to be another time so tell me tera took another bite of meat and then shrugged i knew that the pack that had harassed my fiancé was about i deduced where they might strike and went there to attempt to stop them all by yourself tera sniffed most of those who turn themselves into wolves know little about being wolf wizard but these had taken too much of the beast inside i ran through the window glass and fought but they outnumbered me i left before i could be killed and what about these kids i said nodding toward the back of the van she glanced back at them and for a moment i saw warmth and pride gleaming in her eyes subverting the remote alien lines of her face children but with strong hearts they wished to learn and i taught let them tell you their tale maybe later i said and finished off the french fries where are we going to a safe place to arm and prepare ourselves myself i contradicted her to prepare myself im not taking you with me you are incorrect tera said i am going with you no she fastened her amber eyes on mine you are strong wizard but you have not yet seen my beast the men you will oppose would take my fiancé from me i will not allow that i will be with you or you will kill me to stop me this time it was i who looked away first i sipped at my drink scowling while tera placidly ate more of the hamburger patty who are you i asked her finally one who has lost too many of her family already she said and then she settled back on the seat and withdrew from the conversation falling silent one who has lost too many i grumbled frustrated mocking her beneath my breath i turned back to the front of the van and hunched my shoulders over my burger put some clothes on you weird yelloweyed tabledancing werewolftraining cryptic staremerightintheeyesanddontevenblink wench there was a hissing sound from the back seat and i flicked a scowl back over my shoulder tera was chewing on her meat her eyes were shining her mouth was curved at the corners and her breath was puffing out her nostrils in nearsilent laughter the safe place we were going to turned out to be a big house up near the gold coast not far from marcones own minipalace the house wasnt large by the neighborhoods standards but that was like saying that a bale of hay isnt much to eat by elephant standards susan drove the van up through a break in a high hedge up a long driveway of white concrete and into a sixcar garage whose doors rolled majestically up before us i got out of the van in the garage and stared at the mercedes and the suburban also parked in it where are we i said tera opened the side door of the van and georgia billy and the other young man emerged assisting the two wounded werewolves georgia stretched which did interesting things to the dark bathrobe and drew her mane of tawny hair back from her lean face with one hand its my parents place theyre in italy for another week i rubbed a hand over my face they arent going to mind you having a party are they she flashed me an annoyed look and said not as long as we clean up all the blood come on billy lets get these two inside and into bed you go on he said fastening his eyes on me ill be along in a minute georgia looked like she wanted to give him an argument but shook her head instead and with the help of the other young man took the two invalids inside tera still naked and supremely unconcerned about it followed them glancing back over her shoulder at me before she disappeared susan promptly stepped in front of me somewhat obstructing the view and said five minutes dresden come find me then uh was my rapier reply and then susan went into the house too i stood in the dark with billy the stout short kid in thick glasses he had his hands stuffed into his bathrobe pockets and he was peering at me do all wizards he said get the kiddie crowns and wear them around or is that only for special occasions do all werewolves i shot back snatching the crown from my head wear glasses and too much old spice or is that only for full moons he grinned at me rather than taking umbrage youre quick he said i always wanted to be that way he stuck out his hand toward me billy borden i traded grips with him wearily and he tried to crush my hand in his harry dresden i told him you look pretty beat up mr dresden he said are you sure you can handle going out again tonight no i answered in a spurt of brutal honesty billy nodded and pushed his glasses up higher onto his nose then you need our help oh good grief the mickey mouse club of werewolves wanted to throw in on my side werewolfkateer role call billy georgia tommy cindy sheesh no way i said absolutely not why not he said look kid you dont know what these hexenwulfen can be like you dont know what marcone can be like and you sure as hell have never seen anything like macfinn outside of a movie theater and even if you had the skills to deal with it what makes you think you have a right to be going along billy considered the question seriously the same thing that makes you think that you do mr dresden he said i opened my mouth and closed it again i know i dont know a lot compared to you billy said but im not stupid ive got eyes i see some things everyone else tries to pretend arent there this vampire craze sweeping the nation why the hell shouldnt there be some genuine vampires in it did you know that violent crimes have increased nearly forty percent in the last three years mr dresden murder alone has almost doubled particularly in heavy urban areas and isolated rural areas abductions and disappearances have gone up nearly three hundred percent i blinked at the kid i hadnt really read the numbers i knew that murphy and some of the other cops said that the streets were getting worse and i knew myself on some deep level that the world was getting darker hell it was one of the reasons i did idiotic things like i was doing tonight my own effort to lift up a torch im sort of a pessimist mr dresden i think that people are almost too incompetent to hurt themselves so badly i mean if criminals were trying they couldnt increase their production by three hundred percent and i hear stories read the tabloids sometimes so what if the supernatural world is making a comeback what if that accounts for some of what is going on what if it does i asked him billy regarded me steadily without looking me in the eyes someone has to do something i can so i should thats why were here the alphas tera offered us the chance to do something when she met us through the northwest passage project and we took it i stared at the kid i could have argued with him but there wouldnt be much point to it i knew his argument backward and forward id worked it out myself if i was ten years younger a foot shorter and a couple of pounds heavier that could have been me talking and i had to admit the kid did have power i mean turning yourself into a wolf is no cheap parlor trick but i did have one angle to play and i took it i didnt want this kids blood on my hands i dont think youre ready for the big leagues yet billy could be he said but theres no one else in the bull pen i had to give the kid credit he had resolve maybe you should sit this one out and live to fight another day it could all go bad and if it does those hexenwulfen we took on down by the beach are going to be coming for you someone will need to stay with your wounded people to protect them more likely if they go through you theyre going to go through us too it would be smarter to pile on everything weve got in one place with you i chuckled all your eggs in one basket he shook his head all the money on the most likely winner i studied him in silence for a long minute i was confident of his sincerity it just oozed out of him in a way that only the really inexperienced and idealistic can manage it was comforting and at the same time it was the most frightening thing about him his ignorance no not ignorance really innocence he didnt know what he would be going out to face if i let him go along id be dragging him down with me despite what hed seen tonight id be exposing him to a whole new violent bloody and dangerous world one way or another if i let billy borden and his buddies go with me these innocent children wouldnt live to see the sunrise but god help me he was right about one thing i needed the help everyone whos going takes orders from me i said and he drew in a sharp breath his eyes gleaming not tera you do what i say and you do it when i say it and if i tell you to leave you go no questions you got it i got it billy said and gave me a cocky grin that simply did not belong on the face of a geeky little college nerd in a black bathrobe youre a smart man mr dresden i snorted at him and just then the automatic light on the garage door opener went out leaving us in darkness there was a disgusted sound from the doorway and then the lights came on again georgia in all her willowy annoyed glory was standing in the doorway to the garage billy borden she said dont you have any better sense than to stay here in the dark she stalked out toward him scowling he looked up at her calmly and said tell everyone were going along dresdens in charge if they can handle that theyre in and if not theyre staying here to guard cindy and alex georgias eyes widened and she gave a little whoop of excitement she turned to me and threw her arms around me for a moment making my shoulder scream in pain and then whirled to billy and bent down to do the same thing he winced when she did and she stood up and jerked back his black bathrobe clearing it off of one side of his pale chest to give the kid credit his stoutness was the result of what looked like quite a bit of solid muscle and along the line of his chest there was a thickly clotted wound still trickling blood in a few places whats this georgia said you idiot you didnt tell me youd gotten hurt billy shrugged and pulled his robe straight again it closed and you cant bandage it and keep it on me when i change anyway georgia clucked her teeth annoyed you shouldnt have gone for the hamstring on that wolf he was too fast billy flashed her a grin i almost got him though you almost got yourself killed she said but her voice had softened a few shades i noticed that she hadnt moved her hand from the other side of billys chest and he was looking up at her with an expectant expression she fell silent and they stared at one another for a minute i saw her swallow please help me young werewolves in love i turned to walk into the house moving carefully i had never much believed in god well thats not quite true i believed that there was a god or something close enough to it to warrant the nameif there were demons there had to be angels right if there was a devil somewhere there had to be a god but he and i had never really seen things in quite the same terms all the same i flashed a look up at the ceiling i didnt say or think any words but if god was listening i hoped he got the message nonetheless i didnt want any of these children getting themselves killed chapter susans perfume led me to her she was waiting for me in a bedroom on the first floor she stood in the simply furnished room in her jeans and a white tshirt blazoned with the words eat it i wouldnt sit on it it was one of mine she lifted her chin up high when she saw me as though trying to keep the tears in her eyes from falling our gazes met and held we had looked into one another before more than a year ago shed fainted when she saw what was inside of me through the soulgaze i dont know what it was she saw i dont look too hard into mirrors inside of her though id seen passion like id rarely known in people other than myself the motivation to go to do to act it was what drove her forward digging up stories of the supernatural for a halfcomic rag like the arcane she had a gift for it for digging down into the muck that people tried to ignore and coming up with facts that werent always easily explained she made people think it was something personal for heri knew that much but not why susan was determined to make people see the truth i shut the door behind me and limped toward her theyll kill you she said dont go as i reached her she put her hands against my chest then her cheek ive got to denton cant afford to let me live now i need to finish this business before it gets any more out of hand before more people die if i dont go tonight denton will be able to kill marcone and macfinn and set macfinn up for all the killings hell get away clean and then hell be able to focus on me and maybe on you too we could go somewhere she said quietly we could hide i blinked my eyes closed shed said we she hadnt really done that much before i hadnt really thought in those terms either i hadnt much thought in those terms for a lot of years not since the last time i should have said something about it acknowledged the implication i knew it was there and she knew that i had noticed it she held still waiting instead i said im not much good at hiding neither are you her breath went out in a little whisper and i felt her tighten a little against me there would be tears on my shirt i knew but i didnt look down at her youre right she said a moment later her voice was shaking and i know you are but im afraid harry i mean i know we havent been really close friends and lovers but work i said i closed my eyes she nodded work her fingers tightened on my shirt and she looked up at me dark eyes swimming with tears still more on the smooth lines of her cheek i dont want to lose you now i dont want the work to be all thats left i tried to think of something smart to say something that would reassure her calm her help her to feel better to understand what i felt for her but i wasnt even sure what it was that i felt i found myself kissing her the rough growth on my mouth and chin brushing her soft skin she tensed at first and then melted against me with a deliciously feminine sort of willingness a soft abandoning of distance that left her body in all its dark beauty pressed against mine the kiss deepened slowed became something intense and erotic and selfcontained the motion of our lips the warmth of our bodies pressed together the touch of my fingertips on her face featherlight the scratch of her nails as her fingers kneaded at my shirt my heart was pounding and i could feel hers too racing she broke the kiss first and i swayed on my feet my breath gone without speaking she guided me down to the edge of the bed and sat me there then she vanished into the bathroom reappearing with a basin of warm water some soap and a washcloth she undressed me slowly delicately she changed the bandages murmuring softly to me when it hurt kissing my eyes and forehead to soothe me she bathed me with the water its warmth washing away the dried sweat the blood and some of the pain patiently more gentle than rain she made me clean while i drifted my eyes closed i could hear myself make a soft sound now and then in response to her touches i felt her come to me felt her bare skin against mine hot and smooth i opened my eyes and saw the silver haze of the moon on the far horizon across the lake i saw susan outlined in it all sweetly feminine curves and lines a beautiful shadow she kissed me again and i returned it in kind and it was a liquid smooth thing as restrained and desperate as the nearstill surface of a rushing river her lips passed from my mouth and roamed over the skin she had just cleaned and when i tried to touch her she gently pressed my hands back down telling me without words to be still it went on like that all skin and light touches soft sighs pounding hearts until she settled atop me keeping her weight off me with her legs her hands afraid to cause any pain we moved together feeling the power of our need our hunger for one another a pure blend of desire and warmth and affection and incredible intimacy that shook us to the core it ended in silence the sensation all the more piercing for that our mouths together our breath mingling she lay down beside me until our pounding hearts slowed down then she rose and said i dont know if i want to fall in love with you harry i dont know if i could stand it i opened my eyes and answered softly ive never wanted to hurt you i dont know whats right i know what feels right she said and kissed me again then started touching my forehead lifting her head up to study me with gentle compassionate eyes you see so much pain i just wanted to remind you that there was something else in the world im a pretty tough guy i mean look at me i can handle some rough stuff but some things im not so tough about i started crying hard and susan held me rocked me gently until the tears had gone away i wanted to stay there where it was warm and where i was clean and where there wasnt anyone dying there wasnt any blood or snarling animals and no one was trying to kill me i liked the idea of being there with susan in her arms a whole lot more than i liked the idea of going out into the silver light of the full moon which was growing greater underneath the horizon coming up in a hazy nimbus instead i drew away from her a little and sat up it was a fools moon she rose from the bed and returned with an overnight bag and drew out a pair of my black jeans my black sneakers socks a heavy dark grey shirt dark undies to complete the color theme and bless her heart ibuprofen i rose to dress but she pressed a hand on my shoulder and made me sit downthen dressed me herself slowly and carefully her attention focused on the task neither of us spoke ever had a beautiful naked woman dress you talk about girding your loins for battle there was something indescribably soothing and at the same time exciting about it i could feel my body becoming more relaxed and aware my senses more in tune with what was around me i heard footsteps in the hall and a knock at the door teras voice called wizard it is time i stood up but susan grabbed my wrist harry she said wait a minute she knelt down by the bag and drew out a heavy box flat and broad i was going to give it to you for your birthday but i thought you could use it i tilted my head and took the box in hand it was heavy what is it i asked her just open it dummy she answered smiling up at me i did and inside was the smell of soft worked leather sensuous and thick wrapped up in translucent paper i tossed the lid aside took the paper off and found dark leather new and matte black hardly casting back the light i took it out of the box and it unfolded into a heavy long coat like my own duster in design even to the mantle around the shoulders and arms but all made of the finer material i blinked at the coat it must have cost you a fortune she laughed wickedly yeah but i got to wear it around naked just to feel it on my skin her face sobered i want you to have it harry something from me for luck she glided to my side and helped me into the coat the coat settled around me with a comforting heaviness and a peculiar sort of familiarity it just felt right i plucked my mothers pentacle on its chain from beneath my shirt and wore it openly and then i got harriss confiscated side arm from my coveralls tool pouch and put it in the coats pocket i didnt have any other magical tools and maybe not even any more magic the gun all things considered seemed an uncertain weapon at best but i was as ready as i was going to be i turned to say goodbye to susan to find her hurriedly stepping into her clothes what are you doing i asked getting dressed she said why someones got to drive the van dresden she tugged on her tshirt slung her jacket over her shoulder and walked past me pausing to give me a narrow glance besides this could be the biggest paranormal event ive ever had the chance to cover did you expect me to stay behind she pushed the door open and gave me an expectant look damn i thought and double damn one more person to worry about one more person to protect susan wasnt a werewolf she wasnt a wizard she didnt even have a gun it was crazy to let her even think about going along but i found myself wanting to make sure she was somewhere close all right i said but the same rules i gave the kids im in charge you do what i say when i say or you stay here susan pursed her lips and narrowed her eyes i kind of like the sound of that she said teasing me i like that look on you too have you ever thought about growing a beard then she smiled and vanished out into the hallway i scowled after her shed stay away from the worst of it id make sure of that if i had to tie her to the van myself i muttered something grouchy bent my head to one side and inhaled smelling the smell of new leather of fresh clothes and soap and of eau de susan still lingering on my skin i liked it the jacket creaked as i started forward and i caught sight of myself in the dresser mirror my double the one from the dream stared back out at me only the roughness of the threeday growth of dark whiskers and the bruises were at contrast with the subconsciousmes neatly trimmed beard everything else was precisely the same i turned my face away rather quickly and paced from the room out to the van where the others were waiting show time chapter the moon rose in silver splendor into an october sky strewn with pale clouds and brilliant stars the clouds churned a whitefoam sea and the moon was a vast graceful clipper ship its sails full of spectral light as it ran before the strength of the cold autumn winds pale light bleached each of the uncut stones on the ninefoot wall around gentleman johnny marcones estate making edges sharper shadows blacker until it looked like a barrier made of gaping white skulls trees grew up thick on the other side of the wall blocking the view of the interior though no branches extended far enough to provide a way to climb over it weve got to get over the wall i said to the enormous dark wolf beside me keeping my voice low as we all crouched in the shadows of the bushes across the street from marcones estate there will be security on it maybe cameras maybe infrared beams maybe something else i want you to find us a way past it the wolf flickered her amber eyes toward me and made a soft assenting growl then she simply turned and faded into the darkness leaving five more furry crouching shapes grouped around me the alphas didnt exactly inspire confidence but they had all managed to master enough rudimentary magic to transform themselves into very very close approximations of wolves at least it was something susan had parked the van on a hill leading up to marcones estate and remained with it in case we needed a quick getaway when wed arrived a nude tera west and five young people three female and two male had leapt out of the van the alphas hurriedly tumbling out of their robes hells bells id complained were on a public street can you be something besides naked here people tera had smirked and in a liquid shimmer become a gaunt dark wolf a beast fully as large as denton and his cronies had been but with a narrower muzzle and cleaner proportions like denton and his crew of hexenwulfen she kept the exact same shade and color of her eyes even in wolfish form well id demanded of the others lets hurry it up georgia had slipped her lean body from her dark robe and melted in a few seconds into her wolf shape then had quickly slipped past me to go to tera billy had growled something under his breath as he shrugged out of his robe catching one sleeve on his arm as hed begun to change billywolf had stumbled over the robe still hanging on to his forepaw tripped and tumbled onto the street with a whuff of expelled breath and a little whimper id rolled my eyes billythewolf had snarled and struggled out of his robe picked it up carefully in his teeth like a large and particularly grumpylooking benji and put it back in the van um one of the other girls had said a redheaded lass who filled out her robe a little too generously were still a little new at this shed covered herself with her arms awkwardly letting her robe fall from her shoulders as she whispered a little chant and had become a rather round heftylooking shewolf with dark auburn fur shed moved daintily to the edge of the cargo van and had minced despite her weight down to the street the other two young people a lanky darkhaired boy and a scrawny girl with mousebrown hair had made the change and loped up the hill after tera and then we all had moved as quietly as we could to the rear of marcones estate surrounded by a high stone wall the property occupied an entire block bounded on all four sides by individual streets none of us had known the layout to marcones place so wed chosen to approach from the rear on general principles of sneakiness i hadnt thought it would be wise to walk in the front door so i had dispatched tera to find us a way in while id remained behind with the alphas i found myself tapping my fingers on my thighs as i crouched restless i soon realized that if i was tense the wouldbe werewolves were twice as keyed up the darkestfurred one billy i thought rose to his paws and started away in the opposite direction from which tera had gone georgia growled at him billy growled back and the other male rose to follow him great i thought i couldnt afford to let the alphas wander off now no matter how restless they were hey i said quietly you cant go haring off now if theres a way inside tera will find it the wolves all turned their heads and their very human eyes toward me billy planted his paws stubbornly and growled oh dont give me that i snapped glaring at him without meeting his eyes you promised youd play this my way billy this isnt a time to be messing around billys stance became less certain and i beckoned all of them toward me if i could keep them listening until tera got back i could at least be sure that theyd be around when i needed them huddle up everyone i said i want to go over some things before we go in there was a brief silence and then a crowding of furry heavy bodies and a snuffling of wet noses ten ears pricked up and rotated toward me and ten bright human eyes fastened upon me from lupine faces i suppressed a sudden urge to say good evening class im your teacher mr dresden and instead put on my most serious expression you all know whats at stake tonight i said and that we could all get killed were going to be confronting a bunch of lawenforcement people who have gotten hold of some magic thats as black as anything ive ever seen and are using it to turn themselves into wolves theyve lost control of the power theyve grabbed theyre killing people and if we dont stop them theyre going kill a lot more especially me because i know too much im a danger to them but i dont want that i dont want anyone to get killed not us and not them maybe they deserve it maybe not the power they grabbed has turned into a drug for them and theyre not really in control of themselves anymore i just dont think wed be much different than them if we went in there planning to wipe them out it isnt enough to stand up and fight darkness youve got to stand apart from it too youve got to be different from it i cleared my throat hell im not good at this go for their belts if you can just like i did in the alley once their belts are off theyre not going to be as crazy and maybe well be able to talk to them i glanced up at the wall and back down just dont get killed guys do what you have to do to stay alive thats your first priority and if youve got to kill them to do it then dont hesitate there was a chorus of growls from around me led by the wolf billy but that was the great thing about being the only human being therei was the only one who could talk there wouldnt have been any arguments even had they disagreed their enthusiasm was a little intimidating if you are any louder wizard teras soft voice came from behind me we might as well walk through the front gate i jumped and looked up to see tera naked and human crouched down a few feet away i wish you wouldnt do that i hissed at her did you find a way in yes she said a place where the wall has crumbled but it is far for you to walk around along the eastern wall toward the front of the property we must run if we are to get inside in time i grimaced im not in any shape to run anywhere it would seem you have little choice i also saw many streaks of light across the front gate and there are black boxes with glass eyes every seventy or eighty paces they do not see the crumbled place it is a fortunate position cameras i muttered hell come wizard tera said crouching down on all fours we have no time to waste if you are to join us the pack can cover the distance in moments but you must hurry tera ive had a rough couple of days id fall over in about two minutes if i tried to run somewhere the woman blinked passionless amber eyes up at me your point im going over the wall right here i said tera looked at the wall and shook her head i cannot bring the pack over that wall they are not strong enough to keep changing back and forth and they have no hands in their wolf form just me then i guess you all can find me tera snorted of course but it is foolish for you to go over the wall alone and what if the cameras see you let me worry about the cameras i said help me up to the top then you and the alphas circle around and rendezvous with me tera scowled the expression dark i think this foolish wizard if you are too wounded to run then you are too wounded to go in alone we dont have time i said with a glance up at the moon to argue about this do you want my help or dont you tera let out a sound somewhere between a snort and a snarl and for a moment tension in her muscles made them stand out hard against her skin one of the alphas let out a little whimper and stepped away from us very well wizard tera said i will show you the nearest camera and help you over the wall do not move from where you land we do not know who is on the other side of the wall or where dont worry about me i said worry about yourself if theres a good way through the wall denton might show up there too to go in or macfinn might macfinn tera said traces of pride in her voice and fear in her eyes will not even notice that the wall got in his way i grimaced just show me the camera tera led me forward through the dark silent and naked and looking as though she didnt mind the cold evening at all the grass was damp plush and deep tera pointed out the small silent square of the video camera settled onto the wall across the street and almost entirely hidden by the shadows of the trees i licked my lips and leaned toward the camera keeping my own form obscured by the bushes i squinted my eyes and drew in my will trying to focus my head started to pound at once and i felt sweat break out beneath my arms and across my forehead hexing up anything mechanical is usually fairly simple the field of magic that surrounds practitioners of the art plays havoc with the implements of technology a passing thought on the right kind of day can blow out a cellular telephone or kill a photocopier this was the wrong kind of day that field of energy around me was severely depleted from its usual levels and the metaphysical muscles i would normally use to manipulate that energy were in screaming agony reflected in pains throughout my body but i needed to get inside and i really did think that i wouldnt be able to make it all the way around the property i was running on empty already and too much more would leave me gasping like a fish out of water and wishing i was at home in bed i forced calm on my thoughts and focused all the energy i had and it hurt me starting in my head and spreading into weary aches in my knees and elbows but the energy built and built and with it the pain until i could hold it together no longer malivaso i whispered and pushed my hand out at the square shape like a gradeschool girl throwing a baseball wrong handed the power id gathered though it felt like it was about to split me at the seams rushed out in an almost impotent little hiccup of magic and swirled drunkenly toward the security camera for a long minute nothing happened and then there was a flash of light and a tiny shower of sparks from the rear of the box smoke drizzled up from the camera in a quavering plume and i felt a small surge of triumph at least i had something left in me even if it was aneurismcausing labor to perform the mildest of tasks all right then i said a second later my voice somewhat thready lets go we looked around and made sure no cars were about and then tera the alphas and i rushed across the road through some decorative leafy bushes to the high stone wall tera laced her fingers together to form a stirrup i put my good foot into it and pushed up hard she heaved me up and half threw me over the wall i caught myself at the top saw a cars headlights coming and swiftly rolled down the other side falling heavily to damp muddy earth it was dark it was really dark i was crouched at the base of the wall underneath a spreading canopy of bare tree branches and stubborn sycamore leaves moonlight filtered through in random places but it only served to make the dark spots all the more gloomy my own black leather duster was utterly invisible and i remembered reading somewhere that the gleam of my eyes and teeth would be the most likely to give me awaybut since i didnt feel like sitting in the dark with my eyes closed i didnt instead i crouched and got my confiscated gun ready in one pocket and took my ace in the hole out of the other getting that ready as well i shivered and worked hard to remind myself not to be afraid then i waited in the darkness for my allies and waited and waited time passed and i knew that a minute would feel like an hour so i began counting one number for every deliberate breath the wind blew through the trees brisk and cool leaves rustled and droplets of rainwater fell from the trees around me making little pattering sounds as they struck my new coat they clung to the leather in tight beads and caught pieces of moonlight in them brilliant against the black the smell of rich earth and damp stone rose up with the wind and for a moment it did almost feel as though i was in a forest rather than on a crime lords private estate in the north end of chicago i took deep breaths a little comforted by the illusion and kept on counting and waited nothing happened no wolves no sounds nothing it wasnt until i got to one hundred that i started to get really nervous my stomach beginning a slow twist that made weak sensations lace out through my arms and legs like slivers of ice where was tera where were the alphas it shouldnt have taken them nearly so long to get inside the wall and then to cover the distance back to me though the estate was huge the distance surely meant little to the flashing speed of a wolf the evening had obviously been moving along entirely too smoothly i thought something had gone wrong i was alone chapter alone its one of those small words that means entirely too much like fear or trust im used to working alone it goes with the territory wizards of my level of skill and strength well my usual levels are few and far betweenmaybe no more than two dozen in the united states with a slightly higher concentration of them in europe africa and asia but there is a difference between working alone and finding yourself facing a hatful of foes on a cold night while wounded and in the dark and practically helpless it took me about ten seconds to become acutely aware of that difference fear settled in comfortably fear was something i was used to i was able to think past it to focus on my predicament yay for me my body reacted the same old way keying up for fight or flight while i forced my breathing to stay even the smart thing to do would be to run to turn around and go back to the van and to have susan drive me the hell away granted i probably couldnt even climb the wall on my own but i could have tried but i was already committed i was here to do battle with the forces of evil such as they were i had dropped the challenge to them not the other way around besides if tera and the kids were in trouble i was the only one who could help them i climbed to my feet getting out the gun and moved forward through the woods in a direction that seemed perpendicular to the line of the stone wall behind me the woods were thick sycamores and poplars giving way to evergreens with scratchy low branches i slipped through them as best i could moving as quietly as i could manage i didnt think i made more noise than the wind did as it rattled the branches and the fallen leaves and stirred more droplets of water to fall in time maybe three or four minutes i came to the edge of the woods and looked out on to gentleman johnny marcones estate it was magnificent something out of a homeandgarden magazine you could have put a small golf course in marcones backyard a long ways off at the front of the property marcones huge white house stood serene and flawless artistically illuminated by dozens of lights with a veranda or patio larger than a dance floor plotted out at its rear behind it three enormous square plots sidebyside contained lit and lovely gardens terraced down a gently sloping hill toward me at the hills base was a pretty little vale and there lay a small pond which i realized after a moment was an enormous concretelined swimming pool lit from beneath the surface the pool was irregularly shaped and one corner of the pool stirred near the surface steam lay thick over the water standing stately sentinel toward the center of the vale was a ring of evergreens thick and stocky trees that concealed whatever was at their center two rounded hillocks decorated the left side of the vales landscape one of them surmounted by what looked like a replica of a small ruined shrine or temple all cracked marble and fallen columns the whole place was well lit both by silver moonlight and by lighting placed at strategic intervals the lawn was immaculate and trees dotted the grounds in the sort of careless perfection that only an army of expensive gardeners could have maintained and they say that crime doesnt pay i took a position behind a screen of trees and brush and looked around the grounds with careful stealthy caution i didnt have long to wait there was a rush of motion from beneath one of the trees on the far side of the estate and a swift form a darkfurred wolf billy i thought flew from beneath one tree and toward a patch of dark shadow on the grass not twenty feet from me i tensed and started to rise from my hiding place in the brush to call out to the wolf as he ran a bright red dot of light appeared against the wolfs fur there was a hollow sound something i could barely hear like a politely covered cough i saw the wolf jerk as a flash of blue feathered against its fur and then the beast tumbled into a roll and fell to the ground it struggled for a moment back to its feet and reached for the dart in its flanks with its jaws its balance wavered and the wolf staggered to one side and fell i could see its chest heaving and one of its rear legs twitched spasmodically i thought i saw the beasts eyes billys eyes focus on me for a moment and then they glazed over and went vacant nice shot called a deep tense voice in the ring of evergreens there was motion and then denton appeared walking out across the grass toward the fallen wolf his dark short hair was still immaculately rigid i couldnt see the veins in his forehead despite the bright light it was a subtle change in him one of several his tie was loose his jacket was unbuttoned he moved with less steel in his backbone more fire in his belly there was an animal quality to him a surety and savagery of purpose that had been uncertain before and what it meant was a lot more significant than the changes that showed on his exterior his restraint was gone whatever last remnants of doubt or regret that had enabled him to maintain his own selfcontrol and some measure of control over the other hexenwulfen had vanished with the blood frenzy in the full moon garage it was in every line of him now in each step and every flicker of his eyes the man had become a predator from the evergreens behind him appeared the rest of the hexenwulfen benn now dressed only in a white dress shirt and a grey business skirt her legs dark and rippling with muscle in the moonlight harris his ears still sticking out his freckles dark spots against pale skin his manner restless and hungry and wilson still in his wrinkled suit but with the shirt unbuttoned his potbelly overlapping the belt of dark fur around his waist he stroked and patted it with his fat fingers his mouth was set in an odd dangerous grin denton moved across the grass to the fallen wolf and nudged it with his toe six he said did you count six six benn confirmed her voice throaty can we have them now she reached dentons side and pressed up against him lifting one leg to rub against his baring it to the top of her thigh as she did not yet denton said he looked around him thoughtfully and my gaze followed his scattered around a circle of perhaps fiftyyards diameter were several dark lumps i had taken to be indentations in the ground shadows cast by the moon and the grounds lighting i looked again and saw with a surge of fearful understanding that they werent indentations they were the wolves my allies the dark patch billy had been running for gave a little whimper and i thought i saw the moon glint off of georgias tawny coat i looked around and counted the fallen six i couldnt tell them apart very well couldnt tell which of them if any was tera but i counted six fallen wolves upon the ground all of them i thought with a panicked rush of fear all of them had been taken come on harris said his voice tight strained fuck macfinn he isnt showing up lets take them out all of them and go find dresden well get to your belt soon enough kid wilson snorted his fingers stroking at the fur belt over his belly if you hadnt been so stupid as to lose it harris snarled and denton shook benn from his side to get between the other two men shut up now we dont have time for this harris well go after the wizard as soon as we can wilson keep your fat mouth shut if you like your tongue where it is and both of you back off the men made low growling noises but they took steps away from one another i licked my lips i was shaking the gun felt heavy in my hand there were only the four of them i thought they werent more than thirty feet away i could start shooting right now if i got lucky i could down them all they were werewolves but they werent invincible i slipped the safety off of the pistol and drew in a steadying breath it was a damn fool thing to do and i knew it life is not the movies it wasnt likely that i would be able to shoot them all before they could draw and shoot back but i didnt have much choice denton turned toward the first hillock with its artfully ruined temple and waved all right he called thats all of them a pair of shapes appeared in the lights that shone on the temple and then came down the hill toward denton and the hexenwulfen marcone was dressed in a flannel shirt jeans and a hunters vest and he bore a gleaming rifle an enormous scope mounted on it in one hand hendricks hulking beside him in musclebound silence was dressed in what looked like black military fatigues bearing the gun id seen earlier a knife and various other gear hendrickss eyes flickered over denton and his associates warily i stared at marcone in shock it took me a moment to pick my jaw up off the ground and to piece together what was going on marcone didnt know he didnt know that denton and company were out to get him they must have blamed the other killings on macfinn and the alphas so now denton had marcone and the alphas there once macfinn arrived he would be able to kill everyone he wanted dead everyone who knew what was going on and be able to make up any story he damned well pleased everyone but me that is he did not as yet have his hands on me these are all we saw on the monitors marcone corrected there was a malfunction in camera six at the rear line of the property mr dresden and such malfunctions tend to go hand in hand dammit are you sure the wizard isnt one of them denton demanded one of these wolves i think not marcone answered but i suppose anything is possible denton scowled then hes not here if he truly offered you a challenge hes here marcone said his tone completely confident im certain of it and he just watched his werewolf friends get shot down denton asked wolves run faster than men marcone pointed out possibly he hasnt caught up to them yet he could even be watching us now youre giving him too much credit denton said but i saw his eyes shift instinctively toward the blackness of the growth of woods if i stood up he would be looking right at me i froze holding my breath am i marcone smiled and leaned down to pluck the feathered dart from billys furry flank the tranquilizers likely wont hold these beasts for very long decisions need to be made gentlemen and if you are to hold to your end of the bargain you had best get to work producing i dont know if marcone noticed benns sudden tension the way she slid her hands over her stomach but i did kill these dogs now she said in a low heated voice it prevents complications later in the evening marcone tsked shortsighted let macfinn tear them to pieces when he arrives and any medical examiner wont bother to look for the tranquilizers if one of you does it it will create awkward questions once forensics takes a look at things and i thought that was the point of you coming to me with this offer reducing questions benn lifted her lips away from her teeth and i saw the tips of her breasts stiffen beneath her white shirt i hate slimy scum like you marcone she purred sliding her hand from her thigh up over her hip and beneath the buttons of her shirt marcones eyes narrowed on her and as though connected to the crime lord by a telepathic leash hendricks made one simple motion a shift of his forward arm that chambered a round on the gun with a cold little clickclack denton gave marcone a sharp look and took hold of benns wrist with his hand the woman tensed for a second resisting him but then she allowed denton to draw her hand away from the belt that was surely beneath her shirt denton released her and benn lowered her hands visibly relaxing marcone and hendricks never so much as blinked or broke a sweat fragile situations like this one were evidently second nature to them i let out the breath id been holding for a long time six to one and ready for a fight if i attacked them now i didnt have a prayer if i tried to move to fade back into the trees they would be likely to notice me damn denton glanced at the trees once more and i held my breath again dont worry marcone he said well turn the wizard over to you once we find him no questions asked that being the case marcone said i suggest you start looking while i make preparations for mr macfinn please remember that i want dresden alive if possible my throat constricted and if i hadnt been holding my breath i think i would have let out a squeak what in the world could john marcone want with me after the incident in the parking garage nothing good certainly nothing i wanted to think about damn damn this night was getting spookier all the time of course mr marcone denton said his tone a little too polite do you have any suggestions of where we should start looking marcone ignored the sarcasm flicked a switch on the sight on his rifle and pointed it negligently at the tree line over there ought to do the red dot of the laser sight settled onto a leaf six inches to the left of my head and the thready pulse of fear in my chest turned into an icy white streak of terror damn damn damn chapter if i ran i would be seen and pursued and likely torn apart if i remained where i was hidden i would be found and then torn apart or shot or tranquillized and given to johnny marcone a poor set of choices but i wasnt going to get any better ones by sitting on my ass so i got my feet underneath me and started easing back into the woods the confiscated semiautomatic still in my hand hold it denton said did you hear that what benn asked i could hear the sudden eager tension in her voice and i struggled not to make any more noise as i hurried my pace back into the shelter of the deeper trees quiet denton snarled and i froze in place wind and rain were the only sounds for a few moments in the chilly autumn night over there denton said after a moment i think i heard it over that way could be a raccoon squirrel or a cat wilson suggested dont be naive came marcones voice laced with scorn its him there was the immediate sound of a slide being worked on a handgun a round being chambered into place move forward said denton that way fan out and well take him watch yourself we dont know all of what he can do dont take any chances his voice came closer as he spoke and i nearly bolted there was a chorus of assenting sounds and another couple of weapons being readied footsteps came toward me through the grass after that i did bolt just stood up and ran bent over as low as i could there was a shout from behind me and a bark of a gun being fired i pointed the semiautomatic above me afraid to fire back at them for fear of hitting tera or one of the alphas by mistake and pulled the trigger twice the gunshots must have surprised them because denton and the others scattered for cover behind the nearest trees i ran deeper into the woods marshaling my thoughts i had gained a little time but time to do what running would only put me up against a stone wall i doubted id be able to climb it with a bum foot and a wounded shoulder and i could only play the rabbit in the woods for so long before i was found dammit i thought im no rabbit it was about time the hunters became the hunted around here i moved ahead silent and intent now and scanned around me searching for the sort of place i would need i found it almost at once an inwardcurving hollow at the base of a large tree and slid into it nestling into the woods embrace i put my head down hiding the paleness of my face and the gleam of the whites of my eyes and listened they came forward quietly and without any lights flickering around at the edges of my vision maybe denton and his cronies were getting used to the darkness they were moving forward in a ragged line twenty or thirty paces apart and somehow keeping mostly parallel they were all still on two feet by the sound of the steps thank my lucky stars if theyd gone to wolf form they might have had meof course on two legs they still had hands free to hold guns of their own there are pros and cons to everything i suppose i held my breath when footsteps approached me they came within ten feet then five i felt the brush stir when someone walked past no more than a foot away making leaves brush up against me they stopped right there and i heard a little whuffling sound sniffing i thought of the aroma of my brandnew leather jacket and clenched my jaws down slightly tension thrumming through me and making my legs shake about ten billion years went by and then whoever it was began walking again forward and past me i would have let out a sigh of relief if the most dangerous part of my plan wasnt still to come i got up from my hiding place stepped forward and jammed the barrel of the semiautomatic against the back of the neck of the person before me it was denton his back arched and he sucked in a stunned breath quiet i whispered dont move denton hissed but froze in place dresden i should kill you right now try it i said and thumbed back the hammer of the gun but after the loud noise remember to keep going down the tunnel and toward the light dentons shoulders shifted a fraction and i said dont move your arms at all reach for that belt and ill kill you before youre halfway to furry denton drop the gun denton moved his fingers enough to close the safety on his gun and let it fall not bad dresden he said but this isnt going to do you any good put the gun down and we can talk about this smooth polite nice delivery i said they teach you that at the fbi dont make this any harder on yourself than it has to be dresden denton said his voice toneless you cant get out of this they always say that i said and used my free hand though it made my shoulder twitch to take him by the collar and hold him steady my arms feeling a little weak i said dont do anything to make me slip i felt his body tense at my words what are you doing dresden you and me were going to turn around i said with a little shove of the gun against his neck to emphasize the point and then youre going to order all of your people out of the trees and back into the light theyll each call to you from there so that i know theyre in front of me and then were going to go see them what do you hope to accomplish here dresden denton said i let go of his neck pressed close and reached around him to remove the wolfpelt belt from around his middle i saw his jawline shift as i took the belt away but he remained still and quiet his hands in the air i was just going to ask you the same thing denton i said now call your buddies out of the trees denton might have been a cool customer maybe a treacherous sneak maybe a murderer but one thing he wasnt was a fool he called out to the other three agents and told them to get out of the trees dent wilson called are you okay just do it denton answered it will all be clear in a minute they did it i heard them move out of the woods and call to him from the cut level grass of marcones estate now i said walk dont trip because i swear to god i would rather blow your head off over a misunderstanding than get suckered by a trick and killed maybe you should put the safety on denton said because if you kill me youll never get out of here alive i hate it when the bad guys have a point but i chose to err on the side of denton getting blown apart and left the safety where it was i slung the wolf belt over my shoulder took dentons collar again and said walk he did we walked out of the deep darkness of the woods and into the light i kept at the edge of the darkness and put a trees trunk to my back keeping denton between me and the bad guys they were spread out the three of them in a half circle about thirty feet away and they all had guns it would have been one hell of a marksman who could get at me with dentons broad solid form in front of me and the shadows veiling me but i didnt take chances i crouched down behind him some leaving nothing but the corner of my head and one eye showing at least that way i thought if they shot me id never feel it uh hi guys i said a bit lamely ive got your boss put the guns down take your belts off and walk away from them nice and slow or i kill him a part of me probably the smarter part groaned at my course of action and started cataloguing the number of federal and state criminal codes i was breaking into tiny pieces by taking a member of the federal bureau of investigation hostage and threatening to kill him and attempting to take hostage three more i stopped counting broken laws at ten and waited to see the hexenwulfens response to hell with you benn snarled the silverhaired young woman dropped her gun and ripped off her shirt revealing a torso that was impressive in a number of sensesand another wolfhide belt ill tear your fucking throat out myself deborah denton said his voice strained dont please go ahead bitch growled harris his big ears created little halfmoon shadows of blackness on the sides of his head denton buys it and we all get promoted hell the wizard will probably shoot you while hes at it benn whirled toward harris lifting her hands as though she would strangle him fingers clenching like talons shut up i said both of you put your guns down now harris sneered at me you wont dresden you dont have the guts roger denton said very quietly youre an idiot the mans in a corner now put down your gun i blinked surprised at the unexpected support it made me instantly suspicious that marcone was out of sight did not mean that he was out of mind either where was he crouched somewhere aiming that rifle at me i kept an eye out for bright red dots thats right i appended to dentons statement you are an idiot drop the gun you too wilson i added glancing at the overweight agent and you and benn take the belts off too leave them on the ground do it denton confirmed and i got a little more nervous the man was relaxed now not resisting me his voice was solid confident unimpressed that was bad dentons pack obeyed him if reluctantly benn dropped the belt to the ground in the same way scrooge might have let fall a string of diamonds a visible ache in the motion wilson grunted as his belt came unfastened and his belly flopped out a little as the catch released he left it on the ground by his gun harris glared at me but he lowered his gun too now step back all of you yes denton said harris wilson step back to the trees and bring out what we left there hey i said what the hell are you talking about dont move any of you harris and wilson smirked at me and began walking toward the trees get your asses back here shoot at them mr dresden denton said and you will have to take your gun off me i think i can reach it if you do that and turn this into a fight you are resourceful and intelligent but you are also wounded i dont think you could overcome me in hand to hand i glanced between the two men and denton dammit i said what are you up to denton you try anything funny anything at all and youre not going to live to regret it im with the fbi i dont do anything that could be construed as funny mr dresden i swore quietly and could all but feel dentons mouth stretch into a smile why i asked him why did you get involved with these belts why are you doing this denton began to shrug but evidently thought better of it too many years of seeing men like marcone laugh at the law of seeing people hurt by him death misery brought on by him and people like him i was tired of just watching i decided to stop him and men like him by killing them i said i was given the power i used it what gives you the right to mandate their deaths what gives them the right denton asked to kill should i stand by and let them slaughter dresden if i can stop it i have the power and the responsibility to use it i felt a little shiver run through me as the words struck close to home and the other people the innocents who have died denton hesitated his reply was quiet it was unfortunate an accident it was never my intention the belts do more than make you fuzzy denton they change the way you think the way you act i can control my people denton began like you did last month i asked he swallowed and said nothing and you knew didnt you you knew that id find out thats why you sent me to the full moon garage the vein on his forehead pulsed after the deaths i was warned about a governing body a sort of magic police the white council that you worked for them i almost laughed yeah well someone told you part of the story anyway denton thats why you messed up macfinns circle isnt it you needed a patsy and you turned macfinn loose knowing that the council would suspect him the streetwolves for the cops and macfinn for the council denton snarled necessary sacrifices there was work to be done dresden oh yeah as one of the aforementioned sacrifices i dont find myself agreeing with you i said to hell with the law right thats what youre sayingthat youre above the law like marcone denton grew tense again and turned his head a bit toward me like he might have been listening i pressed him hard desperate to reach him if i could i might get out of this situation after all these belts man the power theyve given you its bad you cant handle it its gotten into your head and you arent thinking straight give them up you can still walk away from all of this do the right thing come on denton dont throw away everything you fought for all those years theres a better way than this denton was silent for a long time harris and wilson disappeared into the thick ring of pine trees benn watched us her eyes bright her body muscled and firm in the moonlight her breasts rather pretty and distracting as she breathed she looked from the pair of us to the fur belt on the ground alternately and her breaths became ragged look at her i said those belts are like a drug is this the kind of person she was is this the kind of person you want to be wilson harris were they always like they are now youre turning into monsters man youve got to get out of this before youre all the way gone denton closed his eyes then shook his head once youre a decent man mr dresden but youve got no idea of how the world works im sorry youve gotten in the way he opened his eyes again necessary sacrifices dammit i said dont you see that this wont do you any good even if you do get away with wiping out everyone here tonight murphy is going to piece together what happened denton glanced at me and said like a mantra necessary sacrifices i swallowed suddenly more cold than i had been it was eerie the way denton said the wordsso matteroffact calm rational there was no doubt in him when he should have been afraid only fools and madmen know that kind of certainty and i had already noted that denton was no fool harris and wilson emerged from the trees carrying something between them someone hooded arms and legs bound harris had a knife in one hand and it was against the base of the hood which looked to be a pillowcase his big ears and freckles were at sharp odds with the arrogant competence with which he held the knife damn you i said quietly denton said nothing benns eyes glittered in the moonlight bright and vacant of anything but lust and hunger the two agents brought the prisoner over and wilson dropped the legs harris kept the knife steady while the overweight man went to remove the hood but i had already seen the cast on the prisoners arm murphys face was pale her golden hair bleached to silver by the moonlight and falling down around her eyes her mouth was covered in cloth or duct tape one of the two and there was blood clotted at the base of one nostril a bruise purpling over one eye she blinked for a moment and then kicked at wilson with her legs bound it was ineffective and when harris snarled and pressed the knife against her throat she stopped struggling her blue eyes glared in fury at harris and then wilson and then they settled on me and widened kill me mr dresden denton said quietly and harris will cut the lieutenants throat benn will go for her gun as will wilson likely they will kill you and then they will kill these wolves you brought with you your allies but even if you get all of us first murphy will be dead and you will be holding the weapon that killed four agents of the fbi you bastard i said you coldblooded bastard necessary sacrifices mr dresden denton said but it wasnt a calm phrase anymore it was eager somehow warmth curving around and through the words like a lovers hands drop your gun no i said i wont he wouldnt kill another cop would he then murphy dies denton said harris the redheads shoulders bunched and murphy tried to scream through the gag i cried out and swung the barrel of the gun toward harris dentons elbow came back into my gut and then his fist snapped up into my nose casting a field of stars across my vision the gun went off pointed somewhere but then denton slapped it from my hand and drove another blow into my throat that sent me sprawling to the ground unable to breathe or to move denton stooped to recover the gun and said you should have shot me while you had the chance mr dresden instead of moralizing he pointed it at me and i watched his lips curve into a slow hungry smile beautiful moon tonight he said sort of reminds me of a story how did it go i tried to tell him where he could stick the moon and his story but it came out a strangled gasp i still couldnt move it hurt too much denton thumbed back the trigger sighted down the barrel at my left eye and said ah yes and ill huff and ill puff and ill blow your house down goodbye wizard death by nursery tale hells bells chapter the barrel of dentons gun looked bigger and deeper than the national debt as it swung to bear on my face his grey eyes glittered down the sights at me and i saw the decision to pull the trigger flash across them before he could i met his eyes hard shoved myself out toward him with a sudden screaming pain in my temples and locked him into a soulgaze there was a rushing sensation as there usually was a feeling of movement forward and then down like being sucked into a whirlpool i rode the sensation into dentons head a brief doubt crossing my mind maybe getting shot would have been better than wading heart deep into dentons soul i cant describe what i found there very well try to imagine a place a beautifully ordered structure like the parthenon or monticello imagine that everything is balanced everything is in proportion everything is smooth and secure stick in blue skies overhead green grass all around puffy white clouds flowers and children running and playing now add a couple hundred years of wear and tear to it dull the edges round the corners a little imagine water stains and worn spots where the wind has gotten to it turn the skies dirty brown with smog kill the grass and replace it with tall ugly ragweed ditch the flowers and leave in their places only dried up skeletal rose vines age the male children into adult winos faces haggard with despair and selfloathing and flushed with drink and the girls into tired jaded strumpets faces hard eyes cold and calculating give the place of beauty an aura of rage and feral abandon where the people who walk about watch the shadows like hungry cats waiting to pounce and then after all of that after all the cares and trials and difficulties of the world a cop inhabits have been fairly represented coat everything in a thick sticky black sludge that smells like swamps and things that attract duncolored flies paint it on make it a coating that emphasizes the filth the decay the despair all around that brings out that painful decline to the utmost degree the sludge makes things stronger and more bitter more rotten more putrid all at the same time that was denton inside a good man jaded by years and poisoned by the power that had taken control of him until that good man had been buried and only the filth and decay remained until the existence of the man who had once been was only a bitter reminder that made the man who was now seem all the more downfallen by comparison i understood dentons pain and his rage and i understood how the dark power hed taken had pushed him over the edge there was an image of him kneeling at someones feet as a wolffur belt was passed into his hands and then it was gone knowing the man he had once been made clear to me the beast he had become all violence and hunger and craving i felt tears on my cheeks and violent shudders shaking down my spine i could pity denton and the others with him but now more than ever they scared the crap out of me i had bought myself a few seconds at least with the soulgazebut would it be enough to keep denton from blowing my head off denton stared at me as the soulgaze broke and we were released he wasnt reacting well to whatever it was he had seen inside of me his face had gone white and his hand was trembling the barrel of the gun wavering every which way he lifted his other hand to mop beads of cold sweat away from his face no denton said white showing all around the grey irises of his eyes no wizard he raised his gun i dont believe in hell i wont let you he screamed then at the top of his lungs i wont let you i tensed up preparing for a futile attempt to throw myself out of the way of a speeding bullet yes said a calm voice you will a bright red dot appeared right on the middle of dentons chest cheerful as a christmas light i twisted my head around to see marcone walking over the turf his weapon pointed steadily at denton hendricks looming to one side dentons lackeys were watching marcone with bright steady eyes murphy lay on the grass her feet toward me her head away i couldnt see what condition she was in and both fear and frustration leapt up into me for her sake marcone denton said his back straightened and his eyes narrowed you treacherous scum marcone clucked with his teeth our bargain was that you would bring him to me alive not execute him additionally you may want to rethink the wisdom of using your own weapons let macfinn kill him when he arrives if he arrives denton snarled my spotters marcone said tell me that the animals i sent out with them went mad with fear about two minutes ago three miles west of here i think it will not take him much longer to show up mr denton his smile widened but his moneycolored eyes grew harder now shall we cease antagonizing one another and finish our business marcone lowered the rifle and flicked the laser sight off denton looked from me to marcone and i saw the blackness rise up in his eyes gather behind them and get ready to come rolling out marcone i said just shoot him now i think weve both had enough of your attempts to divide and conquer mr dresden marcone said his voice bored youre beaten acknowledge it with grace i watched a slow smile spread over dentons face as he kept the gun pointed at my head my voice rose by a couple notes of alarm i mean it john i really do i shit you not this entire thing is about them killing you what a vulgar reassurance marcone said agent denton we have a few details to attend to lower your gun and let us be about them i dont think so denton said and he pointed the gun at hendricks and started pulling the trigger the gun roared so many times so quickly that i couldnt tell how often denton fired hendricks snapped back onto his heels and was driven flat onto his back by the force of the bullets slamming into him he didnt have time to twitch much less scream and he dropped like a felled tree i felt it in the earth when his massive body hit the ground marcone started to raise his gun but wilson and harris hurtled at his back and dragged him to the ground pounding on him with their fists marcone writhed like an eel and slipped away from them but denton stepped into his path and thrust the gun into marcones face thats enough he said his voice gone hoarse get them all and take them to the pit macfinn will be here any moment i took the moment to roll to my hands and knees and attempt to slip away unnoticed but was brought up short by a pair of bare muscular feminine legs my gaze followed the legs up past the skirt to a magnificently barebreasted torso encircled by a wolfpelt belt and then to a face dominated by eyes made eerie by the lack of anything recognizably sentient in them benn smiled at me set her foot against my wounded shoulder and with a sadistic twist of her ankle and a shove of her muscled leg sent searing pain screaming through my body making me crumple to the ground in agony i remember them dragging me across the grounds we passed into the ring of evergreens and i remember thinking that any sounds originating in that circle of pines would be heavily muffled by their branches and needles further muffled by the trees surrounding the property as well as the high stone wall gunshots for example might not even be heard at all off the property it was the clearest thought i had while my shoulder exploded the next thing i remember was being shoved roughly forward i fell straight and hard in the dispassionate grip of gravity and after long enough for me to start to suck in a breath i hit water it was only about six or eight inches deep and beneath it was swirling soft mud i had a brief pang for my leather duster and then i sank down into the water my hands slipping into the mud and getting stuck there cold water burbled around my face and felt nice for a moment on my aching shoulder someone grabbed me by the collar and hauled me out of the water to sit on my butt hands steadied me and i sat with my shoulder aching and my head whirling until i could squint up at who was there murphy dropped to one knee in the water beside me and smoothed back my damp hair dresden she said you okay i took a look around me i was at the bottom of an enormous pit a square maybe twenty feet deep and twice that across muddy water maybe from the rain covered the bottom of the pit and the moon tinted its surface silvery brown directly above the pits center maybe forty feet above me was a square made of wooden planks maybe five by five it was a hunters platform suspended by ropes leading from the circle of evergreens that surrounded the pit i could see the tops of the trees against the moon and the clouds dresden murphy said again are you all right im alive i said i blinked at her for a second and then said i thought they killed you her blue eyes sparkled briefly her hair was a mess and her jeans and flannel shirt were rumpled and soaked with muddy water she was shivering from the cold i thought they had too but they stopped as soon as denton took you out and tossed me down here i cant figure why they didnt do the deed themselves instead of leaving it to macfinn i grimaced trying to cover their tracks from the white council i said denton wants macfinn to take the fall for all the deaths i think hes lost it i always wind up in the nicest places when i hang with you dresden you were tied up i said howd you get loose she had help someone said in a slurred heavy voice for all the good it will do her i turned my head to see a naked and dirty tera west sitting with her back against another wall of mud there were five soggy motionless forms lying around her the alphas in their wolfshapes tera held their heads upon her lap up out of the water she looked bedraggled and anguished touching each of them in turn very gently her amber eyes were dull i dont get it i said why did they stick us down here marcone just keeps a pit trap dug in his yard he was planning on trapping macfinn down here until morning tera said when he would be vulnerable whoa whoa murphy said face pensive youre saying denton was responsible for the deaths all of them one way or another yeah i gave murphy the rundown on denton the way hed gotten the belts for him and his people lost control of the power theyd given him and set up the streetwolves and then macfinn to take the blame murphy broke out into acidic swearing that was the angle i was missing dammit no wonder denton was so hot to keep you off of the case and out of the way and why he wanted to find you so bad after the scene at macfinns place thats how he kept showing up everywhere so fast toohe already knew that someone was dead there were shouts from above and we looked up to see marcone swing out from the edge of the pit he hung limply from a rope his eyes were closed i watched as he was drawn up in a series of short jerks until his bowed head bumped the bottom of the hunters platform above and then was left there what the hell murphy said her voice soft bait i replied i closed my eyes for a moment dentons stringing him up as bait for macfinn the loupgarou comes in jumps up to get marcone then denton cuts the rope and drops macfinn down in here with us murphy said quietly i felt her shivers grow a little more severe theyre going to drop that thing into this pit with us oh god harry denton or one of his people must have gotten some silver bullets made i said theyll just let macfinn slaughter us then shoot him from up there i squinted up at the edge of the pit pretty good plan what can we do murphy asked she hugged herself hard i shook my head i dont know nothing tera said quietly murphy and i turned to look at her one of the alphas was stirring billy maybe and wobbled and fell when he tried to sit up but at least he could hold his head up out of the water nothing she repeated we are beaten i closed my eyes and tried to order my thoughts to push the pain and fatigue back down and put together some sort of plan murphy settled beside me a shivering spot against my side the cast on her arm pressed against my ribs i opened my coat more a polite gesture than anything else given that it too was soaked and slipped the edge of it around her shoulders with my arm her back stiffened and she flashed me a look of indignation but after a second just pressed as far under the coat as she could after a moment she spoke her voice came out quiet uncertaina far cry from her normal brisk tones ive done some thinking dresden ive decided that theres a reasonable chance you arent involved with the killings i smiled a little thats real big of you murph doesnt what denton did to you sort of prove im not involved she half smiled and shook her head no harry it just means that he wants to kill you and me both it doesnt mean that i trust everything youre saying he wants me dead murph that should mean something in my favor shouldnt it not really she said and squinted up at the top of the pit from what i can tell denton wants pretty much everybody dead and you could still be lying to me im not murph i said my voice soft cross my heart i cant just take your word on it harry she whispered there are too many people dead my men my people civilians the ones im supposed to protect the only way to be sure is to take you all everyone involved and sort things out with you behind bars no i said theres more to it than what you can prove murph more than whats going to stand up in court come on you and me weve known each other for years you should be able to trust me by now right i should be able to murphy agreed but after what ive seen all the blood and death she shook her head no harry i cant trust anyone anymore she half smiled and said i still like you dresden but i cant trust you i tried to match her smile but my feelings were in too much turmoil pain mostly physical pain and a deeper heart hurt both for murphys sake and for the sake of our friendship she was so alone i wanted to go to the rescue somehow to make her hurting go away shed have spit in my face if id tried murphy wasnt the sort of person who wanted to be rescued from anything that she accepted as much comfort as my wet coat offered her came as a surprise to me i looked around the pit again intently the other alphas were recovering enough to sit up but apparently not enough to move tera just sat with her back against the wall defeated and exhausted marcone swung from the platform high above me not moving though i thought i might have heard a moan from him at one point i felt a pang of sympathy for him however much of a heartless bastard he might be no one deserved to dangle like bait from a hook the alphas tera marcone murphy they were all where they were because of me it was my fault we were there my doing that we were all about to die carmichael the poor jerk was dead also because of me so were other good cops so was hendricks i had to do something about it i need to get out of here i told murphy get me out of here and maybe i can do something murphy turned her head toward me you mean she waved the fingers of her unbroken arm in a vaguely mystic gesture i nodded i still had my ace in the hole something like that right so how do we get you out of here you going to trust me murph her jaw clenched it doesnt look as though i have much choice does it i smiled back at her and rose to my feet sloshing around in the water maybe we could dig into the walls a bit make climbing holes youll probably get shot once you get to the top murphy said no i said i dont think theyll want to hang around the pit with macfinn coming theyre bloodthirsty but not stupid so murphy said all we need to do is get you up to the top of the pit and then youre going to go oneonfour with a bunch of armed fbi agentscumwerewolves and beat them in time to go up against the loupgarou that we couldnt stop before with all of your magical gizmos and a building full of police officers essentially i answered murphy looked up at me and then shrugged and let out a short defiant laugh she stood up too flicked her hair back from her eyes with a toss of her head and said i guess it could be worse there was a soft sound from above and behind me murphy froze staring upward her eyes becoming almost impossibly wide i turned my head very slowly the loupgarou crouched up at the lip of the pit huge and gnarled and muscled and deadly its foaming jaws were open showing the rows of killing teeth its eyes gleamed with scarlet flames in the moonlight and they were fastened on the dangling figure of gentleman johnny marcone i quivered and the motion made a slight sound against the water the beast turned its head down and when it saw me its eyes narrowed to glowing slits and it let out a harsh low growl its claws dug into the earth at the edges of the pit tearing through it like sand it remembered me my heart started ripping a staccato rhythm in my chest that same raw sharp primitive fear id felt before the fear of simply being jumped on and eaten returned in full force and for a moment swept away all thoughts and plans you had to say that i said to murphy my voice wan and pale happy its worse chapter okay i said fear making my voice weak this is bad this is very very bad wish i had my pistol murphy said her tone resolute i wish wed had some more time to talk things out harry i glanced over at tera one of the alphas the mousehaired girl in her wolfshape was leaning against her and whimpering close your eyes tera said softly and covered the little wolfs eyes with her hand her amber eyes met mine without hope without any sparkle of life they were going to die because of me dammit all it wasnt fair i hadnt done anything grossly stupid it wasnt fair to have come so far sacrificed so much and to buy it down here in the mud like some kind of burrowing bug i searched the pit again desperately but it was a fiendishly simple and complete trap there were no options down here my eyes went up straight up marcone i shouted john marcone can you hear me the limp figure suspended above me stirred weakly what do you want mr dresden can you move i asked the loupgarou growled low and started pacing a circuit of the pit glowing eyes flashing between us down at the bottom and marcone trying to decide who to rip apart first an arm marcone confirmed a few seconds later do you still keep that knife on you the one i saw at the garage denton and his associates searched me and found it i am afraid came marcones voice dammit all youre a miserable stupid bastard for making a deal with denton marcone now do you believe he wanted to kill you all along the figure above me wiggled and writhed swinging from the ropes that held him trussed up there yes do tell me that you told me so with your last breath mr dresden i was already rather acutely aware of that marcone said his voice dry but perhaps ill yet have a chance to make amends what are you doing i asked i kept my eyes on the loupgarou as it circled the pit and kept myself opposite the creature where i could see it reaching for the knife they didnt find marcone replied he grunted and then i saw a flicker of light on something shiny up above me forget it murphy said quietly stepping close to my side as she watched marcone hes just going to cut himself loose and leave us to rot here we wont get the chance to rot i pointed out but i thought she was right marcone started to spin slowly on his rope wriggling around until his whole body was rotating on the end of it he began to speak his voice calm ironic isnt it id planned to wait for the creature on the platform and tempt it into the pit there are some nets ready to drop on it after that i would have held it until morning you do know that its right beneath you now dont you john i asked mr dresden marcone said crossly ive asked you not to call me that whatever i said but i had to admire the raw courage of the man to banter while dangling up there like a ripe peach i use this place to conduct noisy business marcone said the trees muffle the sound you see you can barely hear even shotgun blasts on the other side of the wall he continued to spin on the rope slow and lazy a shadow against the moon and the stars well thats nice i said and despicable the loupgarou looked down at me and snarled and i took an involuntary step back from it the mud wall of the pit stopped me oh quite marcone agreed but necessary is there anything youre not shameless about marcone i asked of course but you dont think im going to tell you do you now be quiet if you please i dont need the distraction and then i saw marcones arm curl in and straighten outward there was a flutter of metallic motion in the air and a snapping sound from the base of one of the ropes that held the platform suspended at its far end where it was secured to one of the pine trees the rope abruptly sagged and the platformand marcone with itswayed drunkenly marcone grunted and bounced against his ropes a few times making the whole affair of ropes lurch aboutand then the damaged line snapped and came entirely free it whipped out toward marcone lost momentum and then fell through the evening air straight down into the pit in front of me one end was still attached to the platform above now off center from the pit and listing to one side i blinked at it for a moment and murphy said holy shit he did it i dont recommend waiting about mr dresden marcone said i saw him twist his head to look at the loupgarou and tense up as the beast trotted around the edge of the pit to the side closest to him if it had noticed the rope that had fallen down from above it gave no sign hope lurched in my chest like sudden thunder i grabbed on to the rope with both hands and started shinnying up it like a monkey pushing with my legs and using mostly my good arm to hang on with while i lifted my legs up higher for another grip i got up to even with the lip of the pit and started rocking the rope back and forth getting a swinging momentum going so that i could leap off the rope and to the ground outside the pit the ropes above creaked dangerously as i did and marcone swayed back and forth still spinning about gently dresden he shouted look out i had been intent on my escape and given the loupgarou no thought i turned my head around to see it flying through the air toward me i could see its gleaming eyes and felt sure that i could have counted its teeth if i had waited around for it i didnt i let out a yelp and let go of the rope dropping several feet straight down before clamping on to it again the loupgarou sailed past me overhead like some huge obscenely graceful bat and landed on the far side of the pit with barely a sound my fingers felt weak i was so shocked and terrified but i started hauling my way up again swinging desperately as i went the loupgarou turned and focused its eyes on me again but marcone let out a sharp whistle and the thing turned toward him pricking its misshapen ears forward in a weirdly doggy mannerism before it snarled and leapt upward i bounced on the rope and marcone bobbed down and then back up again the loupgarou missed him by bare inches i think but i didnt hang around to watch i let out a yell and threw myself at the edge of the pit as the rope reached the apex of its swing i missed my belly hitting the lip of the pit but i started clawing at the earth and kept myself from falling i strained and kicked thrashing and whimpering in desperation and managed to gain a few inches slowly worming my way up onto the ground until i got my feet underneath me the loupgarou on the far side of the pit turned toward me and let out a sound that can best be described as a furious roar shouts erupted from elsewhere in the estatedenton and his lackeys must have been watching the pit i thought but they were the second scariest bad guys on the field at the moment i had bigger things on my mind said thing threw itself at me and i had a few seconds to start running trying to arrange things so that the pit would be between me and it when it landed i was only partly successful the loupgarou tore up the earth where i had been standing when it came down and turned toward me again facing me across a scant ten feet of space from one side of the square pit to the side adjacent to it the rope started bobbing again and then with a motion full of grace and power tera swung up out of the pit and landed in a crouch on the ground beside me go wizard she snarled denton and the others will kill us all if they are not stopped i will handle macfinn no way i said you cant possibly take him on i know him she responded and then there was in her place the huge shewolf dark fur peppered with grey she snarled and bounded at the loupgarou and it reared up like a cat about to take a mouse plunging toward her with abrupt speed and thats when i saw the difference between tera and the alphas tera and dentons hexenwulfen even tera and the loupgarou where they were fast tera was fast and graceful where they were quick tera was quick and elegant she made them look like amateurs she was something more primal more in tune with the wild than they would ever be as the loupgarou threw itself at her she slipped to one side like wind threw her shoulder beneath the beasts planted forepaw and shouldered it offbalance making it stumble it recovered and spun toward her but she was already gone farther away from the pit growling defiance at the supernatural creature it followed impervious and snarling with rage i heard a gunshot and a bullet smacked into one of the trees behind me benns voice repeated a low frantic chant and then i heard her words turn into an animals snarls denton and the others were coming it was time to play the last option i had the one i hadnt wanted to be forced to use i wasnt sure what would happen if i did but there wasnt much choice i slipped my hand beneath my shirt and touched the wolf belt id taken from agent harris in the alley behind the full moon garage it was vibrating beneath my fingers warm to the touch alive in its own fashion and full of the power and strength that had been channeled into it i closed my eyes and let that dark wild power spill into me mingle with all the fear and pain and weariness inside of me it was easy it was easier than any magic id ever done leaping into me with a sort of hungry eagerness seeping into me making pain and fatigue and fear vanish and replacing it with nothing but strength ferocity power lupus i whispered lupus lupara luperoso it took no more of a chant than that for the change to take me it wasnt something that i noticed really but when i opened my eyes again things were simply as they should be right in a way so fundamentally profound that i wondered why i had never noticed its lack before my vision was sharp and clear enough to count the hairs on the head of the shewolf orienting on me a few feet away i could hear the pounding of her heart the restless motion of the wind the heavy breaths of the other agents in the trees moving toward me like great clumsy cows if the sun had suddenly risen into the sky i could not have seen any more clearly than i did all in glorious shades of blue and green and maroon and purple as though god had dipped his brush into a late summer twilight and replaced all the darkness with those colors i dropped open my mouth in a silent laugh and felt my tongue glide over the gleaming sharp tips of my fangs what a beautiful night i could smell blood on the air hear the eagerness of my enemies to kill and i felt that same hunger rising from my own heart and surging through me it was perfect benn came through the trees first fast and powerful but clumsy and impatient and stupid i could smell her excitement pitched to an almost sexual level she was expecting an easy kill a sudden rush over one of the slow graceless twolegs and then the hot spurting blood the frenzied writhing i did not oblige her as she came through the trees i leapt forward and was at her throat before she even realized i was there a quick rip hot blood and she yelped in agony and fear throwing herself to one side stupid bitch id missed the hearts blood but she was badly hurt two snaps severed her hamstrings as she tried to flee and left her writhing on the ground helpless and terrified i felt my body thrill with abrupt and vicious excitement the bitch was mine now she would live or die as i wished the surge of power and elation that flew through me at that realization could have carried me off the earth and to the silver glory of the moon and stars themselves to the victor go the spoils her blood her life was mine to take and that was exactly how it should be i stalked forward to finish her as was only proper there was a puff of breath and then wilson in his wolfform came hurtling from the woods i slipped aside easily as he rushed by the wounded benn snarled and snapped blindly at him wilson turned on her his fury out of control and latched his jaws onto her throat blood was a black rich heady smell in the moonlight and i swayed drunk on the aroma of it my mouth watered jaws growing damp with saliva as i smelled the bitchs blood and i wanted to fling myself at her tear her apart myself as she went screaming to her death those wolves screamed harris they got out they got benn he came plunging out of the trees gun at the ready his nearly useless eyes wide and staring and panicked he started shooting at wilson who released the dead benns throat the first bullet smashed his left front paw to pulp the second and third slugs hammered into his chest and wilsonwolf staggered to one side yelping in sudden agony he twisted and strained as he went down paws scrabbling at his own stomach until there was abruptly a balding overweight man lying on the earth beside the dead wolf his jacket open his shirt unbuttoned to show the unfastened wolf belt there was blood all over wilson bubbling out of his mouth holy harris breathed pacing closer his gun held up until he could see what he had done george oh god oh god i thought you were one of them what the hell agent wilson didnt answer the redheaded kid he simply drew his gun from his jacket and started shooting in their human forms they couldnt see each other very well in the dark i thought they both started shooting at the muzzle flashes more blood flooded the air along with the sharp acrid smell of burning gunpowder both men went down bleeding out onto the earth and i felt my jaws open in another smile on another sense of warm satisfaction idiots who did they think they were dealing with here theyd been making my life miserable and the lives of others and now they had gotten their just desserts it would have been better had i torn out their throats myself admittedly but then i thought there was still denton to deal with that thought cheering me i turned and made my way into the woods hunting the last of them my heart was pounding hard and relaxed and steady with excitement as i melded in with the night and searched for prey denton and i met as i emerged from the circle of trees he stood in the moonlight in the right shape the only real shape the moon streaking his brown coat shades paler and making his eyes glow he was powerfully built as in his twoleg shape and looked quick and strong his eyes burned with the lust of the moon the night with blood need and raging wild strength just as mine did we faced one another and there was a mad sort of joy in it i would have giggled if i could have a snarl bubbled up out of my chest like music and i launched myself at him we met in a tangle of scratching claws snapping teeth dark fur he was the stronger i the quicker the fight was silent with no breath wasted it was a duel between us our fangs were our swords thick fur ruffs used as shield and armor i tasted his blood in my mouth from a slash to an ear and it hit me like a drug sent a fury and power coursing through me like i had never known i threw myself at him again and an instant later was rewarded for my overeagerness with a hot pain on my foreleg scarletblack blood stained dentons fangs in the moonlight we separated and stalked one another in a slow circle looking for weakness our eyes never leaving one another i laughed at him silently and he answered me in much the same way i understood him then and rejoiced with him in the power he had found in that moment i loved the man felt him a brother and longed to hold his throat in my jaws as the last of his blood flowed out of him it was the most ancient of struggles the deepest of conflicts survival of the fittest one of us would live to run again to hunt to kill to taste the hot blood and the other would be dead and cold on the grass it was good we came together again like partners in a dance moving over the grass together dimly of course i was aware of tera dancing with the loupgarou but that didnt matter to me really they were far away dozens of yards and i took no notice of them my joy was here we danced under the moonand he made the first misstep i threw myself into the opening hed left me knocked him to the ground with my shoulder and as he rolled and twisted away i took his back leg right across the big tendon he screamed his fury but i heard the fear in it too he scrambled to his three good paws again and turned to face me but there was terrible knowledge in his eyes just as there was in mine we both knew that it was all over but the bleeding i shuddered yes the bleeding he could still face me could still hurt me if i were foolishbut i wasnt i began to wear him down pressing him with short rushes and quick withdrawals that forced him to shift his weight awkwardly stumble on his three working limbs to wear him out as his reactions became slower i tested him with a few flashing passes of fangs once more i tasted his blood i gave him a dozen small wounds and each taste of him made my frenzy all the more satisfying the night the dance the violence the bloodall of it was overwhelming more than any power i had ever felt any medicine id ever tasted even in my dreams or in the wild realms of the nevernever it was pure beauty pure pleasure pure power victory was mine i grew contemptuous of him as he began to whimper to seek escape the fool he should never have tested himself against me should never have tried his strength against mine had he yielded to me at once i would have been content to lead him to accept him as a follower and taken him with me on the hunts it was sad in a way but then i could always find others it would not be difficult to make the belts i thought to give them to a few people to try once they had theyd never take them off again i stalked denton as he faltered and i thought of running with susan of filling our mouths with hot sweet blood of taking her in the ecstasy of the night and the kill and it made me shake with anticipation i threw myself at denton knocked him over and went for his throat the fool scrambled and took his belt off melting into the ugly twoleg form his suit covered in blood please he croaked oh god please dont kill me dont kill me i snarled in answer and let my fangs tighten on his neck i could feel his pulse against my tongue dont kill him that he would beg at all was contemptuous he should have known the law of the jungle before he started trying to rule it who did he think he was dealing with someone who would give him mercy let him survive crippled and pathetic and feed him when he whined again i wanted to laugh my jaws tightened on his throat i wanted to feel him die something told me that everything else id experienced since i discovered my true self was childs candy next to the passing of a life beneath me i shook with eagerness denton continued to beg and it made me hesitate i snarled annoyed no no weakness no mercy i wanted his blood i wanted his life he had tried me and failed kill him kill him and take my rightful place who did he think i was harry whispered a terrified voice without releasing his throat i looked up susan stood there in the moonlight slender and graceful for a twolegs her camera was in one hand dangling forgotten at her side her eyes were wide with desire and she smelled of perfume and our mating and of fear something pressed at my awareness and though part of me wanted to ignore her to rip and rend i focused on susan on her expression on her eyes they werent wide with desire they were terrified she was terrified of me my god susan said harry she fell to her knees staring at me at my eyes i felt dentons pulse beneath my tongue felt his whimpers vibrate into my mouth so easy one simple motion and i would never have doubts fears questions never again and something inside of me said in a calm tone youll never be harry dresden again power i could feel the belts power in me its magic its strength i recognized it now that dark surety that heady and careless delight i recognized why there were parts of me that loved it so much i released dentons throat and backed away from him i scrambled with my paws my stomach twisting in sudden nausea rebelling at the very idea of what i had been about to do i sobbed and tore the belt from my waist ripping my shirt in the process feeling my body grow awkward and heavy and clumsy and pained again injuries that had been nothing to my truto the wolf form returned in vengeance to my human frailty i threw the belt away from me as far as it would go i felt hot tears on my face at the loss of that joy that energy that impervious strength you bastard i said to denton damn you you poor bastard he lay on his side now whimpering from his injuries bleeding from many wounds one leg curled limp and useless beneath him i crawled to him and took his belt away threw it after the other susan rushed over to me but i caught her before she could embrace me dont touch me i told her and i meant it with every cell in me dont touch me now susan flinched away from me as though the words had burned her harry she whispered oh god harry weve got to get you away from all of this from the far side of the ring of trees there was another furious bellow there was motion in the trees and then murphy leading a stumbling clumsy string of naked alphas came out of the woods toward me staying low she had a gun probably taken from one of the bodies in her good hand all right i said as they approached and turned a shoulder to susan pressing her away i couldnt even look at her murphy you and susan get these kids out of here now no murphy said im staying her eyes flickered to denton narrowed in a flash of anger and then dismissed him again as quickly she made no move to examine his injuries maybe she didnt care if he bled to death either you cant hurt macfinn i said and you can she asked she leaned closer and peered at me christ dresden youve got blood all over your mouth i snarled take the kids and go karrin im handling things here murphy for answer slipped the safety off of the gun im the cop here she said not you this is a bust in progress im staying until the end she smiled tight when i can sort out who is a good guy and who isnt i spat out another curse i dont have time to argue this with you susan get the kids back to the van but harry she began fury rose to the top of the rampant emotions coursing through me ive got enough blood on my hands i screamed get these kids out of here damn you susans darktoned face went pale and she turned to the nearest of the naked wet shivering alphas georgia as it happened she took the young womans hand had the others line up in drughazed confusion and join hands and then led them away i watched them go and felt the seething anger and sorrow and fear in me twist around in confusion from the far side of the woods there was another bellow of rage a shaking of one of the evergreens and then a sharp sudden yelp of purest anguish tera the sound of the shewolfs pain rose to a frantic gargling sound and then went silent murphy and i stared at the trees i thought i saw a flicker of red eyes somewhere behind them and then it was gone its coming around murphy said it will circle around to get to us yeah i said the loupgarous blood was up after the infuriating chase after tera it would go after whatever it saw next my mouth twisted bitterly i had a unique insight to its point of view now what do we do murphy said her knuckles whitened on the gun we go after it and try to hold it long enough for susan and the kids to get away i said what about marcone what about him he saved our lives i said murphys expression said she wasnt happy with that idea we owe him you want to get him out of there i dont want to leave anyone else to that thing i said how about you she closed her eyes and let out a breath all right she said but god this smells like youre trying to set me up dresden if you get me killed theres no one left who saw what happened here is there if you want to be safe go after susan i said bluntly we split up one of us attracts its attention maybe the other one will get through fine murphy snarled fuck you harry dresden famous last words i thought but i didnt waste any breath on voicing it it was time to face the loupgarou chapter i circled into the trees and stepped over harriss corpse the kids face had been smashed in by two bullets though the semiautomatic was still in his dead hand murphy must have had wilsons gun wilson lay not far from harris also dead wounds to the chest massive bleeding benn lay next to him naked but for a business skirt soaked in blood there was a line of greenish goo around her waist probably the remains of the wolf belt its magic must have died when she did i tried not to look at the mangled meat on the back of her thighs or the tears near her jugular i tried not to smell her blood or to notice the dark surge of contemptuous pride that went through me leftovers from my experience with my own wolf belt i shuddered and went past the bodies the night was silent but for wind and the creaking of the ropes that supported the platform in the middle of the encircling evergreens i could still see marcone hogtied up there the position must have been excruciatingit isnt every day that you get crucified and hung up as dinner for a monster and you cant really train your muscles for it i couldnt see marcones expression but i could almost feel his agony i waved a hand as he spun gently toward me and he nodded his head silent i pointed at my eyes and then around at the shadowed trees trying to ask him if he knew where the loupgarou was but he shook his head either he didnt understand me or he couldnt see it and either way it didnt do me any good i grimaced and moved forward through the trees skirting the edge of the pit i looked for the rope that had been used to haul marcone up to his current position it had to have been tied off somewhere low i peered through the near dark followed the strand of rope back down to the tree it was tied to and headed over toward it maybe i could get out of this maybe murphy and i could escape with marcone join susan and the others and get out of here no that was a happy fantasy even if i did get everyone out i knew i couldnt live with myself if i let the loupgarou go loose tonight on another killing spree i had to try to stop it i was already going to have a hard enough time living with myself the rope supporting marcone had been secured with a hasty knot easily undone i started working it rubbernecking all around listening trying to locate the loupgarou it wouldnt have just run off and left us here alive would it i took a turn around the tree with the rope to give me a little leverage and then very carefully because of my bum arm started lowering marcone if i could get him low enough i could have him swing over to me from the pits center catch him balance him and then go back and release the rope it would have been easier if murphy was there but i hadnt seen her a nasty thought hit me what if murphy had run across the loupgarou and it had killed her silently what if it was even now trying to get to me i secured the rope and moved back over to the pit marcone no dummy was already swinging back and forth as best he could trying to get himself over to me i went to the edge of the pit and crouched down keeping my weight well away from the crumbling earth at the pits lip marcone let out a sudden startled hiss and said dresden the pit i looked down and saw the loupgarous eyes glowing down in the darkness of the pit only a heartbeat before they surged toward me with a howl of rage it was coming up the wall of the pit simply gouging its claws into the mud and hauling itself upward toward me i reeled back from the thing threw out a hand and screamed fuego nothing happened except a little puff of steam like a breath exhaled on a cold night and sudden blinding pain in my head the loupgarou hurtled toward me and i threw myself down to the earth rolling away from its claws as it came up over the edge of the pit it raked at me caught the edge of my leather duster and pinned it to the earth i liked the coat but i didnt like it that much i slipped out of it as the loupgarou clawed with its rear legs much as i had only moments before and inched up out of the pit i was already running by the time it got out and i heard it snarl get its bearings and then come after me i was dead i was so dead i had gotten the kids out and susan and i had stopped denton and his cronies but i was about to pay the price i slipped through the trees and out onto the grass again panting cold now that my jacket was off my shoulder ached from the running from all the motion and my foot hurt abominably as well i couldnt run any longerphysically couldnt my steps slowed despite the commands of my brain and i wept with frustration weaving around just to keep on my feet i was at the end of my rope it was over i turned to face the trees to watch the loupgarou coming i wanted to see it coming at least if i was going to be killed i wanted to face it on my feet head on go down with a little dignity i saw its red eyes back among the trees it came forward slow low to the ground wary of some trick i had stung it before if not actually hurt it it didnt want to fall victim to another such attack i thought it wanted to make absolutely sure that i was dead i drew in a breath and straightened my back i lifted my chin trying to prepare myself if i was going to go down id go down as a wizard shouldproud and ready to face what was beyond i could spill out my death curse a potent working of magic if i had time to speak it maybe i could counter macfinns curse with it take the horrid transformation off of him that saint patrick had allegedly laid on him or maybe i could bring down marcones criminal empire with it i debated these things as i drew out the silver pentacle amulet i had inherited from my mother so that it would lie bright on my chest my mothers amulet silver amulet inherited from my mother inherited silver my eyes widened and my hands started to shake a drowning man will reach for anything that floats the idea floatedif only i could pull it off if only my brainlessness hadnt kept me from realizing what i had until it was too late i took the silver pentacle off of my neck breaking the chain in my haste i caught the broken ends in my fist as i fastened my eyes on the loupgarou and started to whirl the amulet in a circle above my head with my good arm the amulet described a circle in the night air as i spun it and i invested that circle with a tiny spark of will a tiny bit of power my head pounded i felt the circle close around me containing magical energies focusing them i hurt i was weary i felt as though i had betrayed myself given myself over to the darkness id tried so hard to resist by donning the evilly enchanted wolf beltbecause let there be no mistaking that is evil anything with that much power and that little control that utter lack of concern for anything but self is evil in the most effective sense of the word there was nothing left inside of me but i had to find it i had to find enough magic to stop this bloodletting once and forever i searched inside of me where everything was numb and empty and tired magic comes from the heart from your feelings your deepest expressions of desire thats why black magic is so easyit comes from lust from fear and anger from things that are easy to feed and make grow the sort i do is harder it comes from something deeper than that a truer and purer sourceharder to tap harder to keep but ultimately more elegant more powerful my magic that was at the heart of me it was a manifestation of what i believed what i lived it came from my desire to see to it that someone stood between the darkness and the people it would devour it came from my love of a good steak from the way i would sometimes cry at a good movie or a moving symphony from my life from the hope that i could make things better for someone else if not always for me somewhere in all of that i touched on something that wasnt tapped out in spite of how horrible the past days had been something that hadnt gone cold and numb inside of me i grasped it held it in my hand like a firefly and willed its energy out into the circle i had created with the spinning amulet on the end of its chain it began to glow azureblue like a candle flame the light spread down the chain and to the amulet and when it reached it the light became incandescent the pentacle a brilliant light at the end of the chain spinning a circle of light around me trailing motes of dust that fell like starlight to the grass around me vento i whispered and then called more loudly vento servitas ventas vento servitas in the bushes the loupgarou snarled quietly and its eyes brightened burned with scarlet fury it started moving toward me without warning murphy stepped between me and the loupgarou her gun held in both hands in a shooters stance though the cast made that awkward she held her gun pointed directly at me harry she said in a very calm tone get down on the ground right now my eyes widened i could see over murphy i could see the loupgarou moving rapidly toward her through the trees i saw it focus on her felt its malice and hunger spread toward her and envelop her i couldnt speak i couldnt break the chant or stop whirling the amulet to do so would have released the energy id gathered the very last strength i had in me my head hammered with pain that would have had me screaming on any other night i kept the amulet whirling spraying motes of light the brilliant white pentacle at the end of a leash of blue light i mean it harry murphy said i dont know what youre doing but get down her eyes were intense and she lifted the gun thumbing back the hammer trust whatever trust shed had in me was gone shed seen or thought of something that made her think i was trying to betray her the loupgarou rushed closer and i thought with a sick feeling in my stomach that susan and the alphas hadnt even had time to make it off the estate yet much less all the way back to the van if the loupgarou got through me it would kill them one by one follow their trail like a hound and tear them apart harry murphy said her voice pleading her hand was shaking please harry get down the loupgarou came through the woods in a sudden rush and murphy drew in a breath ready to fire i kept the amulet whirling and felt the power grow my head splitting with agony and made my choice i just hoped that i could finish the job before murphy gunned me down everything of the past few days came down to that single instant it all slowed down giving me time to view it in agonizing detail the loupgarou rose up behind murphy leaping toward her through the air it was still huge still powerful and more terrifying than ever its jaws were open wide aimed for her blonde head and could crush it with a single snap murphy narrowed her eyes peering down the shaking barrel of her gun flame blossomed from the barrel reaching out toward me she wasnt twenty feet away from me i didnt think there was any way she could miss and i thought with a pang of sadness that i wanted a chance to apologize to her before the end for everything vento servitas i shouted and released the spell the circle and the amulet as the sound of the shot hit me like a slap in the face power rushed out of me everything i had left in me focused and magnified by the circle and the time i had taken to refine it flying forward at the leaping loupgarou something hot and painful hammered into my torsoalmost like it had hit my back i toppled forward too weak and tired to care anymore but i watched what happened to the amulet the pentacle flew toward the loupgarou like a comet incandescent white and struck the creatures breast like lightning hammering into an ancient tree there was a flash of light too much power unleashed in a flaring of energy as the mystic substance shattered the loupgarous invulnerability carved into it coursed through it in a blinding bluewhite shower of sparks blue fire erupted from its chest its black hearts blood ignited into blinding flame and the creature screamed arching backward in agony there was the sound of thunder flashes of more light someone screaming maybe it was me the loupgarou fell to earth and changed muzzle melted back into human face fangs and claws faded warped muscles slithered away into globs of clear preternatural ooze that would quickly vanish fur disappeared knotted limbs straightened into clean arms and legsuntil harley macfinn lay before me partly upon his side one hand pressed to his heart the silver of my amulets chain spilled out between his fingers and dangled down his chest he stared down at the wound for a moment and then i saw him relax macfinn looked up and in his face i saw all the grief and agony and impotent rage everything hed felt during all those years of being unable to control himself cursed to cause death and destruction when all he wanted was to open a park for the wildlife and then it all flooded out of him his eyes cleared and warmed as he looked at me and he gave me a small quiet smile it was an expression of forgiveness something to let me know that he understood then he laid down his head and was gone my own blackness followed soon after chapter i woke up that surprised me in itself i woke up to see the moon still high overhead and to feel murphys hand on my forehead come on harry she whispered dont do this to me i blinked my eyes a few times and whispered you shot me murph i cant believe you shot me she blinked her eyes at me to hold back tears you stupid jerk she said her voice gentle you should have got down when i told you to i was busy she glanced over her shoulder at macfinns silent still form yeah i saw after she turned back to me looking a little past me focused elsewhere its all right i said i forgive you i thought it very generous of me appropriate to the last moments of a mans life murphy blinked at me and then stiffened you what forgive you murph for shooting me your job and all i understand murphys eyes narrowed dangerously you think she said her face twisted with disgust and she sputtered for a moment and then spat to one side she began again you think that i thought you were one of the bad guys still and i shot you because you wouldnt surrender i felt too weak and dizzy to argue hey its understandable dont worry about it i shivered im so cold were all cold moron murphy snapped a front came through about the same time they threw us in that freaking pit it must be below forty already and were wet besides sit up el cid i blinked at her i uh what sit up dummy murphy said look behind you i did sit up and it didnt hurt much worse than it had earlier this evening surprising me again i looked behind me denton was there he held a fallen branch in one hand like a club his eyes were wide and staring and savage his face pale with loss of blood there was a neat hole in his forehead right in the middle i blinked at the body for a moment but how did he i shot him you jerk he came running up behind you just as i came back from giving first aid to that naked woman tera west i was shaking too hard to have a safe shot with you standing and i didnt know the loupgarou was coming up behind me murphy stood up i cant believe this she said and turned to walk away you thought i shot you murph i protested murph give me a break i mean i thought she snorted at me over her shoulder she snorts well for someone with a cute little button of a nose you didnt think dresden she said flipping her hair back from her eyes dramatic death scene noble sacrifice right tragically misunderstood hah i understand you buddy youre such a pompous arrogant pretentious chauvinistic hopelessly oldfashioned stupidly pigheaded murphy went on in graphic detail and at great length about me as she walked away to call the police and an ambulance and it was music to my ears i lay back on the grass tired but smiling things were all right between us the police had one hell of a time sorting out the mess at marcones place i made sure to collect all the wolf belts murphy helped me we burned them right there in a stinking fire made of tree branches it was too hard for me to throw them in murph did it for me she understands things sometimes that i couldnt ever explain to her later i went with murph to carmichaels funeral she went with me to kim delaneys those are the kind of things friends do for each other mr hendricks as it turns out had worn his kevlar under the black fatigues they put me next to him in the ambulance that night when i finally left the scene theyd bared his chest and it was a solid mass of purple bruises so that we were a matched set he glowered at me in silence but he breathed steadily through the oxygen mask on his face i felt absurdly cheered when i saw him alive all things considered can you blame me marcone got arrested on general principles but nothing stuck though everything had happened on his property injuries on the fbi agents indicated that they had all done one another in or been killed by an animalexcept for denton of course none of the peace officers there had possessed a warrant et cetera et cetera i hear his lawyers had him out in less than three hours marcone called me a few days later and said you owe me your life mr dresden are you sure we cant talk business the way i see it john i told him you owe me your life after all even if youd cut yourself free youd have just fallen down into the pit and got eaten up with the rest of us i figure you thought your highest chances of survival were in freeing me the wizard who deals with this kind of thing to handle it of course marcone said with a note of disappointment in his voice id just hoped you hadnt realized it nonetheless harry dont call me harry i said and hung up on him susan filmed the death of the loupgarou from less than fifty yards away with a pretty good zoom lens and special lightsensitive film the light from my amulet illuminated the scene rather dramatically without really showing many details you can only see my back and it looks like im swinging a glow stick around and then throwing it at the monster which can be seen only in shadowy detail as something large and furry at the point where i released the spell theres a burst of static about a second long where the magic messed up susans camera even from that far away in the film the static clears and you can see murphy shoot denton off of my back just before he brains me with his club then she spins around like rambo jumps out of the way of the leaping furry somethingorother and empties the rest of her clip into the thing out of reflex murph and i both know the bullets didnt hurt it at all that it was just a reflexive gesture on her part but i dont need the attention she was quite the hero according to the camera and that was fine with me susans film went on the morning news and was shown for about two days afterward exclusively on wgn channel nine and it impressed chicago a lot the film made murphy popular enough with voters that a bunch of city councilmen went to bat for her and the internal affairs investigation got called off she carries a little bit more clout now than she did before the politicians down at city hall paid for a real name tag for her office door the weird thing was that the film just vanished after two days no one knew what happened to it but the film technician in the room with the exclusive wgn channel nine videotape disappeared too leaving only a few scattered and lowquality copies a couple of days later some experts spoke up claiming that the tape had to be fake and decrying it as a simple hoax perpetrated by a tabloid some people just cant deal with the thought of the supernatural being real federal government is like that a lot but im thinking that if anyone in the government did believe they would just as soon not have had proof of the existence of werewolves and the instability of a local fbi agent showing at five six and ten the films disappearance didnt stop susan from getting a promotion at the arcane a big raise and a guest slot on the larry king show plus a few other places she looked good doing it too and made people think shes getting her column syndicated maybe in a few hundred years people might actually be willing to consider what was real in the world with an open mind but i doubted it i didnt call susan for a while after she had seen me so far gone into being a monster that i might as well have been one she didnt pressure me but kept her presence known shed send me flowers sometimes or have a pizza delivered to my office when i was working late hell of a girl tera was badly injured but recovered thanks to her own reversion to human form and murphys quick first aid she asked me to meet her at wolf lake park a few weeks later and when i showed up she was there wearing just a long black cloak i wished to tell you that what you did was necessary and i wished to tell you goodbye she said and slipped the cloak off she was naked with a few new wrinkled scars goodbye where will you go i asked she tilted those odd amber eyes at me i have family she said i have not seen them in a long time i will return to them now maybe youll call sometime her eyes sparkled and she smiled at me a little sadly no harry dresden that is not the way of my kind come to the great mountains in the northwest one winter perhaps i will be there and then she shimmered into the shape of a great timber wolf and vanished into the sunset all those people shapeshifting into wolves and i had never once considered the possibility of a wolf shapeshifting into a person i picked up teras cloak musing and took it home with me as a reminder to keep my mind even more open to the realms of possibility the alphas decided that im about the greatest thing since sliced bread which isnt exactly the most thrilling thing in the world for me they asked me to a camp out with them which i reluctantly attended where all dozenodd young people swore friendship and loyalty to me and where i spent a lot of time blinking and trying to say nothing theyre just itching for me to lead them in some meaningful crusade against evil hell i have trouble just paying the bills when i took some time to think about all that had happened i couldnt help but think that the last several months had been a little too crazy for coincidence first a powerdrunk warlock had appeared out of nowhere and i had to duke it out with him in his own stronghold before he murdered me outright and then denton and his people showed up with enchanted wolf belts and raised hell i never had found out who exactly was behind the warlock who showed up the previous spring black wizards dont just grow up like toadstools you know someone has to teach them complicated things like summoning demons ritual magic and clichéd villain dialogue who had been his teacher and denton and company had shown up six months later someone had provided them with those belts someone had warned denton that i was dangerous that i or someone like me from the council would go after him and by telling him that they had pointed him at me like a gun determined to kill me im not much of a believer in coincidence could it have been one of my enemies on the white council one of the beings of the nevernever who had come to hate me i was on the list of a number of nasty things for one reason or another you know what i told mister one night in front of the fire maybe ive finally gone around the bend but i think someone might be trying to kill me mister looked up at me his feline features filled with a supreme lack of concern and rolled over so that i could rub his tummy i did pensive and comfortable before the fire and thought about who it might be and then thought that i might be getting a little stircrazy i hadnt gone anywhere but to work and back home for a couple of weeks too much work and no play makes harry a paranoid boy i reached for the phone and started spinning the dial to susans number mister batted at my hand approvingly or maybe im just too stupid to get out of troubles way eh mister rumbled a deep affirmative purr in his chest i settled back to ask susan over and enjoyed the warmth of the fire
