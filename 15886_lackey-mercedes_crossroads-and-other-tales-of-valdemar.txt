mercedes lackey crossroads an introduction by mercedes lackey once there was a computer programmer with ambitionsone might say delusionsof being a writer actually shed had ambitions for a very long time as a kid she had written andre norton pastiches and illustrated them too and somewhere she still has some of those illustrations and occasionally told them as bedtime stories to the kids she babysat as a teenager she continued to write submitting short story after short story to her high school literary magazine and she has some of those somewhere as well and in college she created an ongoing story arc about a team of psychic spies that she wrote as letters to amuse a friend she actually went so far as to take a creative writing honors course with the one college professor who was interested in science fiction and fantasy his advice find out what you like break it down to see what you like about it then do that it was good advice and shes been following it ever since writing kind of went by the wayside for a while as she ok i struggled to make a living but when things werent quite so hard i went back to the writing pounding stuff out on an old typewriter for fanzines good heavens someone even had a set of those things they asked me to autograph recently i was joking when i offered to buy them back but truth to tell i have a lot of affection for those old zines and stories i had a lot of fun writing them but then one day at the point where i was actually that computer programmer something switched over and i decided to get serious a novel of valdemar was not the first book i tried to write actually the germs of that first book became the books i cowrote with james mallory but it was the second and arrows of the queen was the first one i actually finished by that time i had written and actually sold several tarma and kethry storiesalso in the same worldand some darkover fiction most sold to marion zimmer bradley but some also sold to fantasy magazines that was the point where cj cherryh volunteered herself as my mentor looked at the book said commit trilogy and it all proceeded from there i was incredibly lucky to hook up with elizabeth wollheim and the folks at daw with this first effort it has been a great relationship all the way even better the whole world seems to have inspired other people to want to come play in it each person has had his or her own take on it that has made it just that much more varied and interesting and come up with things that made me smile made me cry and sometimes made me say boy i wish i had thought of that two volumes of valdemar short stories have been published already and you hold in your hands the third its been a great trip so far and even better for having all these wonderful folks along for the ride transmutation by larry dixon larry dixon is the husband of mercedes lacky and a successful artist as well as science fiction writer he and mercedes live in oklahoma prologue valdemar weathered the magestorms and all the nations and peoples of velgarth worked to stabilize in the aftermath in the north of valdemar darien and his compatriots returned from their quest to find dariens parents errolds grove kelmskeep and the newest hawkbrother vale kvaldemar forged ahead alongside the western refugees while in the east ancient iftel opened its borders for the first time and to the south hardorn and karse were no longer the threats they once were the trouble now though was from within a trade baron named farragur elm and a coalition of major tradesmen distributors and warehousers seized all resources in the vicinity of deedun and created a putative secessionist movement using the entirestolenlivelihoods of the regions workers as leverage the strong arm of the plan was a mercenary force once under havens pay hired over to elms side the crown sent heralds guard regulars and cavalry to test the situation in the first engagement with the mercenaries cavalry officer hallock stavern was mortally wounded and dragged back to campwhereupon he was put in medical isolation as an untreatable casualty he heard a commotion outside and discovered that a gryphon sent from kelmskeep in the north to scout the situation dove in and smashed a mercenary attack against valdemaran troopsbut was himself gravely hurt the gryphon given only the crude medical treatment available and expected to expire soon was housed with stavern they shared each others company with stories of their homes and loves hallock told the gryphon kelvren about his wife genni charmed by the tales of gennis love for the man kelvren is soothed but then hallock critically weakensand would have died if not for kelvrens desperate healing spellwork to save him it came at a great cost though because aside from his terrible wounds going septic kelvren was sliding into an agonizing death as a result of using literally all of his magic capacity to heal hallockand it was not coming back darkwind ktreva handed over a strip of paper heres trouble elspeth turned away from the lord marshal and read the papers battlefield shorthand aloud gryphon male defended first company sixteenth wounded recovered from field initial aid bad disposition gryphon near death from attempt to heal guard officer by spellwork healers unable to aid further she frowned as she put that dispatch aside from the rest and tapped her command baton thoughtfully on her chin wed better tell treyvan and hydona mmm you know how they are protective darkwind observed he leaned forward against the most massive of the many strategic planning tables in the haven palace it held charts far more detailed than the great map inlaid on the wall in the main court room theyll be concerned you remember those parental instincts of theirs from when we first met with jerven and lytha getting older they treat every other gryphon as clueless little fledglings to be herded about and taught not to fall into wells he murmured to a page who nodded and left immediately less than half a candlemark passed before there were results unbarrr the way a deep voice boomed from behind the double doors as palace guards hastily tried to open them an imposing male gryphon shouldered into the room causing the guards to stumble back as the heavy doors swung against them truth be told he liked the feeling of people trying to get out of his way and no wonder people did considering both of the resident gryphons reputations and relative powerand sheer presence treyvan had a wicked beak and formidable talons that were at the moment sheathed in woodandleather coverings to protect the palaces floors he was golden brown with shadings of pure metallic gold and darker sable with golden eyes the size of fists completely aside from being a predator the size of a horse hydona alone could wither a tree just by staring at it or should the mood strike her restore it to life treyvan was smaller just as powerful magically but faster stronger and more direct in action together they put forth a presence in haven felt in more ways than just the body heat they radiated treyvans crested head flicked side to side then homed in on the main table and its dozen or so planners and pages who isss it he demanded with no preamble elspeth retrieved the dispatch slip and looked it over for any new clues she might have missed in the dozens of lines of code she finally shrugged holding the paper up it doesnt say dispatches can be annoyingly vague im sorry its just how they are she offerred and concsserrrned about all grrryphonsss isss how i am no morrre than that any excuses about field vagueness clearly did not placate the beast that stalked toward the largest planning table respected friend of the crowns or not treyvan had long ago established that he wasnt someone to obstruct for any reason lesser commanders analysts and staff alike parted to make room elspeth handed over the dispatch and treyvan accepted it delicately with the tips of his talons it might be from one of the vales due west of there but that would be more than a hundred miles it wouldnt have any good reason to be in this region would it maybe it got lost a lieutenant suggested but that only gained him a loud click of treyvans beak snapping a warning he treyvan said sternly the grrryphon isss a he not an it sssoldierrr flesssh bone blood beak and he clacked his own for emphasis making a sound like branches snapping talonsss and he flicked up thumb and forefingers of his right hand causing subtle magical sparks to split off and mind asss sssharrrp asss any herrre a nearby sergeant visibly winced and tapped the lieutenants shoulder they made themselves scarce each giving a weak salute to elspeth before fleeing darkwind snorted a barely suppressed laugh another stellar triumph for interspecies diplomacy treyvan good work the gryphon adept ground his beak and clicked it softly he ssstrrruck sssomething that annoyed me i cannot abide usss being thought of asss lesss than yourrr equalsss hissstorrry ssshowsss that he growled darkwind interrupted maybe he thought of you all as something more than equals you dont call an avatar or sacred vision he or she unless youre very good friends im sure he was just overwhelmed by the dazzling thought of elspeth rolled her eyes and sighed giving a wave of reassurance to the staff as they backed off the lord marshal raised a brow then drifted to another table shaking his head a few adjuncts stayed elspeth snapped her fingers you two featherheads come visit my world she said and loudly tapped her baton on the map treyvan loomed beside darkwind and studied the map twitching his massive wings a few times kvaldemar vale darkwind surmised and tapped a fingertip on the map symbol he might be from there firesongs new roost theyre near kelmskeep theyve got a wing of gryphons and theyre threatened by the land grab assuming kelmskeep and kvaldemar are on good terms they may have gotten gryphons to fly scout bondbirds can only do so much range and stamina would all be improved by a healthy gryphon elspeth folded her arms yes well it sounds like all aid availables been given to him and she eyeballed treyvan and its failing we only have so many heralds and healers and theyre more concerned about the hundreds of troops digging in i dont much like the news from the north she reached out and tapped her baton against the largest of the table maps its more delicate than you might first think for reasons we still dont understand these insurgent leaders feel justified in seizing power and using force but if we go in and squash that dissentmilitarilywe send a poor message to the rest of valdemar and allies and rival states darkwind pointed out the famed free country of valdemar open to refugees and the oppressedits population pounded into submission he leafed through other dispatches laying them out to match their approximate places of origin on the map but we have heard the bell ring twice since this began this situation cannot stand but handling it poorly could do great longterm damage socially if anyone was aware of things in the long term it would be one of the hawkbrothers whod think of it socially yes but our agents report the situation began economically weve just sent the skybolts and what regulars we can spare turning in on ourselves after so many outside threatsit doesnt feel right the timing of it i dont think we know enough about action at the front she trailed off seeing treyvanpacing his raptorial eyes crystalsharp appeared to be focused on nothing in particular as if he was preoccupied what is it she asked of him while a clerk handed her a new stack of notes to be signed the gryphon turned his attention back to the others by the table explaining for the adjuncts benefit therrre arrre many waysss forrr a grrryphon to die he began rolling his rs and hissing the sibillants in the accent all gryphons bore when speaking valdemaran assside frrrom the usssual overrrcasssting risssksss frrrom headachesss to unwanted combussstion overrrworrrk of magerrry can lead to deadly maladiesss in grrryphonsss it isss why

ssspellworrrk alone darkwind nodded indita kusk for example tchakisitusk in kleshyan gryphon heavy injuries translate to ruins most deep injuries cascade into worse bodily failures and are ultimately lethal if it is say a nullment ruin hirskausk then even what we consider normal organs will falter as a result of the magic conversion organs waning small wonder our healers are lost magical organs converters more unpronounceable words elspeth could only shrug we dont know who the gryphon is or what the injuries are and we have a thousand other problems right now what are we going to do about it elspeth and darkwind both glanced meaningfully at the gryphon adept while stacks of fresh dispatches were handed over the gryphon narrowed his eyes if you dont do sssomething i will you probably should sheyna darkwind answered bluntly sensing an opportunity and taking it consider yourself assigned were in deep right here all of our heavy magic work is going to be stopping a very uncivil war and if there are no objections if you can go north i want you to take a writ of authority and your badges of rank with you and help out up there at least establish a teleson link if you get the chance we are only getting so much back by herald and courier id like your eyes and your power up there your gryphons your priority but the restbest discretion treyvan nodded firmly and let his hackles smooth down as he turned to exit the two door guards hed bullied through before flung open the doors as the gryphon closed in on them treyvan eyed each of them and pausedthen rumbled sssorrry about earlierrr and stalked briskly down the hall in a word kelvren was miserable the rain persisted and the toosmall tent hed been allocated had long since fallen down over him the tent poles had slanted forward to begin with and when the wind picked up theyd fallen all the way it left his rump and tail out in the rain and the canvas of the tent draped over his head like a very soggy illdesigned cloaks hood hed managed to inch his hindquarters up enough that they werent mired in the mud but that was it the trouble was he felt so heavy not lethargic like hed been drowsing in the sun that was different this was simply the feeling that his wings weighed too much and that his muscles werent up to the task of moving him if he still had his teleson set he could call for help he could have called for help before he was even woundedbut it was long lost back where his skirmish took place and was probably since crushed under horse hooves kelvren was a weak mindspeaker to begin with the teleson amplified what he was able to muster and without it he probably couldnt mindspeak past his tail the healer that had tended to him after hed saved hallock staverns life had long since departed to the frontand she hadnt known even the basics of gryphon anatomy shed confessed to birce shed used draft animal healing techniques on him in fact the indignity of it shed better not tell that to anyone else or shed have silver gryphon kelvren to answer to and she didnt want that he told himself his secret bravado was fading away with every minute of this storm he feared some sort of awful infection from his wounds was causing his inertia the day seemed hopeless and tomorrow hed be weaker still he could feel it this was no way for a hero to end he thought again about a famed tapestry picture hed admired as a youth back at the city of white gryphon it was many centuries old of skandranon the black gryphon wings spread standing majestically atop urthos tower with all the people of the kaledain looking up at him adoringly the moon and stars shone behind the hero and made a halo around his body that young kelvren skothkar had beamed just days before joining the silver gryphons for training i want to be like that i want to be a legend it seemed like it might work too he trained hard and emulated the ancient hero in every way that he couldsuperb flyer vicious fighter fine strategist stupendously skilled loverwell at least he thought soand when the choice was to be bold or prudent he went with bold and reputation was vitaleveryone knew who skandranon rashkae was in ancient times even the dreaded enemies maar and the makaar kelvren didnt precisely boast but he always made certain everyone knew who he was and knew every deed he knew hed be a hero if he tried hard enough a glorious legend instead he was like this mud was splattering up onto his chin and breastfeathers from the constant rain splashing the soil in front of the tent miserable there was constant throbbing agony from his wounds the whipstitching felt like a line of fire no one was coming to help him either his friends at kelmskeep and kvaldemar had to be searching for himbut he was weak and without a teleson he couldnt tell them where he wasand there were none with the soldiers not a mage or herald or even a hedgewizard who could mindspeak or send word he was angry and anger was turning into one of the things that kept him going they didnt bring him enough food for one thing there was no one to come clean him no one to see to his needs no one to groom him no one to admire him all the basics of gryphon wellbeing were absent and he was stuck on the ground murky as the sky was he couldnt help but gaze up at it a tayledras proverb said when once you have tasted flight you forever after walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward for there you have been and there you will ever long to return never before was it so heartbreakingly true if he had bothered to count the number of times hed twitched his heavy wings gathered up his shaky haunches to leap and almost surged forward to flightbut stopped knowing he couldnthe would probably feel even worse hed been on his feet earlier in the day when the downpour ceased for a while hed shambled around through the underbrush and high grasses of the hillock theyd put him on well away from the troops the townspeople their homes their goods and their horses as if id eat the horses anyway of course i wouldnt unless they were offered someone down there had probably seen him eyeing the corral too he felt like someone was always looking his way he saw no smiles when he caught the locals at it either it definitely did not fulfill the eversovital requirement a gryphon had to be admired this was more likewell it was what it wasbeing kept purposely at a distance twice today hed felt an overwhelming emotional wave like a sour crop forcing its way up that he simply wasnt wanted here he swayed on his feet then and sat down abruptly cracking the bushes underneath him when he thought about it it just didnt feel right to be like this they had to know what hed done for hallock and what hed done for valdemardidnt they didnt that count for anything it counted for something he just hadnt realized when he was walked to the tent and given an uncooked pork haunch just how true what theyd said was its the least we can do apparently it was hed been put out here with pleasantries about having free space to roam around and no crowding how diplomatic a way to tell him hed been literally put out to pasture it took an effort to even heave a sigh when he thought about it he had belly cramps he attributed them to the food the weather and to his discontent and he itched he felt like he was getting parasites under his feathers and didnt have the spare strength to gnaw and scratch at them and now here he wasthe brave skydancersoaked stuck under a tarp having a thoroughly unwanted mudbath it just couldnt get much worse he thought except there is a tayledras saying that thinking those words is the first sign that it will definitely be worse there was so much noise from the rain and thunder that he didnt hear someone approach until they were close enough to startle him he felt suddenly furious at himself that instead of lurching to his feet ready for a threat he only flinched his eyes must have looked especially intense as a result because the boy who came toward him immediately backpedaled the boy had on loose heavily patched pants and overlarge boots and the rain sluiced off of his widebrimmedand also quite patchedsun hat right now the hat only seemed to serve as a way of directing rain down his back he carried a sack in both hands that for all the world appeared to containand be completely covered inmud he looked about as gaunt as kelvren felt and his untanned skin had irregular patches of very dark brown like the hide of a wild horse or domestic cattle it wasnt like anything kel had seen before on a human then again like seemingly everything else in this part of the world the dark splotches could have just been caked mud sir gryphon sir s time for your feeding is that all right sir you hungry the boys voice was strained with fear and the words were obviously forced out between nearly clenched teeth in fact those teeth chattered a little from the rain as the wind picked up come to feed you sir hurrrh yesss come clossserrr i wont eat you what did you brrring the insult the boy delivered was galling come to feed him like he was some animal in a pen did they have any idea who he was what he was he tried to stand but instead just felt pinned by the soaked canvas thessse polesss fell down come help with them firrrssst the boy looked around for a dry place to put his load and since there was none he settled on a thick clump of tallgrass to cradle the sack it was still in the rain but out of the immediate muddy water hitching up his pants he clumped through the sludge to the edge of the canvas pulled it up and met kelvrens eyes fullon apparently up this close to a gryphon for the first time the boy looked like a squirrel who just that moment realized that the pretty shadow closing in on him was an owl ten heartbeats passed before the boy moved another inch at that precise moment between ten and eleven heartbeats the canvas weakly arched over kelvrens head collapsed completely from the weight of the rain on it leaving only the curve of a muddy beak sticking out kelvren closed his eyes and sighed from the miserable to the absurd i did wonder the gryphon thought and now i know it does get worse treyvan walked to the recital chamber hydona was using as a classroom the sunlight from the dormers glinted on seven knifeblades and illuminated the swirls of dust from feathers and age stirred up by the beltfed brass overhead fans and the wings of the three gryphons already in the room sixteen people a few in heralds whites were in a loose semicircle strewn with books folios and large multicolored drawings they all seemed comfortable propped up on dozens of mismatched pillows and hydona looked most comfortable of all lying on her belly on a short stage behind her the two gryphlets jervan and lytha were doing their best to hover without flapping their wings the lift that gave gryphons their ability to fly was in their bones and it was a discipline to try and hover solely by mental control without moving any air by wings lytha looked to be a prodigy almost a yard from the floor with all four feet dangling down as if she was held in midair like a boneless cat jervan only managed to get his forelegs and wings to stay up without too much effort he held himself in place and cried out rrrampant then used his new position as an opportunity to bat at his sisters tail more easily treyvan swept in and told jervan leave yourrr sssisssterrr alone orrr ill feed you to the companionsss reached out and bumped jervan with a wingtip the gryphlets wings snapped out straight from his sides changing his center of balance in his partial levitation he fell over backward whistling highpitched laughter while his sister joined inbut she sounded smug tyrrrant hydona trilled as her mate approached come to conquerrr she teased as treyvan tapped beaks with her and then turned his head upsidedown to accept an ear nibble you sssee ssstudentss you mussst be prrreparrred to maintain yourrr worrrk durrring any dissstrrraction the seven knives she held suspended pointdown in midair between the stage and the students didnt waver in fact it appeared that she paid no attention to the knives at all thisss isss why you essstablish sssolid anchorrr pointsss when beginning worrrk rrrelative posssitionsss mean rrrelative forrrcsse when you know the posssitionsss well you can then concssentrrrate on what might affect thossse posssitionsss contrrrol isss in how you sssenssse the changesss in thossse posssitionsss and compensssate thisss isss why ssso many trrraditionsss ussse diagrrramsss and patterrrnsss in magic they arrre waysss of trrracking posssitionsss asss powerrr isss moved and changed in thisss way you can usse

you conssstantly durrring yourrr prrracticsse then brrrute forcsse isss authorrrized and you may ussse the knivesss on him she replied in the same tone gryphlets cackled from behind her and most of the students laughed outright you wound me treyvan complained i wisssh hydona replied and chewed on his other ear but i need you arrround ssso i dont torrrment the ssstudentsss asss much what isss wrrrong her tone changed from mocking to concerned as she sat up on her haunches an unknown grrryphonsss been grrrounded up norrrth treyvan admitted he isss at one of the sssupply line villagesss but therrre isssnt anyone who knowsss whatsss wrrrong with him rrreportsss sssay he isss without magic and not doing well you ssshould go hydona answered immediately gryphlet heads popped up from behind the stage ill sssee to yourrr ssstudentsss and herrrd thossse two without you forrr a while hurrrh arrre you sssurrre you want me away treyvan prompted you can go away asss long asss you need to loverrr hydona purred becaussse i know who yourrre coming back to the rain had finally let up to just a haze and the boy had gotten the tent back up while kelvren wobbled away through the field to relieve himself he limped back wings dragging in the tallgrass and crawled into the tent the gryphon bumped a wing and dislodged one of the four poles doing so but the boy quickly sloshed around to prop it back up kelvren was almost turned completely over onto his stronger side trying to get to some of his worst itches with his beak or talons when the boy said ill get your food sir just wait right there kelvren openly growled ill be herrre why would i want to leave thisss palace the gryphon snorted all the sssilk tapessstrrriesss and dancssing girrrlsss arrre rrreason enough to ssstay its not so bad sir just depends what you compare it to thats what i always tell myself he returned with the sack and plopped it on the slightly less muddy tent floor not ssso bad i am sssoaked to the bone i can barrrely walk i look terrrible and i have beetlesss and twigsss underrr my wingsss do you underrrssstand beetlesss and twigsss ticks too probably the boy shrugged he undid the knots on the sack and left it open like a feedbag in front of the gryphon we get a lot of ticks around here when it rains they climb as high as they can up on the grass the boy took his hat off and shook it toward the outsidean exercise in futility if there ever was one since the hat had so many open patches in the weave he may as well have been wearing an anglers net on his head kelvren itched all over again thinking about that thanksss he growled but the boy must have thought he was referring to the food ywelcome sir i have to wait for the sack when youre done so please dont tear it up much i dont have too many kelvren nosed into the bag and tasted at it with an extended tongue he hadnt expected prime cuts but it looked and tasted as if he was getting the least wanted body parts from whatever animals they had at the time there were a couple of knuckle joints and what looked like some backstrap from awell he wasnt sure could be pork could be horse could be deer could be tax collector he hoped for horse a short leg here a few feet of entrails six chicken feet and a hoof well that part was identifiable at least it might be best just to eat it all without looking too closely the boy was as far back against the side of the tent as he could manage knees folded up to his chest and hands holding the hat in front of him he stared at the gryphon kelvren pulled his face out of the sack and regarded the boy dont be afrrraid he said blood dripping continuously off his beak yes sir no sir not afraid sir hurrrh kelvren growled and got another few pounds of the stuff down his gullet ssso why sssend you up herrre what did you do wrrrong the gryphon asked he was only half joking lot of the town figures youre really dangerous sir and they need all able bodies down there but i dont really count so much and some of the folk they want to stay with what stock theyve got left to em in case you went down there you know on a rampage or somethin monsters always rampage they said kelvren narrowed his eyes and peered out of the tent letting his mood smolder for a long while alwaysss he growled thats what im told sir ssso i am a rrrampagetobe and they sssend a boy to brrring me food you mussst be verrry brrrave not so brave sir i get the work no one else wants and i go with it gets my mum and me a little coin privy needs cleared out fence strung through swamp cleanup after calving im who they get like i say isnt so bad depending what you compare it to theres folk out there losin limbs and eyes and all i figure im doin all right an if somethin happened to me they said theyd just get someone else so its all proper yourrre herrre becaussse they can do without you if i ate you and yourrrecontent with that the boy shrugged and smiled not like i want to get eaten sir but if i did get all killed id still have had a life been told i shouldnt have enough times i figure im lucky havin even a short one he pinched the edges of his hat staring at the water drips that fell from it while kelvren finished the remains in the bag it might not be such a bad thing anyway they say you go to a really nice place when you die where everythings warm and pretty its supposed to be a place where folk really like you no matter what you probably know how it is bein a monster and all no one can really be welcome everywhere kelvren nudged the bag a few inches sideways toward the boy ssso i am learrrning the boy picked up the bag and knotted the cords an anyhow i have my mum an shes good to me no matter what even now that alls this happened she said we were just about to get rich too which woulda been nice still all the army trouble cant go on forever he wiped his bloodied hands on his trousers uhthanks for not tearing up the bag or eating me he said cheerfully and put his soggy hat back on anytime kelvren replied still mystified by the boys logic the boy smiled and waved back as he tromped out through the muddy field toward his town this haze is intolerable treyvan growled in kaledain lashing his tail in anger i cant do any better with my distance viewing and that herald with that farseeing gift just left for the deedun front the storms havent so much made things unreliable as theyve made them hurrh unfamiliar this all would have worked five years ago and now it is giving us nothing all we know is where the target is and just a glimpse did the glimpse show you anything useful a small voice crooned from below treyvan the gryphon turned his hawklike gaze down past his magic instruments to the hertasi in the vast room with him the little lizard creature looked up at the gryphon with a wideeyed but unafraid expression rrrhhh a changecircle near by a valdemaran guard camp a gryphon body in a tent head down wings flat treyvan pondered signs of heavy injuries but tended to looked like far westerner but he was no gryphon i know i couldnt read an identifying radiant treyvan snapped his head up suddenly no radiant aura pena no distinctive life glow to magesight no wonder it was so hard to find him he wasnt shielded there was just nothing there to shield i was looking for gryphon aura traits but i must have passed him by a dozen times since he seemed to only come across as a common animal from such a search the hertasi looked alarmed she obviously knew what that meant hirskaursk you think hell be dead soon is all she could think of to say well see about that treyvan growled with an undertone of determination and stalked to a massive cabinet he reared up onto his haunches laid both claws flat on the upper corners and dug his thumbtalons into the sockets in the trimwork he twisted them and spoke hiskusk and the sound of long metals rods shifting and clanging into place sounded from inside the cabinet unfolded magelights inside gleamed off of teleson sets a massive leather and brass harness steel fighting claws a narrow breastplate and more treyvan pulled out and shouldered on one side of the harness while the hertasi rushed in to clip and buckle the other side of it more hertasi rushed in after three sharp whistles from the gryphon and preparations for a flight gained momentum quickly three telesons were wrapped and packed into a flat case and at a nod from the gryphon the fighting claws were packed as well treyvan called out instructions of what must be brought and side pouches were stuffed with arcane materials and clipped to the harness before long a swarm of the little lizards were readying him for flight and unlacing his talonsheaths when treyvan reached the outdoors he shook his wings and tested the harness for fit another pair of hertasi affixed his ornamental breastplate and cinched it tight while another one added several more pouches to his flight harness pena that downed gryphon is going to need a trondiirn get whitebird ready for travel right now tell hydona i am going north pena the senior hertasi turned to her charges still inside get whitebird ready for travel right now tell hydona that treyvan and i are going north treyvan gave pena a look of disbelief even as she turned to clamber into heavy insulated clothing he opened his beak but was stopped short by the senior hertasi poking a stubby finger up at him you know how this works treyvan if you need supplies you cant stop midspell to go fetch them you get caught up in your magic and you know it you dont get fed enough you get cranky and if you got hurt yourself who would see to you pena nodded firmly slapped her tail once on the pavestones for emphasis and pulled her hood and glass goggles on as they were handed to her by another hertasi scampering by now just pay attention to where you fly and give me a smooth ride understand hallock stavern leaning on a greenwood stick that was either a tooshort crutch or a toolong cane glared at the clerk in the tent with him and stabbed a finger on the papers and palimpsests heaped on a table that was obviously once a door it still had the handle and hinges now you listen to me i want answers son and i want them now is help coming from anywhere for the gryphon anyone anywhere ive got the rank to push you into karse in your shorts if you so much as the clerk held up a hand looked up at the officer and snapped completely no you listen to me you overbearing bastard the dispatches were sent and there is nothing new from haven nothing nothing you understand look at this he slammed his inkstained hands on the stacks of documents this is what i have to deal with every bleeding soul in this camp and three other camps want messages and theyre all demanding them of me send me to karse naked if you want please it will get me out of here but until you get twenty more clerks to replace me you will damned well wait like everyone else sir hallock rocked back slowly he narrowed his eyes and crossed his arms as the clerk sat down after a long moment he replied i should damn well promote you for talking to me like that son theres no need to wish a curse on me sir the clerk replied i know what the gryphon did for you we all do but no news is no news when i know something therell be a runner sent for you hallock frowned but had to accept it ill be making the rounds of wounded then but ill come back good luck the clerk didnt even look up as he resumed scrawling notes on teetering piles of papers same to you sir hallock caught himself rubbing at the wide scar on his forehead then hobbled his way out into the mess of the encampment woods had been cleared on either side of the main trade road which had become the main thoroughfare of a tent citywell a city designed by a drunken mob maybe there were no straight lines to get anywhere and tents clustered around every tree that was too heavy to clear cut ropework between those trees appeared to have been done by myopic giant spiders during fits of seizures and anything from canvas to blankets had been strung up as shelter the poor tinder gained from the smaller felled trees made the cook fires underneath the canopies smoke and struggle for life the main local source for firewood was a nondescript sort of scrubby scrawny bush with annoying short thorns it grew all over for miles except for a former changecircle at the edge of the camp no one wanted to even set foot on that circle even though it was set perfectly atop a circular mound that probably had the best drainage and view of any of this mudridden swamp the most orderly part of the whole encampment was on either side of the wide road to the rivers edge where the grain mill was the miller moved in with a family in town and volunteered his home as a command post most of the officer corps had settled into the mill tower which was the tallest building for many miles around the rooms above the grindstones served as operation planning rooms for security reasons in truth it was mainly because the rooms were warm dry and had fireplacessome comfort despite the incessant grind of the millstones hallock should technically be in there now but the drone of the mill gave him a headache so did the thick concentration of junior officers arguing tactics where they tried to justify staying inside where they were needed most of the staff at the mill mean well but they didnt seem to understand an army can not be administratedit must be led after the southern border wars the turmoil of the storms and the strife the changecircles brought one leader after another retired from service few command veterans had stayed in field service after all of that staverns first his commander of the sixteenth regiment had been the most experienced field commander the guard could send northward at the time he knew the protocols as the womans subordinate but he hadnt known her well shed fallen when hallock had the morning that hed been cut loose from the healers tent and the yellow ribbon removed from it he heard the horns sounding the mourning notes she had been buried already and here he was a new stripe tacked on the sleeve a new ribbon under the badge brevet promotion first of the sixteenth captain hallock stavern a senior officer maybe but still one of the regulars in his heart filthy and unpleasant as the cantonment was at least here he was with the guard he hadnt gained his previous rank by nepotism or bribery hed gained it by genuinely believing in what the guard could be and his soldiers knew just the fact that he was in the muck waving off occasional offers for help and took his time checking in on the units didnt go unnoticed if he had to plod along on a crutch to see to the soldiers wellbeing rather than pass by in a driven carriage then thats how it would be done and the mill be damned he stopped in at one of the larger tents an openfront thirtypole affair where cots and poorly strung hammocks were every one filled with the wounded the most open section of the illset compound tent held a score of uniformed women and men with boiling pots of water sorting rough buckets of moreorless straight wood six of those in the hammocks were unconscious but two were snoring so that was a good sign the ones awake were healthily complaining of officers and strategies these twentysome souls were the barely ambulatory guard soldiers who were left over from most of the northern clashes as was the valdemaran tradition if they werent fit to ride or march they had been put to work those that still had full use of their hands were engaged in basic fletching all guards that were rated for field combat knew how to make arrows bolts and spears of several types of whatever native materials could be scrounged supply trains were on the way from the south and a wagon or two arrived every few candlemarks during the day proper larger tents were being unloaded even now by a mix of the guard and the local but now largely unemployed populace harvest crews would never come so the large households that depended on them for their crops now faced hardship the stalks and rushes from the grain harvests wouldnt be collected and peddlers who sold the baskets and other wares made from them would have no goods and so on down the line the locals were being compensated for their goods and work but a government chit didnt change the fact that so soon after the terrors of the storms when hope was building up again their livelihoods had been smashed still where there is life there is hope he thought as he looked around the convalescents tent and here i am alive to see it and ill see haven again and walk its streets again with genni first sir the senior officer of the tent gave him a salute with her one unbandaged hand even that was unexpected most decorum went out with the slop in places like this good tsee yback with us she said and it didnt take a genius to read the subtext thanks corporal you being seen to well here the obvious answer came right on cue well as can be expected sir a couple of others chuckledno matter what region you were from or what valdemaran dialect you spoke some answers are utterly predictable things sobered up quickly as she spoke her mind whole things been a bit of a toss honestly its not a proper deployment we say cause were moving against well our own really aint a one of us feels right bein here cause of moving on fellow valdemarans we ought not be fightin our own the senior enlisted man nearby coughed discreetly trying to wave the corporal down from making some kind of blunder she gave him a rude gesture with a few fingers ey its true we talked bout it an thats how we all lean firsts got the right t know how we feel even if we are stuck as gimps she looked back to hallock might be a black mark on mrecord to say all that sir but just the same id as soon not get promoted in the guard over fightin my own countrymen hallock leaned a little less on his stick and eyed everyone there whod meet his gaze its not exactly treasonous to say this kind of thing but it bends some regs someone with less ribbon than me might bust down hard on you over what you just said so why tell me this of all people hallock felt himself unexpectedly moved from the words that followed right here were all of his countrys virtues summed up in a few minutes of hesitant confession the corporal spoke up first because youre here sir i mean we coulda writ it up an sent it all official or couldve gotten a clerk tpass itround in rumormail but fact is sir she hesitated but then saw others nodding fact is sir we get put off duty roster there aint much use for us cept as idle hands an cotwarmersbut we aint got idle minds an were still guard even if we get stuck off t bleedinplace another soldier grunted at that particularly derogatory term for convalescents we told you cause you came here to us not us to you an that means a bunch to us gimps murmurs of agreement came from around the tent a junior enlisted footman added you bein so close to bein one yerself sir we figured youd understand better than the mill the group nodded to that as well isnt everyone gets magicsaved by a and he looked around for suggestions by one of those gods and spirits got thave plans for you sir that kind of thing just doesnt happen to regular folk like us we figure ygotta be somethin amazing for that thappen hallock steadied himself on his staff again and licked his lips there is something amazing at that but ill tell you what he began we were under orders and got hit hard a gryphon none of us had ever met struck out of the sky like a thunderbolt and near laid down his life to help valdemaran soldiers just like me and you then he near killed himself just so i could get home to see my wife he looked to each of them completely holding their attention every one of you here lost blood bone or tooth defending your fellow soldiers you didnt even know their names but you bled for em just the same so they could get home to their families he shook his head and leaned on his walking stick more heavily youre lookin the wrong way here you think im special because a fury shot out of the sky and fought to save guard to save me hell no he paused for a few breaths looking at each of them again youre all amazing because youre like him kelvren slept far longer than hed intended and it was a sleep with unsteady dreams these dreams were more like sharp images that struck and faded like the pluck of a bowstring leaving afterimages and the memories that spun off from them the worst were ones of his body coming apart splitting open from each of the wounds hed suffered until he floundered drowning in a deep pool of all his blood the other dreams were less grislythere was sky in most of them in the deep blue of chasing dawn or the dazzling blaze of white only seen when emerging from one cloud towards another in bright day there was the view of the londell river and lake evendim and the descent into errolds grove some memories were sexualwhich was no unusual thing for a gryphon especially him hed been on quite a few backs over the years skydancing solicitous crooning laughter and intimate nibbling were well recalled then theyd fade away until another of those bowstring images shocked into his mind his friends at kvaldemardarian and snowfire and steelmind and that insufferably enigmatic firesong and his trondiirns who made him feel so good and got him prepared so finely for his assignationsand then it was back to the sex dreams again sir time for your feeding sir the boy with the mottled skin was back looking under the flap of the tent kelvren rolled onto his belly startled he immediately regretted it crushing his sheath he yelped and then kept his eyes closed a while seeing only dazzle sir you all right you made a funny noise kelvren coughed twice and answered funny forrr you not ssso funny forrr me he winced and slowly opened his eyes i may have brrroken sssomething ill need laterrr urrrh food he asked ears flicking forward or isss it what you brrrought lassst time uhm its not the ah exact same as last time some of its new colors and i brought some bread that didnt turn out right but they didnt want me to tell you that they figured if you didnt know it was burned youd maybe think it was a treat kelvrens eyes went to slits and he stood up on all fours but kept his head down as he exited the tent as he came out into full sun despite the haze left from the heavy rain before he swung his head to bear dead on the village a trrreat i am wearrry of thisss disssrrressspect you boy what isss yourrr name boy i mean thats what most people say to call me is boy my full names jeft roald dunwythie the roald parts named after the king o course no relation but like i say most everyone here knows me as boy so ill answer to that if you want hurrrh do you like being called boy kel asked its not as if i have to like it sir boys what they call me at the gryphons unblinking gaze he finally admitted no i dont much like it my mum gave me a proper name and if its good enough for her it should be good enough for anyone else if things was right but things aint so perfect in this life they are as they are kelvren turned away half a minute passed before he returned his gaze to the young man jeft rrroald dunwythie if you learrrn nothing elssse frrrom me i wisssh it to be thisss hold it clossse to yourrr hearrrt and never forrrget it it doesss not matterrr what otherrrsss call you asss much asss it matterrrsss what you anssswerrr to the gryphon limped away heavily and stamped some tallgrass down on the other side of the tent for several minutes he shook out his feathers feeling renewed strength despite his restless innards his anger and pain were transitioning into resolve and a plan and asss sssoon asss i am done making rrroom we arrre going down therrre to get my next meal if they expect a rrrampaging monsssterrr theyll find out i am not that theyve ssseen me hurrrt and delirrriousss but i ssswearrr to youtheyll neverrr forrrget what i am like when i am hungrrry annoyed and deterrrmined kelvren set into the first part of his plan principles of magic he thought learned early on transmutation turn what is useless into what is usable he hobbled toward and then past his companion if i cannot preen for beauty then i will preen for effect he laboriously groomedbadlywincing several times from the persistent agony of his wounds he took a few deep breaths and stared up at the sky when he was done if i am going out of this life he thought i am not going as a disrespected animal shoved away to rot if i die i am damned well going to do it with a full belly and the satisfaction of knowing i ruined some idiots day the gryphon limped around to face the young man bandages askew feathers at all angles and his stitches exposed he looked to be in poor shape to anyones eyes brrring your sssack jeft time forrr fun jeft did just that crashing along through the tallgrass and brush to catch up why arrre you ssso disssresspected that they give you the worrrssst jobsss its my face i think im not any different from the other younglings here cept my face what isss wrrrong with yourrr facsse kel asked pausing ostensibly for jeft to close in on him but in reality it was because he was having trouble moving well his right side haunch folded up on him and jarred his lanced shoulder badly eliciting a short whine it looksss fine to me you have good marrrkingsss thats just it there sir these uh markings he confirmed as he stopped beside the gryphon pointing at the splotches that randomly covered his face people think my face is really ugly they say its cause my mum married a farsoutherner and he had bad blood in him an so i came out like this all ugly from both sides they say and theres nothin can be done about it so i just do what i do he hoisted the heavy bag up again and yourrr fatherrr he died he was one of the traveling harvesters an when he went away up northwest he got crushed by one of those big carts they said mum took it hard and still hasnt gotten better after that anyway hes in a better place now kelvren levered himself up gingerly mulling that over then snorted at the flies pestering his wounds and resumed his trek i am sssorrry youhurrhhavekah sketilossst yourrr fatherrr he said breathily tripping on brush i have not ssseen mine in fifteen yearrrsss we sssend messsagesss butah it isss not the sssame as sssharrring sssky with him skys probly where my father is jeft smiled we always did like talking about birds me and him sos maybe hes a bird now hed like that a lot cept i guess he couldnt get stew an scrapings as a bird kelvren could see that soldiers and villagers were taking notice of them as they closed the distance to the encampment kel angled toward a recently cut tree stump and suddenly fell against it sir master kelvren sir whats wrong jeft dropped the bag and crashed toward the gryphon youre bleedin again sir an that uh sewin they did on yous torn up some sir he waved at the flies to little effect and then kel could feel the boys hand on his eartufts sir you hear me can i help sir he was sounding desperate slowly kelvren opened an eye toward jeft hurrrh it isssall forrr effect he wheezed and smiled as best he could ssso brrrave you rrrun towarrrdsss me when the rrressst of yourrr village would rrrun away welli was scared too he blurted and then confessed i mean if youiid be in a lot of trouble mayor said you were my problem now an i bet theyd whup me if you died he pulled back his hand and wiped it on both of his eyes under the brim of the sun hat iti just dont want you tdie all right an an if yneed a healer or somethin ill run get you a healer jeft looked all around and saw a dozen guard soldiers were headed their way at a brisk walk i uhi think maybe helps coming sir kelvren rumbled softly yesss ssso they arrre heh he closed his eyes to rest let the gamesss begin hallock heard a commotion from the town while walking around the last of the convalescents tents in a guard encampment it wasnt unusual to hear occasional incidents ranging from fist brawls to dirtysong competitions or some poor soldier getting dressed down at top volume this was the first one hallock had heard though that began with shouting and running and finally laughterand not all of it human there was just that one loud descending burbling voice that mixed in with the rest but it put hallock into motion quickwalking with the stick in his hand he rounded the mill road and followed it toward the soundswhich came from the main mess tents he saw a mix of backs in guard uniforms and locals work clothing and then a flick of a large feathery wing above them then there was another ripple of laughter he pushed his way forward finally collaring a lieutenant to help him reach the center of it all there he found someone who appeared to be a town official judging by his necklace he was getting up off his knees where apparently hed been vomiting into a large sackthough on second thought yes it appeared he had been vomiting because his head had been in the sack now the man was coughing furiously into a handkerchief and attempting to wipe his face down some of his attendants were trying to calm down a few sixteenth and guard regulars who were still shouting and provoking the man kelvren sagged sideways against a trestle table with one wing slack on the ground and his bandages askew and seeping the platter on the table was filling up soldiers brought their own bowls over to pinch off a bit of meat or bread and set it down on the platter when they spoke something to kelvren the gryphon nodded or smiledbut even from this far away hallock could tell that the creature was exhausted kelvren reached for a bowl and some of the food on the platter but his taloned hands shook too much to keep hold of the bowl a strangelooking boy stuck close to the gryphon and was there in an instant to catch the bowl and load it up with food first someone called out and the air filled with a mix of expletives intakes of breath and sir aimed nowhere in particular all firsts were captain in rank over a hundred guard soldiers instantly werent involved and were doing something else when it happened whatever it might have been some soldiers saluted and then swiveled around in the mud to find who they were supposed to be directing it at its stavern someone else called out and then a small cheer followed welcome back sir called a junior rider who jostled around the retreating official to reach hallock he saluted again apparently just to make sure hed been seen saluting at all but was also grinning your gryphon friend there well weve just been taking care of him sir he wasnt getting treated none too well so we just helped him out some the rider shooed people out of the way to get hallock over to kelvrens side the gryphon swayed a little and his eyes pinned and dilated several times as he recognized hallock ah my fine frrriend hallock ssstaverrrn he purred how isss the belly feels tight hurrrh mine too thessse arrre good people thessse sssoldierrss of yourrrsss know the value of a good meal a couple of dozen chuckles from all around told hallock that he was missing something kel you look i know how i look the gryphon growled threateningly then mellowed the next moment then i hope you dont feel like you look kelvren swallowed twitching his ears and keeping his eyes closed as a bowlful of food went down his gullet he sighed loudly and opened his eyes again to lock onto hallocks own wellknown fact feeding a grrryphon isss good luck he sighed thisss sssketichunk therrre the what isss it called officsse warrrmerrr that he indicated the retreating official and his staff with his beak ssseems he left orrrderrrs that i wasss to be given a sssackful a day of the ssscrrrapsss unfit forrr the ssstewpot i took insssult he swung his head around to indicate the soldiers in the mess tent with him several of whom were still coming by to drop bits of their ration into what had become the gryphons food tray ssso in the ssspirrrit of equality between alliesss i came herrre and sharrred the sssack with him he looked well fed and ssso in the ssame ssspirit added sssomething to the sssack himssself beforrre leaving i think a couple more soldiers laughed outright then stifled themselves at hallocks withering look the rider turned hallock aside and whispered confidentially he was in awful shape when he came limping down sir an we knew what hed done for you ocourse so when he asked so polite for help well we couldnt refuse we brought im here to get him fed an sent word for thewell anyway things just went as they went some of the regulars well they crowded the mayor there and mayor that was the mayor hallock sighed he put up a hand to halt the explanation so some of you pulled the sack ofscrapover the mayors head and pulled the ssstrrring kelvren finished with a hint of triumph policssy change wasss enacted immediately upon esscape from the feed bag hallock frowned and asked wait why would the mayor have anything to do with whether you got fed anyway the rider interrupted i know that one sir guard feeds guard and buys meat and grain from whoevers nearest the gryphons a foreigner sos when the accountings done the hospitality comes from the local senior diplomat thats the mayor i figure he thought the gryphon was gonna die soon anyhow so why use the good meat he can sell to the guard instead hallock nodded and unhappily took in kelvrens disheveled appearance i see so you it was regulars that did it all right the rider nodded you there regular it was horse that did it all right the woman nodded all right then clearly there were no witnesses and no laws or regulations provably broken he waved a hand around loosely to dismiss the whole affair as you were he angled in close by kelvren who reached up with a shaky taloned hand and pulled him close in against his head hallock was pressed against the gryphons warm feathered neck cheek and jaw it wasssnt too much hallock ssstaverrrn i jussstwanted the sssame rrressspect of any valdemarrran warrriorrr not hurrh what would darrrien sssay the firrrst sssalt frrrom the table his stoic demeanor faltered therrresss nobody forrr me herrre hallock squeezed a few of the neck feathers each wider than his spread hand im here kelvren and believe me there are many here who admire you for what youve done for me hallock saw that where the gryphons feathers had been cut away in clumps along his side and flanks bandages had fallen away and seeping wounds glistened you have wounds coming open again kel we need to get you out of here you look like you are in terrible pain kel held him there for a few more heartbeats then patted the mans back before pulling back to meet eyes again a good meal helpsss and the good will of otherrrsss and ssseeing you my good frrriend what would genni think of thisss day mmm the gryphon shifted his weight flinched and let the wing he was trying to move lay where it was i do hurrrt yesss and i need a placsse to ssstay and to get clean the gryphon lowered his head to the table and let its weight rest on the curve of his beak while he kept his eyes closed he sagged a little more with each breath hallock held out his hand and rubbed the gryphons mudcrusted brow ridge i know somewhere you can stay my friend well take you there kelvren lifted his head and looked sidelong at hallock with a slight grin you know what i sssaid beforrre pain sharrred isss pain halved i sharrred half of my pain with the mayorrr and i feel much betterrr now hallock gathered up a squad and they helped kelvren trudge from the mess tent through the cantonment a pair under each wing and one at each shoulder soldiers came out from almost every tent and watched the slow progression some came over to ask if they could helpeveryone seemed to know who the creature was or at least what hed done jeft followed along looking worried each time the gryphon slipped or groaned when they passed one of the corrals several horses pressed in closer to see what this curiosity was why arent they terrified one of the soldiers wondered hes a huge predator shouldnt they be bolting we do not ssscarrre mossst crrreaturrresss unlesss we intend to it isss a peculiarrrity of usss kelvren wheezed his exhaustion was showing and he stopped to rest you have a lot of those hallock teased hoy look that dapple gray thats dughan my mount when my forehead got redecorated kel made an effort to look over but still his head hung low hallock tried to keep the gryphons mood light im ordering that you be fed well some of the men were suggesting we make up a fake squad to allocate the food for you its an idea with some meritbut i think i carry enough weight now to have you cared for outright he spoke instructions to a runner and then sent her on her way ahead of them when they arrived near the convalescents tent hallock had visited earlier the sorting barrels had been pushed to the back and several cots had been folded and pushed aside nearly everyone was awake and every eye was wide enlisted men spread out a canvas tarpaulin on the cleared space and the squad gingerly guided the gryphon in kel all but collapsed on the spot and sprawled sideways onto his goodor rather less injuredside panting an unhappy private nearly pinned by the gryphons fall crawled out from under that sides wing healer birce will be here soon hallock reassured kelvren knelt down beside him devon too on his usual rounds theyll fix up those plasters for you when they check everyone else he waved over a folding stool and set it in front of kels beak patting the canvas here a place for your head he grunted and lifted kels head to rest flatly upon it after a candlemark of reassuring talk and gawkers coming to see the beast that saved the captain the healers arrived to tend to all the selfnamed gimps in the hours that passed a couple of dozen soldiers asked the captain if they could touch kelvren and after the first one scratched at his brow ridges for half an hour kel consented to all the cloud cover broke and treyvan and pena found themselves in searing sunlight theyd made a short gating to shorten their flight time but then found themselves with a strong tailwind and treyvan calculated itd be quicker to fly directly for as long as that lasted despite the desperate circumstances treyvan found himself feeling good about it he hadnt been on a truly long flight since the return to haven from the plains now feeling the sun on his back the magic tingling through his feathers watching the terrain roll on below he exulted in the glory of flight pena he mindspoke you dont need a rest soon do you i have good thermals ahead oh no you go on ahead im thinking about new tunnels around the collegium and the embassies and where to tap a new hotspring and where to set in a new baking oven treyvan felt the hertasi pat his back an idle mind is my workshop but treyvan arent we due to make another gate attempt soon he replied if i recall my maps right we should be in range of a clean gating within the candlemark ill try to anchor high up to correct for any targeting drift we can fly the difference from there ill find us a good landmark by the main road mark it with a lasting magelight and send word to whitebird by teleson well set an arrival time when she gets there ill try another gate to bring her in to where the gryphon is arent you the clever one pena chuckled in his mind just trying to keep up with you treyvan answered and laughed out loud as he soared higher kelvren dozed off and on as best his wounds would let him the humans were given drugged drinks to reduce their pain but birce was not willing to risk mixing such stuff with a gryphons unknown anatomy it was very hard to get good rest when parts of your body were simply screaming at you and throbbed with every breath stillthe attention the full belly and the company gave him new strength when he was able to he answered questions and shared scores of stories about his exploits and his people with dozens of eager listeners he related the story of hallocks healing but felt a pang of wistfulness when hallocks wife genni was brought up because kelvren was acutely aware he had no mate to go back to should he survive this and by this age he should the night swallowed up the sky and he lost all track of time between naps most of the rest of the convalescents were asleep their night dosages in full effect he raised his head looking up to the starry sky seeded by sparks from the camps fires he whimpered softly this wasnt what skandranon was likehe would never have been laid up with such injuries wasting away and they have to be looking for medarien and firesong and the others they must be able to send me help or bring me back i know that great legends usually involve great funeralsbut i dont want to die sir ythere sir you awake he heard jefts voice at his side and turned an eye that way without lifting his head oh good youre awake sir i uh my mum wanted to see you i fetched her here the young man waved someone in a woman in trews and blouse carrying a large basket knelt beside him and licked her lips my lord gryphon she said in a voice gentled down as if talking to a scared child jefts talked so much about you i wanted to see you myself you and she glanced at where jeft stood back by kels flank youve treated him well better than most people ever have iwanted you to know it is appreciated hes never really had many friends and even then they didnt consider him an equal but then here you are thiswonder dropped into our livesand you talk to him as a person not as a servant youve done us a great honor kel listened to every word and raised his chin up then laid his head sideways the honorrr isss mine lady ammari not a lady though my lord gryphon i am just a seamstress and artisan she looked down at her hands when she said this there was something in her tone that was deeply sad for a moment hurrrh jeft isss a brrrave and he paused i wont sssay boy but he isss brrrave sssmarrrt he brought his head up and shifted his weight from his sideways slouch which sent lightning shots through his body from each stitch and scab deep into him urrrh ssso welcome to my palacsse ammari pulled back the cloth cover from the basket and hesitantly pulled out a scrub brush jeft said thatthat you didnt lookuhm that you needed some cleaning up and he knew you were in pain when he gets hurt he comes to me so he thought if you were in paini should come to find you she asked apprehensively you wont bite me if i do this badly will you kel smiled but took his time to answer havent the ssstrrrength to bite ammarrri you have no fearrrsss frrrom me but you arrre herrre forrr morrre than tending to my filth he glanced back to where jeft was pinching and toying with the tattered feathertip of one of his primaries and it isss not jussst about him isss it ammari swallowed and nodded to kel itsabout both of us ive never been like this beforei feel so lost my husband she caught kels eye he nodded you know then jeft must have told you ive been alone with jeft all this time and we work so hard butwhen all of this happened it justits just been too much for us ive been trying to find work here at the camphonorable work i mean but its so hard she reached out to kelvrens face but let her touch fall instead along his neck his hackles looked black in the dim light flakes of dirt crumbled away off of feathers im sorrywords dont come easily about this i feel selfish being here when youre so badly hurt but with what happenedyoure magic andmagic does bad and good in this life and youyoure good magic everyone talks about what you could do what you did do i dont know where else to turn and jeft thinks so much of you ammari pulled her hand back and wiped her eyes where tears had welled up i justis there any work i could do for youis there anything you can do to help us kelvren let out a long descending sigh and rested his head again sssoldierrrsss have been coming herrre all

survived how many a dozen two cut shot stabbed lanced through even and still you can speak even walk hurrrh i am ssstill dying kelvren replied distastefully lord gryphon we are all dying but if youll forgive me for being so bold sir until you are dead you are still living kelvren stayed silent for a while and ammari started brushing out feathers while jeft picked away at the larger clumps of dirt around kels hindlegs you know my husband would have loved to have been here with you he loved birds and kept feathers when he found them out on his travels yours would be a prize if you dropped one kel looked sidelong at the woman jeft sssaid that you werrre about to be rrrich what of that isssnt money what sssoothesss illsss in valdemarrr ammari smiled a littlea flicker of pride then the sadness again when the changecircle camewehad just lost my husband i was unconsolable i ran into the circle in my grief i justclawed at the ground crying out for someone to bring him back somehow i knew there was magic thereelse how could it have appearedbut by morning there was still no help i clawed at the ground while i criedi cried so much she paused in her work when daylight came i saw that my hands weredifferent there was something in that soil that made my hands glimmer in the light she resumed brushing my man was not back but maybe he provided for us in his own way i found a way to sift this from the soil and bind it so that it would adhere to cloth and leather no one but jeft and i would go into the circleso it remained ours alone almost all the money i had i spent to buy the land the circle was in i made jars and jars of my solution and there it sits she sighed before all of this strife traders were going to carry some to haven and deedun andwell you understand i staked all i had on a luxury item and now no one wants it and no traders will come for it kelvren rumbled a little and then asked thissssssubssstancsse of yourrrss do you have any to ssshow me the glint of speculation was in his eyes ammari set the brush down and brought out a kerchief from her blouse even in the meager light it shone with an irridescence like oil on water in bright sunlight jeft beamed when he saw it my mums special shes smart an i helped with the makin of the stuff kel admired the cloth as ammari twisted and turned it around showing its shimmer and thisssssubssstancssse isss it expensssive doesss it poissson or ssstink or come off easssily doesss anyone elssse know of it he added with a hint of shrewdness and doesss it bind to featherrrsss by noon of the second day kelvrens plan was in motion through hallock he arranged the purchase of several jars of ammaris mixture it positively blazed in the full light of day small wonder she knew it would make her wealthy with his guidance several of the convalescents trimmed away particular stray and partial feathers from around his wounds painted them with the bright substance and set them aside to dry transmutation he thought though i fade i still have resources when he had time to rest the pain actually sharpened his thoughtsit was only when he moved that it overwhelmed him completely i can turn what little we have into something important whether i can flyor even walkagain he had to be of usehe couldnt bear to slide off into oblivion meekly so then what was there to do assuming he couldnt move he had to somehow use what he was rather than what he could do he was unique in the campan oddity he had reputation here even a growing mystique the elements were there the soldiers superstitions about how he was good luck a tent full of invalids making arrows and to bring it all together ammaris secret beautiful mixture that shone like magic the history was told lovingly in the way only someone who loved tales and had actually experienced a part of them could tell a story far off to the west there was a city made of hope and light it was made to honor its peoples savior and named for him white gryphon was built of terraces and sweeping walkways carved from a white cliffside overlooking a perfect bay in the centuries since its founding its wings had gradually spread out around the bay enfolding it as a loving protective bird would cover its nestlings from cold or rain its wings in fact truly did appear to be wingscanopies and promenades swept in complex curves on a massive scale to outline individual feathers when seen from the sea and barrier islands the city center was a huge complex of overlapping towers making the hackles breastfeathers and lower mandible the highest and widest complex crested the whole of the city in a stylized beak with its eyes and ears facing north in summer the sunrise cast the shadow of a raptor across the bay waters and at noon the eyes of the beast were completely concealed by shadow at sunset the water reflections shimmered upon the creation and the suns colors blazed upon it while the thousands of small lights and fires came up one by one to greet the stars for the oncoming night to the immediate east was the more conventional side of the city that had sprawled out as more housing workshops and trade centers were neededbut past that the terrain became terrible indeed forest that became impassable trees as broad as eighty men thrust up to a canopy three hundred feet tall above treefalls and hidden rivers as deep as oceans deadly ravines lurked under simple ground cover and nightmarish beasts hunted anything that ventured in past that came hundreds of miles of marshlands and desert two entirely different kinds of forest and then mountain ranges and a jungle then grassland and finally after all of that the other great forest the pelagirs gryphons need the help of trondiirn though like me sometimes gryphons learn some healing along with other powers yet one pair endured the venture for over six years alone blazing a trail eastward from white gryphon until they found their citys longlost brethren that pairrr was trrreyvan and hydona when i call them the grrreat onesss it isss becaussse they arrre the brrravessst explorerrrsss of ourrr time and they arrre herrre in valdemarrr they helped everrryone sssurvive the ssstormsss and hallock ssstaverrrn knows them essscorrrted them around havenperrrrsssonally jeft looked up at kelvren in amazement having utterly forgotten the bowwrapping hed been tasked with tangled between his fingers the few other locals and guard in attendance and all of the convalescing soldiers had similar expressions it wasnt just that they had a sixhundredpound taloned killing fury telling them fireside stories it was that these stories were uplifting his tales fired the imagination in ways no one had expected most of the soldiers would probably never see active duty again but instead of being stuck with the wastingaway grousing of lousy encampment and the same old blather this creature theyd first thought would be an intrusion instead had become needed because all of his tales were new and you got here because of that trail they found one of the horsemen asked kelvren nodded an so did all these strange allies that came with th hawkbrothers kel nodded again an these trondiurn people could fix you up there was a collective holding of breath as that question halted the mood yesss but that isssnt to be ssso let usss sssee just how tough i rrreally am mmm the gryphon tried to play it off we ssspend time togetherrr herrre it isss a good exchange you learrrn about farrraway landsss and amazing culturesss i learrrn about mud and sssmoke people laughed and fletching i

stories he had done his part to make his heroes immortal above the mill at midday there was suddenly a bright flash what appeared to be a hole in the sky rimmed by an everchanging glimmery edge showed through to a landscape of low grass beside a wide roadway the light came from a column of magelight the height of two men on the other side of the hole bright enough to be noticed by people below a hulking shadow eclipsed the light and observers below shouted and pointed up the shadow burst through the hole and huge wings snapped outward to stop its arcing fall it flapped ponderously to level its flight before circling over the encampment whatever it was it wanted its outline to be clearly seen before landing treyvan spied the command flag at the mill circled the guard camp four times and glided to land in the road between the rows of carriages the door guards readied pikes and called for reinforcements and a junior officer went pale when he popped his head out treyvan stood with his wings up then sat on his haunches to be received pena stayed on his back as yet unseen and appeared to be simply another bundle of cargo then a familiar figure stepped into the road from the mills entry hallock closed on the gryphon and hailed ambassador treyvan this is unexpected it has been too long since i saw you last he gestured for the door guard to go back to vigil and waved off questions from junior officers still walking forward with the aid of his walking stick welcome are you here about kelvren hes in a bad way because of me i fear i was the one he healed kelvrrren you sssay the wingleaderrr frrrom kvaldemarrr treyvans knowledge of gryphons was encyclopedic he could recite the names and positions of hundreds hurrrh wherrre isss he frrriend of firrresssongsss a badly wounded grrryphon isss harrrd to find by ssspell if firrresssong hasss not aided kelvrrren the sssituation mussst be grrrave indeed treyvan turned to accompany hallock and paused for pena to dismount she peeled off her helmet and goggles and tucked them under an arm while she walked alongside the others hallock filled in the senior gryphon on what he knew of kelvrens condition talking continuously until they neared the convalescents tent they heard singing not just from inside but from the eighteen soldiers standing outside lacquering sheaves of arrows in the middle of the song a gryphon voicethin and strainednonetheless boomed a line and made the others grin the soldiers outside halted singing one by one and moved backward as one as treyvan pena and the captain approached only a few remembered to salute they had come to know kelvren a terribly wounded gryphonbut this was a fully healthy gryphon stalking toward them bedecked in regalia of rank all but dwarfing the captain beside him with a little lizard creature padding along beside them i can hear you treyvan mindspoke toward the gryphon he heard i have come to help you and a trondiirn is on the way inside the convalescents tent the singing went quiet voice by voice kelvren turned his head from side to side and upward as if searching for something something was about to happen and everyone in the tent could sense it kelvren cut short a whimper of pain as he rolled himself over to his belly i hearrrd kelvren croaked and then his eyes fixed outside locked onto an approaching shadow a large shadow captain stavern stepped around the edge of the tent nodded behind him and then came someone kelvren thought he would never see in his lifetime the breastplate adorned by the badges and bars of rank the impeccaby tooled harness and the teleson headpiece around the featherperfect gryphons brow ridges and forecrest crafted to be as much a crown as anythingit could be no one else completely against his will kelvren shuddered all over breath seized in his throat he blinked his eyes out of their stare and lowered his head the fletchers and attendants dropped their work completely or set their tools aside all eyes on whatwhohad just walked across the threshold of the tents oiledcanvas floor then everyone who stood or sat went down to one knee and bowed their heads in recognition when kelvren spoke the words my lorrrd trrreyvan the power of the senior gryphons arrival could be felt radiating into the tent like sunlight sinks into the skin on a summer day rrrissse all treyvan said kelvrens head felt light as if he was about to pass out treyvan stepped to within arms reach of the stricken gryphon and then bowed his own head in turn wingleaderrr kelvrrren ssskothkarrr of kvaldemarrr the crrrown hasss sssent me to sssee to yourrr wellbeing what treyvan said next made kelvren certain he was hallucinating you arrre firrrssst grrryphon on sssite in thisss engagement i name you wingleaderrr of thisss forcssse asss sssoon asss you arrre fit forrr duty motes of light swam in kelvrens vision this must be a fever dream it was silver gryphon standing practice that whoever was on scene first was automatically the senior of that engagementincident commandthe reasoning being that they knew the situation by being there first better than any who followed it held regardless of rank until there was a formal exchange of power it meant that he was now empowered to command treyvan one of the great ones it was mindboggling enough so that kelvren passed out on the spot much happened while kel was adrift the supply tent across the mud path from the convalescents tent was emptied out so treyvan could always be near kelvren treyvan used several spellsthough relatively minor they were impressive to watch because to enhance his precision he used simple light effects to burn off any excess energy he used magesight and sweeps of power to discover which of kelvrens magicconversion organs were still alive and responsive and several probes to test the state of the stillunconscious kelvrens injuries jeft stood by his gryphon friends side and askedvery possessivelyexactly what treyvan was doing treyvan explained that he was taking away kels pain and deepening his sleep to help him regain strengthand to keep him from trying to move and make his wounds worse jeft wasnt the only one who acted proprietary about kelvren to the inhabitants of the convalescents tent this was their gryphon hallock stavern called a muster on the main road and each company stood in formation while he introduced treyvan and pena he made it very clear that unless it directly contravened high end regulations the gryphon was to be treated as captainor better he held up the proof that the crown wished it so and added that the little lizard with him was treyvans personal assistant treyvan made a formal pass by each company he nodded to each companys senior officer and gave them polite greetingsbut it was also calculated so they got a very clear view of his rank markings by being close up to him birce and devon stood humbly while treyvan thanked them personally for their good work and astonished them when he suggested to hallock that they be listed for commendation treyvan explained to the mill officers how a teleson worked and contacted haven with one to report on kelvren the overworked clerk that hallock had needled before was set in front of the device and thanks to the link he might actually have some sleep possible in his near future pena was well on her way to becoming the most popular creature in the camp once word had been spread that any fastmoving lizards in camp werent to be shot at shed become a blur not only were kelvrens needs being tended to and materials brought to treyvan her abilities as a chef transformed the dull fare the convalescents ate into events to be savored she bolted into the woods and returned with foraged materials half a candlemark later that by the end of the day made a basic stew bear delightfully complex tastes the condition for offduty soldiers getting any of her dishes though was that time must be spent assisting the convalescents and treyvan they never wanted for help ammari spent more of her waking hours in the tent with the gimps as theyd now laughingly begun referring to themselves one of the southerners pointed outwiselythat a word is only truly an insult if you take it as such making it a joke instead of derogatory takes the power out of it and makes it your power instead it reached its zenith when one of the fletchers asked jeft to bring another basket of arrowshafts and ammari heard her son answer back thats boy jeft to you gimp the whole group fell about laughing that laughter was what awoke kelvren he blinked a dozen times cleared his mind and found the pain that had been his constant unwanted companion had dulled its screaming to barely a whisper he still felt unbearably heavy but lifted his head and found treyvan was there and real treyvan spoke to him with respect wingleaderrr kelvrrren you have sssurrrvived woundsss that would kill thrrree grrryphonsss i am imprrresssed by yourrr willpowerrrand

to bring in his trondiirn he would open a gate to connect partway to haven and that anything they needed to send through in half a minute could pass through after his specialist from the other side arrived he caught hallock biting his lower lip as he sat by the slumbering kelvren what trrroublesss you firrrssst its the gate a doorway to just step through to be closer to haven clossserrr to yourrr genni treyvan shrewdly noted hallock nodded closer to my genni i miss her so much its impossible not to think of being with her every moment and returning to her is precisely what kelvren diced his life on i could just resign my command and step through a door to be a few days ride from her but i cant do it he looked treyvan in the eyes i do have a command here and i owe it to my troops but as much as thati have to be at kelvrens side treyvan was silent for several minutes finally saying delicately you mussst rrrealize he isss unlikely to sssurrrvive thisss hallock held a fist in his hand im not knotting a yellow ribbon for him yet he gestured out toward the rest of the camp and i have my soldiers to take care of they just lost their first and ive replaced her it would be too much for me to leave now i cant risk them getting someone with no field experience in my place you arrre a good leaderrr hallock ssstaverrrn the grrreatessst of leaderrrsss arrre at the forrrefrrront of

frrrom afarrr this may be so he agreed and thank you for the compliment but just the same i have to admit theres a lot of me that wants to go through that gate of yours he turned toward kelvren but im not leaving him three light wagons laden with injured troops and a courier on back of a pony were lined up two horselengths behind treyvan the gryphon mage sat in front of a rope laid out on the road which marked where the gate aperture would be he stared toward it but not at itas if he looked past it deep into the earth he spread his wings and flapped them slowly drawing his arms up and tracing talons through several motions culminating with a wide gesture of two halves of a wide circle a short crack of thunder came from in front of the gryphon and made everyone flinch the horses looked none too happy but didnt run then the air simply opened up forest grass and another road were brightly lit by a column of light on the other side of the gate and rippled while the edges of the gate stabilized foreclaws still up treyvan sidestepped to its right and called out now the light was eclipsed by three horses running toward the hole and then they were there in the camp swerving off to the side at a gallop go treyvan called and the horses pulling the line of wagons churned hooves toward the gate and went through the courier on the pony surged through the hole last and then the gate was allowed to collapse treyvan dropped back to all fours swaying and panting two of the horses bore trondiirn whitebird her assistant and a heavy load of supplies whitebirds appearance was strikingshe dressed in a half dozen shades of blue and her hair was past shoulder length and as snowy as the third horse that had come through a swarthy man in a heralds uniform was astride a mare companion and dismounted to speak earnestly with captain stavern treyvan walked briskly toward the convalescents tent and the trondiirn fell in behind him whitebird let her assistant take the horses as she walked the rest of the way to the tent when she saw kelvren dozing she stared mouth open oh you poor thing she gasped she rushed to kelvrens side resting her hands on his shoulder his wing and down his flank she leaned in to smell him taking in his scent from beak to rump a minute later her assistant came in laden with cases and pouches they extracted instruments and vials from them and took samples from the wounds judged the colors they turned and set them aside on a complex anatomical chart kelvren roused from slumberbarelyand rolled a glassy eye sideways to view the two new people oh good he murmured and then drifted back to sleep whitebird glanced at treyvan with an unreadable expression then stood to stand near him she spoke in kaledain treythis looks very bad he has such strong infections i can smell them i dont know how hes lasted this long unless its divine providence or pure willpower well get to work on him immediately but ill be honest with you its definitely a ruin she wiped down her hands with a wet cloth that smelled of vinegar right now it looks like hirskausk and if you dont find a way to rejuvenate his magic hell be lost to us in days i can give him medicine and prime his body for a rejuvenation but if you cant infuse him with power the best i can hope to do is stabilize him as he is no strength no flightfor a life of a few months the elder gryphon rumbled and nodded and whitebird bent to her work on kelvren ill be here for four or five candlemarks shes beautiful one of the men behind her said i think im in love grow some wings and im yours whitebird answered without looking up until then get me some hot water ammari birce hallock and whitebirds assistant rivenstone sat on folding chairs huddled with treyvan in the tent across from where whitebird still tended to kelvrens wounds jeft stayed by her fetching whatever pena did not whitebirrrd and i have conferrred with firrresssong and hydona by telessson what we attemptwe do not know what the rrresssult will be if we take a longerrrterrrm path therrre isss a ssslight chancsse he will rrrecoverrr but find hisss flight limited orrr gone if we attempt thisssrrrejuvenationhe will jussst asss likely die frrrom it ammari asked why rivenstone answered her when his inner channels are opened up it will be a surge through the feather rootswhere gryphons collect ther energy and begin its conversion the sudden rush of power intoby nowsensitized vessels might well boil out as heat or rather boil in andahcook him if we can keep the inrush to a steady flow we may be able to draw it out of him before it becomes too much he steepled his fingers resting his elbows on his knees i must be honest with you all no gryphon has ever been drained so completely as kelvren has treyvan laid out a spread of pages from one of the trondiirns books we only have thisss frrrom the hissstorrriesan infusssion method unusssed sssince ssskandrrranonsss time what effect it will have now we can

everyone was silent for a moment so hallock began the questions are do we try this method can it be done what is required for it to be done and what will we do if it fails or succeeds if it fails rivenstone answered he will be his own funaral pyre but the firrrssst quessstion isss what the rrressst hinge upon kelvrrren hasss rrresssolved that even if he diesss he hasss done well i doubt he would want to lingerrr in a living death ssso i sssuggessst that we procsseed the others agreed we will need a sssite to prrreparrre treyvan stated and i confesss it isss no sssmall rrrisssk to me we need a placsse clossse by but sssafe from casssual interrrferrencssebecaussse in a matterrr of a day i mussst consstrrruct a node there was an uncomfortable silence finally hallock asked whats a node a confluence of magical power rivenstone replied like streams run to a lake a node is where lines of force converge but since the storms those lines have been largely dispersed if treyvan tried to use his personal power he could wind up like kelvren is and kelvren still wouldnt be healed so he has to use an outside source of powera node there arent any nodes around here so we need a place to make one safely quickly ammari raised her hand shyly uhm will a changecircle do being gryphon through and through treyvan was very physical about his magicbut to human eyes he looked utterly mad while he worked he had gotten volunteers to go into the changecircle and dig holes in specific places with the deepest in the very center a mans height in depth he dropped particular stones in the holes and covered them up and paced around the changecircle muttered to himself then did things his gathered audience found inexplicable many times he leaped ten feet in the air and suddenly dove down thumbs locked as if trying to push a stake into the ground with his forefeet other times he would slink along the ground and turn his head side to side before jumping up to circle in the air over the site shafts of light erupted from the ground periodically equidistant around the circle treyvan walked around each one then drew glowing lines in midair toward the center of the circle and subdivided them more shafts of light shone higher this time where those lines crossed and then wavered treyvan growled and leaped on one that was brighter than the rest and the others became evenly brighter he warned loudly that no one was to enter the changecircle for any reason and took to the air flew a circuit across the changecircle and then arced back to the convalescents tent where kelvren was awake after his trondiirns drugenforced sleep treyvan murmured to pena who dashed off after something hallock intercepted treyvan kel was just giving me his opinions about this political and military situation in case the worst should happen the captain said and i have to say im impressed you should hear this he looked down at the notes hed written in this conflict the guard is already beaten because they do not want to fight their fellow valdemarans and this insurgent militia brought to bear arms against the guard and heralds are also beaten for the same reason in their heartsregardless of blades arrows and horsethey cancel each other out therefore the battle is between the mercenaries and the callous bastards who incited this who owe no allegience to this country and have no affection for itand those mercenaries hired by the crown who do feel affection for this country but hold no pressing regard to spare that militia or their hired counterparts so to make this conflict collapse the motives must be attacked without swords and arrows piercing flesh and thus make the mercenaries cancel each other out create a collapse within this insurgents power structure and the mercenaries fold up then may valdemarans be brothers again and meet in taverns to give thanks and apologize to each other rather than soak their beloved soil in the blood of their brothers hurrrh the shinain sssay therrre are only two powerrrsss in a warrrthe sssworrrd and the ssspirrrit and the sspirrrit will alwaysss win out if kelvrrren wasss a warrrlorrrd we would all sssurrrely be in trrrouble treyvan said in all seriousness hisss ability to find powerrr in the mossst minorrr of thingsss isss unnerrrving hallock looked back toward kelvren i think he really needed to tell me all of that it seemed very important to him even though it exhausted him to say it he wantsss morrre than anything to feel effective treyvan observed but i sssuppossse ssso do we all pena arrived by his side and offered an unlatched case which treyvan delicately reached into he pulled out a fistsized sphere of glass perfect in every dimension with a calculating look he asked hallock do you know what a heartstone isss it was dusk whitebird set the last of the empty bottles and cups aside then arose from her knees beside kelvren those should strengthen you she said encouragingly and keep you going through whats to come everyone is ready kelvren stood up on all fours for the first time in days he shook all over from the muscle strain but he did not buckle whitebird folded her arms squeezing herself in worry ammari shuffled close from the rear of the nowemptied tent kelvren pulled his shoulders back and raised his head to look her in the face thisss isss a tale that tellsss itssself he rumbled wearily forcing a raisedcrest smile pena hasss sssomething forrr yourrr ssson if my ssstorrry endsss this nighthisss ssshall go on i have a favorrr to assk of you ammarrri yourrrliquid lightsssparrre a few jarrrsss for genni ssstaverrn frrrom me he lifted his head up to his shoulders height and ammari cupped his lower jaw in her hands and rested his beak against her bosom she tucked her chin down and kissed him on the curve of his beak youll be all right kelyou will be his breath was hot against her body and he trembled as he turned aside and took his first step toward the circle if i am not i ssshall fly with yourrr husssband firrrssst of all whitebird rivenstone and pena stepped in instantly to help him from the tent but he warned them off with wingtips dragging kelvren trudged to his fate on the hill spectators had gathered but guards kept them a hundred feet from the changecircle they parted to let him through as he approached and several murmured encouragements to him all of the gimps were there among them treyvan awaited him several horselengths from the edge of the faintlyglowing changecircle it isss not too late to refussse thisss he said to kelvren in kaledain you may ssstill live if we use the other method live but not fly or rrrun even neverrr climb a back again id rrrather die he chuckled weakly noi must try this treyvan shrewdly asked you already have plansss for what you will do

will be a gloriousss lifeor a gloriousss death he dipped his head solemnly thank you for giving me the chancsse at eitherrr my lord treyvan treyvan bowed his head mirroring kelvrens own motion the

cassst your ssselfhealing ssspell if you can ssstand then ssstand if you can he paused obviously trying to hide something if you can fly then fly ssstraight up as far as you can kelvren said the obvious if i cant fly then i burn treyvan looked down yesss he said softly kelvren stared at the center of the circle his heart beat harder as he stepped across the circles edge and more than a hundred people held their breath pena stood at treyvans side with a look of dismay and sorrow on her face he doesnt know its a heartstonedoes he he asked treyvan the gryphon mage looked down at her with a look of resignation no he doesssnt know penas eyes glittered from the reflected lights that were starting up from the ground as kel approached the circles center it is probably best that he doesnt whitebird and rivenstone walked up beside them treyvans made a minor node pena explained to whitebird and rivenstone but its channeled into a heartstonea purposely fragile one its why treyvan used glass when the spell reaches its height it will consume itself even a tiny heartstone will release its power in a saturated burst treyvan nodded i didnt tell him i completed the node hoursss before i buried the glasss sssphere and the control pointsss i burrried arrround the rrressst of the cssircle are not to draw the power in from outssside they are to contain the power and dirrrect the burst upward from the center if his sssyssstem ressstartssshe will absssorb it if it doesss nothurrrh he will only feel pain forrr a few ssseconds ammari and jeft approached the four that were speaking kaledain whatre you all talkin about jeft asked we arrrewishing kelvrrren luck he stepped toward the circle and spread his wings widely as kelvren neared the center it isss time pena ushered the humans back to where the herald and his companion stood even with the soldiers locals and patients who came to see the fate of their gryphon dusk descended further making the light from the circle even more apparent kelvren neared the center and walked around the packed earth there until he faced the crowd he lay down on his belly and carefully and deliberately folded his wings treyvan stepped to the edge of the circle sat on his haunches and pulled his wings straight back behind him faint beams of light broke through the ground around the perimeter the light of the nearer control points visibly pulled toward him as his wings swept slowly back treyvan spread his arms wide curled his claws toward the sides of the circle and swept his wings forward again the light pushed back and caused the next nearer points to flare brighter kelvren watched treyvanand then looked at every one of the gathered crowd a sharp eye could see that tears ran from his eyes and dripped from the hook of his beak he laid his head down flat on the ground and his wings slumped the sixty control points around the perimeter blazed fully now all of them matched columns of light tapering to a foot high treyvan went back to all fours and walked a horselength farther from the crowd and stopped again at the edge of the changecircle he sat up raised his forearms higher than before and swept his wings back then forward again harder all the perimeter lights swayed inward and another ring of them blazed up from the ground in unison another massive flap of his wings and a third ring shot up and steadied encompassing kelvren arcs of energy extended from one light to another seemingly randomly and then all at once they made a stable steady pattern which looked like a stained glass rosette treyvan held his own breath for a moment and said in kaledain wind to thy wings sheyna treyvan snapped his wings open a boom of thunder struck the crowd inside the circle a rising ring of light closed in on kelvren in the center and consumed him daylight surged upward from the circles center and the briefest shadow of wings flickered in it before everyone watching was blinded by it treyvans irises pinned to width of a finger he peered resolutely into the light there was movement there was the shape of a gryphongetting to its feet standing its wings were unfolding and raising up except it was not a shadow against light it was light and everything else was shadow compared to it treyvan stepped back one step two the figure in the center rose up onto its hindfeet it was kelvren but he was radiating light like nothing treyvan had ever seen before his body color wisped away replaced by a glow from inside the feather shafts themselves the edges of every feather gleamed and rippled in a yellowwhite radiance like the edge of burning paper his eyes more than glowedthey shone outward in tapered rays of light wherever he looked kelvren raised a hindfoot then the other and stepped up into the air calmly he shone there suspended off the ground watching everyone and with a single wingbeat the gryphon of light shot up into the air as a streak and was gone he went up higher until he was a bright speck in the sky amidst the stars no one could say a word the mote of light descended a minute later it shone even brighter than before and swept over the encampment making shadows shift as if a new sun was lighting the night up kelvrens flight was effortless he backwinged once and with the lightest of touches settled atop the mill with his wings spread wide and regarded everyone below hallock pena ammari whitebird rivenstone and jeft staggered stunned to treyvans side whatjust happened ammari asked i have no idea treyvan admitted just look at him whitebird gasped hes beautiful thats the damndest thing ive ever seen hallock said he looks just like that tapestry back at white gryphon rivenstone gasped thats my gryphon jeft said the gryphon of light stayed atop the mill for ten minutes then he sprang up from the mills roof and dove to alight in front of the crowd banking in to brake and hang in midair without a single wingbeat his eyes swept them one by one and murmurs of astonishment came from nearly everyone kelvren spoke i have becomesssomething morrre than i wasss beforrrebut my hearrrt and allegiancssesss arrre unchanged ssso hearrr me his voice boomed i know what i mussst do the forcssesss at deedun know little of magic theirrr sssoldierrrsss arrre mossst likely bewilderrred by magic and by now they know what a sssingle grrryphon can do i believe they will

wings as he rose suspended in midair i will ssstrrrike and i will ssshed no blood and i do it in the name of the guarrrd the herrraldsss and the crrrown forrr all of you forrr all of usss forrr valdemarrr the crowd erupted into cheers and shouts the light from kelvrens eyes flared brighter and swept over to treyvan you underrrssstand he said his voice seeming distant kelvren gazed upon the rest where theyd gathered with the convalescents the illumination surrounded them all sharpening the shadows my frrriendsi will neverrr forrrget you and with those last words kelvren rose did a wingover dove down from four winglengths up and slammed his claws down to the ground the earth trembled and loose earth momentarily heaved up to knee height the resulting crater ignited into a white scintillating brightness when kelvren leaped into the sky the sunlike glow stayed then with several massive wingbeats the gryphon powered away from the crowd driving up debris and dust and with each downstroke his brilliant wings surged brighter below him a jagged incandescent line two wingswidth wide crackled up from the shimmering focal point and split away from its origin the shimmering swath on the ground directly followed his flightpath he swept through his skies leading the line of sunfire from the changecircle through the camp to the great trade road he followed the trade road precisely and the brilliance followed him on the ground with each wingbeat kelvren absorbed more magical power from the air and the swath trailed him as light following every twist he coursed faster with each wingbeat than any gryphon he had ever known of he flew for hours tracing the trade road below leaving a trail of light all the way to deedun and it did not fade mercenaries and militia alike looked up in astonishment uncertainty or stark terror at the figure that shot past them by the time an arrow could be nocked candlemarks passed and the path of coruscating light etched into the road still did not fade only when he reached deedun did kelvren backwing and hover in midair in front of the tallest of the high keeps towers he stared at it and concentrated the citizens of deedun saw line by line the crest of valdemar three stories high burn itself into the wall of the keeps tower and blaze like daylight across the city and like the wide line of light the length of the trade road it too did not fade kelvren turned his gaze across the city citizens guards militia and mercenary alike were coming out of buildings all lit by the bright path that came from the far distance through the center of the city kelvren knew that with the sheer power hed put into his magelight spell the crest of valdemar would not fade away for a month or more he smiled then the gryphon of light soared into the sky becoming a bright star and went home captain hallock stavern and the sixteenth cavalry three companies of guard regulars and kerowyns firebolts advanced steadily along the trade road the militia they met offered no noteworthy resistance and laid down arms almost apologetically the herald with the crowns forces adjudicated the conditions of surrender town by town and left the locals with their pride the mercenary company hired by farragur elm and his cohorts all but disbanded demoralized by the showy display of magic they could not possibly match kerowyn held her firebolts back from taking the city she was of the opinion that it would be damned unseemly for a merc company to take over the city rather than the crowns guard regimentsespecially since so much of the troubles had been caused by other mercs when the guards rode in and liberated deedun chancellor of prosperity farragur elm and his several of his insurrectionists barricaded themselves in the high keep others guilty of the thefts that financed the power grab were over time discovered arrested and jailed in time elm himself was dragged screaming obscenities from the very tower that kelvren had marked treyvan conferred with whitebird and all the mages he knew still amazed by what had happened they finally deduced what kelvren had done when the power of the heartstone dissolution surged upward into him kelvren healed himself but there was too much chaotic raw power flooding in too quickly kelvren used the simplest but most stable spell that any mage knewmagelightand quelled the chaos of raw power into a tuned current instead of ending the spell as mages normally did when they had enough light he let it flow through him the ordeal of having no magic in his body had left his channels and conversion organs needy and they filled to capacity then into his bones then into the feathers themselves then with so much freefloating energy in the air his every movement brought in more the road of light was far more than a psychological ploy the rate he cast it matched the rate the power was absorbed as he flew and it burned off enough energy for his system to stabilize firesong reported by teleson that kelvren returned to kvaldemar the night after his rejuvenation still as bright as a sunrise he flew over the clan fires kelmskeep errolds grove and the vale purely for effect and so the mill was gradually emptied of officers and the village was freed from the guard camp and trade was reestablished along the great glowing road the light faded slowly over the fortnight since kelvrens flight but it wouldnt leave anyones memory anytime soon before long it was time for treyvan whitebird rivenstone and pena to go back to haven they said their goodbyes and with a small bow pena gave an oilskinwrapped package to jeft jeft opened it up and inside were three gryphon feathers bound with strips of leather a folded scrap of paper and a small leather pouch attached to them inside the pouch were six gold coins his mother read the message jeft roald dunwythie my friend if you grow tired of being boy with this you will be welcomed into hawkbrother lands and accepted as our own your mother will be welcome also so speaks wingleader kelvren skothkar of kvaldemar vale ally of the crown of valdemar ammari felt tears in her eyes and she hugged her son as strongly as she ever had they gazed up at the encompassing sky and listened to the birds together and by the end of that month captain hallock stavern returned triumphantly to haven and to the arms of his beloved genni darkwind handed over a paper slip to elspeth mmm oh this is good repercussions from the kelvren affair says here some mayor demands reparations for the gryphons presence in his village cites him as a hazard detrimental to the towns morale and an insult to the dignity of his office elspeth browsed the slip shrugged and handed it off to a passing clerk to be handled sounds like a healthy gryphon to me whats next the feast of the children by nancy asire nancy asire is the author of four novels twilights kingdoms tears of time to fall like stars and wizard spawn she also has written short stories for the series anthologies heroes in hell and merovingen nights and short stories for mercedes lackeys anthologies flights of fantasy and sun in glory she has lived in africa and traveled the world but now resides in missouri with her cats and two vintage corvairs the evening service had ended and the night candle burned brightly on the altar from the steps leading to the temple pytor watched his fellow villagers as they went off to what would normally have been a wellearned meal after a long day in the fields as priest of this small temple for fifteen years now he knew each of them as well as he knew his own kin unlike so many other priests he had come home after being elevated from an acolyte to a fully practicing member of the sunlords representatives on earth born in the village of two trees he had returned drawn by the quiet of the place and a family history that spanned generations he had offered to come after the old priest who had served two trees since before he had been born had died not for him was the life some priests cravedcities and towns were too crowded too noisy too full of people who sought status and power he was more than satisfied to minister to his villagers people he had known since birth but as he watched the last of his neighbors leave the temple pytor suddenly shivered though the summer evening was far from cold this evening one of the most terrifying situations he had ever faced as a priest had loomed before him one that could presage even more horrible times to come but he had made his choice and now he must weather its outcome pytor he glanced over his shoulder at his sister who waited for him to close the temple for the night and join her for dinner sunset light revealed the concern on her face the searching look in her eyes he was going to have to tell her he had no choice she would find out soon enough then what would she think of him would she see him as a failure less of a priest and could he live with that selenna he smiled turned and led the way back inside shutting the doors he doffed his ceremonial robes and led the way to the room that served as his residence attached to the back of the temple it was the only home he had known for fifteen years a simple place that contained everything he owned in this world tell her that suddenly everpresent voice in his mind whispered youll have to tell her eventually and the best time to do it is now ill have dinner ready in a moment she said bustling around with preparations for their meal she glanced over her shoulder take care of your cats first you know theyre waiting for you he smiled somewhat sheepishly not only his sister but the villagers teased him unmercifully about his fondness for the feline kind he had always loved cats a love fostered no doubt by growing up surrounded by at least two or three cats living in and around the house not to mention those that had taken up residence in the barn here selenna said extending a plate full of cold and finely chopped sausage left over from the midday meal should keep em quiet til they go out mousing pytor took the extended plate smiled his thanks and opened the door to the yard behind the temple sure enough he was greeted by a group of his cats their tails lifted in expectation here was tom the big brownandwhite tabby puss the allwhite cat with green eyes shouldered forward followed by the dainty little girl patches and there sitting back as if to say he was above all this pushing and shoving was the newcomer pytor had named the recent arrival sunshine because he sported a coat of the oddest shade of gold a color rare enough in these parts to have attracted attention sunshine looked up at him the fading light turning his eyes into fiery points of topaz tell her now that voice whispered again to set things right between you she has to know pytor put down the plate and stepped back letting the cats gather around their meal sunshine finally took his place at the plate eating with a daintiness his companions lacked there was something strange about that cat ever since he had wandered into the village several months ago odd thoughts had filled pytors head thoughts that could in this day and age lead to inquisition or even worse the cleansing fires thoughts that had finally blossomed into the actions he had taken this evening he shook his head and went inside selenna was patiently waiting for him to join her how could he tell her how could he explain what troubled him so would she understand pytor selenna reached across the table and patted his hand you be too worried bout this from what you told us tonight we got no choice you know that i do he responded i just dont like it i dont like it at all cant you see its not simply that were disobeying the new laws we could be putting our very souls in peril she snorted a very unladylike noise but one that spoke of her practicality youve said over and over we could put our souls in peril if we dont do this that we must stand up for what we know vkandis sunlord wishes for his children in this world how could he look down on us and be pleased if we let the children be put to the fires and there it was the lurking fear that had plagued him only five days left now before the feast of the children when a priest came to the village all the way from sunhame to test the children test the children what a bland way to put it in the old days that was exactly what it had been priests went from city to city town to town and village to village to test children for their talents talents that were now becoming spoken of in whispers as witch powers and were said to be evil in the sight of the sunlord but pytor knew better by the light of vkandis he knew it was not so even when he had studied for the priesthood things had started to change in sunhame the son of the sun was no priest he would have chosen had he had been vkandis sunlord to be the gods representative on earth and through the years the son of the suns actions had proved him right far more interested in temporal power hanovar had gathered priests around him who told him exactly what he wanted to hear all eager to increase whatever powers and positions they thought were rightfully theirs what were doing he started and abandoned his words and tried again it goes against what ive been taught our allegiance to the son of the sun is paramount but i know whats going on in the priestly circles is not what i was led to believe vkandis wants for his children how could he wish to destroy those of us he granted these powers to at birth more the reason she said in her quiet voice to giveem a chance to grow into those powers in a place they wont have to live in fear najan be our cousin hes told of the place were going it be not that far off and hes lived there over a year two trees be close enough to the border so we can make it there in three days a few priests be there already you know that other families followedem they be afraid of what could happen to their children who have talents when the feast of the children comes what be so different bout this time he cleared his throat its you i dont know how i could live without you were all we have left of our family what with father gone mother dying last year and your husband the year before both you and i are childless if anything happens you be avoiding my question she said and smiled slightly what be so different bout this time and who be the one to say i wont come back once the children be safely cross the border najan will take care of em and i can come home here it is pytor thought heres where i tell her or trust vkandis to keep my secret you know i have confidence in you and najan and its not that the children will be too close to the border of valdemar neither karse nor valdemar seems too concerned with what goes on in that territory he sighed what ive not told you is this the priest whos coming to two trees is chardan for a moment his sisters face went totally blank suddenly sadness replaced the emptiness of her features a sadness that spoke more than anything she could have said yes he said softly chardan my friend from my earliest days of study in sunhame the one i swore an oath to promising there would never be anything between us ill have to lie to him selenna about those children lie and in doing that ill have to break my oath to him to say nothing of what might happen if chardan detected the lie but what happened to durban durban the redrobe priest who had become a blackrobe who had come year after year to two trees and who despite his talents as a demon summoner had seemingly possessed a soft spot in his heart for the inhabitants of this small village durban had never pressed too hard and pytor suspected had consciously overlooked those children who might be growing into their talents durban died a few months past pytor said i didnt want to tell you because i knew id worry bout the upcoming feast she finished his dying sentence she stirred the greens on her plate her face gone still and thoughtful but it wouldnt have changed things pytor i always worry bout the feast he glanced up at the ceiling what am i to do how can i lie to chardan theres nothing wrong in doing such a thing if its done for vkandis and for the love of his children that voice whispered in his head dont take more upon yourself than you ought if he had not known better he would have sworn his sister had heard the same voice which be worse she asked lying to an old friend and betraying a childhood oath or doing what you know be best for the children of this village oh youre clever he said throwing my own words back at me yes selenna theres a higher power to answer to here than a childhood oath but if he doesnt believe me what if he tries to go into my mind now why would he do that he be your friend she stated you been tested time and again not once ever did you show a hint of any socalled witch powers but times are different now and that difference can turn friend against friend remember what happened with zarvash and tomasio never did think zarvash worthy of much more than pig slop selenna responded bluntly he be an evil grasping man hed betray his own mother if it meant a few more gold pieces in his pouch thats true but he did report tomasio to the priesthood and tomasio went to the fires there are worse things than going to the fires the voice in pytors head murmured the sunlord sees all and rewards accordingly pytor rubbed his forehead attempting to dispel that inner voice well he said sitting up straighter in his chair i guess theres nothing to be done for it now weve cast our fates to the sunlords mercy you and the children will be leaving at first light tomorrow vkandis willing youll be over the border before chardan is close to two trees and ill be back pytor she said squeezing his hand in hers dont worry bout that i can take care of myself and najan oh dont look so horrified hes always been a free spirit a trader and tinker by nature he comes he goes no one knows where hes been or that he livescross the border but i can find him pytor knew that for truth though a woman wasnt supposed to travel unless accompanied by a male relative those rules werent strictly enforced out here in the back of beyond a woman could make a trip by herself if she thought the need was great after selenna had returned to the house she and her husband had shared pytor was left alone with his own misgivings now that his plan had been set into motion he could foresee a hundred ways it might go wrong not for one moment did he believe the new thinking emanating from the son of the sun once an eagerly anticipated ceremony the feast of the children was turning into a day every family dreaded in years past it had stood as a marker of the passage from childhood to adulthood the child making that passage tossed some valued possession of theirs into a fire to signify entry into a new phase of life now they themselves could be thrown to the fires unless of course they could be suborned by the priests into becoming one of the newly powerful blackrobes those summoners of demons and possessors of a magic pytor suspected did not flow from the hands of the sunlord he wore his own robes of red proudly the last thing he wanted was to be seen as a figure that inspired fear not love he stepped outside to retrieve the cats plate tom was gone and puss and patches were stalking something in the grass over by the bushes only sunshine remained cleaning his whiskers when pytor picked up the plate the cat looked up a satisfied expression on his face pytor reached down and stroked the cat behind his ears the simple act settling his emotions where did you come from he asked conversationally whos missing you you were far too well cared for to be homeless sunshines response was a throaty purr i hope im doing the right thing pytor continued finding nothing odd in holding a conversation with a cat i cant see jovani chelsah bhobar lispah or the twins go to the fires and i know they would his heart gave a sad little jump in his chest chardan wouldnt hesitate a moment to make the decision to rid the world of those children as much as he cared for his old friend chardan was no durban the admission pained him oh sunlord how it pained him but he had seen the change come over chardan years ago as chardan had become intent on ascending through the ranks of the priesthood and assuring himself a position of power in the future pytor simply could not understand what had happened to his childhood friend the world was far too much with chardan and the dark side of that world seemed to be winning and that fact made pytors decision to shield the children even more important the sunlord requires much of us his inner voice said warmth present in its tone but not more than we can give theres no limit to his love for us he only wishes us to love him in return and share that love with all his children and as a priest he should know that better than most pytor smiled his sister was right he must place his trust in vkandis certain he had made the correct decision if things went wrong well there were more terrible things than death the following day passed in a blur selenna and the children had left for the north but not as early as planned a sudden summer storm had boiled up during the night and drenched the countryside delaying a morning departure normally the villagers would have hailed this storm as beneficial but with travel held to narrow country roads most merely lanes rain seemed a bad omen choosing not to see it so at the morning service pytor had blessed the rain as a gift to the surrounding fields he further assured the childrens parents that vkandis had given everyone a bit more time to say farewells it had been extraordinarily difficult to stand at the edge of the village and watch selenna and the six children set off to the north though his sister ever the practical and enterprising one led the small caravan the families of the departing children had seemed lost now that their children had gone he had said comforting words made comforting gestures but had no comforting thoughts for himself and now of course he must rehearse his explanationsif such were ever neededas to the absence of the six children two trees was hardly a large village and the yearly census would show there were fewer children to be found if anyone came looking and that was exactly what chardan would be doing chardan pytor bowed his head what could he say to chardan the ready responses he and selenna had concocted had seemed more than sufficient at the time but would they hold up under chardans questioning the fact all six children were cousins could explain why they had set off to visit a dying grandmother before the god took her such an event could preclude mandatory presence at the feast of children the childrens parents had agreed to journey to the grandmothers home to flesh out the deception leaving not more than three hours after their children had departed and now in a village far emptier than it had been in the morning pytor wondered if it was enough chardan was no fool and pytor was uncertain as never before how he would react when he looked his childhood friend in the eyes and had to lie morning dawned as one of those glorious summer days when all seemed right with the world some of the gloom had lifted from pytors heart overnight and he felt considerably more confident in the outcome of his plans even pytors cats sensed his increased optimism when he went outside to feed them everyone even sunshine had gathered close and rubbed his ankles thoroughly before settling down to their breakfast and now he fell back into his priestly routine he cleaned the temple thoroughly swept the yard around it and made sure he had a sufficient supply of night candles as he inventoried what few medicines he kept in a small chest in his room he thanked the god he had a more than competent midwife living but one village away with fields in constant need of weeding and watering the remaining children of two trees would be off helping their parents the village therefore lay strangely quiet save for the occasional barking of an exuberant dog in the past this had been a time when pytor had devoted his waking hours to contemplation and study of the writ it should have been again but far back in the depths of his mind he still worried about what could happen when chardan arrived sunset and another evening service passed without incident the night candle lit pytor sat down to supper missing his sisters company by now she and the children should be nearly halfway to their destination if the roads and lanes held firm this knowledge of course only emphasized it would be all too soon that chardan came knocking at his door suddenly the sausage he was chewing tasted like dust his heart beat faster and he closed his eyes calm he needed calm if he could achieve a state of serene composure if he could maintain that state through chardans visit then his deception would be complete the door to his room stood open admitting the evening breeze he drew another deep breath and cast a wary eye on what remained of his supper his appetite had gone and the thought of finishing what lay on his plate upset his stomach ah well the cats would thank him for the extra portions as if called he felt the soft sensation of fur against his ankles he leaned down to pet the head of his visitor and started it was sunshine sunshine the standoff cat the one so far as he knew had never entered a building yet there he was sitting now at pytors feet staring at him with the total inscrutability of his kind pytor rubbed sunshines head again glad of the diversion from his gloomy thoughts you worry too much the voice said in his head the voice he had not heard in several days vkandis protects those he loves have faith in your god has he let you down yet pytor smiled no the god had never let him down but then he had never been party to a deed that at least in these days seemed to fly in the face of what the god demanded three days remained until chardan arrived three days to perfect his attitude of calmness in the face of possible exposure as a renegade priest only three days and all our days are held in the gods hands the voice said what are you man in the scheme of unfathomable eternity he bowed his head and silently acknowledged his doubt as proof of his own mortality he could no more understand what vkandis had in store for the world than an ant could of what a man planned as he walked across the fields he had no choice he had cast dice in this game and must wait on the outcome of their tumbling the following day held nothing but rain unusual for this time of year the rain fell slow and steady keeping the entire village indoors what was good for the fields unnerved pytor this should have been the last day of his sisters journey with the six children but now he was not sure what fell from the dark sky today had more than likely fallen to the north the evening before this could delay crossing the border into the nomans land that lay between karse and valdemar a sodden gathering had waited for him in the temple to begin the evening service as he threw himself into the ritual in an effort to diminish his own fears pytor sensed the unease that gripped the villagers at his back and now held to his room by the gently falling rain he prayed again one more day and he would have to face chardan one more day and his sister and the children would surely be safely across the border and out of reach of the blackrobes who would consign the children to the fires for no other reason than they were different a seething emotion welled up in pytors chest that he recognized instantly it was anger pure and simple anger how dared those charlatans decide who lived and who died especially the very young whose lives were new and full of promise how dared they nowhere in the writ that pytor was familiar with was there any mention of such depravity nowhere once again he was confronted by the fact the priesthood was changing that earthly matters were swiftly supplanting heavenly ones all in the name of temporal power despite the weather he left his room and stood outside his face lifted to the darkening evening sky the rain felt good on his flushed face and its coolness served to calm his mood no good would come by railing against what he could not change again he knew he had no choice he must trust in his god and rest sure in the knowledge he was doing the gods will hoofbeats broke the stillness of the village the following late afternoon pytor looked up from weeding his small garden amazed to see iban riding his way his old plow horse dark with sweat suns ray iban got out his breath coming fast he slid off his mounts broad back and sketched a brief bow horsemen to the south pytor glanced over his shoulder as if he could see beyond the edge of the village who he asked struggling to remain calm dont know the farmer said wiping his brow with the back of his hand dont look like nobody round here be four of em and they got a wagon with em pytor felt the blood leave his face chardan a day early that was the only answer or could it be traders he was proud his voice remained steady dont think so suns ray not enough of em and from what i seen they be dressed in black all of em chardan pytor closed his eyes briefly now not only would he have to face chardan but a day before he was ready make sure everyone knows the priest from sunhame has come sooner than expected he said slowly and for the gods sake remember what youre all to profess to do you understand ibans sunbrowned face paled at pytors words aye suns ray ill tell em you can trust us and the farmer scrambled up on his horses back before pytor could add another word off to warn the villagers that auspicious company was arriving well met pytor well met the voice was as he remembered it cool deep and utterly confident pytor bowed slightly as chardan dismounted in front of the temple not much else had changed about his childhood friend either unless one noticed the even finer cut to his black robes the glint of more gold than was seemly for a priest to wear and the subtle hint that the food in sunhame was tempting beyond belief pytor took chardans hand in greeting im sorry to be so ill prepared you came earlier than expected chardan waved a dismissive hand all the more time to talk to you old friend he glanced around his eyes cataloging the cottages that stood around the temple besides im not used to all this riding about simply put i want to get this over and return to sunhame you really should change your mind and join us there nothing can be accomplished here in this backwater youre made for better things that this pytor said nothing so chardan said again taking a slow look at the village everyones out in the fields i take it they are pytor replied we have no inn here as you well know im not sure where im sure your villagers can make room for my three companions as for me i can suffer a night in your bed old friend durban said you always took to the barn when he was here sorry to put you at such inconvenience but ill be gone by tomorrow afternoon pytor smiled what he hoped was his most disarming smile tomorrow oh by the mercy of vkandis let me be strong until tomorrow night the noontide sun beat down like a burning hammer that alone could account for pytor being slightly lightheaded but what he faced now was enough to cause cold sweat to gather on his brow he hoped chardan would mistake it for honest sweat produced by the heat and not an indication of guilt pytor had managed to make it though yesterday afternoon with no sign of his growing unease chardan had presided over the evening service the villagers reacting to the senior blackrobes presence with suitable awe but the night pytor had spent in the barn had been one of the most unnerving in his life he had spent most of the night in prayer and rose fuzzyheaded before dawn to participate in the morning service now standing before the temple in the blazing noon sun he prayed again for the strength he felt he sorely lacked where are the rest of the children chardan asked in a deceptively quiet voice the children who had remained who had never given any evidence of talents or powers shifted slightly their parents who had grouped themselves on the other side of the temples doorway kept their expressions as neutral as they were able pytor drew a deep breath forced himself to meet chardans eyes all too aware the three junior blackrobes were watching him carefully according to my records old friend there should be six more children living in this village there are pytor said struggling to keep his voice as devoid of emotion as chardans theyre all cousins unfortunately their grandmother is dying and they left with their parents to be with her before vkandis calls her home there he had done it lied actually lied to someone he had pledged faith to hmmm chardan glanced down at the list he held in his hands a list pytor suspected contained the names of everyone who lived in two trees their ages and their sex interesting and your sister pytor i missed her company last night where is she this line of questioning caused pytors heat to jump in his chest visiting our cousin najan he replied his mouth gone dry the itinerant trader and why would she go visit him now pytor shrugged his shoulders who knows what goes on in a womans head it was a safe response for a man to give though selenna would have excoriated him had she heard hmmm pytor held his face to an expression of polite attention certain chardan watched his every move from the corners of his eyes well chardan said at last since impending death of a family member grants adults and their children exemption from the feast of the children i suppose were done here once again old friend i congratulate you on the condition of your village and the souls you minister to we could have been treated no better in the larger towns we sometimes visit he folded the paper he held and lifted his right hand in blessing go with the love of the god who watches over all he said his voice deepening into stentorian depths turn to his light and away from all things dark and flee in peril of your very souls from anything that verges on the edge of witchery may the blessings of vkandis sunlord be upon you all the villagers and their children responded as was custom and ritual may it be so for a moment pytors knees threatened to give out relief flooded his heart could it be over could he have actually pytor chardan said his voice pitched so only pytor could hear a word with you if you please it was not over not by a long shot with legs feeling heavy as lead pytor followed chardan to the rear of the temple his four cats lay in what shade they could find sleeping deeply in preparation for their nightly hunts chardan glanced at them with an expression of extreme distaste dont know why you keep such creatures around he said too independent though i suppose theyre good for killing mice now he continued you and i need to have a talk what are you hiding pytor pytor stared at chardan his heart in his throat how did his old friend knowthe answer came with that thought old friend how could he keep a secret from someone he had regarded as a brother with whom he had shared his most intimate thoughts there was no hope for it another lie piled up on top of the ones he had told already i cant hide anything from you chardan you know that then why am i sensing something youre not telling me it has to do with the children doesnt it pytor most assuredly not pytor answered allowing the barest hint of hurt indignation to enter his voice why would i lie to you im not sure but i sense it those six childrenwhen durban was here just last year if my notes are right he said there might be the possibility of those six showing witch powers is that what youre hiding from me pytor do they possess forbidden talents pytor simply stared what could he say what could he do im sorry my friend i want to trust you ive always trusted you in the past but this is something i cant led go based simply on our old friendship i must go into your mind o vkandis shield me now hell find out for sure and it will be the fires for me you have every right pytor said amazed his voice sounded steady behind chardan sunshine lifted his head blinked and stretched wandering over to where pytor and chardan stood the gold cat sat down next to pytor leaning up against him in a feline display of affection this wont hurt and ill be brief as i can chardan said staring into pytors eyes im sorry its come to this but witch powers cannot be allowed even in those we love and care for the sunlords people must be pure and turn their faces from darkness a dizzy sensation overwhelmed pytor he thought he was going to fall but another portion of his mind assured him he still stood steady on his feet but even more powerful than the thrust of chardans mind in his came the sudden warmth and comfort emanating from the gold cat leaning against his leg into his mind blotting out the rummaging of chardans flowed a feeling of peacefulness of affection forgiveness and above all of a love he could no more understand than fly a barrier rose in his mind a flaming bulwark erected between his innermost thoughts and chardans probing nothing could hurt him now nothing could hurt him ever wrapped in the hands of a power greater and more indescribable than anything he had ever experienced before he was only dimly aware of the tears seeping from his eyes and spilling down his cheeks and suddenly he was released and stood fully back in the present day world im sorry old friend it was chardans voice the blackrobe reached out and steadied pytor im sorry i ever doubted you your mind is clear as sunshine youve hidden nothing from me durban must have been mistaken for you have no suspicions about the six children he mentioned and i doubt youd ever try to lie to me the god knows youve never been good at it even back in our childhood days pytor drew a deep breath you did what you had to chardan youre forgiven if i have it in my power to forgive the gold cat meowed softly stretched again and wandered off to lie down in the shade later after evening service and lighting the night candle pytor sat in his room only now feeling full strength returning after his ordeal chardan and his fellow blackrobes had left two trees immediately after chardan had searched pytors mind pytor hadnt even lit the candles after dinner preferring to remain in the warm darkness his mind gone a total blank suddenly clearly as if seen in bright sunlight he beheld his sister and the six children safely across the border they had found najan and the other people who had fled karse in the face of growing persecution they were safe he had wagered mightily and through what grace he dared not question they had all won you trusted in your lord the voice inside his head said softly and as such you were rewarded rememberthe god loves all his children for he made them each and every one he heard a soft meow and turned to see sunshine standing in a corner of his room for a moment time seemed to stand still though no candle burned the gold cat stood surrounded by a glory of light a wondrous golden halo that cast shadows on the walls and he grew in size his coat changing to rich cream and his face legs and tail darkening to brick red for a long moment man and cat stared at each other and pytor could have sworn the cat smiled and then so swiftly pytor could not comprehend it sunshine turned away and was gone vkandis watches over those whose hearts are pure the voice said fading off to a mere whisper never doubt that the sunlord loves those who love and care for others for that is why he made us all death in keenspur house by richard lee byers richard lee byers is the author of twentyfive fantasy and horror novels including dissolution the rage the rite the black bouquet and the shattered mask his short fiction has appeared in numerous magazines and anthologies a resident of the tampa bay area the setting for much of his contemporary fiction he spends much of his leisure time fencing foil epee and saber the living eyed me with emotions ranging from hope to dislike mouth agape eyes wide smallsword still sheathed at his hip chest hacked to bloody ruin the corpse stared up at the high ceiling with its painted scene of nymphs and deer i stooped to see if his eyes still held the image of the man whod cut him down they didnt that trick has never worked for me nor so far as i know for anyone stout and balding a man in his middle years like myself lord baltes asked are you learning anything master selden i straightened up its too early to say lanky and sharpfeatured like so many members of the keenspurs tregan snorted surely its clear enough what happened venwell had the bad luck to blunder into the thief who then had to kill him to make his escape is that what your magic reveals i asked a talent for wizardry ran in the keenspur blood and in addition to serving as his brother baltes lieutenant tregan was house mage his mouth twisted no actually the signs are muddled but its common sense surely maybe i said inspecting a floral tapestry spoiled by eight long rustbrown streaks the murderer had evidently used it to give his weapon a thorough wiping id like to see the room where the wedding gifts are on display what will that accomplish asked the sorcerer the killer took the ruby tiara it isnt there for you to examine anymore we sent for you because marissa claims you know your way around the stews and thieves dens down by strangers gate you should be hurrying there you sent for him because hes the one who caught the salamander and so kept the city from burning down and the greens and blues from slaughtering one another marissa said lithe and longlegged shed been the principal swordteacher to the green faction as i was for the blues he has a knack for puzzling things out i hope so baltes waved his hand the room is this way tregan marissa and i followed him and an assortment of his kinsmen and servants traipsed along after us the remaining giftsbegemmed goblets gold plates and trays rings bracelets armor glazed jars of spice and unguents furs and bolts of velvet and silkglowed in the candlelight relatives political allies and trading partners had sent presents from as far away as errolds grove id walked a warriors path my whole life long first as a mercenary then primarily as a masterofarms though i still occasionally rented out my blade if the job didnt require actually riding off to war so perhaps it was no surprise a splendidly crafted broadsword with emeralds gleaming in the hilt and scabbard caught my eye i hankered to pick it up and try a cut or two but that would have been gauche and inappropriate so i kept my mind on the task at hand wandered about inspected the heaps of gleaming treasure and tried to think of something useful are we certain i asked that only the tiara is missing yes baltes said i need to confer with my colleague i said well only be a moment conscious once more of the animus with which so many of baltes people regarded me i led marissa into the next room what have you figured out she whispered brushing back a strand of her short black hair nothing for certain curse it selden im the one who urged them to send for you dont make me look a fool believe me i said i want to unmask the killer and recover the bauble as much as you do and not just because baltes will reward me to lay the feuds to rest for good for years the fifty noble houses of mornedealth had divided themselves into factions of ten each of the five disliked the others but the greens and blues the most powerful detested one another with extraordinary virulence when the fire elementals depredations fanned their mutual hatred and suspicion their enmity nearly plunged the city into outright civil war strangely enough that turned out to be a good thing because it threw a scare into every noble with a particle of sense in the aftermath pivar a leader of the blues led a campaign to quell the factions the forthcoming wedding represented the culmination of his efforts when baltes a widower married pivars youngest daughter lukinda it ought to lay the rivalries to rest for good and all but only if the wedding came off as planned on the surface there was no reason why the murder and burglary no matter how unfortunate need prevent it but my gut warned me that if left unresolved such an alarming inexplicable calamity could bring the old malice and mistrust creeping back so said marissa what did you want to talk about first tell me about venwell did you train him yes was he an able seasoned swordsman very much so i sighed i was afraid of that now i need to know how hard i can push these folk i have things to say they wont like i wont mean to denigrate their honor but some may take it that way she snorted wonderful because they dont like you understandably so i supposed since for years i made my living teaching blues how to kill them i dont know that you dare push them very hard at all damn it i have to do the job they brought me here to do will you back me up she made a sour face well i did get you into this even if im starting to regret it lets rejoin the others what do you have to tell us baltes asked milord i said im no sagefar from itbut as marissa told you sometimes i have an eye for whats odd about a particular situation we have several oddities here for starters neither the sentries nor the watchdogs outside detected an intruder nor have we found any sign of forced entry what of it tregan asked as i understand it there are thieves skillful enough to sneak into any house perhaps i said but consider this also venwell died of cuts to the chest he saw his killer yet he perished without even trying to draw his blade perhaps tregan said he froze marissa shook her head no i schooled him too well its possible i said feeling as if i were about to dive from a cliff he knew his slayer if it was someone he trusted that would explain why he took no alarm until it was too late even though the killer had a naked sword in his hand similarly if the culprit was someone who lives here in the mansionor is currently a guesthe wouldnt need to sneak past the guards and hounds or break open a window or door for a moment everyone just gawked at me then a footman said but everybody liked venwell that may be i replied but a thief still couldnt afford to let him report that hed seen him stealing the tiara ridiculous tregan spat ours is a wealthy and honorable house no one here would steal the gift not even a servant i asked or the least of your kin perhaps burdened with gambling debts no tregan said i dont believe it have you wondered i said why the thief took only a single article a housebreaker could surely have carried away more but if the murderer never left if he needed to hide his plunder here in the mansion for the time being he might have reckoned that the more he stole the harder it would be to conceal or if hes a member of the household it might have shamed him to take more than he reckoned he truly needed skinny and sharpnosed like tregan but younger a keenspur named dremloc stepped forth from the mass of observers and planted himself in front of me here it comes i thought at least it looked as if he meant to deliver a formal challenge i had a fair chance of surviving that as i wouldnt if he and all his outraged relations simply assailed me in a pack you blue bastard he said i say youre a lia but just before he could articulate that unforgivable word marissa sprang between us she glared into his eyes and he flinched since shed trained him he knew how deadly a combatant she was and accordingly feared her more than he did me master selden she said is under my protection is that clear dremloc scowled but also inclined his head baltes turned to me do you have more to say he asked i had a nagging sense that i should that id missed things a sharper eye and brain might have discerned but it would have only have undermined his confidence in me to say so youve heard my conjectures milord they point to an obvious course of action search the mansion find the tiara and hope its hiding place reveals who took it the assembly growled at the prospect of having their quarters and belongings ransacked tregan said ridiculous evidently it was a favorite word of his no baltes said it isnt master seldens guesses are only that but they seem plausible we will search the house if only to lay the suspicions hes roused to rest and you brother will try once again to locate the tiara with your sorcery we organized ourselves into search parties and formulated a plan i cast a final admiring glance at the broadsword with the emeralds in its hilt then set forth with my companions the keenspur mansion was enormous it took well into the morning to complete our search and even so we didnt look everywhere some hiding places simply seemed too unlikely to bother with and i wasnt bold enough to suggest that we rummage through baltes or tregans apartments even if id believed it would serve a purpose our mundane search failed to produce the tiara nor did tregans divinations fare any better at the end of it all standing before baltes the magician and their tired irritated relations and retainers i did indeed feel ridiculous im sorry milord i said i thought id reasoned my way to the truth or a part of it anyway but it appears i was mistaken tregan sneered will you now make inquiries among the robbers and knaves as we told you to in the first place yes milord i certainly had no better plan as i walked to the door with as much dignity as i could muster i heard dremloc and another young blade muttering in my wake this is like sending a weasel to escort the chickens safely into the coop my wouldbe challenger said what do you mean his companion asked i dont claim to understand any of this why the tiara was taken or venwell had to die but you can bet your last copper a blue is responsible the seed of suspicion was already sprouting for the next week i went about mostly in disguise in the costumes of other lands or with false whiskers gummed to my chin prowling all night and sleeping by day reasoning it would be difficult for a woman to wear the tiara in mornedealth i began my investigations among receivers of stolen goods who specialized in moving them safely out of town when that availed me nothing i moved on to the commoner sort of thieves market and bribed whores and tavern keepers to tell if any of the citys more accomplished housebreakers had lately boasted of a coup started spending lavishly or was lying low to avoid hunters like myself that was of no use either if any of the citys rascals had knowledge of the tiara it would take a shrewder subtler agent than me to tease out the information meanwhile mornedealth commenced a slide back into the hateful bloody days of yore hotheaded young keenspurs started wearing green tokens their friends from other houses followed suit and the fools among the supposedly defunct blues would have felt cowardly had they not responded by displaying their own colors soon the reds yellows and blacks took up the old practice too from there it was a short step to insults mockery and scuffles in the street baltes tregan pivar and other leaders of the noble houses did their best to quash the unrest and at their behest the city guards assisted thanks to their efforts the quarrels among the resurgent blues and greens and members of the lesser factions ended short of grievous harm to any of the principals but it was only a matter of time before our luck ran out and i feared that as soon as it did the bloodfeuds would resume in earnest all because of a crime that on the surface had nothing to do with the grudges and rivalries of old it was perverse mad yet it was happening in due course i trudged back to keenspur house to report my lack of progress somewhat to my surprise when a lackey admitted me to confer with tregan and baltes i found the latter wearing the broadsword from the wedding gifts it was contrary to custom to put such a present to use prior to the nuptials but i could understand why hed succumbed to the temptation i explained what id accomplished or rather what i hadnt it didnt take long as accounts of failure rarely do so long as a man resists the urge to make excuses im beginning to think said tregan sneering that your success in catching the salamander was a fluke i was starting to wonder myself but still had enough pride left to resent his contempt should i infer milord that your efforts to solve our problem with wizardry have proved as futile as my own the question made him glare tell me the truth baltes said is there any point in your poking around the slums any further i sighed i cant be certain but probably not then dont tell me what i owe you for your time and the steward will pay you on your way out now thathis assumption that i wasnt merely stymied but defeatedtruly stung me and perhaps it was the injury to my pride that finally goaded my brain into squeezing forth some semblance of a fresh idea please milord i said i dont want your coin not until i earn it i have a further course of action to suggest he cocked his head what id like to take up residence here from now until the wedding why i didnt know myself really but had to improvise some sort of answer maybe if i become more familiar with the murder scene some new insight will occur to me or failing that maybe i can at least stop the robber from returning and doing any more harm nonsense tregan snapped youre reverting to your first idiot notion that one of our own family or loyal retainers is responsible for the atrocity you want to spy on us in hope of identifying the culprit no i said and wasnt sure if i was lying or not i was halfway satisfied that none of the household was guilty yet likewise suspected that some secret awaited discovery within these walls youre aware baltes said that the old folly of green and blue has flared up again im struggling to put the fire out and i fear your presence here will feed it you surely wont feel particularly welcome i can tolerate that i said please milord i want what you and lord pivar want to put the feuds and factions behind us forever if theres even the slightest chance that my presence here will help accomplish that or simply lead to the apprehension of venwells killer isnt it worth a try perhaps baltes said stay for the time being and well see how it goes so began my sojourn in keenspur house as the head of the family had warned few of his kin exerted themselves to show me hospitality it might have been even more unpleasant if i hadnt kept to my nocturnal habits sleeping the mornings away and roaming the mansion late at night looking for clues that had eluded me before trying to imagine what had happened on the night of the murder any huge old pile no matter how opulent can turn into a shadowy echoing spooky place after the servants turn out the lamps and everyone goes to bed so it was with the mansion and perhaps it was that eerie atmosphere that prompted me to recall venwells wide eyes and gaping mouth and to infer what they actually signified marissa was wrong the lad had frozen because hed faced a supernatural assailant and any man no matter how well trained a swordsman can succumb to terror in such circumstances yet tregan swore the killing had nothing of the mystical or otherworldly about it and much as he disliked me he seemed sincere in his desire to identify the culprit so what was i to make of that i returned again to the suspicion that the thief dwelled within the mansion i thought of our search and one area wed neglected because the family kept it locked baltes had the only key and thus it scarcely seemed a likely or convenient hiding place it was moreover the sort of place folk rarely visit by choice but though i still possessed no certainties merely a collection of vague suspicions and intuitions i decided i wanted to visit it or at least inspect the entrance i found an oil lamp that was still burning lifted it from its sconce and set off through the hushed gloomy chambers and corridors portraits busts and statues seemed to glower as i passed and suits of plate armor standing on display looked misshapen as ogres then a pair of figures skulked from the shadows to bar my path it was dremloc and his crony each was only half dressed with feet bare and shirt unlaced but despite the inadequacy of their attire theyd taken the trouble to arm themselves the flickering yellow light of my lamp gleamed on the smallswords in their hands dont be stupid i said im here to help your family im lord baltes guest and if thats not enough for you marissa would take it ill if you harmed me they didnt answer just stalked forward further into the circle of lamplight and then i saw what id missed before their eyes were closed happily i didnt freeze though i admit a chill oozed up my spine retreating i set the lamp down on a table drew my broadsword and yelled for help the keenspurs spread out to flank me then rushed in somnambulism didnt hinder their swordplay the slender thrusting blades streaked at me and i dodged and parried frantically meanwhile striving to keep either of my opponents from working his way around completely behind me even if id wanted to kill them i didnt dare for fear of their kindreds retaliation but neither could i simply defend and defend until one of them got lucky and slipped an attack past my guard i feinted at the cronys face and he jumped back his retreat bought me a moment to concentrate solely on dremloc i parried his next thrust feinted high then made a drawing cut to his knee to my relief the blade sliced his flesh precisely as id intended his leg gave way beneath him and he fell but barring ill fortune hed survive and even walk again i heard rushing footsteps as the other youth charged at my back i spun parried his thrust stepped in close and bashed his jaw with my weapons pommel bone cracked he reeled dropped and lay motionless his trance knocked into true insensibility it was then that help finally came rushing into the room in the persons of baltes tregan and six of their household guards by the goddess baltes said he wore a robe nightshirt and slippers but like my assailants carried a swordin his case the sword with the emeralds whats happened milord i panted i regret this but i had no choice your kinsmen attacked me no said dremloc ashen voice shaky clutching at this bloody knee no longer sleepwalking in any obvious way dont believe him we found him looking at that jade statuette yonder as if mustering the nerve to pocket it we told him to leave it alone and he drew on us the fabrication startled me and it took me a moment to reply that isnt so you and your kinsman were sleepwalking possessed or under some sort of spell you attacked me despite the pain of his wound dremloc managed a laugh thats stupid wyler and i were drinking and playing at knucklebones in my room we got hungry came downstairs to raid the larder and found this blue whoreson looking shifty if that was the reason you left your quarters i said would you have brought your swords the same influence that controlled you before is tampering with your memory baltes looked to tregan tell me the keenspur leader said if there can possibly be any truth to this as you wish the warlock said he closed his eyes murmured under his breath swept his hands through mystic passes and swayed from side to side the darkness flowed and thickened around us and a bitter taste stung my tongue tregan opened his eyes once more there was no magic involved no i said somehow youre mistaken i pivoted toward baltes milord do you truly believe id steal from you when you already offered me gold and i refused it is it likely id pick a fight where the odds were against me in a house full of my adversaries kin or that id be the one to cry for help if i did baltes scowled perhaps it was simply ill will and folly that made the three of you brawl and no one has the courage to admit it no uncle dremloc said i swear it happened as i told you meanwhile i made the corresponding assertion in different words master selden baltes said i suspected no good would come of having you here and youve proved me right in other circumstances i might be inclined to punish you for it but pivar and the other bluesformer blues i should sayhold you in esteem the wedding is only two days hence and im loath to do anything that might stir the old animosities so just get out milord i said i was about to follow up on an idea when all this happened apparently our unknown enemy somehow discerned my intent and used dremloc and wyler to stop me that must mean the notion has something to it i beg you baltes hand clenched on the hilt of his sword ive had enough of your foolishness go now or i wont answer for your safety i looked at all the keenspurs and keenspur servants glaring back at me and i went afterward i resolved to put the affair behind me since baltes had discharged me it was no longer any of my concern and id been lucky to come out of it with my skin intact but id never had much of a knack for minding my own business and after a morning of moping and grumbling around my school i went to see pivar hed already heard id disgraced myself among the keenspurs but received me anyway for the sake of the services id rendered him in the past i told him my side of the story and couldnt judge if he credited it or not im glad you escaped unharmed he said sitting on a marble bench in the conservatory where he often received callers if their rank and business was such that formality was unnecessary sunlight streamed through the high windows and the scent of verdure tinged the air but you cant let go of it can you i grinned you understand my foibles milord well enough to realize youre here because you want something of me what can you tell me about the early years of the feuding it was already well underway when i first came to mornedealth and i never bothered to learn the details i dont see the point of your learning them now but all right i have time to chat for half a candlemark or so some of what he told me i did in fact already know how the factions began as supporters of one or another racing team silly as that seemed but eventually the talk turned to a wizard named yshan keenspur he was their house mage before tregan pivar said from which you can guess that he was an older man that in turn might lead you to imagine him as a prudent coolheaded fellow who would try to prevent the rise of the factions but youd be wrong he was one of the instigators as rabid and bloodyminded a green as ever was perhaps he simply had a choleric temperament or saw it as a way to increase his familys power or maybe he dabbled in dark magic and it twisted his mind there were rumors but then there always are whenever a sorcerer is disliked what became of him i asked for all his powers he came to grief in a street brawl when three blues set on him at once he died trying to lay a curse on us but so what it happened long ago maybe not long enough i explained my suspicions to the extent i understood them myself pivar shook his head you realize the greensthe keenspurs i meanwould find this allegation even more offensive than anything youve suggested hitherto i suppose on top of that it doesnt actually explain the theft of the tiara according to your postulations the culprit took it to rekindle the hatred between green and blue but why would anyone anticipate that it would have that result he smiled a humorless smile even if somehow thats how its working out i dont know i said but i have figured out what we ought to do next i told him no he said at once if i insulted baltes and his kin with such a proposal it could shatter the peace for good and all something dangerous is lurking in keenspur house i said and youre about to send your daughter to live there but not immediately shell marry there but she and baltes will spend their wedding night and the following week at his hunting lodge even if your wild hunch is right that buys us some time lets get the bride and groom wed our two houses united then perhaps you and i can broach this matter if you still deem it necessary it was the best he had to offer so i tried to rest content with it i failed every great house employs dozens of servants but when it hosts a wedding even they arent enough the steward cook and groundskeeper all have to hire extra help and accordingly nobody expects to recognize everyone he sees thus clad as a common laborer my grizzled brown hair stained black as marissas with my sword a pry bar and a lantern hidden in a sack i found it easy enough to slip back into keenspur house i then skulked to the one quiet precinct of the mansion a chapel where a few votive candles glowed before icons and stone stairs descended into the earth i lit the lantern strapped on my sword and headed down before long i came to a door of vertical iron bars it was locked but the fact did little to allay my suspicions magic that could turn sleeping men into puppets could likely manipulate a lock as well i broke it with my lever and continued on the steps debouched into dank crypts festooned with webs the spiders spun to snare the beetles and smelling faintly of incense embalmers spice and rot the lesser keenspurs lay behind graven plaques in the walls the principal lords and ladies had their own private vaults where stone sarcophagi the lids often sculpted into likenesses of the occupants reposed on pedestals in the center i assumed yshan had rated one of the latter and found him quickly if his marble likeness could be trusted hed possessed the sharp features characteristic of his line honed beyond the point of gauntness it gave him a look of fanaticism and spite which the sculptor had accentuated by rendering him with glaring eyes and a scowl instead of the usual expression of serenity i inspected the lid of the sarcophagus trying to discern whether anyoneor anythinghad opened it recently i couldnt tell not unless i opened it myself assuming i could it looked damnably heavy for a lone man to shift but i meant to try i set the lantern down then with a dry mouth and sweat starting beneath my arms tried to work the pry bar into the crack between cover and box the iron tool scraped the stone the lid flew up and to the side like the cover of a book straight at me it could have shattered my bones but my reflexes jerked me backward and perhaps that robbed the impact of some of its force even so the sculpted marble slab slapped me like a giants hand knocking me into the wall i fell and the lid fell with me crashing down on top of my legs meanwhile yshan who had by dint of either magic or prodigious strength flung his graven image at me reared up from the sarcophagus he was relatively intact the embalmers had evidently done their work well and his box had protected him from rats and worms but his face was shriveled flaking and streaked with black leakage his right eye had gone milky while the left had crumbled inward a few slimy strings stretched across the vacant socket he held a sword and the glow of the lantern just sufficed to reveal a thick layer of grease coating the blade when i saw it i finally comprehended all that had eluded me before but i didnt have time to dwell on it not with the dead thing stepping out of the coffin and my legs pinned i struggled to free myself and managed to drag my feet out from under the lid just in time yshans sword flashed at my head and i flung myself out of range it was the only move that could have saved me but it put the dead man between me and the doorway now i had no choice but to fight i scrambled up and snatched for the sword at my side yshan cut at me and i parried the impact jolted my arm and his weapon nearly smashed through my guard he was as unnaturally strong as id feared in other circumstances wary of his might i might have fought defensively but if i hung back it would give him the chance to cast spells and i feared that even more than the force of his blows so i attacked hard whenever i was able i drove my point into his chest but it didnt balk him even for an instant why should it when he was already dead his vital organs still and rotting the only effect was to trap my blade he whirled a backhand cut at my face i ducked beneath it and yanked my sword free he cut down at my head still in a crouch i just managed to parry and once again his stroke nearly hammered through my guard almost broke my grip on the hilt of my blade but not quite and i discerned that hed struck with such ferocity as to shift himself off balance i straightened up feinted deceived his awkward attempt at a parry and slashed his one remaining eye from its socket he snarled like a beast exposing yellow teeth and dark oozing gums but he didnt falter as most any mortal creature would have done instead he struck back immediately and his aim was as accurate as before as i dodged i thought a hit to the vitals hadnt stopped him nor had blindness what if nothing could i struggled to quash the panic welling up in my mind i opened my guard a hair praying that hed think it an error not the invitation the trap it truly was that hed make a particular indirect attack id noticed he favored it seemed likely it was a combination well suited to exploiting the seeming defect in my defense his arm extended and i immediately stepped forward and to the side without waiting to see where his blade was actually going if id guessed wrong it had an excellent chance of winding up in my guts but i hadnt he made the move i expected i avoided it and placed myself on his flank in the process surprising him before he could pivot to threaten me anew i gripped my hilt with both hands and cut with all my might i didnt quite lop off his sword hand but i shattered the wrist bones and left it hanging useless yshan reached to shift his weapon to his off hand but i was faster i beat the greasy blade and knocked the hilt from his nowfeeble grip the sword clanked on the floor even then with his terrible strength and resistance to pain and injury he might have gotten the better of me if hed simply assailed me like a wrestler but he hesitated and i cut at his leg my sword bit deep he fell and i attacked the same spot twice more until i was certain id done enough damage to keep him from getting up then i concentrated on his head driving stroke after stroke into his skull while avoiding his flailing hand finally he collapsed and lay motionless i studied the mangled seemingly inert carcass for a few heartbeats then turned and strode toward the exit at my back a harsh voice hissed rhyming words the patch of floor beneath me turned to soft muck treacherous as quicksand i sank to my knees in an instant and as i floundered yshan began a second incantation no doubt to finish me off while the ooze held me helpless i cast about spied the open sarcophagus and tossed my broadsword into it then i stretched out my arms and straining succeeded in hooking my fingertips over the lip of the stone receptacle i heaved with all my strength and dragged myself up and out of the sucking slime in the process i noticed the tiara lying inside the coffin not that i cared anymore i grabbed my sword and leaped at yshan some shapeless phosphorescent thing was rippling into full existence above him but it vanished when i cut into his chin and silenced his conjuration i finished removing his jaw severed his head cut the tongue out and hacked off his fingers afterward i still wasnt certain he was altogether dead but reasonably confident id deprived him of the ability to cast any more spells that should have been the end of it but i hurried back the way id come because i feared it wasnt practitioners of dark magic dont always pass from the world as easily as normal folk especially if they leave a dying curse behind while the feud between the greens and blues raged yshan had apparently rested easy but the prospect of peace roused him and he resolved to avert it he had the power to observe things at a distance and so discerned a sword among the wedding gifts its blade smeared with grease as such fine weapons generally come from the maker he decided to switch the sword for the costly one his family had interred with him baltes and lukinda had received such an abundance of presents that it seemed unlikely anyone would notice the substitution yshan emerged from the crypts late one night had the bad luck to encounter venwell and killed him to silence them he then gave his sword a more thorough cleaning than any common housebreaker eager to flee would have done it couldnt have even a drop of blood on it if it was to pass for a new weapon he made the substitution stole the tiara simply to bolster the impression that an ordinary thief had invaded the mansion and returned to his vault in the days that followed the enchantments hed laid on the emerald sword began their work first a glamour made baltes yearn to wear the blade without delay id felt the power myself if only id had the wit to realize it next its influence nudged the keenspurs back toward the rancor of yore and through it all tregan never sensed supernatural forces at work because yshan had trained him and held some tricks in reserve tricks that allowed him to operate without his successor detecting it i doubted he was detecting anything now either and that meant i had to get upstairs fast because i suspected the warlocks sword had a final trick to play the keenspurs were holding the wedding in their great hall before hundreds of guests lukinda was plump freckled and pretty in her gown of shining white the priestess matronly in vestments of green baltes wore the emerald sword from the looks of it the ceremony was nearing its conclusion stop i bellowed starting up the aisle lord baltes throw away your sword its cursed everyone turned to gawk at me and i realized what a peculiar spectacle i must be clad like a laborer my legs filthy a blade in my hand then dremloc cried its selden the dye in my hair wasnt enough to fool him several of the keenspurs rose to bar my way get out of here lunatic said one hand on the hilt of his dagger you dont understand i said nor were they disposed to listen as they advanced on me and all the other guests gawked at us baltes whipped yshans sword from its scabbard and lifted it to threaten his dumbfounded bride the priestess grabbed his arm but he shook her off and shoved her reeling nobody else saw because they were all looking at me and i could do nothing the entire length of the hall and the folk intent on ejecting me or worse separated me from the altar which meant that despite all my efforts baltes would commit the atrocity yshan had intended then the blues would rise up in fury the greens would have no option but to defend themselves and any nobles who survived this day would prosecute the bloodfeud for years to come or so it seemed but it turned out that someone had heeded my warning after all marissa hurled herself at baltes and grappled with him she softened him up with a knee to the groin then twisted his arm the emerald sword dropped from his fingers as soon as it did he stopped struggling blessed goddess he whimpered his voice full of horror blessed goddess by then people were finally taking note of what was happening before the altar i cast about and found tregan the evils in the blade i reiterated surely you can sense it now he peered at the fallen weapon then growled yes he muttered words of power swept his right hand through a pass and a ragged darkness swirled up from the sword people cried out and cringed but tregan had the demon if that was what it was under control and it couldnt hurt us it wailed as it withered away afterward came explanations and reassurances to the frightened lukinda and her understandably agitated kin during the course of it all baltes still whitefaced and shaky told me master selden i owe you a hundred apologies what can i do to make amends i grinned finish the wedding invite me to the feast and give me a purse heavy with gold marissa said i think im due a split dawn of sorrows by brenda cooper

planning she writes for futuristcom and can sometimes be found speaking about the future and suggesting that science fiction books make great reading the rest of the time shes writing reading exercising or exploring life with her family bard jocelyn paused at the crest of the hill and looked down at the peaceful town of sunny valley spilling between two sets of lower hills below the midday sun washed the houses and fields in bright cheerful warmth as if the town smiled up at her and bard silver she turned to look back where bard silver trailed behind one slender white hand against her side the other wiping sweat from her forehead jocelyn wanted to push down to sunny valley buy supplies and keep right on going but silver needed a break even if she wasnt complaining standing sideways jocelyn watched silver struggle up the last few steps to stand beside her on the crest of the hill soft midsummer wind blew tendrils of ashblonde hair across the younger womans white face obscuring the light freckles on her nose silver was pretty enough to draw a crowd anywhere between the silver eyes she drew her nickname from her alabaster skin and her slender height she looked more like a fairytale princess than a young bard fresh to her scarlets might as well be nice to the girlit wasnt her fault her beauty was so like dawns not any more that it was her fault the powersthatbe in bardic had decided jocelyn needed a partner she didnt of course shed been just fine on her own the last five years she sighed well take a break here she gestured toward a convenient tumble of whiteandgray rocks then dug into her pack and pulled out two red apples handing one to silver silver settled on the sheepcropped grass took the apple daintily and bit into it thank you ashamed of her curtness jocelyn stepped into her pleasant performance voice no problem she picked out a flat rock sat down and took a bite of her own apple do you have any questions is there anything youd like to know maybe silver wanted to know about their tripthey were going to walk a circuit all the way to the border and back and would be expected to perform and listen for news starting in just a few days this was after all silvers first long journey away from haven silver nodded and finished her apple in thoughtful silence then she turned toward jocelyn a small mischievous gleam in her eye i want to hear the story behind dawn of sorrows jocelyn sat back against the sunwarmed granite rock and crossed one long leg over the other this was why she hadnt wanted to travel with anyone i dont tell that story silver laughed nervously youre famous for dawn of sorrows but no one knows the real story just the song i thought she looked away as if suddenly shy i thought maybe youd be willing to tell me i know the song tells the story but there must be more details i want to write a song that matters some day jocelyn bit back a suggestion that no one should want to write a song like dawn of sorrows she finished her apple she didnt have to answer silver not right away she was the elder by seven years after all she threw her apple core into the woods for the ants then captured the most unruly bits of her own red hair with her left hand and looked down from this distance and height the people working the ripening fields looked like brightly colored moving dots but she remembered looking down on another town despite the days warmth she shivered shed managed not to talk about dawn for at least five years and not to sing the song herself for almost as long it was impossible of course not to hear it dawn of sorrows was one of those songs that took on its own life and became part of the repertoire of nearly every minstrel and bard some days she wished shed never written it she hadnt written anything else since maybe she should talk about it maybe that would teach silver that adventure wasnt always easy that sometimes it tore you right up jocelyn sighed bard dennis had assigned her to travel with silver for a full season shed have to talk to the girl eventually jocelyn had pushed silver by setting a hard pace and the girl had kept up shed asked for silence and silver had let her have a polite and respectful quiet she didnt deserve to have her first question rebuffed jocelyn took a sip of water and settled back sorry i guess im a little touchy ill start by telling you dawns story her story from before i met her silver sighed a smile edging her pale pink lips anticipation brightening her eyes she pillowed her head on her scarlet cloak and closed her eyes relaxed and still as if she listened with her whole body jocelyn nodded in silent approvalthe bardic gift was akin to empathy and when silver focused her energy on listening as hard as jocelyn focused hers on storytelling theyd both feel jocelyns emotions she whispered almost to herself i hope youre ready to hear the story silver opened her eyes and regarded jocelyn gravely try me dawn lived in johnsons ford a border town near hardorn i call it a town just because it had a name but it was really just a handful of houses maybe thirty people or forty not a bad place not really but like other border towns raiders and bandits swooped down from time to time bellies grumbled and old people died when the winters were hard and the granaries never overflowed other small towns nearby traded with them but they didnt get much news or many minstrels or bards so the people of johnsons ford didnt understand the big things shaping up in valdemar like elspeth becoming the first heraldmage since vanyel jocelyn paused watching a lone hawk circle lazily just above her eye level if only she could fly alone like that today no johnsons ford mostly worried about surviving the storms that plagued valdemar that year oh the impending war with hardorn had grazed the town rattling nerves and stealing young men but johnsons ford was far from anything strategic except the ford itself jocelyn let her voice trail off she was taking too long making the story hard to get into she closed her eyes and focused her breath deep in her belly letting her loss and pain creep up so it would fill her her story with true emotion her breath quickened silver opened her eyes as if curious about the long pause but she closed them again content to wait jocelyn swallowed the year before elspeths return a pack of black wolves that had been twisted by ancars mages came through town and dawns husband drake and two other men died defending their homes a nasty death as quick and as unexpected in dawns life as a lightning strike she kept living in the little tworoom house that drake died for alone except for their daughter eightyearold lisle oh dawn was pretty enough that she did get a few offers from other men but she turned them all down for she had been truly in love with drake dawn had no other family in johnsons ford lisle became her anchor her ground they were inseparable they worked side by side minding the sheep in the morning and weeding the fields in the afternoon neither had the bardic gift but either could have been minstrels and they sang together when they worked and sometimes they sang for town gatherings silvers eyes were bright with curiosity so what did dawn look like jocelyn cocked her head studying the other woman a little like you she arched an eyebrow shook her head but not so light or so thin her eyes werent silver they were dark and warm like walnut she shook her head again silver frowned puzzled so shed already lost her husband before you even met her yes jocelyn paused so the first stanza of her song happened before i met her thats the only part of the song i didnt see she took a deep breath and threaded her fingers through her hair i took my journeyman trip alone and for a purpose selenay had given word that valdemar was her people and not her places she sent heralds out to tell the people along hardorns border to leave but there werent enough heralds available so some bards were selected as well our goal was to take selenays message to every single person near hardorn she glanced at silver caught her pale eyes with her own we were to use our gift to convince them if we had to you know that business about it being okay to use your gift on the business of the crown silver nodded smiling wryly i know the rules she sat up picking at the grass beside her in small nervous motions im sorry shed been silvers age the year she met dawn so why did silver seem so much younger than she remembered being herself jocelyn uncrossed her legs and bunched her red cloak under her knees to serve as cushioning that was the year the companions searched valdemar high and low for mage gift i was walking the last half mile or so to johnsons ford when a lone companion trotted past her head up her nostrils flared as though she smelled something good i remember how it felt for her to pass me just for a moment i wished she would choose me but of course i already had my scarlets and though i wouldnt refuse a companion i didnt really hope for one anymore but i was going down the same road and id never seen a choosing take place i quickened my steps turning a corner just in time to see the companion stop in front of a little girl and her mother the girl had dark hair the mother light they both had pert noses and wide eyes and slender builds it was of course dawn and lisle both were beautiful and the companion in front of them was beautiful and all together it called up all every choosing song and story id ever heard she could see it in her mind all over again as if the companion and her chosen stood in front of her right then even now years later it awed her there are no words for the grace with which the companion bowed down to that little girl and lowered her gorgeous head so her bright blue eyes met lisles dark ones i stopped no more than twelve feet away from them and i swear i felt something flow between the companion and the girl some magic like the magic in a room when a master bard weaves his or her gift into a powerful song the girl held her arm up and she spoke the companions name tamay i could hear the love in that one word even from twelve feet away surely dawn heard it too jocelyn paused again for effect tears began to flow down dawns face lisle didnt notice tamay knelt even farther down and nuzzled the girl lisle climbed up on tamays foamwhite back and clutched tamays bright white mane her eyes shining with pleasure tamay stood completely still unnaturally still looking at dawn dawn stood her ground gazing back brown eyes into blue they stood that way so long my legs began to shiver from standing there was a conversation going on between them that i couldnt hear and all that time lisle sat on tamays back and twisted her hands in her new companions white mane and watched her moms face finally dawn nodded she wiped her eyes and took three steps toward lisle she reached up took lisles small hands and kissed them smiling up at her daughter through damp eyes she whispered i love you honey take good care just barely loud enough for me to hear and her little girl whispered back i love you mommy and im sorry dawn said dont ever be sorry and let lisles fingers slip from hers the companion turned and passed me by she gave me a look that didnt need mindspeech to read she might as well have spoken out loud and said take care of this woman for me jocelyn paused this was the heart of the song and she wanted to be sure silver felt it silver had turned her head but when she turned it back to see why jocelyn had stopped talking tears glistened in the corners of her eyes jocelyn noted the tears smiled and kept the story moving i reached for dawn but she had already fallen to her knees in the dirt head buried in her hands sobs shook her whole body i knelt by her side my hand on her slender heaving back i sang softly soothing her as best i could silvers voice was soft and warm concerned and thats when the last stanza starts jocelyn nodded her tears were pure sorrow id never heard such a forlorn sound before and havent since not from animal or human i wanted to help her more than id ever wanted anything for her sake and for tamays and lisles too for all of our sakes seeing lisles choosing felt like a symbol of all that valdemar holds dear all the love all the sacrifice all the magic it showed me what ancar wanted to take from us she glanced back down at the peaceful summer scene below them and spread her arm out over the town encouraging silver to see the peace when id thought about choosing before id only seen the joy and shock and bewilderment of it never the price companions choose who they choose of course and usually its not first or only children usually its a blessing to the family left behind surely lisle must have a special part to play but thats not part of this story did anyone ever write a song about lisle jocelyn shrugged i dont know remember shell just barely be getting her whites by now i never stayed in haven long enough to watch for her jocelyn shrugged most heralds live unsung lives its easy to forget that there are so many songs about heralds but there are many more heralds than songs about them many parents and families of people who come to haven whether herald or bard or mage or healer well their pain is unsung as well she stared down at her knotted fingers thats why i wrote dawn of sorrows for choosing and all the love and pain and sacrifice and promise of that moment dawns pain would have gone unnoticed a single sacrifice in a flood of things surrendered to save valdemar from ancar except i gave people her story for remembrance thats what bards do silver twisted her hands in her lap i havent yet written anything that many people sing the wistful yearning in her voice echoed in her eyes jocelyn stood up your life will surely yield opportunities come on theres only a few hours until dark we should get moving she bent down to gather up her battered leather pack and fiddle case and when she stood back up she saw the disappointment on silvers face she sighed yes theres more ill tell you more of the story tonight thank you silvers voice sounded small she shouldered her own nearlynew black leather pack a flute case hung below her pack tied in with purple ribbons and she carried a gittern case that looked as new as her pack will we stay at an inn tonight jocelyn shook her head not if you want the rest of dawns story it doesnt make me want to sing theyll have plenty of minstrels and even bards in a town this close to haventhey wont expect us to sing silver fell silent and jocelyn started down the hill setting a good hard pace silvers footsteps behind her reminded her of dawn following her and she walked faster leading them downhill through tall dry grass and yellow mustard flowers if only she hadnt tried so hard to help dawn she struggled to distract herself by counting the small suncup butterflies flashing white and orange over yellow mustard flowers and tiny blue wild onions she picked up speed nearly jogging down the waterrutted path after an hour the footsteps behind her began to fade and jocelyn stopped looking back silvers cheeks shone red with exertion and her shoulders drooped jocelyn heard her own rattling breath and stopped she waited for silver to catch up then said im sorry i didnt mean to walk so fast beads of sweat stood out on silvers forehead she breathed in little hard gulps i didnt know how much youd mind talking about dawn she licked her lips and brushed damp hair from her face looking at jocelyn earnestly i thought i was asking about a song but i guess i was asking about more you dont have to tell me hot tears suddenly licked at the edges of jocelyns eyes she turned her face away a little hoping silver wouldnt see them i know she took a long drink of water felt it fall like a welcome river in her mouth shed been pushing silver too hard but maybe shed also been pushing herself too hard ill slow down some tell me about the first song you wrote she started off again not looking at silver but measuring her pace silver was quiet for a few steps when she spoke her soft voice barely carried to jocelyn i always made up songs as long as i can remember im sure my first songs were about my family what about you did you sing about your family jocelyn flinched how come everything silver said poked at her had she really become such a pincushion no wonder dennis had looked so concerned when she wandered back to bardic a month ago for rest i sang about the boarding school i was raised in and about some of my teachers maybe we should just walk for a while behind her silvers answer was to start humming and then singing a summer harvest song if silver had asked her to join in jocelyn would have refused but the younger womans quiet singing acted like a balm letting jocelyn enjoy the late afternoon sun warming her face and steady quiet hum of bees in the flowers by the third song jocelyn began to sing along and before they even made it all the way off the hill and onto the main road she realized she was smiling and her pace was naturally slower the road to sunny valley was wide enough for two carts to pass each other easily although the hardpacked road was empty for long stretches they were greeted by kids on horses going between farms and carts most likely headed between towns or even to haven jocelyn remembered to stop a few times under shade trees silver would get used to traveling and theyd make better time in the future after all this was only day two of a threemonth journey they stopped at an inn in sunny valley to refill their waterskins and purchase a loaf of fresh bread a skin of red wine and a round of deepyellow cheese as the skinny darkhaired innkeeper handed them their packages of food he said theres room we have a local minstrel who plays here but he never minds being joined by bards long as they share the takings says it helps him learn new songs jocelyn glanced at silver letting her choose silver shook her head wed rather push on tonight the innkeeper grumbled goodnaturedly you folk from haven always hurrying he turned to his next customer and jocelyn and silver headed back for the road two candlemarks later after setting up a quiet camp by a thin stream they perched on an old log a small fire at their feet throwing tiny sparks up into a darkening sky jocelyn broke the bread in half while silver parceled out the cheese and one more apple each jocelyn set her plate on her lap and took a long sip of the wine her stomach fluttered but at least the hot tears didnt return no point in waiting the words wanted to come out so we left the story with me and dawn in the middle of the road and dawn in pain and me feeling her pain and on my way to johnsons ford to convince people id never met to leave a town theyd struggled to build their whole lives well i might as well have promised tamay id take care of dawn and besides who could have left her so i sat there with her and fed her water and sang to her and she let me stroke her back even though shed never seen me before finally she pushed herself away from me and looked deep into my eyes her voice trembled as she said thank you she glanced at silver finding silvers pale eyes staring at her waiting silver still looked like dawn and still like dawn looked like she needed jocelyn except silver had her own scarlet cloak and her need was simple and healthy unlike dawns naked scrapedraw tenderness jocelyn cleared her throat i stood and helped her up we walked back to town just as the sun was setting she moved slowly as if she were an old woman as if every movement hurt perhaps it did perhaps her grief was so heavy it weighed on her bones johnsons ford didnt have an inn so dawn led me home with her for the night i really should have called a town meeting right then maybe stayed one night and gone on but i didnt i stayed a week dawns house had two beds hers and another that must have been lisles but dawn didnt offer it and i couldnt make myself ask besides id been traveling a few months anyway and the floor wasnt as hard for me as dawns sadness jocelyn stopped and took another pull of wine leaving her plate untouched silver spoke softly compellingly a voice full of promise you loved her didnt you the first time i heard dawn of sorrows i thought it must have been written by a man had she theyd never been lovers but she knew every line of dawns face every curve of her slender arms she knew the shape of her fingers long slender with one pinky shorter than the other even after all this time she remembered how warm dawns hand had felt in hers even though shed only had weeks with dawn she still stopped by streams and pretty trees in bloom and wished dawn were there to point them out to she swallowed hard i loved her beauty and her loss and her story was so romantic and so tragic and id seen the most recent part of it so maybe i was stareyed about her but theres nothing romantic about helping someone with such deep grief so even if maybe youve found a grain of truth it didnt feel that way the days we spent in johnsons ford i talked to the mayor that next morning i told him about the choosing and he helped me get news out that selenay had sent me to talk to the town i met with about twenty townspeople that night farmers and hunters strong and tough sure of themselves the women held their little ones like they were gold especially the older boys watching me carefully their faces were stoic and still as i told them selenay wanted them to abandon johnsons ford when youve worked your whole life to keep a town together when youve built the buildings with your own hands you dont much want to just pick up and leave after the first amazement at having the queens words sent to them the meaning of the words sank in some of the parents understood right away but most peoples faces stayed stones to me and i knew i hadnt convinced them so i told them id sing to them every night and that they could find me at dawns house most of the day if they had questions i only sang a few songs that first night even though i put as much of my gift into those songs as i could the town didnt just jump up and start packing another mageborn storm slammed into town that night and by morning the streets ran with water and the river had risen noticeably but still no one agreed to leave between me and the storm it took four days before anyone started to pack those four days are their own story that ill share some other time each night i sat with dawn after i came back in wet from walking home from the mayors house in the storms we kept a fire going talking a little and singing a little and staying quiet a lot jocelyn started to reach for the wine again but changed her mind and picked up the bread she chewed slowly watching the little fire so it took four days for the town to start packing it began with three women who had little kids and their husbands and then a grandfather and then a young couple that had just gotten married by the sixth day i was there everyone finally decided they didnt want to be the last one in johnsons ford and they all started making plans to leave some had family in other towns but most were just going to walk away from the border walk farther into valdemar and hope except dawn dawn came up to me her eyes big and dark and suddenly full of fire instead of sadness she said i dont want to go with them i want to help you keep other people safe i want to go with you she took me aback completely she looked so brave and so damned lonely i reminded her i was traveling toward danger and wouldnt be going back to haven until winter i thought maybe that was it maybe she wanted to get to haven and saw me as the easiest way to get near lisle but she stood in front of me looking like shed looked when she stared into tamays eyes rooted curious and full of dread she said i want to do something that matters all my life ive just lived and loved the people i loved and ive been lucky i had the best husband and the best little girl in the world theyre all gone now even lisle even if i get to live near her well shell have her own life tamay told me all about the collegium and about how lisle would have important jobs for valdemar how she was special tamay convinced me my little baby was special for more than me that it was time for her to grow up now its time for me to do something that matters and the only thing i can think of is to go help you she took my hand the first time she voluntarily touched me you can use someone familiar with living near the woods and hills of the border i know you could i cant just run away with everyone else and i cant start over not yet not until the war is over lisles gone off to help in her way and i want to help in mine i need to jocelyn shifted uncomfortably and stirred the fire dawns eyes had drilled into her so hard needed her to say yes so badly i didnt have an argument for her i understood her we were allowed to accept local help i could probably even bring her back to haven and find her work somewhere maybe even at the collegium but first there was a war on i wish id told her no every day i wish id told her no i took her the next town was about the same size as johnsons ford and we stayed outside of it in my tent stormdrenched and shivering for the first night the second night an older couple made room for us in their barn that town took five days to convince to leave then we went to killdeer which was big enough for an inn a herald came through there the day after we got there reinforcing my message so we were off again jocelyn paused reaching for water silver shivered i was only thirteen that year and mostly i heard about everythingi wasnt involved except i did get to see the gryphons come into haven i remember that so you must have only been twenty jocelyn closed her eyes i felt older and dawn how old was dawn i dont know i suppose she was in her late twenties lisle couldnt have been more than ten when she was chosen and women marry young out in the hill country like that i bet she wasnt ten years older than i was silver took a bite of cheese and reached for the wine the last light had faded silvers white face and light hair looked almost ghostly in the firelight but she listened to you followed you right she sipped the wine because you were a full bard jocelyn shook her head not everyone follows you because youre a bard not in haven and not out here youll learn that eventually she steepled her hands under her chin musing on silvers question i think she needed someone and maybe it mattered that i was a bard but maybe it mattered more that i had seen dawns loss and been there for her i was young and any other year i probably wouldnt have been a full bard yet i think a few of us were tested into full scarlets because valdemar needed us that was a scary year with newfound mages and ancars army and the storms very little was done the way youd do it in peacetime jocelyn took her own sip of wine silver was rightshe really had been young younger even than silver if just by a year or two silver said youve traveled alone ever since didnt you like having someone to travel with the fire snapped and popped holding jocelyns gaze the presence of the other woman did feel good and jocelyn wasnt responsible for her even though silver was younger she was a full bard while dennis was correct and silver could learn from jocelyn they were more equal than jocelyn and dawn had ever been silver had education as well as enthusiasm even if she had lived in the city her whole life maybe maybe silver could be a friend or more dawn could have been more but there hadnt been time jocelyn threw two new logs on the fire and watched it lick up their edges in bright tendrils then bloom the new light played on her feet she didnt have to decide whether or not to trust silver not yet but she did have a story to tell she finished eating and then slid down so her back rested against the log next to her silver took out her metal flute and started polishing it with a clean cloth until firelight glittered back from its bright surface jocelyn cleared her throat we had fires like this at night small and cozy and we talked after a while dawn began to talk about lisle and drake she told me doing something even just helping me find my way from place to place helped her to feel less lonely oh i still heard her crying sometimes at night especially when it was cold and wet and we shared a tent and lay close each of us swaddled in blankets but still near enough to share body heat the coldest scariest nights we even held hands shed never told anyone that but then she hadnt told the story at all for years oh shed told plenty of stories and sung plenty of songs to countless people she didnt know but this was different it was like like talking to dawn had been after wed been traveling two weeks we had two more towns to go and then i was due to head back i still planned to take dawn with me we came to the first of the last two towns up over a hill kind of like where you and i sat today when i started this story the sky hung low and oppressive over us a gray at midday that was almost black lightning flashed in the far hills it wasnt raining but it had and would and the air itself felt full of water as if drops might materialize all on their own in the damp darkness smoke filled the bottom on the valley persistent and thick and ugly bright embers showed where the largest houses had once been we walked down into it we had to whoever whatever had burned the town did not seem to be there and maybe there was someone we could help dawn clutched my hand when we saw the first two bodies children two children they had been running and fire had somehow caught them dawns eyes were huge her face pale and at first she stopped and her fingernails dug into my palm and her body shook i had seen the dead before but something seemed unnatural the nearest burned building was quite a distance away it looked like the children had just burst into flame running not like they ran flaming from a fire it sounds like a small difference when i say it but it was a big difference to see it struck us both silent part of me didnt want to go any farther into the town no matter what didnt want to take another step the memory hurt the moment she should have could have changed her mind jocelyn stood and stretched and paced once around the fire and sat back down keenly aware of her own restlessness but you know when youre out there and there might be someone you can help you remember youre a bard that youre more than just a court singer you just are jocelyn looked up into silvers eyes did silver understand this in her bones did she know what life shed chosen silver nodded as if answering jocelyns unspoken question so we walked forward we didnt talk about it we dropped each others hands but we kept going looking around the stenchall the things that had burned but were never meant to burnstuck to us covering us and i wanted the sky to rain and clean us off it didnt the sky just glowered above us instead we saw more burned bodies crisped dark some houses still smoldered others stood untouched a fat brown dog ran between two houses it looked lost but healthy it stopped and stared at us then it barked plaintively and then then it burned fire flashed alive on it and in it a blanket of blue fire it went from standing to burning she swallowed dawn screamed she paused swallowed again the words clawed their way out of her throat dry and hot as flame and burned tears ran down her cheeks and burned she gestured toward the fire not like if that campfire caught my clothes but completely in seconds i could see her bones she didnt jocelyn choked she didnt even scream for long i ran i didnt scream i i just ran dawns armsno silvers armsbard silvers long slender strong arms circled jocelyns shoulders and jocelyn turned her face into the other womans chest and burrowed holding on she should never have let dawn go in there she should never have let dawn travel with her in the first place she should have gone alone she should have died instead or at least died too magic she lifted her head looked away talking in broken words it was she was killed by a spell triggered by sound that killed them allthe whole town jocelyn wiped at her eyes and nose and reached for a waterskin her hands shook so hard silver had to help her pull the stopper out she drank deeply i learned that when i got back to havenlearned sound started the spell and learned that it faded quickly if wed come into town the next day all the gruesome sights would still be there but we could have talked or laughed or screamed the palace sent one of the white winds mages to read the spell as soon as i got back to haven and told my story he said he said it he thought it was ancars mages testing a potential trap they killed that whole town just to test a spell you know it wasnt your fault she died silver whispered awkwardly earnestly jocelyn pushed a little away from silver reached down to touch the dirt to ground herself she drew in the smell of the fire of the night i know my head knows but i could have been more careful silver sounded confused as she said but wasnt magic new to valdemar werent you still inside the borders where magic hadnt even worked just months before how were you supposed to know jocelyn didnt answer her head said the same thing all the time but but silver was so young and she was saying the same thing silver was a year older than jocelyn so so jocelyn really had been young that year she hadnt felt young shed forgive silver if she made a mistakeshe was on her first trip and couldnt even walk a good days pace yet even though by the end of their trip todays walk might seem short if she could forgive silver almost any mistake why couldnt she forgive her own younger self look silver said im sure it doesnt help to tell you dawn died doing something she wanted to do you must have heard that before but you did the very best you could and then you wrote her a song and your song made a difference how dawns dead right silvers voice was soft musical a bards voice surer than dawns had ever been but now when kids are chosen now a lot of towns do something extra for the parents or for the other family left behind jocelyn looked up was it true why hadnt she noticed really silver returned the smile really silver picked up her gittern unwrapped it and started the refrain for dawn of sorrows dawn of sorrows sacrifice yield up all you love in life jocelyns took a breath and opened her throat she took up the first stanza focusing on the notes on her voice on singing as strong as she could by the end of the song her voice sounded clear and steady this she suddenly understood was why dennis wanted her to travel with someone maybe shed write another song it was too early to tell what that song might be of course but maybe even a song about something that wasnt quite so painful there were after all happy moments in valdemar she looked over at silver tears glittered like gems on the younger womans smooth pale cheeks but she sang through a wide smile and her eyes were warm behind the wetness warmth bloomed inside jocelyn it took her a moment to recognize it as happiness to notice that she too smiled as she sang even though tear tracks still stained her own cheeks horse of air by rosemary edghill rosemary edghills first professional sales were to the black white comics of the late s so she can truthfully state on her resume that she once killed

at httpwwwsffnetpeopleeluki there are places in valdemar where the heralds cant go well actually this isnt true heralds and their companions are welcome everywhere from keyold to the crookback pass heralds are the voice and hands of king sendarits queen selenay now but it was sendar who reigned when i put on my white leathers for the first time and old habits are hard to break heralds bring news and gossip defend the weak embody the crowns justice do good in the world it is a sacred trust to be a herald and it is a public thing you are always on display whenever you are in public people tend to think of heralds as being more than humanas far removed from them and ordinary concerns as our companions above pettiness injustice fear and weakness the first lesson you learn from your companionand at the collegiumis that you must never disappoint them sometimes it iswas very hard to be always watched and always judged by a standard no human could possibly meet and because they believe such things of heralds the people behave differently when heralds are among them some try to act as they believe a herald would and that can be a good thing some hideboth their bodies and their wordsout of fear out of awe out of guilt some lie some tell too much truth even in haven where they see heralds and their companions daily it is the same the people turn a different face to the heralds than they do to one another they talk of different things and so when i say that there are places in valdemar that a herald cannot go this is why if the crown would know what the people speak of when the crowns greatest mystery is not before them in a glory of blue leather and silver bells it must send other eyes i must go it has been twenty years since shavanne and i rode over these roads on circuit the bells that ring out my journey now are copper and brass twined about my walking staff i walk everywhere now i could not bear to ride when i returned to the collegium after shavanne was killed everyone said i would be chosen againit was only to be expected it was the last thing i wanted for months after i was well in body i wandered the halls of the collegium soulsick and perhaps halfmad at the death of my lady heart everyone said that too would pass in time my soul would heal even my fellow heralds those few who knew what it was to survive the death of that which should survive both death and age said i would love and be loved again i had no desire for that shavanne had been life and joy to me i could see no purpose in accepting anything less and i could imagine nothing more perhaps it would have been different if i had possessed one of the great gifts or even a powerful one but i had no more than minor mindspeech and perhapsno one was every quite surea trace of empathy enough to hear shavannes voice and with her death even that was gone i did not miss it i knew that she of all beings would not wish me to squander my life in vain regrets and hopeless yearnings and i tried to honor what i knew were her wishes the anger at my lossvaldemars lossfaded and even the bitterness in time but no one chose me and it was a relief when a year had passed i knew it was time to take up my service to the crown once more in whatever fashion i could the kings own had shown me the way there are places in valdemar that a herald cannot go i had all a heralds training and loyalties but i was not precisely a herald i put off my white leathers for a coat of motley and took up my belled staff paynim the tinker was welcome everywhere in valdemar my father had been a tinsmith we both thought when i was chosen that my apprenticeship in his shop had been for nothing how wrong we both had been a tinker can find work anywhere and stay as long or as short a time as he pleases he need carry with him no more than the tools of his trade and no one is surprised when he wanders on i wandered where i was senteven into hardorn and karseand in twenty years i had crossed and recrossed valdemar a dozen times where there was need of a herald all white leather and silver bells i sent for one where merely sending a report back to haven was wanted i did that too i quickly learned the circuit of every herald it was easy to pass messages and receive orders my friends kept my secrets as i wished and as the years accumulated fewer and fewer that i met knew that i once wore the white it is more comfortable that way if they wonder who i am and why they bring me messages and take my reports away they do not ask herald niniyel and companion teroshan had brought me a message there are many fairs and market days throughout the warm dry months and heralds and tinkers both attend many of them the message was an odd and improbable one but it is my task to turn the unlikeliest of rumors into hard truth and until i have seenor not seenwhat i have been sent to see i do not waste my time wondering about it in advance a wise man never needs to borrow trouble since fools give it away free as my father always told me yet this time i did wonder out of season for the message herald niniyel had brought me said there was a witch in the armor hills that alone was reason enough for me to go since vanyels time there has been no magic in valdemar the mindgifts of herald and healer are not sorcery as they use the term beyond our borders but lately that has changed there is even a mage college in haven now though it is new and i have never seen a brown robe on my wanderings but the world is filled with wonders that i have not seen with my own eyesa karsite captain with a companion for example but it is a byword of the bards that the memory of the common folk is longer than any history and so the country folk have never ceased to speak of witches when they encounter anything uncanny a fortnight and more of steady walking lay between me and my destination but it was summer a good time to walk the roads the armor hills are north of the east trade road they are not so distant from haven as many other places but sumpost and boarsden are the nearest villages and they are not large to the north iftel is their border on the east hardorn i had been told that the witch of the armor hills was said to be a woman grownthat in itself was odd for notable gifts generally appear first in childhood further it was said that all the armor hills paid her tribute for she had the power to call a mans soul out of his body which is a power that could not be explained by a misunderstanding of any of the mindgifts i knewso perhaps the tales i chased were true and what i sought was indeed a witch at first there was nothing for me to see it was difficult enough to find the people themselves for the armor hills is a wild and unforgiving place and the houses of its folk are scattered and hidden the people there subsist by hunting and trapping and gathering the bounty of the wild for though i saw many small gardensonce i had found the peoplei had also quickly discovered that everything that is not up is down it is impossible to find a level tract of land to plow or plant it is an article of faith with those who dwell there that the land is too poor to take a crop but i saw no sign of that the small gardens flourished and the woods and sharpcut narrow valleys that i trudged through were lush with growth i mended pots gossiped idly and listened more than i talked a moonturn passed as i wandered from house to house i had visited such remote places before and knew better than to ask questions lest i give offense but soon i was accepted so far that one nights host would give me good directions to the next place that might have need of my services and i no longer had to search out each house by myself people began to talk freely in my hearing giving little thought to me as i sat over my fire in the dooryard wrestling a cracked pot into working order or repairing an old skillet that must have lost its handle in king roalds reign that was when i first heard folk speak of the moonwoman who else but she could be the creature i sought they said she was the offspring of a companion and a herald i took no offense at hearing that the common folk say odder things of us they said her hair was as white as a companions tailthat at least was a thing nearly possible they said she could see the inmost thoughts of man woman or child and could send their spirit from their body into light or darkness calling it back at her whim to placate her they gave her anything she asked for when she walked among them these things did not sound at all encouraging but what mattered most to me was that they said she would be at midsummer meeting there i could see herif she was in fact a fleshandblood woman and not simply a tale of the hillsand judge for myself for myself whether she had allor anyof the powers claimed for her it took more work than i had imagined to gain an invitation to midsummer meeting i had imagined hearing the hill folk speak of it that it was simply their version of one of the season fairs so common elsewhere in valdemar and so a tinker would surely be welcome in fact it bore more in common with a religious gathering or a mustering of clans midsummer meeting was where marriages were celebrated babies acknowledged and those who had died in the previous twelvemonth named trading went on as well and music dancing and fine eating but the true purpose of midsummer meeting was the exchange of information among the hill households and a chance for a young hill son or hill daughter to meet someone from several valleys away but outsiders were not forbidden to attend meramay was a young widow plump and blonde who had taken a shine as the saying there went to me i had stayed with her ten days together walking out each day in search of work and returning at nightfall adding my days payment in eggs or honeycomb or freshkilled rabbit to meramays larder in truth she could use all that i brought for she lived entirely alone and to take a living from the hills was a constant round of hard work best shared by many strong backs i dealt with her honestly telling her that i was lowland bred and born and would be moving on before the seasons turned still there was comfort to be given and taken she told me flatly the first night i stayed with her that she hoped to get a child with me as she was seeking a new husband at midsummer meeting and as in many places a womans fertility was a far more attractive quality than her chastity it was she who invited me to accompany her to midsummer meeting she wished to show off her current bedmate to her prospective suitors much as a farmer would show the bull when selling the calf i had long since outlived false pride and so i was happy to say i would go with her i only hope moonwoman doesnt take against me meramay told me matteroffactly she doesnt like a lighthaired girl and no mans going to cross her you might darken your hair i said casually though my heart was beating fast this was the first time anyone had spoken of moonwoman directly to me the herbs are easy to find after all meramay shook her head decisively thatd be the same as lying and they say she hates a liar worse than death and poison she can see right into a bodys heart too there was no changing meramays mind though i did wonder why if she feared moonwoman so much why she was taking the risk of bringing an outsider to midsummer meeting she did take the precaution of tying up her hair in a brightly colored scarf before we set out apparently simply hiding her hair didnt count as lying and so we began meramay carried a pack heavier than my own and traveled besides with a cart drawn by one of the enormous brownandblack dogs which are the usual beasts of burden in these hills pulling carts and sometimes carrying packs themselves it took us three days to reach the place where midsummer meeting was to be held but i had long since decided for myself that everything in the armor hills was three days walk from everything else most of it spent climbing one side of a hill and falling down the other as we walked i did my best to gain more information from meramay about the mysterious moonwoman meramay said she had been here for always but moonwoman had not been at last years midsummer meeting nor had word reached haven of her before the spring so i did not think that could be so i was growing increasingly uneasy with what i heard of her meramay had never seen her but she certainly feared her on the third day just as we reached the meeting grounds i found out why was her took my man meramay said as simply as if she were remarking on the fine summer weather or the flowers growing by the side of the trace saw him out walking of an evening and followed him home then she sang him out of my bed willhe nillhe and that was that this was the first time anyone had mentioned music in connection wit the witch i was seeking did moonwoman have bardic gifts no proper bard would use his or her powers so i was not even certain that bardic empathy could so thoroughly compel someone against their will certainly not the gift of an untrained bard i would have questioned meramay further though it was a chancy thing to do save for the fact that we had arrived at meeting home it was the closest thing to a proper town that i had yet seen in the armor hills though it must lie deserted most of the year there were dance floors open to the air platforms of raised wood planks where even now groups of dancers whirled stamped and spun to the sounds of drums and dulcimers and even a few roofs without walls where groups of hill women clustered together talking and sewing and keeping a weather eye on the youngest children meeting home filled an entire valley and its floor was surely the largest flat space id seen since id arrived here at one end of the valley there were a row of hearths a great openair kitchen flanked by tables enough to fill the dining hall at the heralds collegium i wondered then why i should think of that for memories of the collegium belonged to a life i had long since left behind me they had nothing to do with the life paynim the tinker led though the meeting did not properly begin until the following night the whole of the valley was already filled with bright clothes and bright colors the sounds of music and the smells of good cooking there were more people here than i had seen so far in my entire visit to the hills and meramay assured me that more would arrive before the meeting days began tomorrow night with the acknowledgment of the new children born in the past year as i followed meramay across the meadow to help her unload her cart i saw unharnessed cart dogs lying everywhere basking in the sunlight with meramay to make my introductions i was welcomed without trouble and set myself up near those who had brought things to trade i soon had as much work as i could fairly handle not much of my payment was in coin there was little way i would be able to carry the bulkiest of the goods away with me but i might well be able to trade them for smaller and more portable itemsor for more costly things that i could fairly use such as a new shirt a hat or a pair of breeches more people arrived as the day waned and that night there was a feast the like of which i had rarely experienced followed by dancing that would go on i was assured until dawn the dances of the armor hills are complicated ones and after stumbling through a few sets i excused myself and sat with those who wereto hear them tell itolder and wiser when the ale jugs began to pass i began to hear more of the moonwoman half of what i heard i discounted immediately for not even the sorcerers of karse and iftel could do such things as were claimed for moonwomanor if they could do one they surely could not do the whole thus i did not think she could truly turn men into wolves and women into deer nor ride the wind invisibly nor strike people dead with a touch if she could do even a tenth of what was claimed of her she would have been a greater mage than vanyel the good and i thought that unlikely what was plain to hear however was that the people of the armor hills feared her greatly and would not cross her though she took not only goods from their houses but young men as well none of whom had ever been seen again i heard further that she was never seen beneath the light of the sun which only increased the awe in which she was held the awe and the fear it was fear perhaps that had kept them from petitioning for a heralds services before now in truth i did not know i heard as much admiration of moonwoman as i did anything else though only a fool would think he would hear honest and open criticism of one whom they felt wielded such power such reticence was in fact one of the very reasons i walked the roads for awe and fear are close cousins and neither is the sister of truth it was plain that i had much to report to alberich but i could not leave just yet i would have no good reason to give for my sudden departure besides i had not yet seen the woman and there is a saying in the taverns along the exiles road that truth is to tale as the worm to the fish one may easily be swallowed up by the other on the first day of the meeting disaster struck though at first meramay and i both thought it to be a blessing several of the families that arrived brought strangers with them in each case the story was the same they had been found wandering nearby with no memory of who they were or how they had come to be where they were the families that had found them led them around to those who cooked and those who traded for these were usually the elder men and women of their households and might have the best chance of naming them of course i could be no help in identifying them perhaps if shavanne had still been with me but not now that they all came from the armor hills was plain the folk there whether blond or dark have a strong look of one another and all were within a few summers of the same age i returned to my work turning over in my mind what could have caused this a few moments later i heard meramay scream loud enough to be heard over the sound of my own hammering i dropped my tools at once and ran for her side garan paynim its garan ceile joard maganits garan she was laughing and crying and hugging the neck of one of the men he looked bewildered but polite elsewhere i heard similar glad outcries as lovers and kin claimed those without memory moonwoman sang him away and now hes back she added when i had been a herald i could sense the tenor of emotion in the towns and villages i passed through it required no mind gift to do so shavanne had assured me only experience and plain common sense as a tinker i had not noticed such things any longer and came to the conclusion that i had felt it before because everyone had been focused upon one thing me and i did not feel it later since no one pays any attention to a wandering craftsman or if they do it is in ones and twos and not everyone in the town at once but now once more i felt it and as if i still wore whites i could read the ripples of emotion as easily as a fisherman can read the ripples in a stream for meramay to speak moonwomans name aloud was bad enough to say what she had donein fact to accuse moonwoman of doing somethingwas far worse even though no one moved from where they stood i felt their displeasure and i was not surprised when they began to drift away and move their goods away until soon meramay was standing alone even garan felt it he made graceful apologies to meramay saying he had to get his family settled in but still he left he had been sung away nearly five moonturns ago after all and the people who had taken him in were all the family he knew she gazed at me eyes wide and hurt and frightened just beginning to be afraid i knew then that we must leave at once for the sort of sullen anger she had roused was the sort i had seen flare to violence more times than i could count but she swore she would not leave without garan that he would not be taken from her twice i mustered every good argument i could think of in vainthat she knew now where he was and that he was safe that she did not wish to kindle one of the stubborn grudges that might smolder for generations in a small enclave beginning for a cause as trivial as a misheard greeting that garan would return to her when he had gotten a chance to thinkbut she would not go whether because it was impossible for her to leave midsummer meeting or because it was impossible for her to leave garan i did not know i dared not press her too hard lest she turn against me and order me from the meeting i would not go in any event and i thought she would need my help soon i was more right than i suspected the shunning of meramay that had begun when she had spoken those fatal words grew like the lake ripples from a thrown stone until her face was as grim as my own no one wished her assistance at their cookstove nor to add the dishes she had prepared to their communal table but she was proud and stubborn and still she would not leave we sat alone together i making my whole meal of the eggs and vegetable pies that were to have been her contribution to the feast and meramay too miserable to eat at all i had expected the dancing to resume after supper though the trading and bargaining over knives and axheads cloth and livestock was over for the day but instead of pipes and drums and fiddles as the sun set over the valley and twilight filled it the only sound i heard was that of a lone and distant gittern in my home village we play the twelvestring gittern only though the sixstring is the more common instrument in most of the kingdom for it is easier to learn and to play well i recognized the faint silvery ringing of the doublestringed gittern long before i saw the singer she came walking down the valley glowing like the full moon itself in the twilight and if you had never seen a companion you would surely think that the hair that fell loose and rippling to her waist was as white as its coat and i thought i must know what she was or half of it when i was a student at haven a child was brought to the healers college for treatment young jaxons skin and hair were as white as moonwomans and the bright light hurt his eyes terribly i had seen the boy arrive and asked the healers what might be wrong with him master tiedor told me that like some animals the boy had been born without color in his skin or hair and none of the healing arts could cure that or lend strength to his eyes in animals healer tiedor told me the uncolored state does not cause weak eyes but humans who are so afflicted cannot see in bright sunlight at all the healers were able to help with tinted lenses for jaxons eyes lotion for his skin to heal the effects of the sun and calm matteroffact advice to his parents though his parents had been hoping for a cure when they came to haven this was no disease just a different way of being born and to change it was beyond a healers skill so must it be with moonwoman the people all turned toward her like flowers to the sun and i felt a strong prickle of warning though as yet she had done nothing but pick out a tune upon the gittern a lullay i had heard many of the women sing here it is written in a minor key filled with sadness and longing like so many of the old songs but now the sweet tune seemed to contain anger as well i felt it prickle across my skin and i wished longingly for some weapon but i had nothing more than an eating knife and my belled staff many of the men with whom i had shared ale last night had fallen into step behind her and from all around men and women drifted toward her in little groups following as she paced slowly down the length of the valley some carried torches plucked up from around the dancing floors to light their way and then moonwoman opened her mouth and sang to this day the experience seems unreal to me her words were of a father who has gone away hunting to feed his family and will never return but the meaning had nothing to do with the words in haven i had once been privileged to listen to a master bard enchant a whole hall of folk in just this way standing upon a stage with a harp in his armsbut it was his audience that was his instrument but the emotions bard ronton had conjured in audience were mild and peaceful compared to the killing rage i sensed building in the people around me in a minuteor two at mostit would crescendo into violence and i could already guess its target if we dared to run we would only conjure the inevitable up faster meramay stood beside me too terrified by what she too knew was about to happen to fall beneath the musics spell the musicand the musician by now the mob was close enough that i could see the singers face clearly tears glittered in her pale eyes and her face was set in a white mask she was as terrified as meramay i could not let this happen though i died trying to prevent it as shavanne had died swept downstream by floodwaters her body battered against the rocks along the way until she was impaled on a submerged tree branch that ended her glorious life as surely as a tedrel spear we had nearly been safely across the river risking the crossing because villagers downstream had to be warned about the flood but the bridge ropes had been rotted through with age and it had collapsed under our weight shavanne had nearly gotten us both to safety even so but the far bank was watersodden earth and it had collapsed beneath her hooves when she tried to climb it she had spent the last of her strength throwing me to safety but doing so had pitched her back into the water i had felt each moment of her struggle to live i had heard her dying scream i would not again fail to save a life not here and not tonight i willed moonwoman to hear me as i stepped into her path and shouted with all my might both in mindspeech and with my voice to stop what she was doing was our only chance the people she had englamoured could not be reasoned with nor would they feel they were acting in anything but selfdefense someone threw a rock it struck me in the shoulder too small and flung from too far off to do more than sting but in that moment i knew despair and felt death step near yet i would not surrender nor flee for i was a herald still in my heart even though no one could see i had never ceased to be a herald stop i shouted again and this time i felt shavanne add her strength to mine power roared through my veins like the waters of that longago flooded river this was the mindspeech such as i had never wielded it strong enough to match moonwomans own gift enough for all about me to hear she flung back her head as if i had struck her with a hand of flesh the gittern fell from her hands and she swayed falling at last to her knees and burying her face in her hands weeping all around me the hill folk roused coming out of the trance into which she had sung them they gazed from moonwoman to me with looks of awe though i knew how quickly that would change to both fear and anger the sorceresss power over them was broken at lastand they would quickly hate what they had lately fearedbut they had no idea how i did the night wind brought me the sound of phantom silver bells now at last i leave you beloved be well i knew now how i had lived through my terrible bereavement and why i had never been chosen again why should a herald with one companion have another in all the years i had walked the roads of valdemar shavanne had never left my side and in the one moment when i truly needed her she was there perhaps it is not possible perhaps her presence in my mind was no more than an illusion nurtured by longdelayed grief perhaps my mindspeech was so powerful for lying dormant all those years but i know what i believe i did not wait for the folk of the armor hills to know their own minds but took moonwoman away with me while they still wondered and argued among themselves i stayed only to gather up my pack and to borrow meramays hooded cloak from her the goods i had gotten in trade here would be a fair bargain for it and i knew that moonwoman would not be able to stand the light of the sun upon her skin and we would be traveling many days beneath the light of the sun i would be returning to haven for the first time in many years for i needed to give my charge personally into the hands of healers and bardsand there was certainly no safety for her in the armor hills now even if she had wished to stay along the way she learned to trust me and told me her story her true name was liah she had been born in these hills nineteen summers ago in a remote cabin similar to many i had stopped at during my visit here her parents andren and colmye were simple folk who knew little of the world beyond their hills and believed less they had thought their daughters milkwhite skin and hair must be some sort of judgment upon them and when the sickly child was painfully burned by the sun they became certain she was a curse for what else would take injury from the sun source of all good andren blamed his wife of course denying that the child was his i well knew the madness of grief even though his fear and anger had led to suffering for so many others i could understand why andren had acted as he had done even though i could not excuse it andren put it about at the next midsummer meeting that colmyes child had died no one doubted his tale colmye never attended another meetingwhether she would have endorsed his story to her own mother even liah does not know andren never ceased to reproach his wife for giving birth to a moonchild though he never raised a hand to her or to liah liah grew toward maturity seeing no one but her parents her father hated and feared her her mother shattered in spirit retreated into a world of music it was her mothers gittern liah had been playing that night her gift manifested violently as the great gifts often do one night the smoldering anger she felt against andren boiled over she sang him all her hatred and despair with the life she led until he fled the cabin into the night in the morning her mothers screams awoke her she helped her mother cut her father down from the branch on which hed hanged himself after that i think liah lost all hope she knew she had caused her fathers death therefore all that he said of her must be true she knew that she had the power to impose her will upon those around her with a song and she had used her power to kill her mother followed her father into death a scant few years later wasted away with madness and grief though i do not think liah caused that death save indirectly she blamed herself for it as welland she blamed the hill people who had not come to her mothers aid though by the time liah had eighteen summers behind her i do not know if many of them remembered andren and colmye at all and none knew that there was a child in loss in fear in rage liah tried to become all that her father had thought she was she found that people would believe anything that she sang to them and had used that single power to create a fantastic monster of herself the men that she lured from their wives she compelled to forget their families and even their own names and sent them wandering through the hills even she was not sure why perhaps garin and the others could be healed and their memories restored healers would have to go to the hills to try to undo the damage liah had done healers and heralds and teachers as well life in the armor hills would change perhaps for the better liah would need healing as well and training she must accept what she had done and move beyond it sometimes healing takes a very long time i am not too proud to say that i am proof of that for anger and grief take strange forms and can be stubborn enough to defeat the strongest healer yet if the heart is strong time heals all in the end in trevale i

currently working on an adventure time travel novel with eric flint her three musketeer mysteries are upcoming under the name sarah dalmeida jacona stank in the heat of a summer night the stenches melded mingled and rolled onto rees senses like a physical assaulta cloying staleness of dinners the acrid bite of wood smoke the offensive punch of middens and animals and offal of human sweat and too many bodies living too close together ree remembered when the smell didnt bother him he rememberedand shook his head and tried to forget the new talents had their uses right now he could smell a collection of unfamiliar scents leather sweat and steel a patrol approaching silently he slipped back into the shadows of his refuge the abandoned warehouse behind him it had been deserted since last winter when the magic failed all that remained now was a maze of rotting timber and fallen stone unfit for human life which did not bother ree he had not been human since the magic storms one of the disturbances had caught him a few days after the magic went bad he had been stalking a sleek rat that would have given him meat for a day the rat had found an old cat waiting to die ree had pounced on the rat as it gave the cat an experimental nip lurking in the shadows he shivered despite the heat of the night as he remembered the blurriness and the queasy feelingas he remembered opening his eyes to a different world a different self to a self equipped with cat claws and rats tail with cat eyes too sensitive to movement and keen in the darknessto a short coat of fur over his whole body the fur had helped him survive the winter his keener senses helped him avoid the patrols and the soldiers who killed hobgoblins like him at least hed been lucky so far but it was getting harder ever since the snow began to melt there had been more and more patrols ree was the last of the street rats who sheltered in the ruined warehouse the humans had been caught and taken off to orphanages or work gangs and the hobgoblins had been killed for all he knew he was the only hobgoblin left in jacona how long could he go on surviving voices drifted to his ears they had a strange accent not like the regular patrol and yet they still smelled military ree tensed and breathed shallowly the area around his refuge had been empty at night ever since emperor melles had declared a curfew so the hobgoblin patrols would not accidentally kill anyones registered changechildren ree scrambled up through the debris until he could peer out from one of the many holes in the roof outside in the dark night his changed eyes could see strangers soldiers real soldiers at least no city patrol ree had ever seen would dress in gray city patrols believed in bright colors as a way of showing how important they were the army believed in efficiency gray clothes and actually doing their jobs ree held his breath soldiers were bad news he ducked back into the dark before he reminded himself that only his changed sight allowed him to see them and to hear them as they drew nearer cant believe no ones torn this dump down even for firewood one of the soldiers laughed ree could not see which one there were five all burly and looking wellfed everthing round heres army property now anyhow aint no one was gonna go through all that crap last winter just to steal a bit of firewood off of army land an icy fist clenched around rees gut he bit his lip to avoid calling out the army was efficient efficient at killing hobgoblins and undesirables at rounding up street rats for the work gangs more like they didnt want to meet the rats said another man every brat thats been picked up in this sector knows the rat hole they moved in close enough to be hidden by the walls of the building only the sound of their breathing the sound of their movements told ree they were still there and coming closer and closer ree stayed where he was frozen his hands reached back to find support against a wall that was mostly crumbling rubble he felt the dryness of plaster against his palms surely they would not enter his refuge this place wasnt safe for humans for him and for the rest of the citys discards it was home gah filthy vermin squeaks and skittering joined the soldiers curse as rats fled the noise a boot scraped in the rubble they had come in rees chest hurt his mind became a blank space filled with fear part of himthe part of him at the back of the mind the part of him that was not fully human not fully himself wanted to run to hide but his working mind his memories knew better to run meant to call attention to himself it meant death the soldiers came closer a spot of light danced erratically on the skewed beams near rees head one of the soldiers had unshielded a night lantern though ree knew he could not be seen from the ground he had to fight the urge to run to escape to hide in a hole and be safe heart pounding he waited until the lantern was lowered and its light aimed away from his hiding place slowly he crept out of his hiding place balancing his feet on crossed beams he shifted quickly feeling the slight shift of the wood beneath him and leaping before the minimal movement turned to a rolling fall he skipped and tiptoed and leaped till he reached a hole barely big enough to let a slim ratboy through stretching his arms up to the hole he balanced on one foot as he lifted himself by the strength of his arms the log rolled beneath him and a shower of rubble trickled beneath up there the light of the lantern hit ree ree pulled himself up pushing his head through the hole he had to escape to get away from the light away from discovery outside quick it cant get far ree squirmed through the gap pulling himself on his aching arms feeling the jagged edges of the hole scrape his furcovered body quick a soldier shouted beneath ree skidded down the sloping roof twisting around to get his feet under him a second from a precipitous fall he managed to jump onto the next building for a heartstopping moment he hung in the air then his fingers latched onto the wooden eaves of the building across the lane his claws extended instinctively and dug into the wood his feet scrabbled for a hold he heard shouts behind him strength he didnt know he possessed infused him he pulled himself onto the steepsloped roof scrabbling up it he panted his heart hammered in his chest his throat ached with dryness at the top he held on his claws fully extended biting into the agesoftened wood he eased himself down the shingled roof his chest hurt he swallowed once twice trying to summon moisture onto his panicparched tongue hed survived he was alive but he was alone and unprotected where would he go now the abandoned warehouse had been the closest thing he had ever had to a home well the closest thing since his mothers home ree banished memories of a beautiful woman dressed in silksof perfumed roomsof her laughing her laughter had never been for him nor had there been any true joy in it it had been a sham deployed in the service of the men who paid her and more often than not ree was locked out of her rooms while she entertained clients until ree blinked to clear his burning eyes his mothers home had never been home his mother had never been a true mother and besides that was all done and over with that was the other ree the humanthe boy the clawless furless creature who was as nothing to this ree he swallowed hard wishing moisture away from his cheeks he was no weak human not anymore he would not cry he would think the warehouse could not be the only available shelter in this town he had to lose the soldiers and then he could think about what to do next at least climbing down to the ground was easy streets here were swept at least once each day by one of the work gangs with his night vision ree could scamper through them as if it were full daylight he hardly thought about where he was going and perhaps that was for the best if he had nothing in mind and just turned on whim the soldiers would find it harder to follow him it would be harder to anticipate random movements their voices grew fainter till even his enhanced hearing could hardly pick them at all ree breathed deeply it was working as he came to a narrow lane between overarching buildings he slowed down and looked around his mad turnings had brought him to one of the tenement districts where the shabby buildings leaned so close to each other they almost touched above the lane black alleys barely wide enough for a hand cart separated the buildings the sun never reached the mud beneath he lifted his feet off the dismal muck and sighed he needed to pick his way more carefully now he had already trodden in more than enough to leave a scent trail even a human could follow lifting his foot he shook off the worst of the filth these lanes had never been paved they went from ice in winter to mud in summer and since the magic died they had more than just mud and ice in them he had been born somewhere like this hed played in these streetsor walked forlornly along themwhen his mother locked him out of her rooms ree crept slowly through the darkness listening listening his enhanced hearing picked up the sounds of people in their houseswhispers conversations a sleeper turning in bed a child crying forlornly smells seeped over the everpresent stink of waste a hint of stew that made his stomach growl reminding him that he had not eaten since last night old beer rancid as it mingled with older straw in the closed alehouses unwashed humans ripe with sweat from days of work in the summer heat acrid smoke from cooking fires the smells were signs of life in the darkness but the streets themselves were almost deserted this area had once bustled day and night but since the curfew no one wanted to risk a crossbow a shadowed figure in darkness could be mistaken for a hobgoblin and who was going to say the soldier who fired the crossbow hadnt thought he was killing a monster certainly not the dead person the quiet felt wrong to ree ominous even though he could never go out among humans again ree wanted to know people were still out there on the streetsfeasting fighting flirting people on the streets meant things were normal again and normal meant that people would fear hobgoblins less and not hunt a young street rat constantly making his life a living hell he walked down the street listening listening for the sounds that told him at least people were still living in their houses still safe he felt a nostalgia for that life hed never had for that life that would never be hisfor a family and a quiet snug home where he could turn in his bed pull the covers over his head and be safe his ears reaching for the sounds of normalcy picked up marching marching feet his fur rose in hackles on his neck marching footsteps came from farther up the lane he stopped then darted into the nearest alley what the someone said near him panicked ree spun to the unexpected voice a hulking shape loomed out of the blackness as the marching feet grew closer a hand closed around his neck rees claws came out he squirmed scratching out with hands and feet to make the human in the army uniform let go he had to he had to defend himself to force the human to leave him be he somehow wrapped his body around an arm that seemed thicker than his chest his feet kicking at the mans neck the hand let go ree tumbled to the ground gasping the dead weight of his attacker fell on him almost flattened him was the man dead had ree killed him there was a trickle of something warmsoft onto his neck some liquid oh he could smell well enough the sharp metallic tang of blood but he didnt want it to be blood he didnt want to have killed someone oh not the first time never the first time but ree didnt want to kill he didnt want every time he killed someone every time his instinctsno the rats instincts or the cats took over and killed a human ree felt that hed become a little less human eventually his humanity would be all gone drained away he had lost too much humanity already blood trickled onto his neck draining away the mans life and ree wanted to stand to squirm to flee but the marching steps approached and he held his breath and hoped hoped they would pass without pausing closer he could hear their breaths and smell the individual men not moving ree felt blood fall on him felt the man shudder stop breathing along the main alley the marching steps passed away slowly slowly ree remained still holding his breath when the silence had lasted long enough ree dug his claws into the mud of the alley and pulled himself from beneath his attacker his muscles seemed to have gone to water his movement was too slow too slow im just tired thats all tired give it a little while pulling away from beneath the dead weight he took deep breaths his nostrils filled with the smell of blood and filth he stared at the man he had killed shaking as he realized what it meant dangerous hobgoblin theyll hunt me down and kill me there could be no doubt the dead man had been killed by a hobgoblin human murderers did not leave claw marks clear across their victims throats he heard a sound a breath it came from behind him he paused shocked he was not alone ree froze terror rising to choke him someone had seen him kill the man he felt as if his lungs filled with freezing air someone there was someone the person would call for help and he would be killed like an animal like the animal he was hed killed someone with his claws with his hed killed out of sheer panic the soft muffled sound came from deeper in the alley for a moment ree trembled on the edge of fleeing then he recognized the smell that lurked beneath the blood and worse aw crap not that he turned slowly half dreading what he would see half expecting it he stumbled in the direction of the breathing in the direction of the smell the boy lay in the muck it was hard to say how old he would be younger than ree but not by much he was all human but he had the hollow youngold look all the street rats got sooner or later seen too much ree thought felt too much it was the gag and the way he had been tied up with his ragged pants that made rees gut churn aw crap you poor thing he fell to his knees besides the boy he saw the momentary panic in the youths eyes and then an odd sort of relaxation resignation as if hed given up the fight and consigned himself to anything fate wished to throw at him as if the worst possible thing the boy could imagine had happenedand now something worse loomed ree could well imagine what he looked like to this stranger this shocked stranger how would he have felt in the old days if a monstrosity with rat fur and broad green cats eyes knelt by him touched him gently ree reached for the knots just the knots every movement deliberate and slow still the boy closed his eyes and tensed the knots were so tight it hurt rees hands to work them free he would not use his claws to tear through the thin fabric likely these were the only pants the boy owned the gag was a little easier although when rees eyes adjusted and he saw the bloody marks from a beatingprobably administered with a roughedged beltetched on the boys shoulders and face his claws nearly came out anyway he stifled a hiss the boy opened his eyes they were very large and sky blue and looked at ree with startled surprise slowly the boy reached down and gingerly touched his wrist with his other hand he blinked at ree what he started and swallowed and his expression changed to one of gratitude ree felt queasy he hadnt killed the man to rescue the boy he had killed in an animal panic gently ree held out the boys clothes but the boy was swaying on his feet and looked dazed and ree sighed he dressed the boy as if he were a small child and the boy let him by the time the boy was dressed ree realized he couldnt leave him here not like this not alone and dazed and hurt but ree had nowhere to go and if anyone saw him especially with the dead man in the alley the dead man killed by a hobgoblin if the boy refused to turn ree in they would hurt him they would hurt him more ree swallowed you know this part of town he asked the boy nodded i squat three blocks down he hesitated as though he wanted to give ree some kind of title call me ree and lets go you gotta rest up and we dont want no one finding us as they approached a rickety tenement building the boy looked over his shoulder at ree i live there he said in the attic ree nodded not knowing what else to say the boy looked longer as if waiting for an answer my name is jem he said jem ree repeated and jem smiled a brief startling smile that made him look of a sudden much younger and much too old he turned away and walked fast ahead of ree a new spring in his step he took ree up a steep crooked staircase that climbed partway outside the building then he climbed up to the attic a space made usable by some enterprising street rat jems meager belongings sat in a neat pile by the hole in the roof jem had used as an entry despite his injuries despite being human he climbed nearly as well as ree ree bit his lip no point feeling jealous jem was all human he could do odd jobs for a copper coin or get himself ration chits ree had no such advantages but it was ree who was unhurt and jem who was ready to pass out get yourself down sos i can clean you up he said jem nodded his eyes too big for his thin face never once left rees face as he lay down but there was no mistrust in that look no fear how can you look at something like me and not fear i aint going to hurt you any moren i can help ree said roughly that big bastard cut you up good and its gotta get cleaned up or youll get sick he had seen what happened to wounds that were not cleaned he knew the putrid wounds the fever no one deserved to die like that jem swallowed but he still watched as ree dipped a rag into the water bucket when ree touched the rag to one of jems bloody welts the boy gasped and clenched his fists into his hair ree supposed that hurt less he tried to be gentle but he had never tried to mend anyones hurts before he was better at killing he flinched from the thought but looking at jems wounds he could not summon up as much regret as he wished he just hoped the big bastard had not torn jem up too bad inside but jem still got sick his fever rose till he burned to the touch and he twisted and talked in his sleep ree stayed with him the rat partthe animal partwanted to go away there was a horror of disease of death death and disease both attracted predators the human part of ree was scared too how could it not be he held onto jems hand through the day and tried to quiet his screams his mumbles tried to still his panics and hoped no one heard no one came what would people think if they found a hobgoblin and a human youth ree talked to him through the day told him silly things sang to him ballads he barely remembered hearingin his mothers house long ago and jem looked at him with wondering blue eyes and never showed fear never fear a twinge of fear from jem a twinge of horror at rees strangeness and ree would have been free to leave free to go in search of a new hideout free to become a wild creature again to forget hed ever been human but jem looked at him with confidence and trust and in his brief moments of lucidity grinned at rees jokes smiled at them or reached for rees hand for reassurance so ree stayed and when he went out at night to refill the water bucket and steal food for them both he always came back perhaps he was fooling himself perhaps he was using jem to make himself feel human but he could not possibly live knowing how jem would feel if he didnt come back the idea of jems betrayal and disappointment was more than ree could bear it would have stripped rees soul bare of what humanity remained so he went and he came back sometimes he caught rats one good fat rat made a meal when he skinned it and cooked it over a tiny fire in the past ree had eaten it raw but jem would have been shocked scared for the sake of jem ree had to be human and eat with human manners as he hadnt since the night the magic had changed him and each time each time out ree feared he would be caught not just for his death but because jem might think hed been abandoned there were more patrols now and searches patrols that came too close for his liking talked about the killer hobgoblin the one whod killed the soldier and how emperor melles himself was offering a whole gold piece for the hobgoblins hide the thought made his stomach go all queasy not all those soldiers would make sure he was dead before they started skinning him and there were worse things jacona had become a rat trap holding jems hand as jem slowly became stronger and more confident ree realized he could not stay in the city like his warehouse it had become a trap the problem was he did not know how he was to escape the work gangs had not just hauled water to cisterns and replaced all the work that used to be done with magic they had built a new wall around the city to keep the hobgoblins out the wall went all the way to crag castle ree had heard and soldiers guarded it all the time jacona was a fortified rat trap no matter how busy the roads were everyone who went through one of the gates was inspected ree had seen the frozen dangling corpse of a merchant who had tried to smuggle his sonturnedhobgoblin out of the city he did not know if the man had died of the hanging or if he had frozen to death ree shuddered at the thought of what the patrols would do to jem if they found them together he did not want to think about it but he had to escape it would be safer for jem if he was just another human with no rat boy to make him a criminal safer for jem to be alone again and safer for ree even though he had no idea what lay beyond the walls of jacona oh he knew there were farms and farmers and roads that went to other cities and he had heard there were wild places where a rat boy might be able to live without humans always hunting him but he had never seen anything outside jacona never been beyond the tenements and warehouses of the poorest districts how could he escape the aqueducts had been broken by the winter storms after the magic began to die the sections near the city walls had been knocked down by the work gangs who built the wall ree had heard that no one knew whenor even ifmagic was going to come back so there had been no reason to keep something that would not be useful without magic he had wondered sometimes if he would eventually change back without magic but that did not seem likely as for the drains ree shuddered the patrols would not go there that was where the changerats and the even weirder hobgoblins had gone the ones that were all teeth claws and poison like the patrols ree did not want to know what had become of them and yet it might be his only chance a slim chance at life as opposed to the sure death that would come to him if they found him in jacona and to jem if they found him sheltering ree but first he had to wait for jem to be well for jem to be well enough to survive on his own youre leaving jem asked he managed to look about two years old and very confused ree nodded jem had stood up two days ago and he looked strong enough to survive strong enough to do whatever he had done before meeting ree why was it that ree could not meet his eyes and found himself looking at the floor as he said stay away from the soldiers jem you are he stopped short of saying that jem was too pretty to be safe he had not thought it not thought it at all the whole time they had been together not consciously not with his rational mind he had not jem was just jem ree looked up and caught a disturbing glimpse of broad blue eyes like a summer sky threatening rain they are not they do not have the restraints of the local patrols they answer to no one jacona will be safer for you without me you could stay here get work that sort of thing jem made a sound it wasnt quite a sigh or quite a sob but it had a bit of both and more of frantic urgency ree looked up dont let jem cry he thought dont let jem cry he is just young and hurt and recovering from a lingering illness his crying meant nothing and yet i dont know if i can bear to watch him cry jem looked like he was trying very bravely not to cry he was biting his lower lip hard dont let him ask me to stay ree thought i cant stay i cant but instead of asking jem whispered my mother left me on the street when i was four she gave me a sweet and said she would come back she never he shook his head ree started to say better than meaning to say better than have your mother sell you to a customer when youre barely thirteen he remembered the fear the frantic humiliation he remembered being told about it being sent to the room he remembered running away for months before hed noticed his mothers customers casting looks at him there were men who didnt seem to care if you were male or female provided you were a young thing whose services could be bought who could not complain there were men who didnt care what they did like that soldier with jem but as he was about to tell jem this ree stopped because all through it hed been afraid jem would follow him jem would come with himthat jem would get caught by the patrols and hung outside the city walls to freeze to death or worse now summer had come and suddenly he wondered if his mother had been afraid of what would happen to ree if one of her customers found him if one of her customers treated him as the soldier had treated jem for the first time he remembered his mothers face that day without flinching and it seemed to him there was concern in her eyes overlaid with a harshness she had put there a false harshness he remembered she hadnt told him who the customer was or anything about him or how much he paid shed told him just enough to make ree run away and be safe ree bit back tears and forced harshness upon his features he stepped close to jem and did his best to growl in his most threatening hobgoblin voice im tired of you youre human and slight and weak i dont want you with me i can travel quicker alone with my fangs and my hobgoblin senses and my claws he saw jem look startled scared and he felt as though his heart were bleeding but he pressed on if you come with me ill kill you like i killed the soldier without waiting to see jems expression to see the further devastation his words had brought to it he turned around he jumped out the windowhe skittered and ran his way to the ground running through the shadows to the abandoned washhouse whose drains fed to the sewers and drains beneath the city he wished he could remember how to cry and he halfhoped a patrol would find him and kill him the washhouse was quiet in shadows no patrols in it more was the pity ree remembered it pretty well from when his mother had come there with him when he was very small he didnt want to think of his mother it hurt even more now he bent to the manhole and prized it open his claws making short work of it he had told jem the truth he would travel faster alone and besides if he got caught he would die alone he was a hobgoblin a thing part animal he had no right to the company of a true human jem would be safer without him ree wondered if there was anywhere he could be safe if a thing like him deserved safety the drains beyond the manhole smelled acridly of old waste ree stared dubiously into the shadows nothing came racing out to eat him ree climbed gingerly down into it rusting steel rungs had been set into the shaft so people had once come down into the sewers that helped he wasnt the first and there would be some way to get around down there it couldnt be all vertical tunnels and precipitously small shafts he hoped there were no guards on the outlets ree listened for anything that might mean an attack all he heard was water dripping trickling and gurgling he smelled more than water even though last nights rain would have washed a lot of the worst away once there had been spells on these drains cleaning them so that only water flowed out at the end of them spells to turn everything else into heavy dark mulch the farmers bought for their fields ree remembered watching them trade for the mulch at last summers fair now everything went out to the river although work gangs had built weirs to catch the worst of the solid stuff the rungs ended leaving rees feet dangling he used his hands to lower himself to the bottom rung and stretched his feet touched solid ground he sighed and let go bit of a drop at the bottom he said and realized jem wasnt there he had got in the habit of talking to jem of relating his actions to him even when he went out alone to hunt he would come home and tell jem everything home when had jems crash pad become home but it wasnt the place it was because jem was there but jem wasnt here jem would never be here again and that was as it should be ree had no right to risk jem no right to he cut the thought off and listened and peered into the darkness this part of the drain was quiet ree saw and smelled nothing animal if there were changefish in the water he had no way to tell with no real idea which way to go ree decided to follow the flow of the water there was a walkway along the side of the drain that must have been built so workmen could get in without having to walk in the water he walked in silence senses straining for a hint of danger there was none once he heard animal squabbling far off whatever made it it was too far distant to be a danger to him when drains joined the one he was in narrow bridges crossed the channels he crossed them following his drain and the water hoping that it would lead to an outlet that would take him out of the city away from jacona if he had not been always listening sniffing for danger it would have been an easy walk he did not know how long he walked or how far darkness and the constant sounds of water played tricks on his senses making it seem that he had been walking forever and sometimes like no time at all had passed apart from the bridges where new drains joined his everything was all the same finally the darkness began to lift ree hurried toward gray eager to be out of the neverending blackness soon light glinted off the water the chilly white light of moonlight ree hurried toward the light then stopped there was something there at the grate waiting for him something big as he drew closer his heart started pounding a hobgoblin had been tethered to the iron grate that sealed the drains it looked looked partly like a snake and mostly like too many teeth its head swung back and forth at the end of its tether as it tried to reach him ree gulped he jumped back his claws all came out but he thought of himselfof how the soldiers would kill him on sight and he did not want to do that to another hobgoblin whose fault was it if he had chanced to be near a snake when the changes came it had not asked to become a hobgoblin any more than ree had you dont have to hurt me he said and his voice came out small and frightened youre like me im like you i mean you no harm slowly he stepped toward the thing toward the grate the eyes amid the teeth glinted he thought with a hint of understanding he thought he was safe and then the creature launched ree just managed to jump out of reach flatten himself against the wall while the things toosharp toomany teeth closed near his bare arm why ree yelled you are nothing like me kittenrat boy snakes eat the likes of you the creature spoke hissingly through its many teeth and my life is spared because im important and i can kill the likes of you vermin ree was pinned against the dank wall moving either way would bring him within reach of the things teeth he could not go out he could not go back he could rush toward death or stay here till he starved he would never see jem again ree flinched from the thought because it was stupid he would never see jem again anyway just then he heard a scream he turned at the same time the snake creature did jem stood in the tunnel away from the snakes reach he had a crossbow and he was screaming a scream of rage through clenched teeth as he pulled the string back on the bow the snake thing tried to jump but it was tethered and it moved a little too late the bolt entered the mouth between the rows of teeth there was a roar and the thing jumped in the air then fell and was still and the smell came ree didnt remember falling on his knees and he didnt remember jem approaching him he had put the bow on his back and he had a quiver with bolts his hands were free he held onto rees upper arms and pulled ree up onto his feet i know you told me to keep away from soldiers but i saw the crossbow right at the entrance to a bar as i was following you he said it was on the floor near a table full of soldiers i only had to go in a couple of steps they never saw me he spoke very quickly as if ree would reproach him for disobeying his orders but rees mind could only hold onto the central fact the central surprise of the last few minutes he looked up into jems big blue eyes the eyes that were looking anxiously at ree you followed me he said jem nodded through the streets and the tunnels you followed me all alone you followed me wherever you go i go jem said ree blinked wondering what he had done to deserve that kind of attention that kind of devotion from someone like jem from someone brave enough to follow a hobgoblin through tunnels infested with worse creatures from someone brave enough to steal from soldiers after what had happened im a hobgoblin he said not human a coward who ran from everything who killed when he was scared when the animal took over nonsense jem said he managed to look sterner more adult youre human ree youre good you saved me without you i would have died i killed the soldier by accident ree said because the rat in me got scared i didnt even know he shook his head he did not want to remember lying under the soldier as he died did not want to remember the blood dripping onto him jem shrugged maybe but no one forced you to free me no one forced you to stay with me to take care of me ree swallowed hard what else could i have done too many memories too many things he wanted to forget the bloody welts on jems body the way he had just given up you could have killed me jem said you could have done what the soldier did despite the years of being hard of showing nothing ree flinched he could never not with anyone who did not want him as much as he wanted them even though weakness was dangerous he could not be angry at himself for flinching for showing emotion jem was safe he could show his true self to jem if jem saw rees weakness he did not show it he pointed at the snake you could have done what he would have done youre human ree and i will follow wherever you go ree shook himself it seemed to him hed been living in a long nightmare and just awakened he edged past the body of the snake thing trying not to look at it he took a deep breath and extended his claws lets get out of here the bars in the grate were set wide to let debris through they should be far enough apart jem nodded to rees relief the grate was wide enough for him to slip through even if he did lose some fur on his shoulders and hips on the way he and jem stumbled out of the river into the moonlight looking at a strange new world that held nothing they knew low rolling hills stretched to the darkness of mountains and the silver moonlight gave it all the look of a ghost land ree sought jems hand at the same time as the boy sought his their hands met warm and moist they stood there a moment rat boy and street rat facing a world of dangers they could not begin to anticipate well ree said finally guess wed better get going got a ways to go and a lot to learn yah jem squeezed his hand got a whole world to find out here they walked into the moonlight all the ages of man by tanya huff tanya huff lives and writes in rural ontario with her partner four cats and an unintentional chihuahua after sixteen fantasies shes written two space operas valors choice and the better part of valor and is currently working on a series of novels spun off from her henry fitzroy vampire series in her spare time she gardens and complains about the weather im too young for this although jors had spoken the words aloud thrown them as it were out onto the wind without expecting an answer he received one anyway so you keep saying doesnt make it any less true you are experienced in riding circuit his companion reminded him all you must do is teach what you know jors snorted and shifted in the saddle so you keep saying gervais snorted in turn then perhaps you should listen im not a teacher you are a herald more importantly you are needed and that was why they were heading northeast out to the edge of their sector to meet with herald jennet and her greenie to accept said greenie from the older herald and finish out the last eleven months of her year and a half of internship the courier whod brought the news of jennets mothers sickness had also brought the news that the herald able to replace her was already in the sector but way over on the other side of a whole lot of nothing it was decided hed start his circuit from there and jennet would backtrack the much shorter distance to meet up with jors the girls name was alyise her companions name was donnel and that was pretty much all jors knew he couldnt remember ever seeing anyone of that name amidst the grays during the rare times hed been at the collegium over the last few years and he only remembered her companion as a longlegged colt the thing was he liked being on the road and he much preferred the open spaces of the borders to any city so he went back on circuit as fast as he could be reassigned that didnt give him much time to learn about the latest chosen and when he did meet up with other heralds he was much more interested in finding out what his yearmates had been doing jennet has got to be ten years older than i am at least and shes a woman strands of the companions mane slid across jors fingers like white silk as gervais tossed his head what does her being a woman have to do with this women are better at teaching girls they understand girls me he rubbed a dribble of sweat off the back of his neck i dont get girls at all you seemed to understand herald erica i remember her continuously agreeing with you continuously agreeing what are you talking about raya and i could hear her quite clearly outside the waystation she kept yelling yes yes yes yes oh ha ha very funny jors could feel gervais amusementthe young stallion did indeed think it was very funny as i recall erica and i werent the only two keeping company that night we were quiet well im sorry we kept you from your beauty sleep and you neednt worry about it happening again for oh about eleven months you do not know that the new herald will find you distasteful raya told me that her herald found you pleasant jors sighed pleasant well he supposed it was preferable to the alternative thank you but thats not the point ill be alyises teacher her mentor i cant take advantage of my position of power you will be heralds together yes but he felt a subtle shift of smooth muscles below him echoed by a definite shift of attention and fell silent inar says we will meet in time for us to return to the waystation outside of applebay before full dark if that was true and jors had no reason to doubt jennets companion they were a lot closer to the crossroad than hed thought he glanced over his shoulder to check on bucky and found the pack mule tucked up close where gervais tail could keep the late summer insects off his face and that was another possible problem mules were mules regardless of who they worked for and mules that worked for heralds could be just as obstinate and hard to get along with as any other theyd be adding a new mule to the mix it was a good thing companions always got along and speaking of why didnt donnel contact you cant he reach this far inar is senior to donnel as you will be senior to his chosen youll be senior to donnel as well then yes sleek white sides rose and fell as gervais sighed jors grinned wishing alyises companion was a mare his grin broadened as it became quite clear that gervais had no intention of answering shes a good kid jennet said glancing over at where the youngest of the three heralds was carefully packing away the remains of the meal theyd shared eager enthusiastic exhausting jors suggested as her voice trailed off a little the older herald admitted with a smile but youre a lot younger than i am you should be able to keep up thats just it im too young to be doing this im no teacher you have doubts he only just managed not to roll his eyes well yes does your companion doubt you gervais jors turned in time to see gervais rising to his feet after what had clearly been a vigorous roll his gleaming white coat flecked with bits of grass gervais has never doubted me then if you cant believe in yourself believe in your companion and now that ive gifted you with my aged wisdom grinning she bent and lifted her saddle wed best get back on the road lifting his own saddle jors fell into step beside her im sorry to hear about your mother yes well she wasnt young when i was born and shes never been what you could call strong so i cant say that im surprised im just glad that the borders are so quiet right now and that there was someone close enough she smiled so gratefully at him that jors felt himself flush two someones close enough inar given his head had disappeared southward almost too fast for the eye to follow one moment he and his herald were a white blur against the gold of summerdried gasses and the next they were gone gone leaving jors alone with alyise alone with an attractive eighteenyearold girl no alone with another herald one he just happened to be responsible for oh havens she is a herald that makes her responsible for herself i was broadcasting gervais snorted donnel probably heard you jors doubted that since donnelwith a fair bit of that longlegged colt in him stillwas dancing sideways away from a bobbing yellow wildflower alyise was laughing probably at something donnel had said their mule right out at the end of its lead rope turned his head just far enough for jors to see that he looked resigned about the whole thing which reminded jors of something hed meant to ask jennet and forgotten no matter alyise would know what had happened to their second mule spike she giggled oh jennet left him back at the waystation supply post saying youd have enough on your plate without having to deal with spike too hes not a pleasant fellow although honestly i think most of its an act and hes really much nicer than he pretends you know jors had no time to answer he suspected she hadnt intended him to as she rattled on without pausing she left a lot of her gear there except for the bits she gave to me i seem to go through soap really really quickly i cant think why i mean were all in whites but if theres something to smudge on ill smudge i may be the only herald ever who really appreciated her grays so jennet gave me her extra soap and a tunic that was getting too tight for heracross the shoulders of course not in front because im well a little better endowed therebut no worry about her being caught short because she didnt leave behind or give me anything shell need because shes heading home but you knew that didnt you because you were there when she left the punctuating smile was dazzling the waystation outside appleby was much like every other waystation there was a corral for the mules a snug leanto for the companions a good sized wellstocked storeroom and a single room for the heralds the biggest difference was that the fireplace had been filled in with a small box stove flattopped for cooking and considerably more efficient at heating the space not to mention therell be a lot less warm air sucked up the chimney jors observed examining the stovepipes this was new since this the last time hed been by i think its less romantic though what alyise smiled as he turned i think a stove is less romantic than an open fire dont you think theres just something so sensual about the dancing flames and the flicking golden light light jors cleared his throat and tried again wed better light the lanterns she pushed russet curls back off her face with one hand gray eyes gleaming in the dusk or instead of lighting the lanterns we could just leave the doors of the stove open and sit together close to the fire fire pardon you light the fire his palms were sweaty in the stove he expanded as she stared at him head cocked so we can cook i have to go check on gervais im fine good he got outside to find his companion standing by the door and gazing at him with some concern shes i mean im supposed to be teaching her donnel says his chosen is glad you are a young man she has been with jennet for seven months hey ive been on my own for eight and thats he paused as gervais snorted yeah sorry way too much information the point is it wouldnt be right if thats how you feel it is good luck oh thats very helpful thank you never let anyone tell you that companions cant be as sarcastic as cats jors muttered to himself as he turned and went back inside the curve of alyises back stopped him cold her pants hung low on the flare of her hips low enough to expose the dimples on the small of her back just under her waist she smiled at him over her shoulder as she pulled a sleeveless tunic out of her pack i just had to get into something that wasnt all sweaty i dont know what it is about spending the day in the saddle that makes me so damp since donnels doing most of the work but from my breast bands right on out everything is just soaked through i guess the good news is that at this time of the year i can rinse them out tonight and theyll be dry by morning unless it rains of course but i dont think its going to theres really no point in having the village laundry deal with them her brow wrinkled as she pushed her head through the tunics wide neck does this village even have a laundry laundry he tried not to stare at the pale swell of her breasts as she pulled the tunic down and turned to light one of the lamps with shaking hands he was not ready for this kind of responsibility men was she allowed to laugh at him there was too much about this mentoring that he didnt know i dont suppose you even noticed she continued slipping out of her pants ah thats better shall you cook or shall i me cooking would be a welcome distraction you can tell me about your time with jennet so i know what youve covered done okay how much of everything everything took them through dinner and into bed separate beds alyise seemed fine with that jors noticed thankfully since he wasnt certain his resolve would stand up against a determined assault long after her breathing had evened out into the long rhythms of sleep he lay staring up at the rough wood of the ceiling and wondered just how authoritarian he was supposed to be all heralds were equals that was a given except when they werent and that was tacitly understood im just not ready for this yet sleep now heartbrother gervaiss mental touch was gentle many tasks seem less daunting in the morning jors woke just after sunrise to discover that alyise had already gone out to feed and water the mules i can never stay in bed after i wake up she explained with a sunny smile my mother used to say its because i was afraid id miss something but i think its because i didnt want to get bounced on by my younger sisters and ill tell you that habit stood me in good stead when i was a gray because you know how hard it is to get going some mornings and the first up has the first shot at the hot water and there were mostly girls in my year six of us and one boy what about yours my when did she breathe your year how many boys and girls in your year oh three boys two girls how nice he heard donnel snort realized she was staring at him and a moment later realized why hed gotten a little panicked when hed seen her bed was empty and raced outside wearing only the light cotton drawstring pants hed slept in with the early morning sun behind him he might as well be naked oh yeah this is going to help me maintain some kind of authority authority does not come from your clothing and that would have been more reassuring had his companion not sounded like he found the entire situation entirely too funny maybe not but it sure doesnt come from it occurred to him that while he was standing talking to gervais alyise was still staring appreciatively ill just go and get dressed well be heading into appleby right after we eat and thank any gods who may be listening for that he thought as he made as dignified a retreat as possible into the waystation appleby wasnt so much a village as it was a market and clearing center for the surrounding orchards that gave it its name jors told the younger herald all he knew about both the area and the inhabitants as they rode in from the waystation but since his available information ran out some distance before they arrived alyise took over the conversation her mother made a terrific apple dumpling but wouldnt give out the recipe no matter how much alyise or her sisters begged donnel was very fond of apples especially the small sweet pink ones that grew farther north she loved apples sliced and dried and hoped shed be able to buy some of last years if they had a moment before they left town her grandfather used to carve apples and dry them whole and they turned into the most cunning old men and women dolls heads just when jors was about to suggest she stop talking she finished her story about how an apple peel taken off in one unbroken spiral would give the initial of true love when tossed over a shoulder and fell silent straightening in the saddle and transforming from girl to herald neat trick why does she need to be anything but what she is when she is with you gervais asked reasonably she doesnt and why do you because im her teacher herald jennet was also her teacher do you think herald jennet behaved differently than herself herald jennet has had more time to be herself jors pointed out gervais tossed his head setting his bridle bells ringing as they passed the first of the buildings you are not herald jennet he said as the first wave of laughing children broke around them thats what i keep saying the companion carefully sidestepped an overly adventurous and remarkably grubby little boy maybe you should try listening and that was all he was willing to say go not to your companion for advice jors sighed for they will tell you to figure it out for yourself judgments in appleby were not surprisingly mostly about apples more surprisingly jors found alyise to be an attentive listenerboth to the petitioners and to him although she deferred to jors as the senior herald she expressed her opinions clearly and concisely when asked for them and in turn asked intelligent questions when she needed more information having been more than a little afraid of what the day would bring jors was impressed and grateful that he could set aside personal doubts and concentrate on the job at hand late that afternoon when theyd finished with official business and had moved on to the more social aspects of being a heraldtrading the gossip that kept the farflung corners of the kingdom telling the same storiesjors glanced over at alyise within a circle of teenage girls and wondered if it counted as a conversation when everyone seemed to be talking at once herald jors he turned to see the eldest of the village councillors holding out a cup of cider dont worry its one of this years first pressings windfall from the early apples it has absolute no trade value so you neednt fear youre being bribed a tentative sip curled his tongue tart he gasped a little young the councillor admitted grinning and if you dont mind my saying you seem a little young yourself to be teaching the ray of sunshine there ive been doing this for a while councillor on the outside jors remained calm and confident inside a little voice was saying oh thats just great its obvious to everyone and alyise is a trained herald im only here to help guide her through her first circuit oh im not criticizing lad and given that ones energy its probably best youre no graybeard i imagine shed be the death of an older man the councillor obviously believed he was sleeping with alyise that was a belief hed have to nip in the bud heralds arent in the habit of taking advantage of their interns advantage the elderly councillor glanced over at alyise and began to laugh so hard he passed a mouthful of cider out his nose oh lad he gasped when he had breath enough to speak again you are young there wasnt a lot jors could say to that you seem fine in the villages gervais pointed out as they headed toward the border its different in the villages jors told him we have welldefined roles and i know what im supposed to do youve always known what to do in a waystation before youve always know what to do with another herald before he glanced over at alyise whod turned to check on the mules ive never been responsible for another herald before his companion sighed and raised his head so jors could get at an elusive itch under the edge of his mane youre beginning to worry me there wasnt a lot jors could say to that either six days later alyise handed him a mug of tea and said is it because you like boys its just that ive been as obvious as i know how without coming right out and saying we should bed down together she explained a few moments later after they cleaned up the mess i mean i was with jennet for seven whole months and youre cute and well its been a while you know he knew your ears are very red she added jors attempted to explain about being responsible and not taking advantage of her while he was in at least a nominal position of power alyise didnt seem to quite understand his point youre a little young to take such a grandfatherly attitude dont you think thats it exactly she wrinkled her nose confused whats it she was adorable when she wrinkled her nose and some of the tea had splashed on her tunic drawing his eye right to maybe you should talk to donnel about it he choked out i need to check the um mules i just checked them i meant the um stores gervais explained to donnel who explained to me and i think i understand the problem alyise smiled at jors reassuringly when he came back inside i was kind of dumped on you unexpectedly wasnt i i mean there you were out riding your circuit just the two of you hearing petitions and riding to the rescue and being guys together and all of a sudden jennet finds out her mother is sick and youve got me i know heralds are supposed to be adaptable and all but this is a situation that could take some getting used to for you so i expect its all a matter of timing good so were um he tried not entirely successfully to pull her actual meaning from the cheerful flow of words her smile broadened were good okay still something felt not quite right gervais he could almost see his companion roll sapphire eyes i dealt with it chosen but let it go not so much advice as an unarguable instruction so jors brought his attention back to the younger herald there were some tax problems in the area were heading for next we should go over them in case they come up again jennet and i ran into a few problems just like this back last month well not just like this because thats one thing ive learned since ive been out is that no two problems are exactly the same no matter how much they seem to be and he let her words wash over him as he pulled the papers from his pack so they were good that was good why did he feel like he was waiting for the other shoe to drop last years tax problems didnt reoccur but new problems arose and jors did his best to guide alyise through them she was better with people than he was and as summer passed into fall he allowed her to hear those petitions that dealt with social problems and tried to learn from her natural charm as she learned from his experience given her unflagging energy and exuberance he felt as though he was running full out to stay ahead of her and he never felt younger or more unsuited for his position as her teacher as when he saw her in the midst of a crowd of admiring young men not that she ever forgot she was a herald on duty it was just just what chosen youre laughing at me again arent you no answer in words just a strong feeling of amusement which was of course all the answer jors needed frost had touched the grass by the time they reached the tiny village of halfrest grown up not quite a generation before around a campsite that marked the halfway point on a shortcut between two larger towns a shortcut only because the actual trade road followed the kind of ground sensible people built roads on rather than taking the direct route more suitable to goats jors had a feeling that without the mule tied to her saddle alyise and donnel would have been bounding like those goats from rock to rock alyise chattering cheerfully the entire time as they skirted the edges of crumbling cliffs the waystation was brandnew the wood still pale and raw looking no corral had been built for the mules but a rope strung between two trees would take the lead lines giving them plenty of room to graze while there was no well the pond looked crystal clear and cold if you have a waystation jors said as they carried their packs inside youre more than just a group of people trying to carve out an uncertain life youre a real village and thats important to them to be seen as a real village this was wilderness when the elders of this village came here with their parents theyre proud of what theyve accomplished he reminded her of that again as they rode into halfrest which was in point of fact nothing much more than a group of people trying to carve out an uncertain life livestock still shared many of the same buildings as their owners and function ruled over form only the meeting hall bore any decorationgraceful joyful carvings tucked up under the gabled eaves gave some promise of what could be when they finally got a bit ahead because a real village has a meeting hall alyise asked quietly as they dismounted he nodded and turned to greet the approaching men and women they had not had an easy year of it there had been sickness and raiders and heavy rains then sickness again we had no harvest festival this year a weary woman told them pushing graying hair off her face with a thin hand with so many sick there were few to bring the harvest in so when the fields were finally clear the time was past we had little heart for it besides but there are two pigs fattening pledged for the festival last spring one came from my good black sow and i feel i should be able to slaughter him for my own use he was pledged to the village an equally weary looking man interrupted he was pledged to the festival as there had been no festival it would seem sensible to give the pig back to the woman who had pledged it perhaps requiring her to give some of the meat to those in need but this was alyises judgment and jors sat quietly behind her allowing her to make up her own mind with no interference from him he glanced around the hall from the workroughened and exhausted villagers to the sullen knot of teenagers clumped together by the door no one looked hungry or ill used just tired theyd been working nonstop for weeks it was no wonder theyd skipped their festival all they probably wanted was a chance to rest i have heard all sides of the argument alyise said at last and this is my judgment she paused just for a moment and jors had the strangest feeling the other shoe was finally dropping the pig was pledged to the harvest festival have the festival but the harvest has been in long since and the harvest is in alyise interrupted her smile lighting all the dark corners of the room i think thats worth celebrating before anyone could protest she locked eyes with the woman who owned the pig dont you well yes but the sickness is past the raiders have been defeated and thats worth celebrating too the man who had protested the reclaiming of the pig seemed stunned by her smile dont you think so i guess and the rains have stopped she spread her arms and turned to the teenagers by the door the sun is shining why not celebrate that shoulders straightened tentative smiles answered her question no one stood against alyises enthusiasm for long soon to jors surprise no one wanted to the pigs were slaughtered and dressed and put in pits to roast tables were set up in the hall food and drink began to appear musicians brought out their instruments id have thought they were too tired to party jors murmured as half a dozen girls ran giggling by with armloads of the last bright leaves of fall my mother has a saying if you dont celebrate your victories all you remember are your defeats the food theyre eating now wont be enough to make a real difference if the winter is especially hard but the memories they make good memories of laughter and fellowship that could be enough to see them through alyise gestured toward the carvings they know joy i just helped them remember they knew you know he did actually careful chosen gervais adjusted his gait as jors listed slightly to the left you lied to me alyises whites were a beacon in the darkness which was good because he didnt think he could find her otherwise except that she was on donnel and that made it pretty obvious where she was now he considered it what did i lie about you said that was apple apple jush juice she giggled it was once jack that wash apples jack he wasnt drunk heralds did not get drunk on duty even at impromptu harvest festivals where the apple juice wasnt which he wouldnt have had any of had alyise not handed him a huge mug just before they left to toast the celebration and the celebrants now the night was spinning gently around him and he suspected that getting the companions settled for the night was going to be interesting fortunately it seemed that alyise was less affected hey he set his saddle down with exaggerated care you had some of that too some she agreed the dimples appearing come on inside her hand was warm on his arm then it was warm under his tunic and her mouth tasted warm and sweet and wait a minute he pulled back although his hands seemingly with a mind of their own continued working on her laces i dont think her eyes gleamed what he couldnt remember gervais she got you drunk and now shes taking advantage of you what it was donnels suggestion but it seemed sound the bunk hit the back of his legs and he was suddenly lying down holding a soft willing body help his companions mental voice held layers of laughter say that like you mean it heartbrother actually for a while he wasnt able to say anything much at all jors stood staring down at the pond watching the early morning sun tease tendrils of fog off the icylooking water trying to work the kinks out of muscles he hadnt used for far too long alyise was as enthusiastic in bed as she was about everything else and hed been hardpressed to keep up he guessed he had been a bit of an ass about that whole position of power thing still what is it chosen gervais velvet nose prodded him in the back im still her mentor for another seven months what if this changes things between us you think she will no longer trust your judgment because you have shared her bed put that way it sounded a bit insulting well no then what is the problem there didnt seem to be one jors leaned against his companions comforting bulk and thought about it he wasnt jennet alyise was a herald that made her responsible for herself donnel said his chosen was glad he was a young man they had welldefined roles in the villages there was no reason for them not to continue sharing a bed as long as they both remained willing no reason at all for it to detract from his ability to teach what he knew or learn what she offered jors grinned he had other nights like last night to look forward to and days of cheerful conversations combined with an enthusiastic welcome to whatever the road ahead might bring and a highenergy approach to life that definitely got results since a villagewide party turned out to solve a petition about a disputed pig his grin faded as a muscle twinged in his back havens he sighed as he realized what the next few months would bring im too old for this gervais weight was suddenly no longer a comforting presence at his back but rather a short sharp shove the water in the pond was as cold as it looked war cry by michael longcor michael longcor is a writer and singersongwriter from indiana who wrote a dozen songs for the mercedes lackey album owlflight released by firebird arts music hes also had stories appear in the mercedes lackey anthologies sun in glory and bedlams edge here he tells the tale of a young valdemaran soldier with a dangerous problem facing his first big battle and the bloody final clash of the tedrel wars rury tellar pulled the blanket closer around his shoulders and stared into the yellow heart of the campfire the blanket and the valdemaran guard surcoat were enough to keep off the nights cool but still he shivered his throbbing head didnt dim the whispering feelings crowding in feelings of doubt fear hope despair cheer loneliness and sadnessthe massed feelings of an army camped close on the eve of battle it had started three weeks ago soon after his seventeenth birthday and the call for the oakdell village militia to march off and join the main army the intruding feelings were very faint at first like the notquitewords heard late at night in the settling of an old house theyd grown steadily stronger and now they constantly jostled his thoughts his head ached with the pressure of other people cramming in sometimes he felt like his brain was the anvil from the blacksmith shop where hed apprenticed with strangers feelings hammering and ringing on it like the smiths sledge around him were the night sounds of an army encamped thousands of soldiers shifted in sleep muttered in dreams coughed or whispered curses the air smelled strongly of campfire smoke and more faintly of horse dung ten paces away aed snored in the tent alongside milo and snipe rury would likely have to nudge space to lie down between them when he finally turned in theyd been in the big camp for two days waiting for the tedrel army to come over the border somehow the brass hats knew the tedrels would cross near here and there would be plenty of them camp gossip said this would be the last battle of the tedrel wars one way or another rury was tired but trying to sleep made it easier for the feelings of others to crowd in it was better a little to sit and stare at the dying fire until his eyelids drooped and his head nodded at first hed mentioned the headaches to the others but stopped because his comrades might think he was shirking or crazy or worse scared he was scared hed do his best though no matter how afraid he felt but he could feel when people around him were afraid and their feelings ran through him adding to his own fears it didnt help to know the rest of the unit was scared too except for maybe sergeant krandal they were all young and scared and afraid to let it show afraid of looking like cowards last night princess selenay herself had briefly visited the company campfire shadowed by her bodyguard she was young and lovely and seemed brave and genuinely interested in them rury knew even if the others didnt that she was afraid of what was coming too no matter how brave her words trouble sleeping again tellar rury jumped as sergeant krandal stepped into the firelight it glinted on the silvergray in his closetrimmed beard and the white horse of the valdemaran arms on his blue surcoat he was no taller than rury but built square and solid where rury was lean young muscle uh just thought id get a little quiet time sarge rury shrugged aeds snoring shakes the tent and snipe talks in his sleep krandal smiled and shook his head still having trouble with the headaches ah they come and go said rury uh maybe i better turn in anyway he got up and walked to the tent gnight sarge good night soldier sergeant krandal said softly he was concerned and not for the boys health mit krandal had seen twentyeight years of guard service and thousands of young soldiers before his retirement to oakdell two years ago rury tellar was a good kid wellliked big and strong with good fighting moves and the makings of a fine soldier krandal knew all the symptoms of a youngster facing his first fight but tellars problem seemed more complicated and serious than that he banked the fire and started walking instead of heading for his own tent he steered toward the fires of the command tents a hilltop away it was time to call in some help even this late the tents of the communications and intelligence sections bustled with candlelit activity couriers came and went with the less pressing reports and orders urgent dispatches were sent off by the few heralds who could make objects disappear then reappear elsewhere others pored over big maps keeping track of units supplies and numbers they waded through seas of unrelated information assembling tiny bits into bigger bits and fitting it all into a hazy incomplete picture of how things were herald erek ranwellen pushed aside the reports scattered about his folding camp table brushed away a stray lock of lightbrown hair and rubbed his eyes it had been a long day he felt ages older than his twentysix years his white leathers were mostly clean but he longed for a bath and change of clothes he should have turned in an hour ago like his companion deanara he looked up at the sound of nervous throatclearing to see a door sentry at attention before him yes what is it beggin your pardon herald said the soldier but theres a sergeant from the pikes outside wantin to see you did he say why no sir he just said to say you still owe him for turning a whiny little rich boy into a passable good soldier the sentrys mouth barely twitched his words sir not mine ereks eyes widened he smiled broadly to the sentrys wonder sergeant krandal said erek iron mit krandals outside send him in man send him in sergeant krandals snap to attention and salute were paradeground perfect as was ereks response the grins and strong handshake that followed were less than regulation sergeant krandal ill never get used to you saluting me aye erek er herald sergeant krandals eyes twinkled whod have thought the companys biggest slacker would be chosen as a herald you even turned out a good soldier thanks to you sergeant maybe said krandal with a crooked grin a few hundred laps around the parade ground in full kit didnt hurt either how is your lady wife asked erek a shadow of pain crossed sergeant krandals face there was a fever two winters past she he looked away and waved weakly im sorry i didnt know no way you would have anyway im not here socially what is it i need a favor thrust recover advance thrust sergeant krandals voice cracked out the commands and the oakdell militia sweated through pike drill rurys tunic was damp under his armor his hands sweaty on the spear shaft they drilled two hours a day with the larger company then sergeant krandal had them on the field for an extra hour after that they needed it the spears were half again as long as rury and the pikes even longer they had to work together as a unit or people got hurt even in drill theyd learned the basics of spear and pike back home but there the militias main job was fighting bandits and peacekeeping the weapons were more likely to be sword bow or staff the guard however had decreed they were pike soldiers so pikes they had to become for rury one good thing about drill was getting some small respite from the massed feelings pressing in those around him mostly suspended thought and feeling as they concentrated on the barked commands and responses rest in ranks ordered sergeant krandal the four rows of militia grounded the butts of their weapons gratefully and leaned on the shafts the sergeant walked around the formation to face them he upended the spear he carried and thrust it upright into the trampled sod it took some doing to get these toys he patted the short sword hanging off his right side and the buckler a small round shield two handspans in diameter clipped at his left all the militia members carried the same so you will oblige me by being proficient with them he had them lay down spears and walked them through various drills drawing the sword with either hand and getting the buckler off the belt and up theyd had months of training back home using larger shields and longer swords and they were improving rapidly aed karlan the groups selfappointed jester muttered sidewise to rury its not enough we have to slog around with armor and pigstickers we get to haul extra gear too you have questions karlan or just gas said sergeant krandal aed flushed and stammered uh just wondering sergeant why the extra weapons if the army thinks were pike soldiers not that i mind em but itd be nice having a fullsize sword and shield thats simple enough sergeant krandal replied two lines of spears backed with two of pikes are a bit thin against a massed rush put a big force of heavies against you or even an equal force whose front line cares more about running over you than staying alive and you people will be playing kissyface with the tedrel if that happens he pointed at aeds weapons those will give you a fighting chance and theres no way to carry fullsize weapons and still fight a spear in close order without getting hung up on your comrades the sergeant smiled thinly i approve of soldiers asking questions aed looked relieved as krandal continued but not soldiers talking in ranks karlan you get wood and water duty tonight aeds look of relief melted dortha front and center a darkhaired young woman broke ranks and came on the double run them through reversedraw drills dortha was nononsense and as good a fighter as the men after joining up shed silenced snickers from the boys with a ready kick to the knee if they were lucky somewhat higher if they werent she quickly got them into the rhythm of the drill drawing the sword with blade reversed and pointing down slashing up and across an enemys face then immediately sweeping back to stab face or throat sergeant krandal noticed the unit sneaking looks off behind him he glanced back to see a small group of horsemen most on brilliantly white mounts turn off the camp road at the end of the drill field and trot toward them the sunlight glinted off the armor and crown worn by the groups leader and off the coat of the companion he rode behind him a horseman bore the blueandsilver standard of the king of valdemar hold dress your ranks sergeant krandal snapped back to the militia i dont know why but thats king sendar coming to call you lot follow my lead and show some respect or youll all spend the next week wishing you had sergeant krandal turned back just as the group pulled up he saluted and dropped to one knee clinking and rustling indicated the militia was following his example now if they can just keep quiet rury dropped to a knee with the rest with the mindless rote of drill paused he immediately felt the feelings of those around pressing on his mind the militia were awed and a little apprehensive sergeant krandal was mostly curious from the king rury sensed an almost overwhelming weight of worry and sadness but in front of it like an armys standard in the charge rode a spark of hope and pleasure king sendar sat his companion leaned forward on the saddle and smiled warmly its good to see you back in the field sergeant krandal the king said the militias eyes widened its good to be back your majesty replied sergeant krandal i may be getting old for this game but im your man and valdemars to the end of it i know that said the king and im grateful he raised his eyes to take in the rest of the militia im grateful also to every man and woman standing for our kingdom against the tedrel you may guess that i know your sergeant of old i know then you are well trained i see you are wellarmed this battles outcome will depend on each of you i depend on you i know you will not fail me or valdemar rury felt his heart swell with pride and sensed the same from his comrades this was a king to follow a king to fight for king sendar sketched a salute to sergeant krandal wheeled his companion and he and his entourage cantered back to the road all save one one herald with the insignia of the communications branch on his surcoat remained behind his companion shifted with a delicate grace as he dismounted sergeant krandal walked over and saluted the herald then bowed deeply to his companion and it seemed to the gawking militia that the shining companion returned the bow my greetings to you lady deanara said krandal you look even lovelier than usual the heralds companion dipped her head gravely and snorted dee says its always a pleasure to meet the legendary sergeant krandal said erek and whens lunch we break in fifteen minutes or so said krandal with a grin he turned back to the ranked militia back to work people you heard his majesty hes depending on you to save the kingdom but dont get big heads about it they sat on the grass in the common area between the company cook fires and the drill field lunch was cracked grain boiled with bits of sausage and what vegetables might be available a staple of the guard in the field the troops had a dozen nicknames for it the commonest and least profane was thunder mud the cooks are trying to kill us with this stuff said aed they sure cooked this until its dead sergeant krandal snorted he pulled a tiny bottle from his belt pouch undid the stopper and sprinkled a bit of reddishorange powder on his food never let the cooks hear you gripe about the food he said if you do dont eat camp soup after that besides any dish loses a lot when its made for five hundred at a time perking it ups your problem whats that stuff sarge ground karsite peppers guaranteed to put a little zip into anything the guard dishes out he restoppered the bottle tasted his food and nodded sarge said aed looking to where rury and erek sat apart with the heralds white companion standing behind is rury in trouble were all in trouble muttered sergeant krandal its just that we might be able to help tellar with some of his herald erek seemed likable enough but rury had never met a herald before let alone had the personal attention of one he was nervous guardsman tellar said herald erek after they got settled can i call you rury uh sure said rury am i in trouble or something erek smiled slightly not with me youre not im just here to help with a problem you may have rury felt the heralds sincere concern but he still didnt like where this was going im uh not sure what you mean let me make a guess said erek you think everyone around you is trying to climb into your head or that maybe youre just going crazy ereks voice stayed calm but it took control not to laugh aloud at rurys openmouthed goggleeyed response what how its all right said erek may i touch your arm for a moment it should help me help you rury held out his left arm in reply erek grasped rurys wrist his companion whom hed introduced as deanara left off nibbling grain from a canvas bucket and swung her head to where erek could place his free hand on her nose rury felt a gentle coolness brush his mind a few moments passed and erek released rurys wrist i was almost certain but dee confirms it said erek you have a strong gift of empathy i have a touch of it myself though my major gift is mindspeech it doesnt feel like a gift said rury more like a curse thats because you havent learned how to keep other peoples feelings out it can go both ways too if you have strong emotions of your own you can influence others around you you mean like the rest of the militia yes especially with feelings like fear they could feel afraid for no reason other than youre afraid rury didnt want to think about what that might mean in a fight the entire militia panicking because of him is there a cure erek chuckled but cut it off sorry its not a disease so theres really no cure you can make it easier for yourself though and safer for your comrades you need to learn ways to shield your feelings from others and keep the emotions of others out i could do that rury looked like hed been reprieved from a death sentence which was just what erek was trying to do they spent the rest of lunch break running over simple techniques rury seemed more relaxed at the end of it erek hoped it would be enough keeping out the random jitters of his comrades was one thing shielding against the raging emotions of two armies locked in mortal combat would be an entirely different beast the night was clear and cool with stars twinkling in a black sky no one looked at the stars soldiers glanced away from their fires toward the karsite border where an orange glow marked the encamped tedrel horde tension and suppressed fear thick and heavy pushed through rurys best attempts to shield his mind his own fear kept intruding on his efforts to block out emotions of those around him sergeant krandal stood and stretched wincing better hit the bag people he said we dont want to oversleep the party tomorrow sarge said snipe i heard the next company over is sleeping in their armor should we the sergeant shook his head no not unless youre sure you can actually sleep that way if you have any clean dry clothes with you especially underclothes change into those wouldnt hurt to keep your boots on either he looked around tellar and i will take first watch the rest of you turn in they shuffled and muttered back to their tents sergeant krandal had rury take a position on the companys tent line facing away from the banked fire after noise from the tents settled down he appeared at rurys side you might not feel like talking tellar he said but tell me true hows that empathy thing going its better sarge really it is he paused wondering if he should go on but you still feel afraid sergeant krandal said well yeah kind of youll be fine lad the sergeant smiled every sane soldier is afraid at some time or another its what separates the good soldiers from the dead ones a little fear is natures way of making you pay attention if you feel afraid use it stay calm and let it turn to something else something you can use what if i freeze up i doubt thatll happen let your training and reflexes take care of things while you deal with it herald erek taught you ways to handle the empathy right yeah sarge but im not sure if i can make them work then turn in and practice until you sleep i can handle the rest of the watch and i want you fresh tomorrow sarge i dont thats an order tellar sergeant krandal said gruffly go his tone softened itll be all right krandal watched rury trudge off then muttered under his breath i hope half a candlemark later erek and deanara appeared at the edge of the firelight sergeant krandal waved them in silently well he said barely above a whisper erek swung off deanara sighed heavily and sat down he replied in equally soft tones i didnt get much farther than you did sergeant the brass isnt about to pull one young pike soldier off the line this late in the game im sorry behind him deanara gave a snort of disgust im not surprised sergeant krandal replied guard policy is like guard cooking whats best for the army is usually hard on the individual soldier erek nodded i did point out that an untrained empath probably wouldnt survive the coming battle and that the intensity and volume of emotion hed face would leave him dead or insane he sighed heavily they said there are hundreds maybe thousands of young soldiers in this army who wont survive the battle empaths or not theyre right so whats to be done i spent what time i could teaching him shielding techniques it wasnt much but we have to hope it will do weve simply run out of time can you shift him in the unit i could but hes one of my best and if hes capable of what you say and he panics he could take the whole unit with him if he breaks id just as soon it be where i can see him ill shift things so im behind him in the second line so you can help if theres trouble sergeant krandal stared into the fire a moment so i can help him and if its the only way so i can stop him rury kept running the shielding exercises through his head as they donned armor in the dim light of predawn armor in the guard was never completely uniform even within units except for what it had to protect leather and metal leggings covered rury from crotch to foot he pulled on a padded vest with separate quilted sleeves and over that a leather jerkin with small overlapping iron plates stitched inside more leather and metal covered arms and elbows and an armored cowl covered throat shoulders upper back and chest he looped the baldric suppporting his short sword over his left shoulder and secured it with a wide belt that also supported his water bottle rations pouch buckler and dagger reinforced leather gauntlets and a plain wellmade helmet finished the outfit rury bent and picked up his spear he consciously felt the armors weight only for a moment sergeant krandal had been drilling them in full kit since before theyd marched out from oakdell the sergeant appeared wearing his armor as naturally as if it were his skin stepping close to rury he spoke barely above a whisper remember relax and let the training do the job if you feel fear let it go to something else the sergeant stepped back and looked around at the militia then smiled grimly boys and girls he said its time to go be soldiers marching order column of fours they marched to the companys muster point then trudged to the valley in the dim red light of predawn the upright rows of their shouldered weapons rippled as they moved like a field of grain waving deadly in the breeze a crow cawed harshly at their passing they reached the shallow stream marking valdemars border with karse and arrayed themselves there rury stood on the front line with aed and snipe to either side behind him were sergeant krandal and the others their presence reassuring perhaps fivescore paces to his left rury could make out the kings standard fluttering bravely in the breeze to either side stretched the armored ranks of valdemar muttering rippled through the valdemaran ranks as the tedrel army crested the opposing hilltop they came and came and kept coming armor glittering in the morning sun the measured tread of their march was like muffled drums that may be the scariest thing ive ever seen muttered aed thats because you arent them looking at us replied the sergeant look close the front ranks arent squared off and hard lined like the ones behind see how the officers are riding close on them the tedrel are running their mongrel hounds out ahead those boys in front are nervous he raised his voice ive seen more than my share of fighters and you people are better than that lot he grinned wryly though it looks like it will be a while before we run out of tedrels rury knew the sergeant was trying to buck them up still he was glad of the confidence in krandals voice as the tedrels filled the far slopes the mutterings in his head grew to a low roar even through the shields he tried to raise the voices were back and this time every voice was shouting hate and rage and desire for his death for the first time in his young life rury seriously thought about the possibility of death and that today he might die nice to see somebody remembered to invite the tedrels joked aed so what do we do now we stop jabbering like a bunch of firstfight rookies for starters growled sergeant krandal then we settle in and wait stand easy the morning crawled on the sun was well up now glinting off the dew on the grass soldiers in the line held their positions occasionally shifting their feet or drinking sparingly from water bottles suddenly there was a cry as the tedrel lines started moving their front ranks left the main body and advanced toward the little stream just ahead of rury they moved at a trot that sped up as they came down the slope dress your ranks shouted sergeant krandal hold in place the tedrels were up to a run now a wordless roar coming from their throats thousands on thousands charged down the hill shaking the ground rury felt the vibration through his boot soles level weapons the front line of tedrels reached the stream lurching and splashing across hold steady sergeant krandal could barely be heard over the noise hold the the rest was lost in crash screams and drumming thunder as the lines slammed together and two armies each leaped for the others throat on either side of rury tedrel fighters unheeding of danger or unable to check their rush impaled themselves on spear and pike points for every tedrel who did two more fought to get past the spears and close with the fighters of valdemar the roar of clashing arms and screaming soldiers was deafening rury nearly blacked out from the waves of emotion he tasted bile in his throat his head felt as if it would explode a big tedrel in bronze and leather armor knocked rurys spear point aside with a shield rim and charged in he hacked down and his sword bit into rurys spear shaft with a crack the shaft buckled rury saw death in the warriors eyes felt hate pouring from him as the tedrels sword came up again the noise seemed to mute and time slowed to a crawl as rury brought up the splintered remnant of his spear shaft and blocked the sword coming at his head something happened clicking into place in rurys mind the physical act of defending himself combined with the hurried training from herald erek and sergeant krandals words stay calm let the fear and hate turn to something else he didnt need to stop the feelings he just had to let them divert as they flowed into and through him the hammering in his head and the sickness in his gut vanished he felt the rage and fear of two armies coming to him and felt it refracting turning into something else he held up the broken spear shaft like a talisman with his left hand and fumbled for his sword the tedrel swung again but stopped short as sergeant krandals spearhead hit the mans shoulder the thrust didnt bite deep through the tedrels armor but it hung him up the hours of training kicked in rury gripped his own sword fist up and bladedown and swept it out of the scabbard slashing across the tedrels face the cheek and nosepiece of the tedrels helmet turned most of the cut but rurys backhanded return stab took him just below the chin the tedrel dropped like a puppet with cut strings his blood bathed rurys sword and spattered his surcoat filling rurys nose with its coppery smell a tidal flow of primal emotion roared into rury the greatest feeling of his young life the dying tedrels anger fear and lust surged and churned inside him turning to something that felt strangely like love love of his enemies love of battle love of killing at that instant rury tellar became an angel of death spears and pikes stabbed from behind and around him as rurys comrades fought to fill the gap left by his broken spear another tedrel forced an opening with his shield and rushed at rury his war hammer swinging high rury calmly stopped the charge cold by thrusting the splintered end of his spear shaft into the warriors face followed with a sword stab over the shields rim whether the sword struck the tedrels face or throat rury couldnt see he heard the man cry out and felt him sag but the tedrel didnt go down rury tried to draw the sword back but it was stuck jammed in bone or armor he released the sword and wrenched the hammer from the mans faltering grip then brought it around to crash on the tedrels helmet the blow threw the mans body back into the tedrel line in the moments respite rury dropped the splintered spear shaft and had his buckler off his belt and up still gripping the war hammer the weapon was no noblemans decorative piece just a steel head with a long narrow hammer face and wicked points on back sides and front mounted on an oak haft nearly as long as his arm whatever its form it was a hammer and rury had spent four years at the forge using one driven by his hardtrained muscle the hammer rose and fell on the pressing tedrel host armor and bone crushed with nearly every blow a man went down the tedrel fought to get a return blow on rury but sergeant krandal bellowed orders and the militias spears stabbed and clicked like giant deadly knitting needles taking down any tedrel who gave rury too much attention bodies piled before them making a barrier that let their spears and pikes reach across to dart and tear every tedrel who died in pain and fear and rage fed energy into rury every blow was like a lovers touch every scream a sweethearts whisper he wanted it to never end he would kill until no one lived on this bloody field just to keep the song of love and death singing through him the tedrels fell back a dozen steps and arrows rained down on the valdemaran line armor and luck proved good enough for the oakdell militia and they took little hurt but the tedrels had pulled back out of reach of his hammer and rury stood with impatient resentment the roar of battle eased for a moment and he heard cries of commanders getting louder as they relayed orders glancing to his left rury glimpsed the kings banner plunging across the stream and deep into the tedrel host and then sergeant krandal was shouting at his back advance the line the king is leading advance the line move up to support the king move it move it now charge like a hunting dog released from its leash rury scrambled up and over the slick line of tedrel bodies trailed closely by the rest there was a shock of wet and cold on feet and shins as they splashed into the shallow stream now running a muddy crimson past the opposite bank stood a locked line of tedrel shields this time it was the soldiers of valdemar who crashed into a line of steel rury gave it no thought he only wanted to regain that wonderful feeling that came with killing his hammer crashed down on a tedrels wooden shield splintering the arm that supported it another blow smashed a helm the rest of the militia were with him now exploiting gaps made by rurys relentless blows the tedrel line gave ground before the young demon with the hammer and those terrible thirsting spears no thought rury stay stay and let me love you he smashed the shield of a lone tedrel left in an opening cleared of live enemies the shield sagged down but before rury could strike the killing blow a spear head thrust past him and took the tedrel cleanly as the man fell rury felt the rage of a child whose toy was taken take my kill will you thwart my love rury turned to see aed pulling back his spear then let you be my love rury smiled as he raised his hammer far up the line the kings banner trembled and fell rury drew back his hammer ready to send it smashing down on aeds helmet instead lightning struck rury a bolt of searing emotion ran through his mind and body rushing through his veins so intense he felt his fingers and toes must be sparking and flaring it was a wave of feeling that screamed of pain despair death and the loss of loved ones our beloved our chosen they have killed the companions they have slain the king it was too much too much power too much pain and raw emotion rurys mind reflexively redirected the bolt casting it back out across the battlefield his legs buckled and he sank to his knees felt the hammer pulled from his grasp he heard savage screaming as he fell something about the kings death he glimpsed aed swinging the war hammer wildly and sergeant krandal roaring wordlessly running into the enemy ranks with his spear gripped high and then the dark closed in erek limped as he picked his way across the wreckage of the battlefield closely followed by deanara his uniform and the companions trappings were torn and dirty here and there stained with blood communications and intelligence people werent supposed to be front line troops but after the valdemaran reserves had been ordered out to intercept the tedrel cavalry ravaging the countryside every valdemaran who could hold a weapon became a combat soldier even with his mental shields up hed felt the call of grief and rage that marked the kings death he and dee had thrown themselves into the battle as ferociously as any erek wasnt certain who had channeled that wave of emotion but he had an idea and he had to find out around them was what the worst of the nine hells must look like on a sunny day nothing in the universe is so horribly totally messy as the aftermath of a battle the metallic smell of blood and pungent aroma of feces from the dying and dead hung in the still air the injured moaned and screamed figures on the ground writhed or lay much too still others like erek and deanara picked their way across ground littered by broken weapons discarded armor and awkwardly sprawled bodies it was difficult getting through some sections without walking on limbs torsos or faces the former front lines were marked by raggedly piled rows of dead like windrows of cut hay ready for harvesting he found them twenty paces or so beyond one of the largest piles to the right of what had been the valdemaran center sergeant krandal sat sprawled in a small cleared area bareheaded and with part of his armor stripped off rury lay with his head cradled in the sergeants arms sobbing like a child both were bloodstained and filthy sergeant krandal looked up at the heralds approach how did you fare sergeant said erek sergeant krandal gave a pained crooked smile better than we might have hoped we gave far better than we took but we did take losses six dead that i know of aed took an ax to the shoulder lots of walking wounded dorthas got the rest out with the company mopping up he winced and shifted his seat and erek saw the sergeants outstretched leg seeping blood through a crude bandage ripped from a surcoat i took a scratch on the thigh enough to make me stay put krandal looked down at rury who was quiet now like a child who had cried itself almost to sleep the boy seemed to master that empathy thing about the time they closed with us he fought like a karsite demon after that that was mostly why we werent overrun then right after the king died when we all somehow knew hed been killed i was filled with grief and rage like id never known thats when i saw the boy go down he wasnt struck down just dropped like he was dead there wasnt time to check on him then we were all too busy trying to rip out the tedrels throats with our teeth at least thats what it felt like it was as if the boys demons burned him out and jumped to all of us erek knelt and laid a hand on rurys forehead as if checking for a fever deanara snorted gently and drew nearer and erek reached back and laid his free hand on her velvety nose he drew breath sharply after a moment removed his hands from rury and dee and stood up find something said the sergeant frowning erek sighed dee thinks he was something like a conduit for what you and i and everyone else felt i agree when the king was killed when he and his bodyguard and their companions and the other mounts were being cut down the companions knew it those directly involved felt their chosen pierced and dying felt the pain and panic and death of their fellows they put out a combined mindscream that must have hit rury like a thunderbolt my guess is he threw it back out over the army probably translated somehow so that even the least sensitive valdemaran could understand it erek stood stiffly we cant find any trace now of his empathic talents i think youre righter than you know when you say his demons burned him out what he did was an instinctive reaction but thats how we all felt the kings death at the same instant whether or not he meant to do it it helped turn the tide of the battle krandal stroked rurys head like a concerned mother the boys breathing evened out will he recover we need to get him to the healers you too for that matter hell certainly be affected but no youngster goes through a war unchanged with help and time i think hell be well enough erek paused and frowned wed best keep this to ourselves at least for now the companions will know and some of the heralds but they wont gossip about it ill pass it on to those in the guard with a need to know erek stopped abruptly as rury opened his eyes and raised himself up on an elbow how do you feel rury said erek my head hurts rury replied but not like before sergeant krandal let out a long breath at least youre alive lad i heard what you said said rury to erek i didnt mean to send those feelings back out to everyone it was like catching a redhot iron you just want to throw it back im sorry you had to bear that rury said erek im glad it happened i guess replied rury i dont think i liked what i was feeling before that or maybe i liked it too much when it hit me it was like a basin of iced water in my face when i was having a nightmare he paused and closed his eyes for a moment then opened them and youre right i cant sense other peoples feelings now another thoughtful pause is it true the king is dead its true said erek soberly he raised an arm and pointed to where a small group of riders picked their way down to where king sendar lay fallen at their head rode princess no now queen selenay king sendars dead but his kingdom still lives and the princess thanks to you and all of us who fought today i dont want to fight anymore said rury from where he lay and i dont want to kill i just want to go home erek smiled sadly thats all any of us wanted rury perhaps when you sent out that cry we all truly realized what the tedrel would take from us maybe thats why we won out in the end well grunted sergeant krandal right now none of us look like we won he reached up a hand and grimaced as erek hauled him to his feet im getting too old for this he tried his injured leg winced and balanced on his good one while erek helped rury up in the distance a body wrapped in the kings banner was borne and carried up the hill by heralds and officers followed by a young new queen none noticed three ragged men and a companion upon whom the tide of battle may have turned limping slowly away years passed and old veterans remembered their own golden valor a heroic king and a brave beautiful girl made queen the memory of a searing cry piercing the thunder of war faded until it was less than the distant calling of crows on a battlefield far from home strength and honor by ben ohlander ben ohlander was born in south dakota in and grew up in colorado and north carolina after completing high school he did a stretch in the marines before attending college in ohio upon graduation he was commissioned as an officer in the army reserve and is now serving on active duty in eastern iraq in his civilian interludes he works as a data analyst parttime writer and cat owner he currently lives in southwest ohio cogern warmaster of the nineteenth foot hero of the regiment and beloved of vkandis paced in the blazing desert sun a distant smudge on the horizon drew his eye he watched it a while as it spread laterally the thought of an attacking force crossing the high desert at noon fell into folly but he looked for it anyway folly served judiciously could be well employed hed employed it himself the smudge resolved itself not infantry dust storm typical weather for this time of year but one of his least favorite things about his home country he often wondered why they fought so hard to defend the place the oftheard comment was that the sun was the gift of vkandis too bad hed been so generous dust storm looked like it would pass them by he wiped the sweat that rolled down his scarred head with his dog rag and checked the sentries they were all alert and jittery the village that lay hard by the oasis should have been brimming with life children playing women coming down for water the presence of two thousand soldiers in the area should have meant a steady stream of fruit sellers merchants and the odd maiden intent on trading favors for silver now nothing no bodies no sign of the haste or force just no villagers the place had been abandoned as though everyoneman woman and brathad simply walked away the empty village wasnt central to their being there but it felt bad cogern wiped his brow again tracing a clean streak in the dust that marked his forehead he hated mysteries especially when his regiment lay vulnerable sprawled with armor shed in the thin shade of the date palms that clustered close to the oasis he didnt need to look back to know that most men slept while others diced or talked quietly all moved as little as possible he glanced to his right seeing movement a soldier made water catching the fluid in a small bowl for the chirurgeon who stood nearby cogern shook his head and stepped over he would have dismissed the valdemaran as a quack just another foreigner with strange notions had it not been for the mans skill with the arrowspoon and scalpel cogern knew little about the chirurgeon only that tregaran had taken his service after some vague indiscretion back home cogern appreciated the mans skill and soft hands but not his motives that made him bear watching cogern shook his head in polite disbelief as the man swirled the water in his bowl the chirurgeon believed a good deal in piss see the dark water here the valdemaran said his accent mauling karses more sophisticated sibilants his head and the troopers leaned together peering into the bowl these are your humors growing cloudy you need to keep them flushed out darkyellow or brown mark a sure sign that your bodys fluids are clogging up yellow is liver humor lightcolored not so bad dark yellow is bad brown worse cogern interested in spite of the obvious quackery craned his head a little to better see then what the quack with the soft hands looked at him and smiled ah warmaster a little interest if the humors get too thick arent kept flushed out then they back up and clog the heart you die the trooper looked worriedly into his bowl ahm i gunna die his homespun accent and credulity gave away his country roots the chirurgeon glanced sideways and smiled a laxative a quick lancet to the wrist vein to bleed a little and as much water as could be drunk oft fixes the imbalance the trooper paled ah lancet the quack smiled maybe not the lancet drink as much water as you can hold and bring your bowl to me tonight if its clear well hold the lancet for now the trooper nodded once and moved away cogern smiled as the lad headed for the oasis the chirurgeon grinned the water seems the most needful the laxative is only if the stools dry out and become too firm the needle cogern understood soldiers trade in blood and hate to see their own shed the trooper will drink to bursting to avoid being bled clever cogern didnt have any use for chirurgeons but he did admit this one knew his trade better than most most proved no better than butchers and far too many enjoyed the blood shed though to be honest he did keep track of the color of his water now no man but an enemy would bleed him but drinking a little more water every now and again didnt seem to hurt as for the rest feh pure quackery the chirurgeon understanding hed been dismissed eased away quit stalling man cogern said to himself as the quack stepped away to check on the next man time to get it over with he crossed to the colonels tent passed between the sweating sentries with a nod and entered inside he drew himself up into full attention sir the warmaster requests permission to speak colonel tregaran groaned once then sat up on the low cot he shook out the drowsiness and pulled the sleeping rug around his shoulders he felt a twinge in the left shoulder where the hardornans arrow had pierced the shield he rubbed it ruefully sweat burst out of every pore even from that small movement he squinted at the warmaster cogerns sudden affliction of formality did not bode well he glanced at the shade outside and shadows in the distance not much into the second watch of the day not even noon and the heat already a blast furnace wine he asked bending to pour some of the thin sour stuff into a camp cup no he pointed toward the village with his chin any sign cogern shook his head once no scouts have been out all morning solid trail sir going back up into the wadis but no idea of why doesnt look like a threat its just strange yes tregaran agreed but its part of the reason were here he felt cogern relax the commanders duty to set the orders the warmasters to keep them cogern was used to being aware of his colonels thoughts though and tregarans refusal to include the warmaster this time had chafed the older man cogern leaped like a stonelion at tregarans opening his bottled frustration spilling over sir what in the nineteen hells are we doing here having started his carefully rehearsed speech abandoned him and the rest tumbled out in a heap we left our post followed you across the high desert in summer and laagered within a nights march from sunhame why tregaran took a sip of wine making a face at the sour bite he looked down at the cup and the slightly oily surface of the liquid inside he smiled and made the decision to give it to the warmaster straight up the blackrobes have assembled a force an army really and are preparing to overthrow the hierarchs and put one of their own on the sun seat cogern prided himself on being unflappable no matter the provocation the slight widening of his eyes equaled most others dropping jaw he sat on the camp stool without being bid and reached out blindly tregaran smiled and handed him the cup cogern drained it held it out for a refill and emptied it as well tregaran watched cogern work it out but laskaris must surely know wont he put a stop to it the warmaster shook his head answering his own question no hes too busy buggering boys and the hierarchs are either too drunk to notice or well paid to look the other way he chewed his lip thinking the blackrobes will save the faith and our precious god hasnt put in an appearance so say what he thinks he shook his head its that simple so whats to stop them cogern played the role of the simple soldier not too bright really proof you didnt need brains to survive in the army tregaran knew the act for what it was not much got past the warmasters washedout blue eyes he wouldnt have made thirtyfive years in the line if it did his blunt face harelipped scar and lisping gravelly voice all hid a quick and ready mind he let his silence answer for him tregaran reached for a second battered cup and poured more sour wine the warmasters eyes tracked him working it out us a pause us bugger me he looked hard at tregaran sensing more to this why do we care laskaris the boylover or some blackrobe thinning the herd among the heirarchs has been a long time coming tregaran nodded grimly it wont be just laskaris or even the hierarchs who will die when the blackrobes strike they will have to take down all of the ministries decapitate the entire government they know that the redrobes will have no choice but to fight so the black shall strike down the red all of the redrobes in sunhame i cant allow that cogern exhaled deeply there it is the real reason so then this is for her tregaran looked long and hard at him yes for solaris cogerns jaw firmed he flashed back to the miracles performed the regiments adoration tregarans increasing attentiveness during the months she had traveled with them he had his own suspicions about the colonels motives but they owed her dammit he owed her cogern stretched his arms corded muscle stretching who else knows tregaran shugged not sure delrimmon of the thirteenth is close i think a couple others hergram of the thirtyfirst probably cogerns face grew grim so no orders then it was not a question tregarans pursed lips and single head shake made the word unnecessary no orders cogern stood sir i want to make sure that i understand what were for we commit treason here just by moving without orders we strike against vkandis own priests and if the army splits then we start a civil war a civil war to protect one middleranking priest tregaran met his gaze long and level yes cogern shugged and took a deep breath okay im in never liked any of those bastards anyway he rubbed his hand over his face touching the harelip how dya know all this tregaran smiled measuring how far cogern was out of depth by his lack of sirs the warmaster even in the worst battle the line broken and enemy in the camp would never let the honorifics slip tregaran nodded over to the firecat who lay curled up on the camp chest quietly watching he had finally gotten used to the cats ability to simply be overlooked he gestured to it a sort of well cogerns eyes followed his hand the cat chose to be noticed cogern took a deep breath air hissing between his gapped front teeth as he registered its presence is that a firecat a real firecat it told you the cat its tail kinked in annoyance stretched and hopped down from the chest yes the creatures voice sounded clearly in their heads irritation clear to them both it told him and it is hungry and as you havent even a saucer of milk for it it is going to find its own damn dinner it stalked out of the tent stifflegged tail still bent and flicking a semaphore for a feline snit it peasants cogern jumped in his seat as the cats mental voice sounded clearly in their heads the offended tones fading as the avatar insulted stalked away whats got his tail in a kink he looked back at tregaran tregaran shook his head cogern was if nothing else flexible in the space of a few moments the warmaster had moved from an empty village placed himself in opposition to the strongest force in the land and insulted the avatar of the god himself without seeming to show the slightest concern he smiled then reached into his pack for the carefully rolled map youre gonna love this tregaran followed by cogern and the regiments officers jogged hard up the hill the late afternoon sun lay almost directly behind them throwing long red shadows they closed quickly on the ring of scouts who stared down at what tregaran first took for a pile of laundry the circle parted for them the townsman lay staked out in the sand naked alongside the trail of the missing villagers his belly had been opened and the entrails carefully removed so carefully that none had torn and there remained astonishingly little blood the man had most likely died from the exposure of being staked out rather than the vivisection the corded muscles and death rictus gave evidence of the mans agony the scout whod marked the backtrail stood nearby his hands shook and his face was still pale even after vomiting into the sand tregaran didnt blame him he was little more than a boy a stock thief saved by a stint in the army from karses rough justice tregaran looked at his pale face and shaking hands and wondered if the boy thought keeping his hand now seemed a bargain cogern toed the body with his boot breaking into tregarans thoughts what does this mind you of tregaran was a few seconds late mindalis a scout leader piped in first the man we found up by the border warmaster the man with the horse yeah cogern said in a troubled voice all we need is a horses head on a pike and thisd be a perfect match he looked at tregaran under his brows absolutely perfect this could be the same guy tregaran studied the body comparing it to a body found in the borderland hills where karse and valdemar came together in the regiments terilee river sector the dead herald staked and tied out not naked but with his white leathers still about him to show what he had been he had similarly been tied flayed and left to suffer unto death identically tied once tregaran saw what to look for the herald was little more than a boy tregaran said slowly whatever secrets he held would have been given up early in the torment what had taken place after that had been for fun yet the heralds surgical pain looked nothing to the outrages visited on the horse the animal had been torn apart by a hatred strong enough to shatter equine bones the animals head blue eyes open set on a spearstave he returned to himself and shivered cogerns marking the spear as karsite and the presence high on the border where karses brave defenders protected them from the demon horses of valdemar the official version had paled when faced with the reality they did not protect karse from the demons they protected the demons a hard moment the worst of his life tregaran bent to look at the mans hands a laborers calluses not a swordsmans he lay near the trail of the missing villagers so was likely one of them whatever caused this man to die it was even less then the herald that at least could be laid to spying this he could think of no sane reason officers tregaran said file the regiment by let them get a good long look at what they are fighting against we march at dusk blood for blood strength and honor the lead scout pounded in on a stolen borrowed horse sir thirteenth regiment reports having secured the crossroads they will drive on to the citys edge they expect to ring the sunlords by dawn no sign of the thirtyfirst yet the firecat beside him looked up not to worry hergrims thirtyfirst ran into more than they bargained for hardornan mercenaries of all things serving the black most of the blackrobes mercenaries are dead the rest scattered in the name of the good god theyll be at the city by dawn it stretched and yawned its job done all right tregaran replied to the scout give the warmaster the same report and tell him to bring up the rest of the regiment once weve secured the priory well drive onto the city he paused looking over the scouts shoulder never mind the warmasters here the older man also on a found horse halted in a spray of dust the animal heaved and swayed cogern didnt so much ride horses as wrestle them sir he said while trying to control his snapping mount scouts report a village ahead the trail goes straight in big fires youll see em on the horizon once you come up out of the wadi tregaran shook his head no our line of travel is north against the priory thats were theyve massed their strength cogern shook his a broad sweeping no sir looks like the blackrobes are drawn out not at the priory troops mebbe a couple hundred priests out doing the fires scout says there are mebbe forty to fifty robes down there and villagers hundreds of them tregaran puffed out his cheeks thinking okay the village second battle for the assault hold the other two in reserve its going to be too tight in there for one than one battle at a time cogern nodded rapping out orders to the under officers the regiment shook itself out moving from traveling order to assault column then picked up cogerns trot tregaran a little ahead with the scouts crested the wadi and saw the firelight glow from over the low hills pillars of smoke rose then spread out forming a black layer like a roof over the burning the lurid red flames flickered and danced against the smoke and clouds giving the little valley a hellish cast second battle came clattering up behind him shields at the ready one scout momentarily highlighted against the flickering red background swung a piece of cloth over his head any sentries placed were now dead tregaran led his battle forward charging up out of the wadi across the flat ground and started up the slope to where the scout now lay hidden he heard the rest of the battle some four hundred men go to ground below them they sounded like a herd of horses puffing and blowing after the exertion of climbing the hill he leaned his head up over the crest of the hill and peered over the outer portion of the village glowed eerily in the firelight flames from fires leaped high at thrice the height of a grown man the firelight threw more red than yellow the bonfires set in a rough circle around the outer court the same pillars of smoke all but blocked the view into the inner part of the village tregaran could see the impression of more fires but little details the rising smoke formed a complete veil over the town square he shook his head karse woodpoor as it was lost a treasure in the fires that night an entire forest had to have gone into creating this much burning a knot of troops several hundred strong came into view from the village center they formed a rough line facing the regiment behind the hill they obviously meant to defend the village from the nineteenth foot theyre onto us sir said the scout no kidding replied tregaran then waved the horncallers to him pass the word rise and make ready no horns the hornsmen scattered running along the line and preparing the units for the charge the battle drawn into three rough lines stood ready tregaran raised his sword over his head and cut it down sharply first sally go the leading line of second battle gave the single shout vkandis and charged they crested the low hill and sprang down the far side the units leading edges lost coherence in the steep slide down the hill but training discipline and momentum carried them into the thin line the blackrobes warriors set to defend their chiefs the mercenary men fought like lions but in the eternal fight between soldier and warrior soldier wins the warriors no matter how skilled fought as singletons the men of karse trained and blooded brethren fought as part of a larger unit no shame in ganging two on one three on two five on two no honor in the line just the imperative of stab guard parry shuffle step right to cover your mates exposed side thrust into the enemys back his bad luck his mates didnt cover down the leading edge of second battle broke into the blackrobes line fracturing it tregaran sent the second sally at that point the men sliding down the steep slope the reinforcements piling into the first line shattered the blackrobes forces they began to fall back warrior after warrior broke and ran as the fight turned south tregaran still on the hilltop with the reserve watched the enemy line fragment and fail he made a comehere gesture to the horncallers blow halt pursuit form double line he looked at the battles double squad of archers they stood close by weapons strung and ready kill them he said quietly the archers leaped into action they used the new rethwellen pattern bows sinew and wood all backed with horn the weapons shot fearsome distances on a flat trajectory the archers brought the weapons into play quickly standing on the hilltop and taking a savage toll on the firelit men who fled tregaran noted that the archers killed as many as the line the blackrobes forces fell back into the village in disarray tregarans mind flashed to a place where a regiment used the bow to provide the bulk of the killing power rather than just skirmishing he had an image of a line of pikes with reth bows salted in yardlong arrows in direct flattrajectory fire and two or three more rows of archers behind shooting overhead the pikes would hold cavalry at bay likely enough and the reth bows would punch through field armor for cert if a halfcompany could work this slaughter a regiment of bows would black the sun and an arrowstorm that would shatter any unit closing valdemars slow heavy foot would never have a chance the cease arms call brought him back to the moment the last of the blackrobes troops fled within the inner ring of houses surrounding the town square depriving the archers of clear targets plunging fire remained an option but there still remained at least one more fight tonight best to conserve arrows for the later fight he left a small detachment to guard the archers and led the balance of the reserve down the hill the horse theyd found for him plunged forward eagerly not needing spur or goad it nearly fell in the scree and at one point sat down to avoid plunging tail over head the battleline reformed quickly the reserve moving to its accustomed place he passed their lines his horse bucking a little at the soldiers cheers the troops blood was up winning did that especially when the win laid low two of three enemy with no loss on your side tregaran led them into the firelit streets nearly staggering from the heat and smell no wood fed these flames instead long bones marked the fires fuel each piled between knee and waist high and all burning with an unholy vitality he was no stranger to battlefield carnage enough to estimate a death count and his gut told him hundreds lay slain just in the outer court most of the dead now fueled these fires he heard the sounds behind him as the soldiers took in the carnage and what burned in the fires all around their morale would soften if he gave them too much time to me he bellowed then charge the battle came behind him with a shout and he led them between the thick greasy pillars and around the line of buildings the horse refused the flames battling and bucking to avoid being driven forward he felt it slide in the street and fall heavily on one shoulder tregaran had bare moments to kick free to avoid having his leg crushed he rolled away as the horse got its hooves under it and staggered upright slipping one more time before bolting in panic the troops now ahead rounded the corner he grabbed what remained of his dignity picked up his blade and shield from the street and ran to follow his right leg still hurt for cert from the fall and it was more of a limp than a sprint when he cleared the corner his men already engaged hard slamming into the fragments of the enemy battleline that still stood a long line of families stood behind calmly lined up by a roaring bonfire the furnace heat struck him like a hammer and he inhaled superheated air that brought him up short blackrobes stood scattered throughout the towns square tregaran stood mute as more soldiers surged past him and broke into the square cutting into the remaining mercenaries behind the mercenaries failing line a priest calmly tapped a man on his shoulder tregaran watched helplessly as the man gathered up his daughter and together with his wife and son calmly walked into the center bonfire the mans flesh immediately burst into flames but he stood without expression as the fires consumed him and all he loved something about the smoke and rising sparks drew his eye tregaran slowly looked up seeing the smoke from the fires bending together blending into a single cloud a maelstrom that slowly spun and turned gathering the fires into itself he knew he should move join the fight but the overwhelming scene froze him decades of experience failed him as he took in something literally beyond his capacity failure and depression rolled over him he had brought his men to this failed them utterly he tried to think of something to say something to do but his experience betrayed him as well he simply couldnt move the blackrobes last troops fell and the soldiers broke past they cut down priest after priest and no few of the villagers as they turned to clumsily fight the veteran infantry it became apparent to tregaran than none of the victims moved of their own volition he shook himself out of his fugue now that he was aware of it he could feel a heavy weight like a blanket soaked in water trying to descend on him its message was heavy soporific listen to me do as i bid give over you have failed you are a failure just listen and all will be well tregaran tried to shrug the weight away but now that he sensed it he could feel it working its way into his mind the depression built he scanned around frantically looking for the source of the oppressive weight in his mind in the very center of the town square next to the largest fire stood a priest working his stave a halfdozen soldiers cut their way through his final protection and pressed down on him he raised his stave and a something flowed out moving like smoke it coalesced in a few heartbeats becoming a malevolent envenomed whip drawn from the end of the stave the first soldier swung his sword at the looping whip his arm cutting smoke even in the distance tregaran heard his highkeening scream the man fell back his arm boiling with blisters that ruptured maggots spilled from the wounds and chewed into his skin the second soldier charged full into the same sick smoke then the priest whipped the thing on the end of his stave carrying it through the other four each fell screaming flesh consumed by boils that burst into parasites that ate at their hosts the men fell screaming and writhing still several feet short of the priest tregaran looked around desperately wishing he hadnt left the archers on the hill his men continued their assault through the open center slaughtering mercenary priest and townsfolk alike windrows of dead piled up near the fires as the defense failed against his men the soldiers had cut down most every living thing it wasnt until he saw a tongue of flame bend reach from the fire and engulf a fallen priest that he truly understood its movements were sentient alive the priests were making something he felt the touch of the firecats voice in his head aye and when they are done they will bring it through he thinks he can control it but it is a master not a slave he seeks to use it to make miracles to succeed where laskaris has failed instead he will be its tool do something tregaran cried aloud as another of his soldiers fell to the smoking stave flames now licked around the archpriest swirling like a cyclone up above him i cannot youre halfway into its world now where i cannot enter then how he screamed he saw his soldiers slowing as the last of the minor priests fell beginning to look around and beginning to perceive the center of the holocaust they were now in most of the surrounding smoke now limned with flame darting and dancing like things alive as they licked and drew on the bodies of the fallen a soldier dropped his sword in despair and fell to his knees the weight of the voice calling on them to despair built now that blood cooled and panic built break the key and break the binding that draws the thing here break the stave that is the center tregaran looked around wildly seeing the first of his troops fall as the fires strengthened by the bodies of the fallen lashed out at the living a soldier frantically defended himself using his blade to block the fistshaped tounge of flame that grew out of the bonfire punched through his armor and immolated him he had bare seconds to scream before writhing on the scorched paving stones his body alight in sickly red flames tregaran heard a second scream to his right a moment later and saw a third soldier fall across the square tregaran knew then what he had to do he threw his shield away and gripped his sword tightly in both hands he shook off the last feelings of despair and gathered his will into a single dart of purpose he lifted the blade over his head and charged the swirling pillar of flame cogern with the first battle just crested the hill and started the running slide down into the fight when the detonation blew him backward onto the scree the entire center of the village totally shrouded by flames and rising smoke blew outward the pressure wave tossing the smoke aside as it would a curtain the lurid red glow that marked the horizon faded then to something more normal an underofficer his armor scorched and one arm hanging free staggered into him warmaster thank vkandis the colonels down cogern followed at a run the bulk of first battle behind they passed into the center square where the bonfires had been snuffed by the blast a distant part of cogerns mind registered there was no wood in those fires only bones second battle lay scattered around the square some dead more hurt most stunned from the detonation in the center lay tregaran held by an openly weeping soldier nearby lay the blasted body of something with too many arms and a broken stave lay nearby cogern fell to his knees next to what was left of tregaran shiny skull showed at tregarans forehead and his fingers and armor appeared burned away strips of flesh hung from the colonels ruined body and sightless eyes stared up cogern wept freely the chirurgeon appeared from behind the men falling to his knees besides them he took a silvered mirror and held it to where tregarans lips had been by all thats holy hes alive cogern looked up tears pouring down his sooty face will he live the chirurgeon looked down then up no hes too badly hurt theres nothing we can do hes probably not even aware of us the firecat unnoticed sat to one side it had done what it could to take as much of the mans pain as he could he opened the door to the mans mind and began to ease him away better to end this now tregaran slipped into something like a dream he walked on a wide plain marked only by the dead herald and the horses head on the pike its not your fault you know she sat on a rock nearby her squarish jaw not a feature he liked she stood her acolytes chiton flaring around her and settling back her long lithe legs flashed as she jumped down from the rock and walked toward the herald you see this as what you fight for she said it was not a question you march your regiment from border to border defending those who pervert the way she gently took his hand between hers he could feel his scarred fingers rough against her smooth palm feel the scribes callus on the index finger against the back of his hand you lead your regiment to battle after battle you execute traitors condemned by laskaris word with not a peep in their defense you start wars you know are wrong execute orders you know are wrong and sent many a brave soldier to their deaths for a son of the sun you dont believe in each sentence softly spoken struck him like a physical blow yes he could but nod yes her cool hand brushed his face you saved those you could from the fires spared the wounded from pointless burning you did as you were sworn to do leading your regiment to battle to defend your country and enforcing those laws placed in your hands to enforce your doubt of your orders came often afterward in the full light of day and in growing realization of error when duty compelled and honor failed she smiled at him he inhaled her scent of honeysuckle and jasmine you have guarded your country obeyed those you swore to obey and held to duty when faith swayed she leaned down to him and kissed his brow your god is pleased with you tregaran i love you solaris he whispered and in cogerns arms he died the firecat lay still as the noon sun streamed down overhead tregarans body had been removed in great honor cogerns men had worked their revenge rooting out blackrobe sanctuaries all over the outskirts of sunhame it would be a miracle if even a few survived who lived within a days ride of the capital the cat felt the surge and heave of the gods presence even this far from sunhame as he made his own appearance by now laskaris would be dead and solaris ascendant a small tendril of that power settled at the place where a man gave his life for a woman for love a second firecat shimmered out of the void and stepped down it didnt seem to know exactly what to do with its tail was that me it said looking at the place where the colonel had died yes said the firecat your task now is to watch over her she is handmaid to our lord and she must survive i will said the new cat in the meantime said the old let me show you the joys of field mice they go best with toast the chirurgeon deserted the next morning a month later he knelt before his own bound liege arise healer and report said queen selenay of valdemar what of karse the blue coat by fiona patton fiona patton lives in rural ontario canada with her partner a fierce farm chihuahua and inumerable cats she has four novels out with daw books the stone prince the painter knight the granite shield and the golden sword her fifth novel the silver lake was published in hardcover by daw in she has twentyodd short stories published in various dawtekno anthologies including sirius the dog star assassin fantastic and apprentice fantastic spring had come late to the ice wall mountains although the warm afternoon breezes had brought the first of the tiny purpleandyellow flowers pushing up through the snow the passes were still closed and the nights still frosty and cold well into the season two figures each heavily bundled in hides and fleece and wearing thick caps made of the soft luxurious brown fur that gave the goshon clan its name walked single file along a narrow barely passable mountain path each carried a short hunting bow and several brownfletched arrows in ornate quivers at their backs and long knives waterskins and a brace of rabbits at their belts the older just past twenty years in age was tall and thin with a short length of beard and long dark hair plaited in several thick braids and tied with bits of hide the younger closer to fourteen or fifteen was cleanshaven lighter in coloring and more compact in build but still bore a striking resemblance to his companion as the path widened to reveal a small protected vale they paused to study the tableau below them with an apprehensive air a stout hide tent stood in the lea of a copse of pine trees with four shaggy ponies cropping at the dry grass before a ringed fire pit two figures one old the other young were the only people to be seen for a moment there was no sound except the piercing call of a hawk high above the trees and then the sharp painful birthing cries of their cousin dierna that had driven the two men from the vale that morning began again the younger backed up a step but the older put his arm about his shoulders and drew him forward theres nothing for it kellisin he said keeping his voice firm and even take the hares and prepare them but trey i know treyill kgoshon glanced over to where his brother bayne stood guard before the tents entrance the other man met his gaze then shook his head and trey nodded in resignation shersis doing all she can he continued handing kellisin his kill maybe a thick rabbit stew will help her and dierna both yes kellisin swallowed hard yes so go on then little cousin as the younger man made for the fire pit his face clouded with distress trey walked the short distance to where vulshin the familys shaman sat weaving his fingers through a thin trickle of water running down the rocks as trey touched him lightly on the shoulder the old man raised his head the expression in his rheumy gray eyes making words unnecessary trey crouched beside him its as you dreamed then he said studying the collection of stones and small bird bones lying on the ground before them vulshin nodded his seamed face gray and weary its as we both dreamed he corrected the babys breached shersi cant make it turn and diernas lost a lot of strength and a lot of blood just getting this far now the babys in trouble it cant breathe and theres nothing shersi can do he sighed deeply its only a matter of time trey picked up the largest of the stones squeezing it in his fist with a helpless gesture before dropping it once more how long dusk no later both men glanced up at the sun already well into its trek towards the horizon once there were so many of us vulshin noted sadly the voices of our people sang in my dreams like a chorus of sparkling water flowing down the mountains sides not like this pitiful little trickle he sneered waving a gnarled hand at the rivulet of water but like a torrent now sickness and clanfighting have silenced their voices one by one until the goshon are no more the people are scattered trey allowed the people are no more vulshin repeated sharply their voices have left my dreams i tell you we are the last and when dierna and her child pass from this world so will the goshon pass scooping the stones and bones into a small hide bag he fixed trey with a stern expression when this is over i want you to leave this place you and bayne and young kellisin theres nothing left for you here trey gave the old man a worried glance theres yourself and shersi shaman he said vulshin shook his head no shersi is old he said wearily old and sick the winter was very hard on her too hard and with our grandson aivars death coming before his child could even draw breath the strength to carry on has left her his expression drew inward she used to love the meadow flowers in springtime you know he said more to himself than to the younger man when we were children so many years ago we would go out seeking the earliest spring blossoms even if we had to sweep the snow away to find them sometimes our fingers would be red and stiff from searching but she would never return until she could bring a handful home to plait into our ponies manes now she couldnt walk as far as the edge of the camp to find them and my visions so poor i couldnt see to fetch them for her even if i tried he blinked a sudden welling of tears from his eyes she only waited this long to help dierna bring her child into the world but now he paused and the two men glanced unwillingly toward the tent where diernas cries had become noticeably weaker now my shersi wont last the week then well wait a week and afterward youll break camp with us no shaman you must we need you trey scowled at the desperate sound in his voice but kept his eyes on the older mans face regardless vulshin patted his arm with slightly more force than necessary no you dont he replied ive taught you all i can trey bayne will stand beside you as he always has and kellisin would follow you into a fire pit if you told him he could learn its nature rely on baynes strength kellisins mind and your own gifts and youll be fine but my dreams arent like yours trey insisted trying to curb the sudden panic he felt at the thought of losing the old mans guidance theyre hazy and unclear and even when theyre not they dont make any sense they will when you trust that they will youre strong so are your dreams strong enough to lead the three of you to a new life vulshin passed a hand through the rivulet of water once again i have only one dream left now and i dont want to see it through without my shersi ive never been without her you see i wouldnt know how he raised his eyes to the sky in this dream i saw a storm of unusual fury bury the hills again as if it were the middle of winter it will be our funeral storm well wait for it and ride it into death like a mountain pony together hand in hand he returned his attention to the younger man by that time youll have reached the pass it will be open and youll be safe pass the feral pass that leads south to the high hills and the terilee river trey blinked the goshon do not travel south shaman he reminded him gently teach your grandmother to suck eggs vulshin snapped youll travel south if i tell you to his gaze drew inward again south to the river and farther still to a place of stone and timber where music and sunlight stream in equal magnificence and where creatures of such magic and poetry as would take your breath away run freely over lush green meadows far away in the young kingdom of valdemar trey mouthed the unfamiliar word with a frown ive never heard of it as i said its a young kingdom and youre an even younger man what clan holds its territory no clan it lies far beyond their reach but you will have to travel past clan lands to get there stay by the river heed your dreams and youll pass through safely trey shook his head stubbornly but what kind of life could we make in such a place even if we could get there safely he demanded what do we have to offer poetry and music have no need for trapping and hunting vulshins eyes narrowed the land and the people will be strange and foreign to you thats true but a sharp eye and a courageous arm are always welcome if theyre offered honestly its their way besides i dreamed you there he closed his eyes last night i saw you standing by bright water wearing a coat dyed the deepest blue of a summer evening sky he opened his eyes again without noticing how pale trey had suddenly become so youre going he continued dont argue with me or ill give you a good smack when i shaman the two men turned to see bayne gesturing to them and trey suddenly realized how quiet it had become the old man nodded sadly its time he said help me up trey hesitated you dont think no treyill vulshin said firmly but not unkindly and neither do you their voices are no more come make your first goodbye its what must be done and you know it with a reluctant frown trey helped him stand then together the two men made their way across the vale toward the now silent tent the next morning after dierna and her stillborn child had been wrapped in hides and buried under as many rocks as the three young men could pry from the stillfrozen ground trey set bayne to breaking camp vulshin and shersi sat huddled together before the fire pit without speaking and to treys eyes it looked as if theyd already begun their final trek pausing only to wait until death could catch up with them mouth set in a grim line he began to wrap the seasons goshon pelts in oilcloth they would use them to barter their way south to vulshins dream kingdom of valdemar whatever the old shaman believed they were still trappers thats what they did and thats all they had to offer a new life regardless of their eyes or their arms beside him kellisin hovered about uncertainly until he sent him to help bayne load diernas pony with their extra supplies he could find no words to comfort him when he had none to comfort himself turning away from the injured look in the younger mans eyes trey picked up another pelt with deliberate care by the time the sun had reached its zenith they were ready trey made one last attempt to convince vulshin and shersi to come with them but the two older goshon were adamant its our right as elders to choose whether we break camp or remain behind shersi said her once strong voice weak and breathy its the way of our people you know that then choose to break camp with us treyill vulshin said sternly come it is time to make your second goodbye do it respectfully trey would have continued the argument afterward but finally bayne drew him away setting his reins into his hand his last sight of the vale was that of the hawk circling high overhead sending its mournful cry into the wind for good or ill the last of the goshon clan were passing from its world the three kinsmen made their way in somber silence for the better part of a week alternately walking and riding following what paths were open and heading roughly south when they reached the feral pass a thin mushy path winding its way through a narrow canyon of high jagged rocks they rode cautiously keeping a close eye on the walls of ice and snow that stretched high above their heads when they finally emerged on the other side they glanced back to find the sky above the mountain peaks had turned an ominous dark slate gray vulshins storm trey said heavily bayne nodded we have to quicken our pace they made the shelter of a rocky tor just as the storm hit huddled behind their ponies they waited it out and when they finally struggled free the next morning the pass behind them glittered with impassible snow trey narrowed his eyes against the glare well thats it then he said his voice devoid of emotion theres no going back now kellisin glanced over at him and vulshin and shersi he asked quietly gone we should never have left them taking hold of his ponys halter trey made his way back to the barely discernable path without looking back bayne shook his head we had to respect their wishes he said to kellisin catching him by the shoulder and pulling him into a rough hug to take the sting away from his brothers words life is seasonal and everyone breaks camp for the ride into death eventually little cousin i know that kellisin said his brows drawn down into a tight vee dierna and the baby was hard for us all but vulshin and shersi were old trey he shook his head helplessly it wasnt his choice to make treys a shaman bayne explained they take responsibility for everything so its up to us to remind him not to but in the meantime he caught hold of his own ponys halter we have to find a clear patch of fodder and some dry wood for a fire unless you want a cold breakfast kellisin smiled ruefully no all right then lets catch up to our ray of sunshine shall we before he falls off a cliff maybe some of your warm rabbit stew will lighten his mood kellisin nodded and together they followed trey down the path that night trey dreamed he saw vulshin standing in the midst of a winter storm so violent it blinded him one hand shielding his eyes the other stretched out before him trey reached out for the old man but just as their fingertips touched vulshin vanished under a sudden avalanche of snow trey sprang forward and falling to his knees worked frantically to dig his old teacher free but every time he thought he might have reached him another deluge of snow buried him again he cried out in frustration and awoke to find bayne holding him tightly rocking him back and forth as their parents had done when hed been a boy in the moonlight he looked so much like their father that trey gaped at him then the other man pulled back and trey was back on the cold ground south of the feral pass once again the next night he dreamed again only this time it was shersi who disappeared under a cascade of falling snow then dierna and her baby then aivar then vulshin again night after night he began to avoid sleeping altogether sitting wrapped in his blanket staring up at the moon for hours until exhaustion drove him to a few hours of broken rest he became gray and gaunt drawing farther and farther into himself and neither bayne nor kellisin could bring him out of it finally as the mountains gave over to rolling hills and valleys bayne joined him sitting staring up and the starcast sky before fixing his brother with a serious expression you have to stop this trey he said well be in foreign lands in a day or two and well need your insight knees drawn up to his chest trey shook his head i cant you have to youre our shaman we need you bayne frowned this isnt like you brother what is it scrubbing at the growth of beard along his cheeks trey took a deep breath do you remember the nightmares i used to have as a boy he asked after a long moment when bayne nodded he continued they were so real so vivid sometimes it was hard to tell if i was awake or asleep i saw storms and floods and fighting and everything i saw came true i saw our fathers death as clear as if it were happening right before my eyes i remember that was when vulshin began your training and the nightmares stopped the nightmares stopped trey agreed but not because vulshin began training me he closed his eyes the dreams always started the same way i was standing by bright swiftly flowing water wearing a dark blue coat the like of which ive never seen among the goshon i looked down into the water and i saw the future of our people his face darkened but our people had no future he grated and all i saw were bodies floating below the surface and just as vulshin heard them singing in his head so i saw them dying in mine and it hurt worse than anything else has ever hurt before or since one day it was just too much so i went into my dream and i took the coat off i buried it in a deep cleft in the rocks and the dreams stopped hurting they became hazy and unclear sometimes happening before and sometimes afterwards i saw aivars death and diernas and their babys but they didnt hurt not the dreams anyway he amended and vulshin and shersi trey nodded wordlessly and the dreams are hurting again yes but theres more the day before we left the vale vulshin told me that hed seen me in a dream standing by bright water wearing a coat dyed the deepest blue of a summer evening sky his very words bayne he fixed his brother with an intense stare i never told vulshin about the coat does that mean its back that even though i buried it it followed me here his brother gave him a skeptical glance its not a predator like a mountain cat he said how do you know i suppose i dont bayne was silent for a moment then stared up at the stars again when i was young i was afraid of the dark he said trey smiled i remember i still am sometimes what bayne shrugged why not the things i thought might attack me in the dark could still be therenow more than ever since were heading into foreign lands but it doesnt matter if theyre there or not and it doesnt matter if im still afraid or not i cant hide from the darkness anymore i have to stand against whatever might be hiding behind it for your sake and for kellisins its what i do i protect but im not that scared little boy anymore either im a man now with a mans strength just like you are and predator or not you may have to dig that coat up and put it back on make it a mans coat instead of a boys coat and make it your own he squeezed treys shoulder and whatever comes of it brother well face it together as kinsmen as clansmen and what if i see your death trey shot back or kellisins well face that together too thats what families do they stand together so that no one has to stand alone be they hunter trapper or shaman yes trey gave a long resentful sigh yes good bayne stood then pull yourself together youre scaring kellisin that night drawing on the warmth of baynes back pressed against his for courage trey reached out past the avalanche of snow and the deaths of his people and drew the blue coat from its hiding place in his dream it was damp and cold and covered in dirt much as it might have been in the waking world shaking it out he studied the silver trim along its length something hed never noticed as a boy before pulling it over his head it settled across his shoulders with an all but forgotten familiarity and once again he stood by the bright swiftly flowing water of his childhood dreams taking a deep breath he looked down but instead of bodies floating beneath the surface he saw a great walled city spiraling outward from a wide river valley a broad belt of green land lay beside a beautiful structure of stone and timber and he could almost hear vulshins music and poetry in the distance fighting back tears of relief he turned to the hazy figure standing in a meadow of spring flowers thank you shaman he breathed that night he had the first peaceful slumber since before diernas death and two days later the three men left the hills and looked down upon a vast open plain covered in tiny purpleandyellow flowers beyond that lay a wide swiftly flowing river bayne glanced over at trey the terilee he asked thats what vulshin called it whatever he called it i call it fresh water for drinking and for bathing kellisin said excitedly with a shout of joy he urged his mount into a gallop the pack pony close behind them the two older men followed more sedately but neither of them could hide the pleasure the sight of the clean blue water gave them as well that evening as they made camp trey collected a handful of the tiny blossoms and wove them into his ponys mane and that night he dreamed again he saw a wide but shallow quarry where strangely garbed people labored to cut great blocks of stone from the ground which were then loaded onto rollers pulled by great horned beasts and then loaded once again onto three oddlyshaped flatbottomed boats the cloudless sky above promised a clear and stormfree day but the dark forest beyond the southern bank whispered of hidden dangers behind the trees and the water below wavered with the hint of bodies beneath the surface he awoke with the familiar twisting fear in the pit of his belly after a cold breakfast they broke camp quickly and turned southeast following the river with their bows near to hand they saw no signs of settlements or encampments as they rode but rather than have this allay their disquiet after the initial excitement of reaching the river had passed all three men began to feel both uneasy and exposed the gently rolling countryside was too open and too empty for their passage to remain hidden the strips of woodland that grew right up to the waters edge too dark and the underbrush too thick to maneuver in easily time and time again they had to leave the riverbank to bypass some soft and crumbling escarpment or boggy patch of ground and strike north after three days of this baynes mood began to darken and kellisin started to lag behind his eyes constantly scanning the unfamiliar terrain trey was unable to break the tension his dreams had become as impenetrable as the woodlands themselves almost as if the blue coat were laughing at him for thinking he could overcome his childhood fears so easily however nineteen days after theyd left the familiar peaks and paths of the ice wall mountains the river flowed through a series of lightly wooded hills then opened up to reveal a group of huts built about a wide but shallow quarry a dozen people labored to cut away great blocks of the exposed stone while a dozen more loaded them onto log rollers pulled by heavyset horned creatures that looked like a cross between huge ponies and hairless mountain goats another dozen figures stood at key locations obviously guardsmen protecting the settlement while two women shouted orders from the first of three flatbottomed boats tied up at a sturdily built wooden and stone pier two of the boats were already loaded with the stone blocks the third half full hidden just beyond the tree line the three goshon stopped dead and kellisins mouth fell open isnt that yes trey answered and look at the color the guards are wearing bayne added meaningfully trey squinted down at the settlement its the wrong shade he declared after a moment trying to mask the sense of foreboding the sight of the bright blue uniforms caused him does it matter the other man asked yes it matters trey snapped back with rather more force than necessary and his brother raised his hands in a sarcastic gesture of submission all right so it matters but you have to admit its an interesting coincidence have you ever seen anyone wear any kind of blue cloth no i havent but until this moment id never seen anyone stand on floating rocks either beside them kellisin stirred restlessly impatient with the argument so are we going down for a closer look or not he demanded if you dreamed this place there must be a reason true then lets go down and find out what it is trey and bayne rolled their eyes at each other over his head life is always simpler for the young bayne noted sagely life is always slower for the old kellisin retorted and life is always a pushy series of inevitable events for the shamans old or young trey added so were going yes were going but cautiously he added grabbing the younger mans halter before he could go galloping down the hill cautiously little cousin all work ceased immediately as the three clansman broke from the trees and rode slowly into the open towards the riverbank one of the guardsmen gave a whistling signal and by the time they reached the pier an older woman in a leather apron and a man in the guardsmens bright blue uniform were waiting for them ringed by people most held their tools or weapons loosely but resolutely and trey gave bayne a casual sideways glance keep your hands away from your own weapons brother he said quietly believe me im trying to reining up trey dismounted i am treyill of the goshon he said this is my brother bayne and my kinsman kellisin were traveling south we have goods to trade you understand trade the woman nodded warily i am kith arkarus of waymeet the quarry master here she replied her accent thick and exotic but understandable this is captain danel of the valdemar guard trey couldnt help but show his surprise valdemar captain danel gave him a measured look you came through the crook back pass he asked the feral ah then youll have passed through no villages to tell you you crossed valdemars northwestern border some days ago were the farthest settlement in the area and the newest king restil is expanding the palace a new voice said excitedly the three goshon glanced up just as a young woman perhaps a year or two older than kellisin appeared on the top of one of the blocks of stone on the halfloaded barge this is gabrielle post the quarry master said dryly my niece apprenticed to havens master builder my father gabrielle supplied sent north to gain experience in the building trades haven trey asked the capital of valdemar and you will float this stone there tomorrow morning if the weather holds trey and bayne exchanged another glance youll be passing through a lot of wild country trey noted wild for the unwary maybe captain danel answered but were not unwary he added meaningfully and were not unprepared bayne smiled at the unsubtle warning im sure of it trey replied smoothly im told that a sharp eye and a courageous arm are always welcome in valdemar if theyre offered honestly for passage to haven i offer ours if any of your people have heard stories of mine youll know that this offer is made honestly the captain and the quarry master exchanged a glance while both bayne and kellisin tried not to look surprised we know of the goshon in waymeet the quarry master acknowledged though weve not seen any of your people in a generation or more she tipped her head to one side her expression speculative its said that you have an uncanny ability to track and trap the creatures your clan is named for trey smiled whats said is true and yes we have pelts to trade as well i think we can come to an arrangement then if the captain is willing what a strange craft this is an hour later with the negotiations between the quarry master and his kinsman complete kellisin lay stretched out on the pier studying the underside of the barge intently as the setting sun cast long orange fingers across the water crouched beside him gabrielle bobbed her head happily its a much better mode of transportation than sleds pulled by oxen she explained the river does all the work you see yes i do see but how does it stay on the surface with such a heavy load upon it magic what truly gabrielles laughter rang out like the pealing of bells no of course not the barge is built to distribute the load evenly and since its made of wood and wood floats so does the barge and whatever is placed on it evenly do you see he smiled up at her obviously content to simply hear the sound of her voice not really gabrielle she grinned down at him call me gaby i shall he glanced back at the barge what if winds or storms redistribute the weight oh then the barge would sink but if the barge sinks youd never be able to get the stone up from the riverbed would you she shrugged easily wed better hope it doesnt sink then my father said to bring him his stone or dont come home at all she laughed again im mostly sure he was joking mostly she cocked her head to one side did you want to see how we load the stone upon rollers she asked suddenly a little shy he smiled back at her suddenly less so yes i should like that very much he answered seated by a small fire on the edge of the settlement trey and bayne watched as gabrielle tucked their kinsmans arm into hers and led him off toward the quarry well it looks like he at least has ridden into our new life smoothly enough bayne chuckled trey nodded wordlessly thats good yes his brother prodded yes but but he isnt there yet trey said in a cautious tone and neither are we hmm staring up at the starlit sky bayne rubbed at a small scar on one knuckle this new idea of yours will likely see us there that much sooner though i wasnt expecting to float our way south when did you dream that i didnt and it might be a terrible mistake but but but as kellisin said i dreamed this place and its floating stone boats for a reason vulshin told me to that my dreams would make sense when i trusted them to do so and do you trey sighed not yet standing bayne swiped at his trousers well lets hope you do by the time we need you to im going to check on the ponies left on his own trey scowled at the image of the blue coat which seemed to form and reform in the flickering campfire yes he said doubtfully lets hope i do that night he dreamed of a hail of arrow fire coming from the southern trees and the next morning warned the settlement guards mounted an extra vigilant watch while gabrielle and the quarry master oversaw the loading of the final barge after giving her a curt hug the older woman held her out at arms length im sending you three masons and three laborers to help unload at haven but i want them back understood she said and the captain has steady company to see you safely there so dont be afraid gabrielle laughed at her granite makes an excellent shield auntie she said in a condescending tone and besides i have my fine northern clansman to protect me she shot a dazzling smile in kellisins direction and the quarry master scowled at her yes well be safe and come back to us if your father allows it youre a good worker tell my sister i said so i will catching kellisin by the hand gabrielle drew him onto the lead boat then waved jauntily as it cast off while beside them bayne and trey shared another rolling of their eyes thats all we need bayne whispered another colt to look after shh catching hold of one of the ropes lashed to the stones to steady himself trey elbowed his brother in the side as the three barges began to move slowly out into the water once theyd made they way into the current the barge captain an old man with a grizzled length of long braided gray hair squinted across the river with an egregious expression we wont be able to hug the northern bank for long he warned sooner or later were going to have to move into deeper water captain danel nodded let us know when its to be he said shafts at baynes shout gabrielle and her workers dove for cover while the six guardsmen and three goshon answered the hail of arrow fire with a volley of their own theyd been traveling for two days down the center of the river and in the last few hours had fought off three attacks from the southern bank one of the masons had taken an arrow through the arm and another had caught a graze across the cheek before the barge captain had pulled him to safety everyone had gotten much faster at reacting but as trey made his cautious way to baynes side he knew it wasnt going to last sooner or later they were going to suffer a real casualty his brother shot him a swift glance before rising slightly to send a shaft of his own streaking towards the trees the answering volley showed plainly that the enemy had not yet broken off the attack its a good thing they dont have any boats of their own or wed be in real trouble he declared they likely do theyre just softening us up first seeing if they can take out a few of our combatants before they make their primary attack and thank you for that my ray of sunshine do something then dream us out of this i have what baynes head snapped around when last night but you wont like it neither will captain danel theres going to be a fog we can either use it to slip past them or an enemy arrow cracked the stone block just above baynes head and he turned an exasperated look in treys direction as he ducked instinctively or what he demanded or theyll use it to mount an attack against us and warned we can set an ambush either way we risk injuries and deaths if its either way im all for an ambush myself as am i but theres a problem what the fog wont be for two days will they wait that long do you think trey gave the southern bank a narroweyed glare i dont know but im going to find out that night huddled beside the ponies tethered in the center of the barge trey struggled to sink down into sleep but the unfamiliar movement of the deck beneath him and the faint sounds of guards maintaining a constant watch all around him kept jerking him back to wakefulness with a growl of frustration he pulled the blanket over his head everything hed seen or dreamed and every decision hed made since leaving the vale seemed to hinge on this one final night and it looked as if he were going to spend it fighting his own restless fears in his minds eyes the blue coat seemed to shimmer with life hovering just out of reach its silver trim sparkling in the pale moonlight almost menacingly you may have to dig that coat up and put it back on make it a mans coat instead of a boys coat and make it your own yes i know bayne he said wearily im trying using the soft familiar scents of fleece and hide and ponies he forced himself to relax well face it together like a family just as you said but what if i see your death or kellisins theres been too many goodbyes already i cant face another one he closed his eyes i cant two days later in the early hours of the morning three small boats carrying half a dozen bandits in each pulled up alongside the first barge in the covering fog they swarmed over the low sides only to be met by total empty silence padding cautiously between the great stone blocks their leader made to signal that the barge had been deserted when a frightful apparition dressed in hides and furs rose up to catch his arm a piercing whistle filled the air and suddenly the deck was alive with people the apparition struck the leader down and violence erupted across the barge when the fog finally burned off in the wake of the morning sun the fight was nearly over taken completely by surprise the remaining bandits either surrendered or fled back to their own boats only to be shot down by a hail of arrow fire from the valdemar guardsmen their bodies floating just above the surface bobbed against the barge side and trey stared down at them for a long time before turning away on the deck the captain was kneeling before the body of one of his younger guardsmen the boy had taken a knife slash to the neck and had died instantly he glanced up as trey approached your kin are all unharmed he asked his voice thick trey nodded kellisin has a nasty cut in the left shoulder but gabrielles bound it up he should be fine thats good the valdemar man stared out at the water the barge captain tells me that we should make the village of deedun by late tomorrow he said we can prepare mariks body there and send it home to his family by road he fought bravely trey offered yes that will comfort his father the other man sighed but not his wife no your people fought bravely as well the captain continued and your aid as shaman he said hesitating over the unfamiliar word was invaluable my thanks he stared out at the water for a long time you said you were heading south to haven he asked finally yes i dreamed of it so did the eldest of our people haven has a need for what did you call it sharp eyes and courageous arms offered honestly yes i would be honored if you would consider another offer made honestly if the king agrees there could be place for all three of you among the palace guard if you were willing palace guard i thought your people were settlement guards my people are valdemar guards who go where theyre needed the captain replied stiffly not just settlement guards but i am palace guard on loan to gabrielle and her workers to ensure her safe return he smiled faintly the king values his master builders peace of mind and the master builder values his incautious daughters health and wellbeing trey frowned uncertainly its a fine offer he began but you need to think about it and consult my kin i understand take what time you need later after the barges had put in to the wharfs of deedun and the valdemar guardsmen had carried mariks body ashore trey told bayne and kellisin of captain danels offer tugging irritably at the edge of the bandage around his shoulder the younger man fixed his cousins with a firm stare we should accept he said this is good new life purpose arms a girl bayne added yes a girl a home family eventually children its everything we came south to find i agree we should accept they both looked at trey stood staring down at the water with a pensive expression trey bayne prodded yes he answered youre right we should accept but but i dont know theres something missing you dreamed of valdemar and of haven didnt you yes then trust your dreams like vulshin told you to if theres anything missing youll dream of that too and well find it together yes trey took a deep breath yes then go and tell captain danel that we accept shaman deedun was not a large village but nevertheless it took trey some time to find his way through the dizzying crowds of people on the docks finally he spotted one of the guardsmen he recognized standing at the entrance to a low wooden building and the man escorted him into the hushed anteroom at once captain danel stood before mariks body laid out on a long table and the silver trim on his formal uniform tunic flashed in the afternoon sun as he turned trey gaped at him in shock i thought valdemar guards wore bright blue he said weakly they do the captain answered palace guards wear coats the blue of a summer evening sky trey finished for him if you like we call it midnight blue he came forward you have an answer for me still staring at his tunic trey nodded slowly yes he drew himself up we accept if your king agrees the last of goshon clan will join the palace guard and make a new life in the south the captain smiled welcome to valdemar as he took his outstretched hand trey thought he saw a man and woman mounted on shaggy ponies with purple and yellow flowers in their manes vulshin and shersi smiled down at him then turned and melted into the distant mountains beyond safe and sound by stephanie d shaver stephanie d shaver lives in missouri with assorted cats and wooden swords she desings online games and websites for a living and has been very active in the development cycle of the upcoming mmorpg heros journey when she isnt talking to gamemasters and artists about the lifecycle of dragons she writes books and hopes to someday sell one or two or twenty you can visit her website at wwwsdshavercom do you think if i swallowed this whole book lelia mused eyeing the fistsized volume of songs she had taken off the shelf id get a bad enough stomach ache that theyd let me postpone the performance i think the healers would give you a bottle of preserved plum juice and tell you to cheer up malesa replied not looking up from where she was scribbling away furiously at her song and then the chronicler would probably flog you for eating one of her books mm lelia slumped in her chair peering about the collegium library with a disappointed scowl i guess youre right she opened the book to a random page and grimaced when she saw the title bright lady she muttered what now sun and shadow lelia closed the book with a thump everywhere i look malesa shrugged its a good story made better by good songs exactly everything that can be sung about sun and shadow has been and by better bards and yet every year some damn trainee thinks he or she can top the masters ah capricious youth malesa said dryly so why compete lelia railed on ignoring her best friend and yearmate there are other story jewels to plunder she picked up another volume this one bound in brown leather like this malesa finally looked up she frowned thats a journal the journal of herald daryann to be exact its fantastic sure malesa looked back at her sheath of papers except for the fact that she dies at the end and while its many things its not a story it is so no its a journal a diary a collection of events without a discernable plot antagonist or resolution she lifted her head and raised a brow or did you miss that class lelia scowled and thumped daryanns journal with her knuckles story or not its the untold stuff between the lines that matters look she flipped the book open to a point near the end here she mentions that her brother wil got chosen too and how proud she was of him and then two pages laterlast entry right before the raiders got her and her companion malesa leveled a look at her so can you imagine being him wil that is lelias eyes glazed over i bet hes got a story and i bet its no sun and shadow and i bet its very sad why is it you have this morbid fascination with dead heralds anyway malesa asked suspiciously its always vanyel this lavan that heyif the bards were right vanyel was quite a catch malesa sighed and shook her head glancing back at her parchments im done what lelia squeaked im done eight verses one bridge and a melody already in mind she looked up coyly you lelia groaned and buried her face in her arms oh lia malesa stood and patted her on the shoulder just write the song and get it over with but i dont know what to write lelia wailed into the table youre a bard trainee with a brother whos a herald trainee id think you could cobble up something if youre so opposed to borrowing from the classics lelia moaned inarticulately malesa patted her shoulder again itll come to you she clutched her papers to her chest im off to practice my masterpiece alone in the library lelia lifted her head and stared at the scuffed leather cover of herald daryanns journal what did you do wil she thought what did you feel when you found out she was gone she sat with her thoughts and her blank parchments until the heraldchronicler came around to put out the lights the next day didnt get any better it started with waking up lelia emerged from a fitful slumber to the sound of someone knocking on her door she sat up papers sliding off her chest to the floor and stared blearily forward as the knocking droned on she knew with a grim growing certainty that when she did manage to convince her legs to move it would be to open the door and throttle whoever had chosen to wake her on a rest day one moment she moaned coaxing her weary arms to pull on a lounging robe shed spent all night trying to pry a song out of her head and bits of parchment with halfscribbled lyrics and notations were strewn here and there they crunched underfoot as she crossed the room she knew before her hand dropped to the handle who was on the other side of the door the warm touch of the bond she shared with her twin easily cut through her stupor the door swung open her brother stood in the hallway dressed from head to toe in whites is this some sort of joke she blurted i did it he whooped crushing her in a hug they voted this morning me and all my yearmates gnhrr she replied he set her down grinning from ear to ear she sat down slowly on her bed her hands trembling whites hed finally earned his whites hed be on circuit soon enough hed terror struck her fast and hard she managed to regain her composure as he shut the door picked his way across the floor and took a seat in the only chair in the room you look great she said at last it hurt to smile but she forced one onto her face really good his grin faded whats wrong their twin bond wasnt legendary but it was strong enough he knew she was worried about something and she knew he wouldnt stop until he found what that something was enh she scrambled for an excuse it was ironic really her whole training rested on communication and yet she couldnt tell him that his becoming a full herald was the one thing she feared most her eyes lighted on the drifts of discarded paper she couldnt talk about her worry she couldnt lie to her twin but she could be creative im supposed to write a song she said looking more than passably worried and cant write it a knowing look lit his face mm and i know its going to affect the bardic councils voting on whether i should be made a full bard she shrugged focusing all her fear and frustrations into this one thing this song this damn song she said you think if i threw myself in the river and caught pneumonia i wouldnt have to perform his smile changed to a smirk i think some herald would jump in after you the healers would stuff you to the gills with foultasting potions and the bardic council would ask you to play from your bed drat she flopped back onto her pillows and closed her eyes then forced herself to ask the question she least wanted to know the answer to so when do you go on circuit she heard him shrug dont know there are only a few heralds ready to head back out into the field if i had to guessand if im lucky enough to be one of the first picks for my internshipi might get to go with herald wil when he heads out again lelias eyes snapped open go with who she asked herald wil she sat up and eyed her brother uh he said what she smiled wishing you had that mindtouch gift dont you dear sister he replied somberly i wish for that when im around any woman thats him lyle said pointing across the common room and speaking as quietly as he could manage amidst the din where lelia asked the brunette no the blond oh she squinted and then brightened ooooh havens hes not much older than us bwahaha you honestly frighten me sometimes any idea where his quarters are you still havent told me why you just then a knot of lyles yearmatesall dressed in sparkling whitescame flowing into the common room one spied lyle and instantly he was surrounded and carried off from the sound of things they were all intending on heading into haven to celebrate no matter lelia had her own work cut out for her she eyed the exits took the one closest to herald wils table chose a shadowy corner to stand in and then stood vigil on the door until he strolled out a book tucked under his arm she let him get a little ahead of her and started to follow the sun was setting when she emerged from the collegium the humid air heavy with the promise of rain her quarry was advancing toward companion field a white shape trotting out to meet him lelia slowed to a stop gnawing on her lower lip vexing very vexing she couldnt shadow him not with this much open land between them hed see her coming and then what she blinked realizing she was being stupid hes a herald he has to like you she lifted her chin go talk to him ask him your questions and write your song yes that was exactly what she would do herald wil leaned with his back to the fence his arms folded over his chest and his eyes halfshut its hot he confessed rains coming vehs replied good this weather is giving me a headache bards coming what he opened his eyes fully to stare at his companion just then he heard the crush and rustle of someone walking through grass turning his head he saw a small form in rustred walking toward him worse than a bard he thought at his companion its a bardtrainee pardon me mlord herald the girl said she was short and fineboned with straight black hair and dusky skin her voice was surprisingly low and mellifluous can i ask you about daryann wil stared at her for a moment dumbstruck then he gave her the best answer he could come up with on short notice malesa looked up with a raised brow as lelia stomped in and sat down no song she asked lelia growled inarticulately i had to go back and rework a couple lines on mine malesa admitted patting the parchments spread out on the library table i found i used light no less than five times in the first six verses lelia mumbled and snarled silly error really but thats what happens when you write something fast i found herald wil lelia said malesa blinked herald who the brother of herald daryann bright havens where hes back from circuit lelia continued through gritted teeth i spotted him in companions field she was omitting some truth by phrasing it that way but she didnt think malesa would care that she had been stalking the herald i went up to him and asked a question and malesa asked chin in hand he said no lelia looked down at the brownandgray quill malesa had been using do you think if i stabbed myself in the eye with that thing plenty of stories about blind bards playing harp maybe if i got ink poisoning malesa smirked so he said no emphatically actually what hed done was swung up onto his companion and ridden off and the look hed given her fit to freeze hellfires she thought with a shiver what did you say malesa asked can i ask you about daryann did you introduce yourself not exactly she said slowly you just went up and asked him hey about that dead sister of yours well when you put it that way malesa put her head in her hands oh lia what its a wonder sometimes that youre a bard you have the tact of a stud in heat lelia bristled it was an honest question theres honesty and then theres rude did you even stop to consider his feelings lelia scowled and stared at the table shed expected comfort and commiseration from malesa not a tonguelashing on the ethics of questioning a subject i just wanted to know lelia muttered so what are you going to do now lelia thought about it for a moment seduce him she said decisively please tell me you jest lelia wiggled her eyebrows well you have fun malesa stood up collecting her scrolls im off to practice the bridge of my stunning piece of genius fine leave me to my misery lelia waved her off then leaned back in her chair and stared at the ceiling this she said to no one in particular is going to be a challenge lelia was anxious and fidgety all through class and morning chores most of which involved restringing harps and lutes the humidity had broken with a brief rain but the result had been many outoftune instruments and much trainee busywork at the lunch bell lelia skipped the bardic common room and instead retrieved a bandolier of knives from her quarters and took herself out to the practice salle even the weaponsmaster had to eat sometime and there was no one outside to watch her as she threw over and over the handleless blades landing dead center more often than not nice grouping a voice behind her said as she was pulling her last knife out of the wooden target didnt know they were teaching bards these things lelia spun startled standing behind her his face half in and out of the salles shadow was herald wil she regained her composure quickly my parents are gleemen she pushed damp sweaty hair out of her eyes i learned knifetricks from my grandmother his brows lifted i see she tucked the knives away into their sheaths anything to keep herself from fidgeting um about yesterday yes about that he pushed away from the salle i behaved coarsely i apologize she nearly squealed with glee and had to resist the urge to fall on her knees and praise the bright lady you do exist she thought does that mean i can ask you some questions about daryann she asked he smiled warmly turned around and started to walk away herald she called her hopes crashing to the ground once more is that a no i just wanted you to know that im not angry at you and im sorry if i acted like a brute he yelled back waving his hand good day trainee wait she called desperately to his departing back he stopped looking over his shoulder at her i her mouth opened and closed i really need a song do what every bardtrainee does he replied write about sun and shadow and then he laughed he laughed she sat down in the grass watching him disappear oh she said her eyes narrowing i think not later as wil was taking an early evening stroll through the field with vehs he caught a flash of red out of the corner of his eye it was the bardtrainee girl she was charging toward him as fast as the tall grass and her own short legs would let her what he said herald she yelled i just want to ask you a few questions good gods wil blurted that famous bardic stubbornness vehs actually sounded amused get me out of here wil mumbled swinging up onto his companions back at your service mlord as wil was coming out of the library after a satisfactory read he heard the slap of boots behind him herald a familiar voice called herald just a moment of your time his legs were longer than hers and in better shape he outran her but only just alone in a hallway and coming back from lunch wil was startled when the girl popped out from behind a velvet curtain and flung herself on him i just want to know she panted as he wrestled out of her grip i just have a few questions to ask he managed to escape to his room again and threw the latch in case she grew more ambitious after that he was on the lookout for any trace of rustred or boots peeking out from under curtains and tapestries and quick to avoid the small persistent girl the moment she came into view i have to question the ethics of this question all you want lelia said tossing her hair and giving malesa a glare he laughed at me and youre inquiring about his dead sister thats called tasteless its been ten years malesa she flailed her arms frantically ten years he has to have found peace with it by now would you if it was lyle lelia flinched but ignored the question muttering she deserves a spot in the bardic repertoire malesa eyed her are you saying that because you actually believe it or because it justifies your behavior lelia snorted derisively besides even if you think it malesa continued he obviously doesnt he laughed at me a herald she pushed her head out of a window and yelled in the direction of companions field just what kind of people are you choosing nowadays a passing page gave her a strange look she growled back sending the boy scurrying away with a squeak you worry me malesa said oh go get chosen already you sound like my brother lelia stopped at a door speaking of which she opened it and stepped inside lyle never did lock his door he was just so damn trusting sometimes many of his belongings had already been moved to his new suite but a few things remained and yes there at the foot of his bed was a chest and inside lelia laughed darkly as she pulled out a gray shirt and pants astera bless a fool malesa moaned wil sat down at a table apart from the others there was really no quiet place in the common room but this was far enough away that he could hear vehs think if he needed to he also had an excellent vantage of all entrances the moment he saw a rustred figure walk in he would walk out why not sit with the others vehs asked i like being alone vehs gave a purely mental sigh wil was wiping up a large lump of meat and parsnip with a chunk of crusty bread when someone sat down next to him a voice purred in his ear heyla herald he looked to his left and into the face of the blackhaired bardtrainee in grays no not uniform grays gray shirt and pants but not grays uh he said you can call me lelia did she get chosen he thought at vehs suuure and i sprout gryphon wings in the moonlight uh wil repeated tell me your story herald she said in a low voice thats all i ask youre walking a fine line he said nodding to her gray but not gray clothing her hard eyes remained fixed on him one story wont take long i just want to know what happened to daryann wils blood boiled at the sound of his sisters name he pushed away from the table excuse me she made a grab for his sleeve herald he jerked his head to where elcarth sat several tables down one more word wil growled and i tell him what youre up to bardic immunity or not i doubt very much the dean would be pleased to see how youre behaving lelia released his sleeve and wil slipped out wil sat down on his bed and rubbed his eyes the effort to calm down after his last encounter with the bardic pest had left him exhausted mentally and physically that damn girl we might be heading back to circuit sooner than anticipated he thought to vehs poor chosen poor poor chosen its nothing to be amused about oh i disagree i think its hysterical wil sighed deeply shes defiling daryanns memory by writing a song about her legacy thats not really defiling its not her place but dont you think its time you told someone a cold knot crept up from wils stomach to his throat memories welled up unbidden the acrid smell of herbs and wineetched lines around dark eyesthe soft shush of hair sliding over crisp linens as her head turned toward himthe gaunt pale face whittled to a wax doll parody by pain he shoved the memory rudely aside no he replied he stretched out on his bed abstaining the covers he preferred an old loose shirt and breeches to smothering layers of bedding bit by bit he drifted toward the borders of dreaming relaxing gently into sleeps embrace it was strange just how relaxed he was and his feetthey were nice and warm and his eyes snapped open someone was rubbing his feet he yanked his legs back and sat up belatedly he realized hed forgotten to latch the door there was just enough moonand starlight coming through his windows that he could see an alltoofamiliar fineboned face at the end of his bed thats it he roared at her swinging out of bed and bearing down on her get out leave me alone leave her alone lelia stared at him her mouth wide open i she started to say out she backed away from the murderous rage in his eyes turned and ran he heard a faint sob as she fled wil slumped back onto his bed ah lord he mumbled rubbing his forehead ah hellfires lelia bolted back to her quarters halfsobbing the whole way wils anger had been startlingoverwhelmingterrifying the only thing she could think to do was run from it she opened the door to her room reaching for the laces of the gray shirther twin sat in the chair by her bed his hands folded in his lap lelia froze in place the heat of embarrassment creeping across her cheeks heyla lyle said softly she shut the door her hand falling to her side that shirt doesnt fit you know he said and then sighed whats wrong lia she shook her head sitting down on the bed and not looking at him nothing im worried about you he said so is malesa she and i talked tonight lelia grimaced at the implications of that lyle sat down next to her putting his arm around her shoulder thy heart is heavy little songbird the familiar comforting sound of her childhood dialect crushed her pitiful attempts to shut him out i think i did a bad thing she whispered what could be that bad her words emerged as halting halfincoherent sentences she told him her fear of never finishing the song that would make her a full bard her days stalking wil and the disastrous consequences of intruding on the herald in his bedchambers the frightening display of anger that had sent her scurrying for her room when she finished lyle sat quietly mulling over the tale in his bedchambers he said at last she ducked her head i didnt see anything you violated his privacy she slumped you should apologize to him he said i should apologize to him she echoed listlessly and maybe ill get him as a circuit mentor and i can explain to him my crazy bardsib the word circuit crashed down on her shoulders like a lead church bell in a fit of recklessness lelia blurted the words shed never dared given breath before youre going to die what he knelt in front of her taking her hands in his she felt his concern and love down the line of their bond so fiercely it startled her no lelia youll be leaving me at the very least she said half hysterical tears streaming down her cheeks gods lyle do you know how many stories i know do you know how many times i hear about the heralds who dont return from circuit do you know what happens to a twin when the other one she couldnt finish it the growing dread in her heart made her feel like shed already said too much im so selfish she said shaking her head y eah he agreed when she gave him a startled look he grinned lia its not a bad thing i see you as my balance given half a chance id beat myself to death to help others i need you to remind me that sometimes its okay to help myself he touched her shoulder i worry about you too you know in a few months youll be wandering out there on your own who knows what trouble youll run into without me around to balance you out why couldnt you have been a healer she asked not smiling or a bard why couldnt you be like me were supposed to be twins he laughed but there was a brittleness to it bright lady bright havens she crushed his hand in hers how i wish you didnt have to go they sat together in the darkness holding hands just as they had during thunderstorms as littles she couldnt imagine a world without lyle in it to give her comfort to bear her through the storms she just couldnt lelia got up early the next morning dressed once again in rustred shed lain in bed all night struggling to come up with a plan for dealing with wil and the damage shed caused before breakfast she hiked down to companions field and went hunting it didnt take her long the companion she searched for was wide awake he even seemed to be waiting for her heyla she said approaching him youre wils companion right the stallion tossed his head well i know very well youre probably smarter than me she said i also know i owe some things to your chosen she reached up and scratched his neck so i need to ask you a favor and she told him her plan much to her surprise he nodded in agreement wil didnt see lelia all the next day or the next as the candlemarks passed his discomfort outgrew his ability to ignore it by dinnertime he was wrestling with the twin serpents of guilt and anger why should he feel guilty she was the one intruding on his life she was the one who refused to leave him alone she damnit he muttered as he sat down to eat by himself in the common room it didnt matter what she had done he had lost his temper he had raised his voice he was better than that or supposed to be he was the one with a cartsized otherworldly horse on his side dinner ended quickly but the selfflagellation remained he wandered back to his room lost in the emotional push and pull of anger and shame he stopped in front of his door a note was pinned to it with one of lelias knives he gritted his teeth took it down and opened it up it read if you want to see your companion again come to the grove chapel in one candlemark signed l he stared for a moment dumbstruck vehs he thought where are you oh chosen vehs thought back please save me the evil bardtrainee has me and this is not funny she refuses to play anything but my ladys eyes its awful chosen this is ridiculous wil mumbled ah gods shes invented a chorus to it save me im going to kill you both he sighed lelia wasnt playing my ladys eyes when wil strolled up she was sitting on a stump and playing but the song shed chosen was one from his own sector of valdemar a piece by the bard faber called seven white horses vehs lingered nearby a loose bit of rope around his neck shed tied him off to a dead sapling he could have snapped without breaking a sweat her strings grew silent as wil approached she put the lute in its case closed it with a snap and walked over to vehs untying him and tucking the rope into her belt she stood on tiptoe whispered something in his ear and then gave the companion a kiss on one plump cheek vehs looked away to wil he seemed to be blushing lelia approached wil and looked up at him he steeled himself be calm he thought whatever you do be calm be gentle youre a herald damnit act like one im sorry she said she patted him on the arm as she walked away wil blinked stupidly caught off guard an ache started in his heart and throat and grew the longer he stood there damnit wait he said her footsteps continued to fade away wait he said again turning toward her she started to run lelia didnt want to know anymore she ran through the grove like an arrow aimed at the collegium shed write somethingshe had toand it would be terribleand unoriginaland it would probably be about sun and shadowand it would probably get her kicked out of the bardic collegiumand she would have to go back to juggling knives with her familybut she didnt careshe didnt careshe a white shape flashed to her right vehs leaped in front of her she flailed to a stop sliding in the grass and leaves clutching her precious lutecase to her chest she fell on her back and stared up at him wil frowned down at her from companionback wait he said stubbornly she blinked flinging tiny bits of tears from her lashes he dismounted and sat down next to her justwait crickets sang nightingales warbled vehs white coat shone like moonlight a silent challenge to the growing darkness she didnt die immediately wil said at last it took a month her companionhe carried her all the way to haven and then collapsed hedied she should have too but she didnt she held on the healers didnt know why for the longest time and then one day she woke long enough to mindspeak something vitalsome bit of intelligence shed been holding on to i was there i saw her eyes when she slipped awayto the havens somewhere a frog gulped lelia said nothing and made no move except to breathe the whole heraldic circle was in a fury wil continued everyone wanted the raiders who did it to her it was a mess he stared numbly into the darkness to his surprise he felt lelias callused fingers close over his hand she fought going he said because of duty she had to fulfill it and to say goodbye he looked at lelia startled what to you to say goodbye to me why she gave him a confused look havens wil she loved you why wouldnt she want to say goodbye wil blinked stupidly thunderstruck by the obviousness of her statement in ten years the thought so simply expressed to him now by a bardtrainee had never once occurred to him his shoulders tightened and the aura of a headache threatened hed avoided it for so longthe memory of that moment when daryanns eyes had opened the clamor of the healersthe shouts for a heralddaryanns head had turned toward him like a northneedle gravitating toward its inexorable position he pushed past the pain of the loss and allowed himself to finally really remember that moment she had seen him she winked he said slowly she winked at me something inside him broke free he felt as if an old weightone hed forgotten was therehad been lifted away lelias hand slid off of his he heard the lutecase open and the hum of the disturbed strings as she pulled it out notesbittersweet and hauntingrose from the belly of the instrument hanging in the air lelia sang bring them home she began directing the lyrics at vehs white guardian and it just kept going from there she knew as it bubbled out of her that it wasnt a sixverse piece of genius the lyrics werent terribly clever the melody had none of the flash of my ladys eyes but it came straight from her heart the truest expression of what she felt it was exactly the song she could write at that moment it was complete it was hers and it was enough the grove had fallen into silence by the time she finished not really about her she said at last more for her than about her i think the bridge needs work and itll do wil said she rubbed her lutes neck you think so i do she nodded me too the morning of her performance lelia got up at dawn and wandered down to watch as lyle put the final touches on saddling rivan where are you headed she asked west he replied not quite evendim but close forst reach dont know if youve heard of it ashkevron holdings her eyes flashed ive always wanted to see the famous manor he smiled ah yes i forget that i speak with the kingdoms greatest authority on dead heraldic heroes only the pretty ones she eyed her twin critically youll say hello to mother and father oh hellfires are they out that way lyle he grinned if i can youll stay away from trouble of course and at the first sign of danger youll ride straight back to haven and let the army handle it he nodded solemnly i promise she smiled and stood up on tiptoe throwing her arms around him be safe she whispered in his ear if we meet not in this haven he whispered back we shall meet in another she let him go and then turned toward rivan bring him home she sang to him the stallion tossed his head in a companions nod wil strode in decked out in riding leathers are you two ladies going to stand around clinging to each other all day or are we going to leave he asked glowering i believe my instructor is not what one might call a morning person lyle said in a mock whisper to lelia surely she whispered back he could take lessons in charm from alberich bright lady wil rolled his eyes ill have to ask the dean what i did to deserve this he nailed lelia with a look i need to have a word with your sister lyle alone yes mlord herald lyle said bowing his head and beckoning to rivan the two walked out leaving wil and lelia in the stable yes she asked he took a step forward extending a fist his fingers uncurled revealing a silver necklace with the shield of valdemar hanging off it for you he said for luck she blinked reaching out and taking it gingerly his fingers closed over hers she looked up at him startled well come home he promised her then bent down and kissed her on the forehead youll come home she agreed her heart thumping in her chest he turned and started to walk away youll come home she yelled running at him and jumping on his back he grunted as she threw her arms around his shoulders and hugged him fiercely lelia slid down and stepped away grinning like a fool wil looked back once a faint smile on his face the hooves of the companions chimed as the two heralds rode out heading for haven proper and the rest of the kingdom they served malesa leaned over and whispered nervous nope lelia grinned tapping her necklace did you finish your song yes and who gave you that lovely necklace lelias grin widened i see malesa raised a brow what makes you smile so dear because the councils going to vote soon she said and when im a journeyman bard i know exactly where im going really oh yes lelia smiled ive always wanted to visit the birthplace of the last heraldmage song for two voices by janni lee simner janni lee simner has published nearly three dozen short stories including appearances in gothic ten original dark tales on the labels of story houses coffee cans and in the first valdemar anthology sword of ice her next novel tiernay west professional adventurer will be published in visit her web site at wwwsimnercom garens voice this is not some heralds ballad we holderkin are practical folk and we know what matters sun and land wheat and hay breaking horses to saddle protecting those in our care these are the things you should ask about if you wish to know our ways the story you ask for instead ought to be none of your concern yet holderkin pay their debts and you say this is the only payment youll accept know this then i was content even before nara came i care for my steading which was my fathers before raiders sent him to the god ten years past i care for my first three wives and my two brothers and my oldest son who works beside me in the fields i care for my littles even those too small to work ive seen you heralds scowl you think holderkin men care only for themselves yet i know well enough the gifts the god has granted me and i give thanks for them just as i give thanks for the winter day last year when i visited my cousin jeth to trade a surefooted plow horse for some wool as i followed jeth into his hall i heard a high sweet song above the crackle of the fire and the whir of the spinning wheel birdsong i thoughtbut the voice was human a girls voice i looked across the room and saw her bent over the spinning wheel dark hair hiding her face she sang of a time when the goddess freely wandered the fields feet bare and hair unbound before she met the god a womans hymn men do not sing it yet hearing her something inside me woke and grew restless and yearned to answer the song my fields and hall seemed suddenly small simply because her voice wasnt in them you say such things are known in your ballads and your lives but they are not known here the girl looked up and her hair fell back revealing dark eyes and pale skin she looked at me without shame and i met her overbold gaze she fell silent then her song unfinished and without warning she smiled i smiled back her face grew red and she leaned back over her spinning i knew then that i could not leave without her i turned to my cousin your daughter i said for this had to be one of his daughters do you intend to arrange a marriage for her soon naras voice you ask for our story i do not know how to tell a story i only know that until i came to garens steading i was not content i had my work in my fathers home endless spinning and weaving and cooking and caring for littles the work needed doing i understood that i understand it still is it different in the north here we know that every person is sacred in the eyes of the goddess put in the place we are put given the work we are given because that work matters and is meant for us yet knowing this i still longed to walk the barren ridges to look out over the narrow valleys to feel the wind tangling my hair when i was younger id spent my days outside on sheep watch and been happy but that was long ago before i was replaced by littles too young for other tasks by the time garen came my days were mostly spent indoors with my mother and my sisters and the other wives of the steading but the goddess never gives us a task without also giving us what we need to complete it and what she gave me was song i sang as i worked hymns and teaching songs songs no one could find improper the work went better when i sang the walls and roof felt less near the wind and sun less far i was fortunate my fathers firstwife welcomed my songs perhaps because the littles also worked better when i sang then a stranger entered my fathers hall and met my improper gaze andi do not know how to say this when i looked into his gray eyes i saw open fields and the spaces between clouds for the first time i thought maybe marriagethe marriage i knew my father must arrange soon or latemight be more than just another set of walls garens voice of course i left without her that day there was the dowry to negotiate and the priest to consult and the ceremony to arrange but at last we knelt together beneath the open sky the men and the women of our households around us it was one of those rare spring days when the sky is so blue you fear it will break in two exposing the first level of heaven above but i forgetyou dont believe in heaven only in endless havens and countless gods with none to tell which is true the priest chanted the ritual prayers we gave the ritual responses and if my attention was more on the curve of naras neck and the sun on her bound hair than on my own words still i meant those words at last the priest asked for our vows do you garen aranson vow to serve the god and honor the goddess to defend your steading and your fields your brothers and sons your daughters and wives i do so vow and you nara jethsdaughter do you vow to serve the god and honor the goddess and to obey your husband and your elder wives in all things nara smiled i do so vow the priest drew us to our feet i looked into naras dark eyes they seemed as large as all the sky i could have gazed at her forever but then she bowed as the ceremony demanded and stepped back to join the women of my household showing she accepted her place as one underwife among many the priest sang a hymn then recounting the first meeting of god and goddesswhen the goddess grew restless and wandered beyond her realm and could not find her way back both households joined him in that song all but me the god gave me no gift for singing and i knew my voice would be no tribute nara stood with my other wives her shoulders straight her eyes cast properly down she sang with my other wives her voice no louder than theirs yet somehow her song rose above the othersand though i knew better her voice still seemed not one among many to me but its own distinct naras voice i was happy married i did not expect that garens firstwife latya had work for me of course laundry and cooking cleaning saddles grooming horses mending tack but often that work took me outside where i could linger over the blooming of orange paintbrush and purple lupines where i could watch the shifting gray clouds i sang beneath those clouds and i sang in the hall too so long as the work was done and done properly latya did not complain it is true that proper and improper matter a great deal more to latya than to my mother or even to my fathers firstwife latya expects hair to always be bound and collars to always be buttoned and tunics and leggings to always be ironed beyond creasing yet i am dutiful as much as i am able i did not see garen often those first months save for mealtimes and the nights he came to my room he had his work just as i had mine but sometimes i would turn from grooming horses to see him in the stable doorway silent listening to me sing he would smile and i would smile back and the stable walls would seem to fall away as if we stood together beneath the sky just as we had on our wedding day my work somehow always seemed lighter after one of those meetings but i am telling this out of order before the stables there was the first time garen came to my room the night we were married i was shy and afraid my mother had told me to expect pain yet garen was slow and gentle as concerned for me as for himself when we came together i felt as if we were closer than skin and bone should allow felt as if we shared a single body a single space afterward i pressed my body close to his not wanting to let the feeling go yet knowing that all things fade in time garen brushed my loose hair aside and he whispered in my ear i am glad you have joined my steading i am glad too i said and meant it with all my soul the times after have been like this too more often than not is it so for everyone or only for us it seems immodest to ask garens voice lying with nara is not like lying with anyone else my first three wives are dutiful they give what is required but they draw away from me when that duty is done and i from them i dont linger in their beds as i do in hers i could lie with nara every night if not for my other wives i could spend my days watching her if not for the work of my steading but that is not for you to record and it is not for sharing with your fellow heralds say instead that spring turned to summer summer to fall the seasons in the order the god set them raiders attacked other steadings and holdings but spared mine latya bore another son and my second underwife isa a daughter nara showed no signs of bearing children but she was good with the littles like me they seemed to listen for her song one stormy afternoon i entered the common room to hear nara singing as she twisted dried grasses to rope while wind pounded the walls and hail pounded the roof the littles sorted grasses by length around her nara sang of janias ride you do not know this song it is a holderkin song about a maiden whose brother was killed by raiders while they were on sheep watch the raiders dishonored the girl but she escaped riding alone through darkness and storm to warn her steading of the attackers she knew her duty you see she delivered the warning first only afterward did she take her life to keep her dishonor from her family yet when nara sang this song i heard more than duty and honor i heard the joy of hooves on stone of rain on skin of wind through hair i longed to sing with my wifebut no id not sully her verses with my rough voice instead i smiled as i listened entranced as the littles nara did not look up but she smiled as well then latya entered the room her arms full of laundry i looked away from my underwife but not before latya saw my lingering gaze latyas frown made that clear enough i see you dont understand you know only that a holder is free to do as he will and he is the god made that clear long ago but the god lives in his heaven with only his one goddess i have four wives and latya is first among them she oversees the work of hearth and hall waking before dawn to do much of that work herself i value my firstwife and i would not have her think otherwise so i decided i would be more careful but my gaze drifted to nara again before i left the room and again it was latya not nara who saw naras voice one stormy afternoon latya changed all the tasks she set before me she did it abruptly without warning or reason at once my work was entirely indoors scrubbing rooms tending the fire but not gathering the wood mending clothing but not mending tack i saw latyas displeasure clearly enough though i did not know what i had done to earn it and she did not explain i did not complain of this instead i turned to my new work and to a song determined to regain the firstwifes favor i sang of how the goddess urged the sun to rise in the gods realm of how she coaxed golden wheat from the hard soil to ease her loneliness far from home for the first time latya frowned at my song dear nara she said i know youve been lonely away from your home and so ive not spoken of your singing until now but in truth it is not proper and it disrupts the work i must ask you to stop i opened my mouth to protest closed it again i was a new wife a young wife id vowed before the goddess to obey my elder wives as surely as id vowed to obey my husband you look troubled by that is it true that in the north a woman has only her one husband to obey and no other wives in truth i was troubled too i had not understood that obeying my other wivesobeying other womenmight be harder than obeying my husband i told myself there was time enough for things to change latyas displeasurewhatever its causewould wane and i would be assigned other duties performed in places where i could sing unheard and trouble no one i told myself i could wait i reminded myself that the goddess never gives us tasks we cannot handle yet as the weeks went on i felt as if my unsung words were choking me my only comfort came the nights garen visited my room but that was a fleeting thing gone once we parted leaving me alone in a room that felt smaller every day garens voice nara stopped working outside she stopped singing inside i didnt know why i knew only that the days felt longer without her voice and the nights i went to her room she seemed far away from me even when i drew her close i asked if anything troubled her more than once but she just shook her head yet i knew something was wrong knew it in a way that went deeper than reason fall gave way to an early winter though not before we got the harvest in silence and cold settled over my steading i had good offers on the geldings i brought to saddle not only from holderkin but also from the villages to our north who are learning that holderkin horses bear work and bad weather with less complaint than their own i offered you one of those horses but you wanted this story instead a holder would have taken the horse and been long gone but what you need to know is my steading was prospering yet my fourth wife was not content and i did not know why i knew only that because of this i was not content either it was with these thoughts that i set out with my oldest son ari to fix fences on midwinter day understand that i was worried about my wife not about myself naras voice no one knows when the world will changewhen an offer of marriage will come or a woman grow heavy with child or an early frost damage the crops and turn an easy year into a hard one i was uneasy all midwinter day once i stopped at a jabbing pain in my leg and nearly dropped the mugs i was carrying to the table latya asked if i was well and i assured her i was but my uneasiness grew even as the pain faded i knew something was wrong so i was the only one not surprised when the pounding came at the doors i think i even shouted garens namebefore those doors were opened i dont remember clearly what i do remember is that ari and a stranger in white carried garen inside garens clothes were splattered red a raiders arrow jutted from his thigh later i would realize that you were a herald and a woman and that though you came upon the raiders by chance you fought alongside my husband and his son you broke three ribs doing it you were injured too and would need time here to heal later it would surprise me that a herald would fight for holderkin but just then i knew only that i ran with the others to garens rooms i kept thinking about the brothers id lost to raiders and of how losing garen would be so much worse it would be likelike losing wind and sky i know that sounds foolish i am sorry i have no better words for such things isa removed the arrowher mother is a midwife and taught her some doctoringwhispering thanks to the goddess that the point was not barbed she cleaned the wound and bandaged it blood soaked through the white linen far too fast i dont like to remember this the coppery smell of the room my husbands pained breathing the unsteady beat of his pulse i knew i could not lose him i knew i could not leave him latya argued with me then she set me to watching over him instead but you are to call me the moment you see any change she said and i saw her own care and worry clearly enough you seem surprised i dont see why do you think holderkin women dont care for their husbands if what you tell me is true perhaps what latya felt was not what i felt but she would have mourned garens death just the same for a time i sat by garens side his eyes were closed and i called his name as if that would open them then i fell silent chiding myself for thinking he might wake just because i bid him to what man had ever done anything because of a womans voice instead i took his hand in mine i wondered how i would survive the long years ahead alone i thought that alone in a thriving steading among many men and wives i would be alone without this one man the walls of his bedchamber seemed very near i thought perhaps i would go mad indoors alone all my days i remembered janias ride and for the first time i understood its end i understood the despair that led jania to take her own life and i knew that her fate could be my own in that moment there was only one thing i could do i sang did you expect otherwise i had not forgotten latyas command but disobedience could be punished and forgivenlater when i stood safe beneath the light of day even if garen were meant to die i could not believe the goddess wanted my life too i sang janias song softly at first i lost myself in wind and rain in the pounding of hooves i forgot the ceiling and walls around me i did not forget garen though when it came time for jania to take her life my voice faltered i heard again my husbands ragged breath i felt his clammy hand in mine i couldnt sing of death not with death so near but then garen squeezed my hand though he shouldnt have had the strength for it sing he whispered his voice hoarse and fierce so i sang not of janias death but of a second escape of how she knew she could not remain with her family dishonored so instead she retreated to the barren ridges and narrow valleys she loved well and rode there all her days a foolish ending i know it would not happen that way but i have sung no other ending since my voice rose i barely noticed garens grip remained tightremained strong i sang the song through again and again my voice gaining strength with each repetition i did not hear the door open i knew only that when at last my voice fell silent you and latya both stood in the doorway watching me i looked down face hot avoiding your stares leaning over my husband instead his pulse was strong his breathing even he still held my hand you latya began i am sorry i said swiftly i was tired and the watch was long you saved him latya said again you are surprised yet latya is not foolish she understands what needs understanding she knows now that my song was needful and she will not forbid me song again holderkin women are practical more practical perhaps than those who let white horses decide their fate that was disrespectful i am sorry at any rate you know as well as i what you said next your words were strange to me are strange still i did not realize you said that there were lifebonds among holderkin you said you wished to know our story i do not know how to tell a story garens voice her song saved me there is no other way to tell it i was ready to leave this world no more for me the dizzying pain of broken flesh and lost blood i wanted the gods peace i knew i could face his judgment without shame the raiders were dead after all by my hand and aris and yours i knew we owed you a debt and that was an uncomfortable thoughtbut it was also a matter for others i was done here until i heard naras song reminding me what it was to live to ride beneath the sky i knew then that whatever else was finished there was something between nara and me that was not yet done something new and incomplete something i was not free to leave you call it a lifebondcall it what you will what matters is that though i am a man i was notam notfree i held to her song i held to her as if she were my only wife the only woman in all the world so i lived through that night and through the nights after to this day when you say you have healed enough to be on your way i asked how we could repay you for i know ari and i could not have killed those raiders alone you told me what payment you would accept now that payment is delivered and i need not say more i walk slowly with this cane but i can walk and since i can walk i can work i have three geldings ready to sell and two mares in foal and the fences still need fixing there is much to do and if naras song makes the work go better that is for the good it is as the god intended a man has many wivesmany peoplein his care nara and i are bound but not only to each other the god places many obligations upon us we are not heralds we seek more than simply to be free you are not holderkin you do not understand nothing has changed everything has changed naras voice i am bound to garen yes but i also serve the goddess and my elder wives i have not been put in this place by chance it is the goddess will it is for a reason even if i cannot always see that reason for myself you say this troubles you yet i think maybe heralds know how to serve too i think you know about having your fate decided by powers beyond your understanding and i think perhaps the story you asked for ends here i can tell you this though last night it was my turn to look after garen his wound still troubles him and will for some time i gave him medicine to numb that pain and because it was late and the days work was done he accepted it as he grew sleepy he asked me would you ride from this place if you could his words startled me i thought he spoke of heralds this is my home i said because it is true and because it says all else i would have said you wouldnt ride as jania rode then garens tone was light but his gaze was not if not for the medicine he wouldnt have spoken thus jania rode these ridges i said and these valleys she did not ride in some strangers land abruptly garen grabbed my hand nara he said you must not be silent again i must always hear your voice always i laughed trying to make it a joke if the god and goddess grant us years enough together you might regret that always he said and he did not laugh garen will not tell you this perhaps i should not tell you either but his serious voice made me feel strange shy as the day we met i will not be silent i promised and then shyer still i said i wish something too what do you wish garen asked even though he need not do anything on account of my wishes i wish to hear your voice i wishto hear you sing he never had you see in all the months id been here my voice is no gift from the god garen said i wish to hear it just the same so he sang the hymn from our wedding day his voice was rough and offkey and perfect i added my high voice to his low one and as we sang together i knew there was in truth a bond between us and that it was not like other bonds you say the gods have put this thing between garen and me i do not know your gods i know only one goddess who is lost and seeks a way home and one god who has offered her shelter and longs to keep her forever by his side yet nothing is forever one day the goddess will return home one day garen and i will be parted for a time at least if garen leaves first my only comforts will be my songs and my land and even they will not be enough yet that parting will not be this day and that matters more than any story can say but then i do not know how to tell a story i only know how to sing garen does not know how to sing but he is learning finding

science fiction novel for daw she is also the coauthor with jennifer wingert of the spellbinding fantasy novel spirit fox mickey lives in iowa with her husband and three of their children and divides her time between her family her writing teaching at the local university and the assorted livestock asword crashed against elvidas with a force that nearly unseated her from raynors saddle trusting the companion to tend to balance she put her full concentration into harmlessly redirecting the strike her riposte followed naturally training drummed into habit by weaponsmaster altorin her blade struck flesh with a sickening tear pain thrummed through her hands her enemy a target more solid than mock combat had prepared her to expect blood splashed throwing red spots and squiggles across raynors snowy neck and her own silvery gray uniform the man collapsed and a bitter thread of bile clawed its way up elvidas throat cursing the dark curls that obscured her vision elvida wasted a motion tossing them from her eyes she followed the sound of bridle bells to find the other two companions tabnar and leahleh together surrounded by a mass of unmounted enemies herald sharylle and her partner anthea flailed wildly through the press scarlet splattered their herald whites and their faces and the warriors bayed at them like bloodsick hounds open for the moment elvida suffered a moment of terror her first mission was supposed to be routine a leisurely ride through the holdings hauling a single cart they would plant soaproot and blue bells help organize the restocking of waystations and gather information to assure nothing troublesome was brewing just beyond the kingdom instead danger had found them in the form of a small and as yet unidentified army one that clearly hated heralds sharylle screamed in clear agony her companion plummeted and both disappeared beneath the wild mass of warriors no elvida shouted her cry lost beneath antheas louder one raw with a pain so desperate and primeval it stopped the assault long enough for her to disengage as well this way anthea called out and her companion wheeled suddenly toward elvida the cave elvida remembered the dark hole they had passed earlier that day dank and jagged it had seemed to radiate a chill that spiraled through her marrow so unlike the myriad welcoming waystations that had brought the three women and their companions through so many warm safe nights elvida had relished the camaraderie opening up to the heralds in ways she had never dared to in the past for the first time in her life she had felt as if she had real sisters though she also found herself envying the bond the heralds shared raynor reared spun and galloped toward the cave the suddenness of the movement added to elvidas gastric distress mentally she suffered her own terror the rage of the enemies and the deep hellish agony of anthea together the mixture made her desperately ill leaning forward she vomited trying not to further soil raynor or herself it felt silly to concern herself with hygiene at a time when it seemed abundantly clear they were all going to die raynors slender muscular legs carried them at a speed the unmounted warriors could never hope to match apparently reading her terror her companion sent waves of encouragement that did not fool elvida without the magical strength to mindspeak his heraldintraining was limited to empathic communication but she had learned that well raynor could try but he would never wholly hide that his own courage was a thin veneer masking a fear nearly as strong as her own leahleh loosed a frantic whinny followed by a cry from anthea raynor whirled in time to show elvida that the herald had fallen leahleh stomped and snorted her empty stirrups flying attempting to hold a band of men with waving swords at bay elvida saw no sign of anthea where is she where is she raynor nickered in question elvida glanced around frantically knowing every moment wasted meant one less in flight she knew sharylle and tabnar were dead anthea would never have abandoned her partner if any hope remained now elvida searched for some radiating emotion that would assure her the remaining herald still lived nothing came to elvidas mental senses but her wildly leaping gaze did eventually land on anthea the woman lay among the stones blood trickling from one ear though clearly unconscious her chest still rose and fell in obvious living breaths leahleh whinnied in agony shes alive elvida jerked raynors left rein we have to save her raynor did not hesitate speeding back toward the fray while elvida wrestled her own decision magically giftless she had honed her weapons and empathy skills but she had little hope of standing against even two armed men let alone several dozen nevertheless while a herald lived she had no choice but to attempt a rescue move move move elvida encouraged raynor leaning over his neck as if to add her speed to his own already the men had swarmed over antheas only other hope leahleh collapsed her brilliant white fur indelibly stained her mortal agony an unignorable screech in elvidas mind even immersed in terrible pain the companion tossed her head toward antheas still form as if to direct elvida and raynor to save her herald besieged by the physical and mental suffering of herald and companion elvida felt as if her head might explode she wished she could comfort the animal to rescue leahleh or at least allow her to leave the world in peace her death elvida wanted to promise would not be in vain instead she waded through the morass of anguish to bolster the companion to entreat her not to give up no matter how awful the pain if leahleh died they would lose anthea also elvida forced the thought from her already overtaxed brain focusing solely on her own desperate duty as raynor skidded to a stop elvida leaped from the saddle and ran to the herald aided by an anxiety beyond extreme she managed to heft antheas larger still form and lug her toward the saddle the impatient companion barely waited until antheas body reached his side before shoving his nose under her and jerking his head upward the herald flew toward his saddle elvida scrambled to her seat barely quickly enough to keep anthea from flying over his opposite side she steadied the older woman still noting the shallow breathing the stream of sticky scarlet trickling from one ear the total lack of response to any of this frantic movement she too is nearly dead raynor lurched into a run still trying to position anthea on his withers elvida slid halfway from the saddle panicked she caught a death grip on raynors mane a sword cut the left stirrup where her leg should have been slicing a short gash in raynors side another blade slammed against his left hind leg jolting raynor with an abruptness that nearly sent both women tumbling to the ground again strings of mane cut painfully into the elvidas fingers but she barely noticed beneath the allencompassing waves of agony issuing from raynor unable to run he stumbled forward as elvida clawed her way back into the saddle and steadied anthea she dared not look trying her hardest to send encouragement to her mount raynor needed her to help him continue despite the extra weight on his back the heavy burden of two lives relying on hooves that were no longer capable limping heavily he rocked toward the cave step after excruciating step his pace barely faster than that of a running man the enemy bayed at his heels only one misstep from victory you can do it elvida whispered fervently i have faith in you my beloved she kept her attention on the warriors who miraculously looked to be losing ground raynor seemed all but motionless compared to her wildly racing thoughts and his usual speed though he obviously moved quickly enough to stay ahead of the howling army at least for the moment with each step the ache radiating from him became more intense more excruciating until it usurped all other thought you can do it heartsib i know you can and raynor responded dragging his left hind leg in a blind haze of pain elvida wished she could do something anything to ease his burden her instincts screamed at her to dismount but she conquered them with logic doing so assured all three of their deaths raynor would not go on without her and she would never find the strength to carry a fullgrown companion it felt like an eternity before the cave came clearly into focus drawing slowly and inexorably toward them there it is beloved only a few more steps those last few seemed more like a thousand then raynor managed a last heave into the darkness before collapsing at the mouth antheas still form rolled gracelessly from his withers and into the darkness were safe the thought was madness elvida realized with a sudden jolt of fresh terror she alone could keep the warriors from simply running into the cave after them seizing raynors bridle elvida closed her eyes to a grim focus and pulled his weight strained every muscle in her arms and back but she managed to drag him away from the opening and deeper into the cave she stood poised directly in front of him sword readied stance balanced hoping no more than two men could face her simultaneously through the crack at least she might manage to hold them off for several hours gripping her sword in hands gone numb she stood bravely at the mouth waiting for the army to arrive the sun sank toward the horizon leaving the sky awash in broad stripes of vivid rainbow hues though still at the cave opening elvida gradually lost her demeanor of crouched expectation gripped in arms aching with fatigue her sword wilted to dangle at her side the army remained a respectful distance from the cave their campfires springing up like gloating wraiths dancing in the gathering darkness for nearly an hour elvida watched the men butcher some large animal for their evening meal hauling hunks of glistening meat toward the scattered fires her own empty stomach rumbled with a desire she could not contain she imagined the sweet fatty aroma that would soon drift toward her on the night breeze and her mouth watered then a group of men in the center triumphantly hefted the skin of the hapless creature huge and longlegged white as newfallen snow tabnar revulsion struck elvida in a wave so strong and vile her own saliva soured to poison once again she found herself vomiting this time with an agonizing savagery long after she lost everything inside she continued to heave dryly until every muscle ached and tears fully stole her vision its over the sight of a companion defiled in this manner destroyed elvidas remaining will staggering mindlessly deeper into the cave she dropped her sword and crumpled to the ground stone bruised her knees and scraped her palms but these superficial pains went unacknowledged she curled into a hopeless ball weeping so violently she could scarcely breathe all her shortcomings paraded through her mind her magical weakness her gross incompetence at mental communication her total lack of any gift sharylle and anthea had clearly picked her as their travel companion from pity alone and choosing her for his rider would soon prove raynors fatal mistake as well two heralds and three companions elvida had always known her inability would get herself killed she had never imagined she would cause the deaths of so many truly special epically important others with her incompetence i deserve to die she did not seem worthy even of the same fate that would surely befall raynor and anthea i deserve to die horribly stop it the words entered elvidas head like a whip crack shocked senseless she sat bolt upright the tears dribbling from her sodden hazel eyes whowho said that i did raynor you quit wallowing in selfpity or so help me ill struggle over there and stomp you to death dumbfounded elvida could only attempt the mindspeech that had previously eluded her throughout her years of training can you hear me too raynor snorted loudly what am i minddeaf of course i can hear you elvida gathered her legs beneath her the flow of tears ending and her vision returning in a blur but this is the first time i mean i never how come i she found herself incapable of completing a thought clearly her newfound ability had something to do with the intensity of her current emotions she had always believed she tried her hardest to communicate now she knew she had allowed selfdoubt to hold her from truly giving it the effort it deserved i can mindspeak no answer followed only her own bitter disappointment apparently the ability had left as swiftly as it had appeared elvida wondered if she had to hit the depths of despair in order to awaken it again oh im sorry was that an actual question relief flooded elvida and she managed a choking laugh a damn silly one obviously im sorry raynor the apology went far deeper than the ludicrousness of turning the selfevident into a serious inquiry im sorry im worthless im sorry im going to get the three of us killed im sorry im sorry for being the worlds most useless heraldintraining i told you to stop it anger accompanied the sending louder than the words themselves wallowing in selfpity isnt going to save anyones life and i resent the suggestion that im inept the very idea sent elvida reeling in horror but i never said you did you said i couldnt pick a capable chosen but i didnt mean elvida paused finally turning toward her companion who clearly had a point only then she realized she had been deliberately avoiding looking at him his pain had faded to dim background in her mind but it haunted every thought every action and every decision he lay on his side where she had dragged him his fur clotted with dirt and speckled burgundy with the blood of foe and friend alike his breaths came in pants and his left hind leg lay at an awkward swollen angle clearly it was broken elvida cried out despising herself for not tending to him and anthea immediately trapped in a web of her own grief and loathing she had worried more for increasing her own burdens than for helping her friends the realization only intensified her selfhatred but this time she cast aside the morass of deprecation that held her inert at a time of necessary action clearly riding with her on this journey of internal discovery raynor sent a quieter message little sister theres nothing you can do for me a horse without a leg can accomplish nothing anthea is gravely injured i wish i were a healer i wish my gift realizing she was still stalling elvida rose and walked to anthea the herald sprawled in the dirt her whites smeared with grime dark blood matted her hair but nothing bright red to indicate a current site of bleeding her breaths stirred slowly oddly peaceful as she lay in a state beyond sleep a more thorough examination revealed no other injuries all the damage remained inside antheas head where no one other than a healer could reach them injuries to the brain elvida knew were always serious and every moment that passed significantly decreased the heralds chance for survival leahleh must still live barely your gift is not healing elvida do not mourn what was never meant to be gingerly elvida stroked antheas hair she doubted the herald could survive the night she asked hopefully but i do have a gift you do raynor confirmed as so many of her teachers had before him yet like them he refused to elaborate elvida repeated the familiar line i have to find it myself yes it seemed unfair in so many ways others were told as they trained and most had more than one now it seemed elvida would die without ever knowing because her companion was a stickler for rules at a time when such things no longer mattered apparently reading her emotions raynor relented i will tell you this much it has something to do with communication under less extreme circumstances only that very morning elvida would have found the suggestion laughable she who could not even mindspeak had little education or talent for communication magical or otherwise yet now that the suggestion had come from the very one she had waited so long to talk to it did not seem so absurd this is no time for riddles beloved our lives may depend upon this nameless gift i gave you a hint i wont say anymore why not raynor turned his head with a snort and a toss of his filthy mane elvida sat back from anthea heaving a deep sigh she knew better than to fight a futile battle long repeatedly punching a stone wall accomplished nothing more than broken fists look raynor spoke with clear caution as ive mentioned its customary to put a horse without a leg out of its misery and anthea cant make another day without a healer chosen leave us do what you can to save yours elvida refused to allow the stallion to finish people kill horses because the animals dont understand the necessary treatment and usually wind up hurting themselves worse youre not a horse youre a sentient being capable of deep thought and understanding she dropped the senseless argument dismissing raynors words as an attempt at heroism though only trying to save her the companions words were nonsense elvida could never leave him to suffer alone and if he died she surely would also besides his value to the queen far exceeded hersand he knew it im going to look for another way out of here you let me know if anyone dont waste your time elvida rose scarcely daring to believe she had heard correctly what its the job of heralds to detail every part of the world i know of this cavea waystation once it has a stream and a back exit elvidas hopes soared only to be dashed by the rest of raynors description both cut off to anything larger than a mouse by a massive cavein ahead lies our only escape and unfortunately our only water elvidas lips went suddenly dry and she licked them thoughtfully her crazed bout of crying would only see to it that dehydration overcame her sooner she swallowed hard steeling herself against the same fog of hopelessness that had earlier consumed her even if she never earned her whites she would at least learn to die bravely she strode away from anthea to look out over the camp of the waiting army so why havent our enemies come after us what are they waiting for elvida did not expect a reply to her mostly rhetorical question so raynors surprised her morning daylight theyre a superstitious lot and worry about monsters or spirits in the darkness elvida shook her head too bad were not monsters she shivered not bothering to add or spirits soon enough they might become exactly that she tried to understand their enemy as the strategists had taught if she could get into their minds perhaps she could find a way to outwit them enter the depraved world of men who attack heralds at peace who slaughter and cannibalize companions the thought stirred an anger elvida could not quell she would rather die than see the reason behind heinous and barbarous actions i dont ever want to know what stirs inside those creatures in the guise of men elvida sank to her knees she had never followed a religion but now she bowed her head fingers laced tightly against her chest gods lords and ladies who sanction goodness i beg of you now to come to our aid i will do anything suffer any trial if you will only rescue my friends these humble servants of the queen she could feel her heart thumping against her fists please anyone whos listening i will do whatever bidding you ask you need only make it clear save raynor and anthea and if it is your will save me as well for several moments elvida remained in this position waiting for an answer some sign to indicate any deity had heard her prayer insects hummed a steady chorus the dull rumble of conversation occasionally pierced by laughter and shouts came from the enemies camp no other sounds reached her not even the light breathing of herself and her injured friends it seemed the gods took no interest in their plight not that elvida expected otherwise she had known many people who extolled some god or goddess in every other sentence these faithful believed that everything that went right in the lives of humanity was the work of whichever deity they personally worshipped any tragedy or mistake they blamed on human infallibility this they felt justified their beliefs in a mindless circle that defied elvidas understanding it had always seemed to her a certain path to selfdeprecation and loathing yet she realized she had felt equally low only moments earlier without the help of any religious teaching or faith its up to me and me alone to get us out of this situation elvida took a deep breath unfolding her hands her determination set raynor i dont know much about mindspeech but im going to try to shout with all the power i can muster with you being so close and all i hope it doesnt hurt you it was a question as much as information dismissed as incapable she had never learned the conventions or details of the art it wont hurt me raynor assured with a mental smile and i think its a great idea encouraged elvida clambered off her knees to sit firmly on her bottom she lowered her head and breathed slowly and deeply eyes closed mind open and focused she put every bit of mustered strength into her call physical as well as thought sending a message of need to anyone who might hear it was at once a communication of desperation filled with begging and demand with need and hope she called to anyone capable of listening be they heralds or bards mages or healers apprentice or notyetdiscovered with every fiber of her being she prepared them for an army of brutal enemies and drew them toward the cave elvida had no idea how long she sat in her chosen position her eyes tightly closed and her mind outreaching it seemed like hours before raynor intruded with a thought that in comparison seemed a breathless whisper little sister look elvida opened her eyes moonlight trickled through the cave mouth and stars studded the sky then from the depths of the gloom she saw a vast sea of brilliant white horses companions their eyes burning like angry sapphires their hooves churning the brush into flying bits of torn stems astride sat heralds of every description their whites as spectacular as their steeds their weapons drawn and gleaming elvida gasped staring in wonder as this massive force of heralds descended upon the suddenly hushed camp of their enemy she scrambled to her feet to watch in quiet awe you did it elvida you did it i did it elvida had not known so many heralds existed in the world even throughout the entire history of valdemar yet they marched in formation before her very eyes in a grim silence prepared for a confrontation with an enemy no longer dealing only with three girls and their mounts most already dead or badly hurt screams rose from the enemy camp filled with unholy terror she watched them flee like frightened children not bothering to grab their belongings some halfnaked in the growing chill they left their fires blazing and their packs unclaimed even the supply cart they had captured from the heralds they abandoned meals partially eaten in the dirt their tents lopsided and incompletely pitched racing without clear destination or reason in allencompassing terror somethings wrong this cant be happening raynors mindvoice cut through elvidas doubt steady chosen one steady elvida did not know what her companion meant but his interference knocked her thoughts askew she continued to stare at the mass of heralds as they streaked doggedly through the camp and chased their enemies far beyond her sight they did it were saved only then she addressed raynor directly what exactly am i steadying elvida received no answer afraid unconsciousness had claimed raynor she whirled toward the companion to find him staring back at her his pale eyes moist with a mixture of pain and joy you did it i did it elvida agreed finally allowing herself to feel a tinge of relief and happiness despite the trials that still awaited her i reached reality finally intruded i reached what how can this be how could i draw in more heralds than actually exist how could they all have arrived so quickly all at the precise same time how elvida shook off the haze of doubts and questions its impossible impossible raynor echoed is precisely what it is elvida jerked her attention back outside the cave the camp remained as she had last seen it abandoned in clear haste and wild disarray she saw no sign of the herald army not even a hoof print to prove they had ever existed what what happened i dont understand your gift raynor raised his head looking better than he had at any time since their arrival in the cave though battered and broken he radiated hope communication the ability to communicate pictures into the minds of others illusion the word was startled from elvida she returned to mindspeech you mean that band of heralds that massive army was nothing but a creation of your mind yes a glorious amazing creation of your great mind beloved elvida continued to survey the ruined camp knowing exactly what she must do next she would have to reclaim the cart and drag her friends into it she would then have to haul it to civilization a lot of hard work remained yet it all seemed so simple after the tragic events of that evening but why wouldnt anyone tell me why did you risk our dying without my ever knowing because chosen one doubt is the enemy of illusion for it to work it must be believed elvida still did not understand until today you were ruled by your doubts they would have foiled any attempt you made to use your gift just as they had your mindspeech elvida considered still grasping for comprehension you mean for any illusion to work i have to believe it too yes elvida sighed it seemed her first great use of her gift would also be her last apparently reading her emotions raynor continued your teachers will train you to properly blank your mind you will learn but your first illusion had to come spontaneously elvida shook her head she still did not wholly get it why because until you performed the first one you would always doubt your ability so long as you doubted you would fail or at best succeed only weakly you would never have learned the amazing power of your gift he shook his mane impatiently little sister you are very strongly gifted elvida sank back to the stony ground her rubbery legs would no longer hold her please tell me last night was also illusion i wish i could beloved i wish i could as so many times before elvida marveled at the wonder that was raynor even through the emotional agony of the battle even through his own physical pain he had kept the secret of her power knowing they all might take it to their graves to do otherwise would have prevented the great miracle of the ghostly herald army thank you she sent along with the awe of the universe for what elvida did not bother to answer she slid from the mouth of the cave and headed toward the camp she still had friends to rescue and no force in the world no magic no army no doubt was going to stop her darkwalls lady by judith tarr judith tarr is the author of a number of historical and fantasy novels and stories her most recent novels include pride of kings and tides of darkness as well as the epona sequence lady of horses white mares daughter and daughter of lir she was a world fantasy award nominee for lord of the two lands she lives near tucson arizona where she breeds and trains lipizzan horses long ago after the magic went out of valdemar but long before it came back again the lord of forgotten keep had a daughter he was old and his lady had thought herself past childbearing his son was a man full grown and his elder daughter had children of her own they were already eyeing their inheritance and reckoning the days until it came to them and yet in the twilight of their years the lady beatrice found herself waking ill in the mornings the healer confirmed her wild surmise she was indeed with child in spite of her age and the healers concern the pregnancy proceeded as it should and all was well word of the ladys miracle spread through the region one day three months before the child was due to be born a guest came to the keep the lady of darkwall keep had last visited forgotten keep when lord bertrands daughter was married five years before she was not a great traveler and visitor of her neighbors she lived alone in her isolated keep high over a dark river that ran through a deep and fertile valley and ruled a domain of farmers and river traders her hosts were somewhat surprised by the visit but they were hospitable people and she was a nottoodistant neighbor they received her with courtesy she responded in kind with manners that could not be faulted the lord was charmed the lady was not but her moods had been strange of late even she was reluctant to trust them darkwalls lady was an easy enough guest she professed herself content to rest in her rooms until midmorning take a turn around the ladys garden until noon then join the lady and her women in their bower until the days meal was served her conversation was light and pleasant like the face she presented to her hosts on the third day at last she came to the point of her visit she did so in the afternoon while the rest of the ladies plied their needlework and listened to their ladys page who had a sweet voice and a singers gift her long white hands were folded and her expression was serene she leaned toward lady beatrice and said i have a favor to askand favors to offer in return lady beatrice was tired and uncomfortable and her temper was not at its best still she managed to raise her brows and say reasonably perhaps you should speak to my lord her guest smiled with a touch of indulgence oh i shall of course but you and i know lady that though a lord claims to rule his lady holds the reins in your keep that may be true lady beatrice said coolly still she was curious what favor can forgotten keep do for darkwall darkwalls lady bent her head her smile had warmed considerably it was almost enough to allay lady beatrices misgivings you know of course that i have no lord and therefore no heir i have to come ask if you would consider an exchange gifts and favors in return for your child lady beatrices hand rose protectively over the swell of her belly her face hardened my child is not for sale oh no darkwalls lady said quickly were no merchants to buy and sell our own children but we are highborn and our best currency is the inheritance we leave our heirs your son will inherit the keep your daughter is lady of mourne fell what is left for this gift of the gods a boy may make his fortune as he can a girl may be traded in marriage is either prospect more tempting than the lordship of darkwall when i am gone it was indeed very tempting but lady beatrice was not a gullible woman nor was she particularly softhearted thats all very well for the child what do you offer us in return a percentage of the river trade the lady answered without hesitation to begin as this agreement is concluded and to continue unless or until your child chooses to end it a promise of military aid for the same term when and as needed and as earnest for the rest a chest of gold in the amount proper for a ladys dowryfor it will be a lady my heart tells me though i would hardly look amiss at a lord lady beatrice knew as mothers might cherishing the knowledge that she carried a daughter she eyed the lady warily its a most tempting offer she said but my lord must decide whether to accept or refuse of course said the lady with all apparent willingness then she smiled and beckoned to the page and asked for a new songa joyful one she said in honor of the hour the lords misgivings were no less than his wifes but he was neither as wealthy nor as well defended as he would have liked to be it was also in his mind that if this last and unexpected child was a daughter she would serve her family exceedingly well as lady of darkwall and if it was a son well then all the better that he should have a keep of his own and blood ties to forgotten keep and so they made the bargain darkwalls lady would have claimed the child when she was born but lady beatrice would not hear of it we will raise our own daughter she said and teach her everything that you would wish her to know send tutors if you wish but she will be fostered here when she reaches the age of womanhood then she may go lord bertrand opened his mouth to upbraid her but darkwalls lady astonished him by inclining her head as you wish she said i shall send a nurse for her and tutors when she reaches a suitable age lady beatrice could hardly find fault with that she bent her head in return the alliance was made and the agreement concluded and it was settled the lords youngest child with three months yet to go until she saw the world was assured of a lordship and a future lady beatrice kept her misgivings to herself she only spoke of them once six years later as she was dying she summoned her daughter to her bedside and said dont ask what this means only remember it word for word walk warily trust no one always keep your counsel and remember everything that you see we sold you for gold and soldiers and we will keep that bargainbut you can make a new one of your own remember that last word came out as a sigh never forget ill remember the child said not long after that lady beatrice died but the bargain still held the child whom lady beatrice had named merris continued to live in her fathers keep tutors from darkwall came to teach her and the lady herself appeared once each year on merris birthday to celebrate it with her and to see how she had been growing she always professed herself pleased or least not too terribly disappointed then she always went away as she had come leaving the child in her fathers care but those days would not go on forever when merris reached her fourteenth birthday the lady would come as before but this time she would take the child whom she had bought for so noble a price merris ran up the stair at a pace that would have given her tutors palpitations she meant to have her hair up and her skirts down and her breathing back to normal by the time she reached the schoolroom but while she could she gave way to the restless energy that had been tormenting her all day one month from today was her fourteenth birthday everyone knew what that meant her life in this keep was nearly over it was time finally for her to fulfill the bargain her parents had made she had been preparing for it since before she was born she was not afraid but her mothers words had never left her she was going into a house of strangers no matter how many tutors she had had or how much instruction she was given in manners deportment and the conduct befitting a lady of darkwall she had never visited the keep she was to rule she knew every nook and cranny but only in books her tutors never said anything but good of darkwall still servants talked and merris had sharp ears she only caught fragments whispers of fear rumors that had no real substancebut they were enough to keep her on her guard halfway up the stair she stopped short it was time to make herself decorous for master thellen and mistress patrizia but that was not what brought her to so abrupt a halt while she stood frozen the bell rang at the gate preparations for her birthday celebration were already underway people had been coming and going for days this morning alone the bell had rung half a dozen times to let in trains of provisions companies of workmen and a succession of messengers bearing replies to the lords invitation this felt different it felt bright she did not know what she meant by that but she had to see even if her tutors set her a punishment she reckoned it worth the cost she turned and ran back down the stair there was always a commotion in the courtyard these days but when merris came out into it there was a circle of unexpected quiet near the outer gate brightness filled it shot through with the tinkle of bells she blinked hard the blur of light resolved into a pair of white horses with bells on their bitless bridles and a pair of men dressed in the same striking color by that she knew that the horses were not horses and the men were men but not exactly ordinary everyone knew about heralds books and stories were full of them merris had never seen one forgotten keep was small and out of the way and her father involved himself only rarely with affairs of the royal court far away in haven except for the occasional bard wandering through to sing his songs forgotten keep was as forgotten as its name now not one herald had appeared in the keep but two she found that her mouth was hanging open she shut it with a snap everyone else seemed as taken aback as she was just as it dawned on merris that someone ought to at least offer the heralds a greeting one of them swayed and sagged against the other the dazzle of what they were vanished abruptly the one who had fainted was old she realized and the one who held him up was young inside their shining whites they were humanand the old one did not look well at all she ran forward without even stopping to think calling to people who stood around with their mouths open rolf gerent take the companions to the stable remember theyre not horses no matter what they look like danilfind the healer move people moved merris planted herself on the other side of the old herald and took part of his weight thinking distantly that one of the servants should do this but she wanted to do something however unsuitable and that seemed like the most useful thing she met the young heralds brown eyes over the bowed white head they were deeply worried there was nothing she could do to soothe that worry but she could say come with me the herald nodded he looked fairly done in himself but he could walk between them he and merris carried the old herald into the keep and up to one of the guest rooms the bed was freshly made and the room was aired the shutters were open to the late spring sunlight merris and the young herald laid the old one carefully on the bed his breathing was rapid and shallow his skin was clammy and his lips were blue merris opened her mouth to ask what had happened to him but the young herald staggered and sat down abruptly on the stool beside the bed the water jar was empty but there was wine in the cupboard merris poured a few sips into one of the cups and made the herald drink it he choked and spluttered but a little color came back into his cheeks good said merris reclaiming the cup we dont need you passing out too he drew himself up apart from the glamour of the whites he looked perfectly ordinary not too tall not too short well built and sturdy with a pleasant bluntfeatured face and curly brown hair there was nothing noble or heroic about that face and she doubted he was highborn he looked like half the villagers around forgotten keep im heraldintern coryn he said and this is herald isak his accent bore out her suspicions it had a hint of a drawl in it a countrymans twang and you are merris she said thank you merris he said weve lost our way i think are we very far from the road to nottaway its a day or two west of here she said he sighed then sagged she jumped toward him but he had not fainted it was relief that was all he might have spoken or she might have asked questions but the healer arrived just then she took in the scene with an all too sharp eye shooed merris out and took both heralds in hand merris would have argued but she had tutors waitingand an extra hours worth of exercises in correct etiquette at banquets for being so drastically late the exercises were deadly dull but there was no getting out of them there was a bargain as she never failed to remember this was her part of it it was two wildly frustrating days before merris could escape the stranglehold of duty and discipline the heralds were still in the keepshe was able to determine that much the old one isak was very ill something to do with his heart she gathered the healer was doing her best the young herald never left his elders side except for a daily visit to the companions all this merris learned from obliging servants even with the flurry around her birthday heralds were a great excitement merris tutors seemed determined to keep her from ever going near them again mistress patrizia insisted that she be fitted for a trunkful of entirely new and to her mind completely unnecessary gowns which took untold hours when she was not strangling in folds of silk and brocade master thellen had her memorizing endless lists of names and dates and places from one of his beloved and deadly dull chronicles none of which had anything perceptible to do with either darkwall or forgotten keep she came terribly close to asking him questions she should never even think about asking is it true the last lady but three used to take a monthly bath in infants blood are there really creatures of darkness in the caves below the keep why has there always been a lady but never a lord and how is it that she never marries but always adopts an heir not to mention why did she choose me there are four keeps between hers and ours all of which have surplus daughters what do i have that those ladies dont but she kept her questions bottled up inside as she always had because her mother had told her to trust her instincts and instinct told her not to speak of such things on the surface it was all ordinary dull dry facts and ancient history and so many gowns she would need an entire train of pack mules to carry them all late the second day as merris dressed for dinner mistress patrizia entered without knocking as she always did and dismissed the maid merris looked at her in what she hoped was innocent surprise mistress what a pleasure to see you at this hour will you be joining us for dinner that would not be proper mistress patrizia said she was a tall thin forbidding person at the best of times tonight she was ramrodstiff i have a gift for you from our lady merris brows went up such gifts were not uncommon but usually it was a messenger from darkwall who delivered them as far as she knew no such messenger had come as if in answer to her unspoken question mistress patrizia said i have kept this at our ladys behest it is a small thing but she values it she would be most pleased if you would wear it she raised her hands there was a small wooden box in them such as jewels were kept in merris took it slowly and opened it with fingers that for some reason wanted to tremble she had had gifts like this before but only on birthdays it was a pendant on a silver chain a drop of dark amber in a spiral of silver it felt warm in her hand and strangely alive and the flecks in it seemed almost to move swirling slowly around one another inside their prison of waxy stone it was a beautiful thing but strange the other gifts had been much more mundane a book a gown a tutor this made merris skin prickle she made herself smile and be as polite as she had been trained to be speaking words of thanks that she was not at all sure she meant mistress patrizia watched her with peculiar fixity she was supposed to wear the thing that was clear she let mistress patrizia fasten the chain around her neck trying hard not to shudder when the stone touched her skin she resolved to get rid of it as soon as she was out of sight she had a moment of breathless fear that mistress patrizia would decide to go to dinner after all but she was much too proper a servant merris stopped in the passageway to the dining hall fumbling with the clasp her hands were shaking and the clasp was stiff it would not come off she almost gave up and let it be but her peculiar revulsion was growing stronger rather than weaker she gritted her teeth and pulled hard the chain broke she thrust the stone into the pocket of her sleeve where a lady might keep small and discreetly useful items amber was as light almost as air but this weighed her down out of all proportion to its size merris stopped thinking and acted she turned aside to the garderobe and let the thing fall out of her sleeve into the odorous darkness if and when she was asked she could answer honestly that she had lost the pendant she took a deep breath barely even gagging on the effluvium of the privy and went to dinner with a lighter heart after dinner at last merris had an hour to herself her maids were still at their own dinner and her tutors were wherever they disappeared to when their duty to their lady was done she shed her voluminous skirts in favor of much more practical ones with no one to stop her she ventured out of her rooms it was a bright night warm and moonlit the garden her mother had made that her father had kept up in beatrices memory was in full and fragrant bloom merris went on past it to the stables companions had somewhat different needs than horses according to the stories but forgotten keeps stables seemed to suit them well enough their stall doors were open so that they could come and go and they were well bedded in clean straw with full mangers and fresh water drawn from the keeps deep clear well the younger herald was perched on a stool between the two stalls cleaning bridles they were ordinary bridles belonging to the keeps horses not the lovely bitless ones ornamented with silver bells that she had seen on the companions merris squatted beside him and reached for one of the many scraps of leather that he had spread around him and started working soap into it with her fingers he stared at her as if he did not know what to make of her a long white head came between them followed by a massive white body companions were not nearly as ethereal in person as they were in legend they were broadboned heavyset creatures with substantial heads and silver hooves and clear blue eyes and manes and tails like white silk merris looked up at that deceptively horselike face and sighed selena says said the herald that no our life is not for youbut what you have ahead of you is just as remarkable i know that merris saida little sadly because even in forgotten keep a girl could dream of being chosen she reached up the companion lowered a soft nose into her palm and blew warm breath on it she also says the herald said that you dont have much time whatever you do dont wear the pendant merris felt her eyes go round there were all too many questions she could ask but most of them were too foolish to bother with she said tell her i dropped it down the garderobe things of that nature have a way of not staying dropped merris wondered if that was the herald speaking or the companion speaking through him not that it mattered particularly what are you really here for she asked she peered around the companions head the herald lifted his shoulders in a shrug isak took sick on the road your keep was the closest place that was likely to have a healer he was telling the truth as far as it went merris could tell still she said i dont believe in accidents neither do i the herald said is it true what they say youre heir to darkwall she nodded he frowned youre nothing like what i would expect what pretentious full of myself too far above it all to sit in a stable aisle cleaning bridles he laughed then flushed well that and well darkwall what do you mean by that he shook his head im sorry i shouldnt have said it no said merris tell me what you mean his head shook again the companion pawed then butted him knocking him off his stool he lay in the aisle and glared i cant say that the companion shook itshermane and snorted wetly not quite into his face he shoved her head aside and scrambled to his feet still glaring selena says he said biting off the words that i should say you dont look like something that would rule darkwall youre too well clean and that means im not even sure what it means he said angrily but his anger did not seem to be directed at merris its rumors thats all stories and a few poorly rhymed ballads darkwall isnt just called that because its built on a black cliff it has a bad reputation why merris demanded what do you know if the heir to darkwall doesnt know it he said maybe theres nothing to know she wanted to pick him up and shake him but he was standing up and she was sitting on the floor and he was a fair bit bigger than she was she let her glare do it for her suppose theres something i havent been told and a reason why tell me i told you its just rumors that the lady is a socreress that she keeps herself young with the blood of children and rules a domain of magical creatures as well as humans ive heard those rumors merris said ive also met the lady shes not particularly young and shes been aging as she should do you like her that was a most peculiar question it was also peculiarly perceptive merris answered it honestly no no i dont i dont like any of the tutors shes sent either theyre all so cold all duty no humanity thats not like you at all he said then he flushed again im sorry i didnt meanwell i did but i shouldnt have i have serious deficiencies in tact and diplomacy he sounded as if he was quoting someoneprobably one of his teachers merris reflected that unlike her tutors he was very likable indeed she was thinking she could trust him thoughts she had not been daring to think and realizations she had not wanted to come to were coming together in merris head she pulled herself up staggering on knees that were suddenly weak the companions shoulder was there offering support over the broad back and arched neck she met the heralds eyes im nothing like the place im supposed to take charge of she said so tell me why did she choose me why not someone who fits her better coryn shook his head he did not know ordid not want to the companions neck bent around the blue eye was very keen it saw everything she wanted it to see and everything else too there are no accidents merris said please tell me you didnt halfkill a herald just to provide an excuse the white head shook from side to side some things the companion seemed to be saying were beyond even her powerseven if she had wanted any such thing i have to go merris said she was running away of course but it was all too much she needed to be alone she did not pause to see if coryn tried to stop her the companion did not and that was what mattered merris lay in her bed staring at the ceiling her maids snored in ragged harmony the moon was setting its light reminded her of the shimmer of a companions coat one reason why darkwalls lady might have gone so far afield in search of an heir was because the farther from her keep she went the less likely it would be that people would have heard the stories the keeps kept to themselves when they made alliances they did so circumspectly people in this country were not given to idle gossip maybe darkwall fostered that if sorcery existed and if the lady practiced it what better way to protect herself than by creating a buffer all around her of domains that asked no questions and shared no tales even heralds seldom came here as if something kept them from noticing this country existed merris drew into a knot her stomach felt sick this was the wildest speculation based on practically nothing at all she was afraid that was all because in less than a month she would have to leave everything she had ever known she was inventing stories and imagining horrors but the pit of her stomach did not believe that deep down where her instincts were she believed the stories then why did the lady want her what did merris have that darkwall could use youth of course fertility maybe maybe her innocence was meant to lighten a dark place and make a cold heart warm again somehow merris found it hard to believe that what did sorcery want with innocence blood of children merris sat up so fast her head spun the moon was almost down its last glimmer caught the box on her bedside table a small wooden box very plain such as jewels were stored in she had not put it there one of the servants must have found it and ever helpful put it where she could see it it was only a box simply made and fit for use it must be empty she had dropped its contents down the garderobe something was in it something that made her skin creep she got up suddenly picked up the box in a fold of her nightgown and flung it out the window it was a profoundly childish and possibly dangerous thing to do but she did not care let the garden keep it she did not want it anywhere near her in the morning the heir of darkwall announced that she would retreat for a while to the shrine of astera she had a great task ahead of her and considerable responsibility she felt a need to invoke the goddess guidance ill be back before my birthday she promised her father lord bertrand was quite old now and growing frail but his mind was as clear as ever he nodded of course he said of course you need a little time to reflect these are great changes which you face and you are young he did not make her promise to honor the bargain that would have insulted them both he met her eyes and nodded understanding more than maybe she herself did with his blessing on her head she left within the hour one of her maids rode with her and a pair of guards she was gone before either of her tutors could have missed her it was not terribly far to the shrinehalf a days easy ride in latespring sunlightand the road was well maintained if not much traveled merris found her fears receding as she left the bulk of the keep behind in their place was a growing conviction this was the right thing to do tonight the moon was almost full riding high over the guesthouse of the shrine asteras priestesses had finished their night office some time before the purity of their voices still shivered in merris skin merris maid gerda was a sound sleeper merris had chosen her for it the guards had not been allowed within the walls of the shrine they had had to camp outside in a place reserved for their kind it overlooked the main road but not she had taken care to observe a track that wound away through the woods she had to go on footthere was no discreet way to liberate her horse from the stable she regretted that but some things could not be helped dressed in the plainest clothes and the most sensible shoes she had been able to find with a small pack and a full water bottle she slipped out into the moonlight her heart was beating faster than her brisk pace might have called for and her hands were cold she had put fear aside but that did not mean she was calm no one in the world knew what she was doing this was a very dangerous thing to dobut she had to do it there was no choice past the first turn in the track out of sight of the shrine the moonlight grew suddenly blindingly bright merris stopped shading her eyes against the dazzle it faded as suddenly as it had swelled distilling into a white horsebody and the dark shape of a rider merris looked at them in a kind of despair im not trying to run out on the bargain she said it looks as if youre running toward it said coryn he was not wearing whites his companions gear was dark and plainan ordinary saddle and a leather halter with reins buckled to the side rings the herald must have raided the tack room in the keep there was still no mistaking what his mount was but merris had to give him credit for trying i wont let you take me back she said this is something i have to do i know coryn said selena knows too we wont stop youbut we wont let you go alone either merris was ashamed to admit how deep her relief was it made her voice sharper and her words more cutting what you cant wait out your internship before you get yourself killed in the line of duty maybe youre right coryn said maybe youre not either way you should have someone at your back why have you gifts that can help can you transport me there instantly read the ladys mind blast the keep into rubble his cheeks were bright red im nothing either special or spectacular as heralds go and the gods know im not highborn but i am a herald the kings authority rides with me if this bargain is unholy or unsanctioned there are things i can do to put a stop to it yes she said nastily you can die for being too stupidly brave to stay away he took a deep breath and squared his shoulders maybe so and maybe my death will count for something were going with you she hissed in frustration if she pushed past he only had to follow he had a mount and she had none he could gallop ahead and be there hours before her she stared him down until he stepped aside when she went on down the road so did he with his companion clopping behind like a common horse she wished they would go awaybut she was glad they were there if nothing else and if they survived they were witnesses they could tell the world what darkwalls lady was it was strange to be walking roads that merris had only known on maps and to see the country come alive around her for a while she walked then she rode because the companion insistedsaying through the herald that she was flagging and the day was not getting any younger and she had to have some strength left when she came to her destination on that broad back she rode through a wilderness of trees over stony streams and across sudden outcroppings of rock and scree she had chosen asteras shrine because it was closer to darkwall than forbidden keep but it was still a long way they were most of three days on the road in rain and sun camping by moonlight and starlight coryn had a useful gift after all he could start a fire out of anything though when she challenged him to do it with a cup of rainwater he responded with a flat stare he had a sense of humor but it had limits late on the third day after merris slipped out of the shrine they came around a curve in the roadwhich by then was little more than a goat trackand looked down on a valley she had never seen before in her life and yet she knew it as if she had grown up there its walls were steep and wooded a river ran through the bottom deep and wide enough for traders boats villages clustered along it high above it on a black rock sat the keep crouching like a raven over a rich store of carrion merris had expected to find the valley sinister she could apply that word to the keep but the rest was beautiful the fields cut from the woods and the hillsides were rich with ripening crops vineyards clung to the slopes higher up thickly clustered with grapes darkwall wine was famous hereabouts it was a dark vintage strong and sweet it was wonderful in winter heated with spices or diluted and chilled with spring water in the summer the memory was so vivid that merris could taste it she swallowed and made her eyes lift past the vineyards to the keep it was black built of the same stone as the rock it stood on a round tower stood at each corner the flag that flew from it was black with the bloodred outline of a raven flying on it the companion moved without her riders asking picking her way down the steep track on the road she had found a mudwallow then a patch of brown dust to roll in until she was covered from ears to tail she was still white but she had managed to dull the brilliance of her coat it was a long way down to the river the track brought them into the village at the foot of the crag in among a cluster of houses fishing nets hung on walls and boats were drawn up in alleyways and along the riverbank there were people out and about they looked much like the villagers of forgotten keep or like coryn for that matter the strangers attracted glances mildly curious but neither greatly interested nor hostile there must be enough trade on the river and enough traders coming through that unfamiliar faces were not unheard of merris had meant to find either an inn where questions could be answered in travelers tales or a temple where the priests might be welcoming to strangers but there was no inn one or two places looked like taverns but they had a peculiarly deserted look and there was no temple every village that merris knew had a temple if not two or more there was none here so where do travelers rest she wondered aloud and where does anyone worship on their boats i suppose coryn said or they go elsewhere he frowned it is odd maybe theres a market town downstream i dont know of any said merris this is the chief town that answers to the keep look theres the marketplace she pointed with her chin to an open space visible down the alley except theres no market coryn pointed out its not market day then merris said but her voice lacked conviction i could swear the books talk about the market and there should be an innthe ravens nest i gather were not encouraged to spend the night here coryn said he touched his heels to selenas sides she went forward obligingly playing the role of ordinary horse with perceptible relish merris thought she overdid the floppy ears and plodding step but these fishermen were unlikely to know the difference their lack of curiosity was beginning to bother her no inn no market no templedid traders really stop here or did they unload their cargo and get out as fast as they could there were no other horses in the streets not even a donkey and no dogs or cats selena was the only fourfooted creature that merris could see no birds either coryn said under his breath does the air feel dead to you merris started to ask him what he meant but she changed her mind she suspected she knew the sun was bright and the breeze was warm with a smell of water and fish and baking bread all very pleasant and yet it felt hollowfalse as if it were a painted backdrop concealing what a fane of monsters she almost laughed her imagination was running away with her there were fish in the river she saw one leap well out toward the middle a silver flash and yes there were birds black wings circled overhead a pair of ravens flying high above the keep she had to get up there if there was nowhere to stay in town travelers must be expected to stay in the keep she slipped down off the companions back too quick for coryn to stop her in a town with narrow alleys and people coming and going at inconvenient intervals a man on a horse or a creature like one was at a distinct disadvantage merris gambled that the herald would not leave his companion it seemed she was right her back felt cold without coryn and selena to watch it she clamped down the urge to run back to them this was too dangerous to share with anyone else she was beginning to think she had miscalculated there was nothing to put her finger on but what she felt here was the wrong kind of wrongness people were too quiettoo complaisant there were no children no young adults either everyone was older than she wasbut not very much older there were no old people either no white heads or wrinkled faces everyone seemed to be between the ages of twenty and fifty young people could be in school except there was no temple for them to be educated in old people should be sunning themselves in doorways or manning stalls in the market she hesitated at the bottom of the ascent to the keep it was supposed to be hers but it felt completely alien coryn was gaining on her the companion was faster than merris had thought and more agile at sidestepping people and obstacles merris bit her lip and started up the slope part of the way was straight ascent and part was a series of steps carved in the rock there were no guards at the gate above but merris did not make the mistake of thinking it was not watched what at first she took for carved ravens perched on the summit of the arch moved suddenly one spread its wings the other let out a single sharp caw it seemed she had rung the bell with clammy hands and thudding heart she passed through the open gate the keep was deserted the passages were empty and the rooms untenanted cobwebs barred windows and flung sticky barriers across doorways merris searched from dungeon to tower with growing desperation the only inhabitants were ravens roosting on the battlements from the thickness of dust in the rooms no human being had lived there for years she dropped in a heap on the top of the tower the wind blew cool on her sweating face even while the sun shone strong enough to burn i dont understand she said coryn squatted on his haunches next to her she squinted but he seemed real he was out of breath as if he had been running to catch her how can it be empty she asked him there is a lady or someone who claims to be she visits me every year she sends my father gold and soldiers ive had nurses and tutors theyve taught me all about this place the staff the servants and who or what belongs in every room how can it be deserted the lady must have another residence coryn said a manor maybe then why dont i know about it i dont know he said then he went still as if straining to hear something faint and far away after the sun goes down he said selena says look below merris frowned what what does she mean look below she says thats all there are dungeons below said merris caves really part of the river flows through them then thats where well look he said we can rest while the daylight lasts theres no food here and i dont trust the water but i brought provisions he held up the rucksack he had brought from forgotten keep it was bulging bread from the bakery in town he said and the water we brought from the spring at last nights camp and a few odds and ends well be comfortable while we wait merris was not hungry but she was thirsty she sipped from one of the water bottles while coryn ate half a stillwarm crusty loaf with cheese melted inside it smelled so good that merris was tempted after all she managed a few bites they helped more than she would have expected she felt stronger when they had both had enough to eat and drink coryn said i saw beds below maybe we should get some proper rest merris shook her head i need the sun she said you go if youre too tired no he said ill stay with you but your companion shes down below he said shell be safe as long as its daylight merris said and shivered he looked as pale as she felt they propped themselves against the parapet side by side but not touching merris tilted her head back and let the sun bathe her face her eyelids drooped shut merris she started awake coryn was bending over her in the confusion of sudden waking she wondered why he had been bathing in blood before horror could consume her she realized that it was not blood it was sunset light coryn was his honest self with rumpled hair and travelstained clothes he was much more awake than she was ive been exploring i found torches he said she nodded there were no words in her she took one of the torches leaving him with the other two the sun was sinking fast she did not need coryns encouragement to follow him out of the open air into the dusty stillness of the keep the shadows were thick there once or twice as they worked their way down from the tower merris thought she saw someone or something flitting around a corner it must be a trick of the light no matter how often she told herself she had a right to be here she felt more like an invader the farther down she went she would have loved to run out the gate and away and never come back but neither she nor coryn paused there they kept on going toward the entrance her maps had shown her down below the gate in an empty and echoing hall coryn lit the torches in that hall laying a finger and a hard stare on each until it burst into flame the light put the dark to flight but made the shadows somehow stronger in its flicker they seemed more like living shapes than ever merris had to lead since she knew the way coryn walked close behind her he was a solid presence compared to the shadows that crowded thicker as they descended the narrow stair there was a cold smell in that place like old stone and deep water the air that breathed upward made the small hairs stand up on merris body she desperately wanted to stop turn run back into the last of the daylight every part of her that was wise or prudent was shouting at her to do exactly that but she had come to find out the truth she had to know she could not seal the bargain without some knowledge of what she was agreeing to and if it killed her then it did she had been bound to this since before she was born it was a long way down her legs were aching and her breath was coming hard well before she came to the end of the stair her torch lit nothing but a tunnel carved out of the black rock and steps descending below her they must be at least as far down as the river by now if not even farther she was stopping more often and it was taking longer for her legs to stop shaking before she could go on coryn had not said a word in all that descent she kept looking back terrified that he had vanished or perhaps worse that his spirit had been taken away and there was nothing left to follow her but an empty shell each time he met her stare with one just as tired and almost as wild just when she was about to give up the steps ended she almost fell down but coryn caught her and pulled her back onto her feet he was breathing hard himself even in the ruddy torchlight his face was pallid he rummaged in the pack he was still carrying and pulled out a water bottle she drank gratefully then handed it to him so that he could drink too they were still in a tunnel the cold damp smell was stronger the only way to go was forward unless they wanted to climb all the way back the way they had come merris strained to remember the maps she had studied her memory was good but the darkness muffled it she should be at the level of the underground river or just above it but she was not sure which the tunnel branchedat least she thought it did one way wound through a succession of caves to a blind end the other led to the river first she had to get to the branch then she had to remember which direction to take she raised her torch though her arm was as tired as the rest of her and pressed on right she thought no left the tunnel branched as she had thought but which way the wrong one would lose them both in the bowels of the earth she closed her eyes in the dark behind her eyelids she tried to picture the map it had been in a book that master thellen gave her to study tucked away in the back with the dry notes and the endless rambling appendices she could feel the book in her hands the worn leather cover and the crumbling pages there it was she almost lost it she was so glad to have found it she struggled to keep it steady then to focus on the part that she needed right she should turn right she almost turned left out of sheer doubt and panic but she gritted her teeth and followed her first inclination the cold smell was stronger in that direction or so she told herself it must be the smell of the underground river the passage widened some distance past the turn coryn moved up beside her her hand reached out and clasped his his fingers were as clammy as hers but they warmed with the contact hand in hand like children they went on into the dark the tunnel did not divide again which gave merris hope that it was the right way it twisted and turned like some vast worms trail sometimes doubling back on itself their torches began to burn low merris was beyond exhaustion one more turn one more doublingjust one more then she would worry about the one after that she walked straight into a wall that should not have been there only slowly did she realize it was a door she pushed it gave swinging outward there was the hall she remembered from the map and there was the dark oily slide of the river running through it if the tunnel had been a worms track this had the look and feel of a dragons lair all the stone in the keep and the tunnels had been black but this hall was golden red the same color as the stone that mistress patrizia had given merris curtains and streamers of waxy stone streamed down the sides and pooled in columns on the floor it almost looked like flesheven to the veins that ran through it it was calling to merris even the little time that she had worn the stone had been enough it had marked herbound her and she realized in a kind of despair it had brought her here coryns fingers tightened on merris his breath hissed merris willed him not to speak there was something in the center of the hall it looked like a depression in the floor a long shallow oval with a statue standing over it the statue moved like the crows on the arch of darkwall keeps gate it was alive slowly in the fading torchlight it took shape as a tall narrow figure in a dark cloak the hood slipped back darkwalls lady looked directly at merris she was the same as merris remembered gaunt aging not beautiful though her features had a certain stark elegance her graying hair was loose falling on her shoulders she smiled welcome my child she said her voice echoed in the cavern reverberating from wall to wall and back again over and over merris gasped and clapped her hands to her ears coryn had fallen flat your eagerness is charming the lady said the echoes were fainter now fading away merris dared to lower her hands from her ears the lady spoke again this time without echoes at all come here merris found she could not resist she left coryn lying and walked slowly across the hall it must be her imagination that the ladys cloak was made of dark scales and the bottom of it wound away in a long tail it was her shadow that was all the torch was guttering badly now both of coryns had gone out when he fell that must be why the river looked as if it ran not with water but with blood and the basin in front of the lady brimmed over with glistening darkred liquid theres no one in the keep merris said all your gold and soldierswhere did they come from i do have a manor said the lady and loyal men in my villages it sounded like an answer but it did not feel like one when merris tried to back away she found she could not move the lady came toward her she could swear she heard the rustle of scales the ladys gait was eerily smoothbut ladies were trained to walk so gliding in their long skirts she could not be slithering over that toosmooth floor like a great snake her hand brushed merris cheek it was warm and dry so young she said and growing quite lovely we have not always been blessed with beauty your bravery is impressive though some might call it foolishness is that your young man yonder or a loyal servant a friend merris said thickly its just a friend the ladys smile was as patronizing as any adults in the face of a childs silliness just a friend yes we may keep him if he pleases us every lady needs a friend merris bit her tongue there was no way she was going to tell the lady what coryn really was she had been very very foolishjust how foolish she was only beginning to understand if she lived through this she would never again sneer at a character in a story for doing something so demonstrably stupid that the veriest idiot would know better and no she was not going to blame coryns companion for getting her into this she had done it herself with or without anyone elses advice the ladys hands came to rest on her shoulders they applied no pressure but they held merris rooted her eyes were black glittering in the waning light so lovely she said so young blood so sweet with innocenceand just a tang of arrogance you highborn are so sure that the world is yours to own and youre not highborn the lady blinked had it startled her that merris could still speak but then she laughed it was not a pleasant sound i am much much older than your lords and princes merris fought to get away she could not move at all the ladys nostrils flared as if merris anger and frustration and her swelling terror had an intoxicating scent so sweet the lady said almost a purr so strong i did well when i chose you young blood is precious but young blood that is strongthat serves me very well indeed ill never serve you merris said through gritted teeth no said the lady but your blood and body will it was most enterprising of you to come early convenient too pomp and circumstance have their amusements but the crowds can be distractingand there are so many questions ill take you now then with many thanks her grip tightened her smile had grown wideunnaturally so her face was changing stretching it had a strange look a snake merris thought getting ready to swallow its prey except why swallow her own heir what a snake also shed its skin suppose it put on another one younger prettier strongerable to feign the appearance of humanity and thereby to avoid suspicion while it fed on its people the lady did not want merris she wanted merris body and merris had walked straight into her lair she must have been doing this for yearscenturies life after life body after body but where are the children merris asked the old people i could see why they would go to feed you but if there arent any children where is the next generation the lady stopped her face was almost but not quite stretched out of recognition she could still talk though the words sounded odd i was hungry had to feedkeep the body alive the cattle will breed more soon now the new body is here merris fought with every scrap of will she had but she was bound fast the lady was not human any more she was all mouth and supple scaled body she rose above merris maw gaping wide the world exploded in white fire someone was shoutingscreaming words that made no sense at all the spell on merris let go she dropped like a puppet with its strings cut a white wall reared above her silver hooves struck battering the great worm it burst like a bladder black blood sprayed the stink of it turned merris stomach inside out everything that had ever died or rotted was in that stench and every festering sickness selena trampled it into the caves floor her teeth were bared and her ears flat to her skull coryn clung to her back making no effort to stop her though she went on long after there was nothing more than a wet smear on the waxy stone the companion stood still her light had dwindled to a moonlit glow her ears were still slanted back and her nostrils were wrinkled in disgust but her fury was gone she blew out her breath in a sudden and explosive snort coryn jumped so hard he almost fell off merris found herself on her feet arms wrapped around selenas neck holding on for dear life a tiny part of her gibbered that she could be killed too she was the ladys heir after all but selena was calming down even more relaxing little by little her neck bent around but only to nuzzle merris hair she sighed into it if she had been human merris thought she would have sagged in relief we got here in time coryn said for his companion dear gods that was close did you know merris asked what she was we suspected coryn said he had the grace to look a little shamefaced selena is sorry she let you be bait shes also sorry she took so long to get here she had to wait for the change to catch the thing at its weakest point when it was completely focused on you but still that was close merris thrust herself away from the companion the flash of temper warmed her which was a good thingshe had been cold to the bone i did not let anyone do anything any stupidity i committed i did entirely on my own and bravery too that was not a voice precisely it was a womans or at least female blue eyes glowed in it the companions approval washed over merris it was a gift merris decided after due consideration to accept it by the day before merris birthday herald isak was well enough to sit in the garden and enjoy his companions company it was a beautiful day not too warm for the time of year and the roses were in full bloom there was still going to be a celebration though darkwalls lady would not be attending it people from forgotten keep were in darkwall helping its people to recover from their spellborn confusion and the grief and rage that came with it merris had come back from there the day before because she needed to see her father and her childhood home againand because coryns companion had told her she should selena was there too with coryn the companion had allowed merris to braid roses in her mane coryn seemed to think she looked silly but she was pleased with herself selena was more than a little vain herald isak smiled at them it was good of you to come back he said to merris i couldnt refuse a companions summons she said and i wanted to be here he nodded youve done well darkwall will prosper now i think i hope so she said something about his smile made her add its true isnt it you didnt come here by accident you were sent to deal with darkwall we were exploring the region he admitted and we meant to investigate certain rumors that we had heard we werent quite expecting matters to turn out as they did we were thinking more on the lines of saving an innocent from a terrible fate then making what order we could and so you did she said im grateful were grateful to you for proving yourself so well fit for the office am i she asked im hardly more than a child now that thing is gone someone else can take the keep someone older wiser better fit to rule but said isak you were raised and trained for it it was meant to be a ruse an elaborate lie but it was well done weve already sent our recommendation to the king and were sure hell approve it you are the lady of darkwall merris supposed she should raise more of a fuss but the truth was she agreed with him it scared herand well it should darkwall had a long way to go before it felt like home but with her fathers help and maybe some assistance from the king as well she could turn that poor broken valley into the prosperous domain it had pretended to be and of course isak continued through the babble of her thoughts now the spell is broken and these lands are open to us again heralds will come here more often in fact his majesty wonders if darkwall would be amenable to the presence of one of his own for a while to help as needed and guide when he can im sure darkwall would be pleased to accept such a gift merris said her words were cool but her heart was beating hard youll be coming to darkwall then are you well enough to travel i will be isak said but im not the one the king has in mind his smile slanted toward coryn there is one whose internship is just about complete who is ready for a posting his majesty wonders if since he and his companion have served darkwall so well already whether it was the height of impoliteness to interrupt and a gentleperson never let out a whoop but merris was guilty of the one and coryn of the other yes she said through his eruption yes we would be pleased she glared at him he scowled back then they grinned selena pushed between them snorting and shaking rose petals from her mane let them never forget her every move said to whom the credit really belonged never they said togetherthen broke out laughing it was going to be a very interesting association not only that thought merris partnership too and above all and perhaps most best of all friendship naught but

various cats that will assist in taking over the world any day now he can be found online at wwwmichaelzwilliamsoncom and wwwsharppointythingscom the aftermath of a battle was always confusing and ugly arden rode through the fractured pockets of suffering surveying everything with trained eyes his concern was practical casualties and effect there was little pleasure in this aspect pleasure came from a wellplanned and executed attack a lightning raid against a larger force that inflicted casualties while keeping his own troops whole a good maneuver around the flank of a worthy foe or a feint that misdirected an enemy so the toughs cracked his shield wall or line of battle the burning huts the moaning writhing bodies and the indignities and rape werent pleasurable to any but the crass the coward or the pervert a common soldier could be forgiven a few hours brutality in the aftermath his partners blood still splashed on his tunic but pain inflicted against helpless civilians as a punitive measure was the mark of a scared weakling crass coward pervert scared weakling those words well described the toughs current employer lord miklamar jobs had been few and far between and it had been necessary to move farther south to find employ but the quality of the ruler varied greatly and arden had little time to sound out prospects his concern had been for good and reliable pay with enough action to keep his troops interested not enough to wipe out them or his reputation here in acabarrin the petty lords paid well enough and the action was steady but with the king dead the squabbling princes and heirs vassallords and slavering powermad seekers were carving the corpse of the kingdom to nothing hed known nothing of miklamars reputation when he accepted the contract he despised the man now that he did ardens reputation and that of the toughs was still safe barring an occasional looted trinket and scavenged arms and armor his soldiers had left the village alone and were drawn back up in formation awaiting his orders the colors of a household unit they had not but discipline pride and the poise of professionals they did arden grimaced a bare fraction of an inch watching six of miklamars troops stretch a young woman girl really out on the ground she screamed as they tore at her silken clothes no mere peasant she but more likely the daughter of the chief or mayor whatever he would be called around this land arden watched acting as witness little he could do other than remember the event nearby others hacked a young man to pieces for the crime of having dared protect his house with a pruning hook fire and blood tinged the air turning the fresh breeze sickly sweet and metallic such a sunset was an ill omen for others arden turned his mount and headed out from the village back past the lines of the allied force ahead was the mounted figure hed have to deal with no matter how much it disgusted him shakis the regional deputy to miklamar and the mind behind this battle if battle could be applied to a bloody onesided slaughter and the present butchery he nodded in salute as he drew up it was respect for the rank of the man who had bought his services and nothing more the gesture was not returned which was as he expected lord shakis i see no point in brutalizing such peasants as these it hardly seems worth the effort it was a hint and far more diplomatic than he wanted to phrase it there are other enemies we could seek shakis gazed at him the sneering contempt he had for the mercenary was concealed but cut through to the surface anyway flickering firelight from a blazing roof making it an even uglier caricature it serves many purposes the peasants will spread the word that resistance brings only woe it improves the take and the pay for my men and it allows them some release to take vengeance on enemy scum it ensures they will have the right mindset for next time my men arden thought only male soldiers here arden would say my troops because one in twenty was a woman that had been part of the contract negotiations too as had swearing fealty to their employers god arden had conceded on a temporary allegiance to their god whose name hed already forgotten but had demanded his women warriors be kept he would have canceled the bargain otherwise all his soldiers were worthy and he wouldnt allow any suggestion otherwise the right mindset he thought that of the bully and the coward and the robber his own sneering contempt was locked down deep it was not something he would share no successful mercenary did after the evenings triumph will there be another movement he asked evenly shakis missed the sarcasm or ignored it and said there will two more towns along this front require attention each will be a harder fight are your men up to it my troops are he agreed if you are done with us for now my troops and i will encamp for the night about a mile south we are in need of rest and to care for our gear and horses as you wish though the revelry will last all night shakis chuckled and licked his lips slightly the man was handsome enough physically but his demeanor would strike fear into any civilian wench unlucky enough to meet him arden wished hed known of that ahead of time rest and care of our gear and horses he repeated we have our own revels planned with ale theyd brought and hired wenches who were part of the entourage women who didnt require a fight and wouldnt slice your throat if you passed out ale that wasnt poisoned at the last minute or badly brewed and rotten though the vengeance and poison were part of shakis calculations most certainly so that he could exact a price in response unprofessional a professional took pride in his work but didnt needlessly create more another day another battle the town of kiri arden scarcely remembered which were which anymore it was easy to remember the towns where tough honorable battles were fought likewise the ones where theyd rescued an employers forces the little villages however were never memorable which made him uncomfortable they were people too the price of honor he thought the stock in trade of a mercenary company was its competence and reliability the ragged bands of sword fodder never amounted to much nor earned much only the best units did which made those best the equal of any state or nations army in quality and outlook which offended said official armies and earned sneers sneers the toughs and the few outfits like them knew were part jealousy and part ignorance and once you knew you were morally above the people you worked for it was rough work and a conscience was both necessary and a hindrance the toughs owed allegiance to each other only they protected each other at work and in the taverns and camps afterward they thought not too hard about their opponents of the moment who would shortly be defeated or dead as part of a cold deal and a weeks pay and food so arden as kenchen before him ryala before kenchen and thoral whod founded the toughs tried for only the best contracts supporting a proud state at its border or chasing bandits were the choicest tasks caravan escort was boring but honorable as was guard duty at a border town or trading center but there were few such jobs and between starvation and ethics was a gray line once again the toughs cracked the defenses of the town that stood in the way of miklamars plan for expansion or peace or world conquest or whatever his motivation was were arden a strategic planner for a nation hed find that information and use it as a mercenary commander he stuck to the closer more local concerns of food support and pay thinking too much made working for such people harder once again the rape pillage arson and looting began the cowardly local troops reflecting the manner of their leader as was always the case arden wheeled his mount away from the spectacle assured his own wounded and dead was being cared for by their sergeants rode through the healthy ranks and nodded in salute he always recognized his troops for doing well shakis was waiting at the rear as always arden you have done well again for mercenaries he said as arden entered his tent such a greeting well for mercenaries as if sword wounds felt different to the vanquished depending on the colors worn by the soldier thrusting it home i thank you he said the campaign proceeds we will keep your men another month as we asked as long as they are paid they will remain loyal to the contract he hinted shakis barely scowled and with a nod one of his lackeys dropped a sack of coin in front of arden arden took the time to count it those two acts summed up the relationship perfectly arden didnt trust his employer and the man was fervent enough in his religion to imagine that people should want to risk their lives for it not for the first time arden pitied the towns falling to this excuse for a man then it was out to ride patrol everyone took turns at the duties of camp and skirmish even the squadron leaders and arden himself no good commander could understand the working soldiers without sharing in the menial tasks occasionally he exercised his privilege not to but it was good practice and good inspiration so he dealt with the muck and tedium and did it most of the time he met up with balyat and two newer riders balyat and he were the scouts for the ride the others backup and messengers if needed and would gain experience in the skill patrol gave him the chance to explore the area consciously and to get a feel for it inside it allowed part of his mind to relax and tour the terrainrolling hills and copses of trees with small growing streams it let him ponder the job they had contracted the work was good in a sense it was honest fighting at their end the pay decent and they had the benefits of a real army nearby all the mercenaries were in the pay of one lord meaning they werent killing other professionals of course they were killing innocent people and leaving the survivors to suffer at the hands of that lord fausan mirdu askauk shelin tiny hamlets nothing but farmers and hunters with a few basic crafters why it was necessary to fight them was beyond arden he would have simply bypassed them taken control of a large city say maujujir and let the traders spread the word that there was a new ruler the peasants never cared as long as the taxes werent extreme and they were left to their lives of course that required a leader with selfconfidence and who was secure in his power miklamar was not and therefore wasteful hed been pacifying a very small province for years proving to be a petty lord in every meaning of the word riders ahead the message came from a small part of ardens brain that never slept he didnt react at once but let his mind go over what hed seen caravan small not uncommon around an engagement area it was foolish and inadvisable to fight though both groups would report the presence of the other to clash four on two wagons and a carriage would mean certain death for at least one rider possibly all nor was arden as a hired sword expected to fight outside of his contract the train was not a massive provisioning effort so it was not a threat to the war still a challenge and meeting were necessary to determine the intent of the others and their origin arden reined back and slowed slightly watching to see that the others did they were ahead to the left crossing obliquely one of their numbers took the lead presumably the troop commander shortly the groups were drawn up facing each other a safe twenty feet apart too far for an immediate strike too close for a charge arden high rider of the toughs he introduced himself patrolling my units line count namhar of the anasauk confederacy escorting a lord the other leader agreed he wore striking blueandblack colors and had a slim lance with a small pennant his horse was armored with light hardened leather and a few small plates that were more a status symbol than protection of the four others with him two shared his colors and two were in a similar blue black and gray marking them as belonging to some side branch of the family you are mercenaries for whom do you ride namhar asked we are on contract to miklamar through his deputy shakis arden wouldnt lie anyway and the truth was best dissemblance could be seen as a sign of espionage one of the others quite young snapped you are the butchers of kiri he reined his horse and clutched reactively at his sword his partner extended a hand and caught him steady the youth was told chal had friends in kiri he is still in mourning namhar said i understand arden replied no threat offered i take no offense youre still a butchering scum the young man yelled in kiri arden said all we did was crack the defenses you lie i saw the desecrated corpses the torn for a moment chal was incoherent with rage shakis men arden said we broke the line as we were paid to and he took what he calls retribution on peasants too poor and weak to resist thereby showing the sum of his courage for a moment there was silence emotion swirled in the air all of them negative at once namhar dismounted arden nodded and did likewise his two junior troops stepped down leaving balyat mounted tall bearlike and imposing but wise enough to be a good lookout one of namhars men stayed astride his beast too the soldiers faced each other on the ground the tension lessened a mounted man was much taller and more imposing a greater threat with the horses held and the men afoot it would be harder to start trouble the shouts had brought the other travelers out the teamsters dropped from their wagons and the passengers in the carriage hurried over the young mans outrage was contagious and in moments the shouts of butcher and violator were ringing arden and his troops stood calmly and firmly though the younger of the two trembled balyat sat solidly on his horse and refused to move namhar waved his arms and got control the others acquiesced to his voice and presence and the trouble downgraded to hard breaths and angry looks i had a cousin in kiri chal said balyat spoke his voice deep and sonorous my thoughts are with you he said we fight only armed men shakis slaughtered the peasants he left none if he could help it he thought to show the kind of man he was and you let him chal said glancing between the two mercenaries arden said the toughs are hired to bear the brunt against the peasants against larger forces we are skirmishers and outriders if you know of our name we fight as we are ordered but the pillage and rapine are not the work of my soldiers i would not hire on to such nor is it worthy of my troops namhar nodded recognizing the words as being the strongest condemnation the mercenary would utter how can you fight for such animals is money so precious the man asking was a welldressed merchant turned statesman an honorable man but not one to grasp the mercenary viewpoint arden said nothing he looked around evenly finding only one pair of eyes showing understanding namhar nodded imperceptibly but in empathy he alone knew the conflict arden faced and why he could not unbind his contract he wondered now though if miklamar or shakis were trying to ruin the toughs reputation to tie them here for lesser wages probably not that would be subtle and subtlety wasnt something hed seen much evidence of it is the employment we have until released perhaps at months end release now there are worthier employers around the merchant tugged at a purse to emphasize the point that is not possible arden replied with a shake of his head we have troubled you enough good travel to you i must resume my patrol i will report this encounter with my other notes after i return and care for my horse bastard chal growled quiet chal namhar snapped high rider we thank you for the courtesy arden nodded as he swung up into the saddle it would be as easy to report the incident at once but there was no threat here and he had no orders to do so he wasnt about to offer a grace before eating without pay or orders if you do find your contract at an end soon i can offer the pay of my lord for good skirmishers i will remember that namhar arden replied offers of support are always welcome shakis appeared outraged when the message was relayed hours later you spoke to what amounts to an enemy patrol and not only didnt stop them you report it to me after a leisurely dinner they were merely a lords retinue surely you wouldnt wish me to attack possible allies allies there are no allies lord miklamar will be the undisputed ruler as is his right then you need to deal with such things not have me be your envoy yes arden asked with a cruel smile it took a moment for the petty underling to grasp the verbal spar watch your tongue mercenary shakis rasped shaking his head he continued there has been more rebellion along the border lessons must be taught i expect this entire village put to sword he pointed at a map and to the south manjeuk only another days march a lesson of slaughtered peasants yes arden thought that would surely teach other peasants not to try to live their lives if he were planning he would kill the village militia then wait with baleful eye for the rest to flee it was harsh but it was war it wasnt as dangerous tactically foolish or obscenely cruel as wanton butchery he reflected that shakis was acting professionally by his own vulgar standards he wasnt sparing the town for looting burning and rapine though not every occupant would be dead after the attack those left would be subject to the most vile humiliations this twisted troll could devise he was sure wouldnt it be more efficient to simply kill the armed men and drive off the rest why waste good steel on starving ragclothed peasants it was a reasonable question so he thought rider arden shakis said caressing a jeweled dagger before him with a blade that would turn on canvas never mind leather or iron the plans are made here you and your mercenaries that with a sniff are merely one small part of many in an engagement planned many hundreds of leauges away all we ask all we are paying for is your men to swing their swords where we tell them to and to not think too much that decided arden he knew what course to take as you command he said with a nod and turned to his own camp that order he would give that exact order before dusk his troops were ready aligned and poised for inspection the ranks were dead straight the product of proud expert riders he felt a ripple of excitement his troops those of the unassailable repute there was tykara the shinain woman tall and quick and almost as strong as some men bukli skilled at sending signals with flags hands or fires and almost as handy with a sword balyat tall and broad and powerful as an ox with a cool mature head his troops the best one could pay for his troops under pay of a cretin duty he turned through each rank examining each raised arm sword or spear to see that they fit his orders all were clean well cared for and ready all his troops quivered in eagerness and a little fear the brave could admit fear fear was part of being human only the coward and the fool denied fear every soldier every weapon fit and ready as he had demanded and now to follow the orders of the cretin he passed behind the last rank then turned between two troops they flinched not a bit nor did their horses shy as he urged his mount fury to a fair gallop then he was through the front rank and behind him came the snorts of horses and the yaaah of riders thunder rose from the ground thunder that he commanded thunder that shattered armies far ahead brave and fearful peasants in sorry untrained formation prepared to die for their homes they trembled in fear armed with hooks and forks and an occasional spear a handful with bows was arrayed in the rear he respected them far more than the scum he worked for this night but he did work for them duty and he would see that duty done perhaps five hundred yards and the flickering lights of torches melded with a blood red sunset to set the mood for the work ahead manjeuk was the name of a quiet town in a forest meadow tonight however it was a darktinged collection of rude huts with little prettiness a hundred yards and he could see faces grubby and fearful and shifting in grimaces that was just enough time to brace shield and lower sword he hit the defensive line and burst through the front rank these poor peasants were no match in any fashion for professional soldiers he chopped down and connected with a skull feeling the crack through his arm he let the impact swing his arm back then brought it into a thrust that knocked another man from his feet he brought the tip up as he swung his shield out on the other side two men sprawled one of them nudged by furys left forehoof then he was through that dismal line of men with inadequate stakes and pits had been the defense theyd lasted not five seconds urging fury to a charge he cleared the deadly empty space ahead four good gallops did it and no arrow came close few arrows came anywhere then he was inside the town a crone with a pitchfork thrust at him and he dodged slashing at her chest she went down behind her was a cowering girl of perhaps twelve who had dropped her stick and was whimpering a slight poke was sufficient for her a boy of fifteen or so wouldnt succumb to a single blow and had to be hit three times stupid of him not to stay down once hit but that wasnt ardens concern he reined back turned and galloped on an old man in a doorway didnt have time to raise his ancient rustcaked sword two younger men drew out a rope arden cursed and ducked snatching at it and twisting the shock pulled them to the ground behind him tykara whacked one dogged over and twisted jabbed the other and recovered then they were through the town and done few casualties but no loot or anything positive to show for it he sniffed in disgust as he waved his arm for the toughs to form up duty done now to encamp again they circled wide around the now flaming town what was left was shakis concern and arden found that most amusing the camp was as it had been patrols far out pickets at the outskirts the wounded and support armed and still a threat to intruders even if not the heavy combatants the regulars were only half the toughs were involved in any given battle the rest including recruits and their sergeants supported them the regimental fire was huge the heat palpable many feet away farther out squadrons and smaller elements had their own blazes then there were those for the watch toughs camp was a ring of fire ever brighter toward the center where arden sat with his troop leaders arden took a healthy slug of his ale it was a good rich brew that quenched and refreshed him the bread had been baked that morning with a chewy crust and nutty flavor the cheese was dry crumbly and sharp he dug in with gusto once mirke had finished roasting that yearling stag he would enjoy the flavor of it the flavor that was already wafting through his nose and taking form regardless of their orders it had been a good nights work and he was proud of it pride and prowess in duty it was the only really valuable thing he had he cherished it a faint warmth and tingle from the ale made it sweet then shakis that damned foppish envoy arrived his horse clattering with ridiculous flashy accouterments arden wasnt surprised and knew exactly what his complaint was to be before the worm opened his mouth high rider arden lord miklamar is most displeased with your performance if it can be called that in manjeuk we did as we were ordered he replied stonefaced as we swore to you were ordered to put the village to the sword and spear and so we did he replied he refused to get upset with the likes of this it would not be honorable emotion he reserved for those worthy who might be allied or enemy but whom he would count as men this was not a man i expected you would take your swords out of your scabbards before striking with them and use the sharp ends of your spears then perhaps you should have so specified in your orders arden said smiling faintly behind him were snickers no doubt everyone in manjeuk had been confused to have the fiercest riders of the south gallop through swatting and poking them with scabbarded swords no doubt they were all bruised and broken from it but none had been stabbed or cut the orders had not specified that and had specified the mercenaries were not to think too hard because of your cowardice shakis said and balyat and tykara growled with flinty gazes arden laid out a palm to hold them it was all he needed to command them despite the mortal insult because of your cowardice our men took near twenty deaths i lost a man too arden replied bukli my best messenger you have my pity sellsword shakis replied he was reaching a frothing level within arden could see no matter the town was taken and now our men show them what it means to lose the expression on his face was a combination of excitement and lust that was simply obscene it would have been better arden realized to have killed the poor bastards quickly hed done them no favors as it was the grumbling around him rose to a barely audible level as shakis rode out ardens troops were no happier than he for a week the toughs were kept in camp as other units fought it was an insult and a further waste of resources arden concealed his contempt but his troops were not so reticent theyd fought for harsh men before and torture and agony were not unfamiliar sights to any of them but any professional soldier had his limits the toughs were barely tolerating miklamars strategy and the toady who relayed his wishes something had to be done after nine days arden was called to a strategy meeting hed been shunned from the planning sessions even though he was merely an observer that banishment couldnt help his survival or plans and his inclusion now being ordered to present himself was yet another slap he had expected it of course hed hoped his disgusted protest in the last battle would have led to the contract being let but either miklamar or shakis was too stupid or petty for that they wasted pay to keep the toughs doing nothing arden arrived and was ignored movements were planned orders given messengers and commanders sent silence reigned around arden with no word or acknowledgment given him by anyone commanders of units hed fought alongside and who mutually respected him gave him only a glance and then studiously avoided further interaction for two hours arden sat in cold drafts at the wall of the tent watching the flickering lamp flames in meditation he refused to get angry for that was what shakis wanted when orders came at last while shakis loudly chewed a pork shank at his table spitting and getting grease on his maps they were insultingly direct arden you have a chance before you to redeem yourself this afternoon we destroy the last vestiges of the old kingdom in this district you will strike in the van and attack the village that means with your weapons in hand with the sharp ends fight as hard as you can i will countenance no clever ploys this time or i will have your men and yourself used for target practice by my archer regiment you will fight any who oppose you you will lay waste as your reputation demands and once we are done you will be sent on your way since you are reluctant to help the rise of a strong empire but i hold you to your contract yet yes shakis i will do as you command there being no point in further discussion arden dismissed himself shakis was aware of his departure but made no sign of noticing the orders created a conflict of moral outrage in arden he couldnt obey an order to slaughter innocents it was unprofessional cowardly and unmilitary nor could he break his sworn oath and contract as he always did when troubled he rode patrol his thoughts drifted and distance from shakis made him feel cleaner hed had disputes with employers before even if this scraped the hoof for lowness he rode ahead of the three troops with him just so he could feel more alone it was a cool night slightly misty and fires could be seen behind the town of a small force preparing to support the town once attacked miklamars only good strategy was to use his larger army to spread the threat of his neighbors though that might be accidental rather than strategic planning count namhar showed far better sense with his force high in the defense prepared to rush in on a force bogged down even briefly in the town below he knew he couldnt save the village so hed use it as an anvil to hammer shakis force against hed do far more damage that way including to the toughs arden wondered if he could arrange to be where the counterattack would happen so as to have an honorable fight against a decent enemy something crept up through his mind and coalesced into a thought yes he just might be able to do that it would take courage risk his life and save his oath that made it worth doing he wheeled fury about and galloped back to camp leaving the other three soldiers to catch up while they wondered what their commander was doing count namhar watched the unfolding battle from a hilltop part of him craved to be down below with his brave men doing what could be done to restrain a horror a horror that not only outnumbered them but had hired crack mercenaries he was thankful that the leadership used both mercenaries and indigenous forces poorly his presence on the hill was for tactical advantage he had a small device from the mages that could potentially change the course of a battle if used well the tube was a magic eye its rippling patterns almost oily resolved to crystal clarity when stared through he could see events far across the field and send swift messengers to maneuver his forces the eye only let him see things larger it couldnt see things beyond obstacles but did enhance anything within line of sight and the mercenaries were just within that line it took only a moments glance to cause him to grin a surge ran through him of respect for a mercenary who embodied every virtue a soldier should have there was loyalty and then there was honor above those was courage and it took tremendous courage to do what ardens troop was doing now somewhere they must have been ordered to attack the village and thats what they were doing arden was a genius and brave beyond words to offer such a tactic exploiting it would cost lives but the tactic was suicidally foolish and namhar could exploit that at once he could wipe out the toughs to the last troop though to do so would be a shame then the true nature of it hit him send rorsys force down to take them he ordered the nearest of his aides at once at the charge or dismounted no take them alive namhar said this had to be done just right a man with a sword was still dangerous and if he knew arden as he felt he did the man wouldnt simply surrender my lord i am confused his aide said i will explain but quickly we have little time and indeed there was a risk if arden was what he seemed it could be handled rather quietly but the flash of steel could turn it into the bloodbath it had looked to be from the beginning attack the town shakis had ordered town had two meanings either the population and resources of the small settlement or the physical structure of it it was that way arden had chosen to obey the order and his troops had agreed with hesitation and fear but in support of their commander and in rebellion against the detestable creature whod hired them and debased them their honor was their coin in trade they would fight as hard to protect it as to earn it arden kept his face impassive and hacked again the daubed withes of the wall powdering under his onslaught yards away balyat crushed small beams with swings of his ax the toughs were arrayed along a front perhaps two hundred yards wide surrounding the rude buildings and smashing them to the south shakis other forces were slaughtering the helpless arden had killed one dweller whod faced him with a staff the others had run some had seen the mercenaries senselessly beating buildings and taken the opportunity to run away or to the battle farther south one didnt question an enemys error behind arden there were men approaching in colors that made them allies of lord namhar each swing of his head let him see their approach they were moving to flank him and were unarmed so they were civilians not a threat he told himself clarifying the strategy in his mind he was playing games with his orders and the risk was great he probably wouldnt die at this point though both revenge and charges of atrocity could lead that way he might destroy a company that had a decadeslong reputation for honest fighting if this worked he would indeed have employ and stories told for generations but the chance for death or disgrace as an oathbreaker hung on the other side of the balance but some lords were beneath any contempt duty bound him to a contract only honor could make him respect a man the two burly civilians closed on him and he pointedly ignored them they were dressed in battle leather and well scarred professionals themselves they had orders and perhaps they understood those orders if they didnt raise weapons he was under no compunction to fight them under any oath he or the toughs had ever sworn we fight only armed men but if they did he would perforce respond in kind all his troops had their orders all would obey but a panicky moment could lead to a closequarters bloodbath with horrific results for all all three of them knew how it must play out and the scene would replay across the front arden could not decline to engage could not offer to surrender to unarmed men if asked hed have to refuse as he drew back for another blow one of the two lunged at him he spun shifted and made to take a swing his trained reflexes prepared to strike a blow that would cleave a man then the ground shifted and he tumbled cracking his head against his helmet as he crashed his sword arms flew above his head and bashing fists broke his grip he kicked snapping his right foot in a blow that elicited a pained grunt the fists rained down on his chest driving the breath from him mercenary you are disarmed will you now surrender to lord namhars courtesy i will he said there was no dishonor in surrender once unable to fight and hed followed his orders exactly his employerformer employerhad been the lowest filth imaginable to be captured thusly should make him feel proud it didnt surrender the toughs didnt surrender a wrenching pain that wasnt physical tore at him certainly the fight had been honorable but it was a defeat in the employ of a weakling that cost dearly in reputation in pride in selfrespect not to mention the hundreds of townsfolk who had been killed i am to offer you employ with lord namhar at guild scale and with a bonus of one fifth or else you may have free passage to our northern border he heard the words but there was no pleasure in him hed won this battle for his honor by losing the battle in the field even though hed planned it that way it was dizzying shocking slowly he rose to his feet one of the two had rushed to join a group of fellows beating balyat to the ground the bulky warrior needed six of them to restrain him before he finally acceded arden couldnt help but grin it restored some small breath of life to the unit that even disarmed they fought so hard his remaining escort was panting for breath and bleeding from nose and lip arden had acquitted himself well enough though he would have a hard time convincing himself i am captain onri his captor said if you will give your word of honor to be peaceable i will escort you to count namhar my word you have captain arden said feeling a slight rise from the depths his soul had sunk to he walked away from the village smiling he had lived through his oath to a coward he had lost by his oath to a good man landscape of the imagination by mercedes lackey mercedes lackey is a fulltime writer and has published numerous novels including the bestselling heralds of valdemar series she is also a professional lyricist and a licensed wild bird rehabilitator tarmas stomach growled and she tried to appease it with a long drink of water it wasnt fooled and growled again the problem with being a lowlevel mercenary pair without an impressive reputation was that sometimes you wound up at the end of a job in a place where your talents werent needed and when that place was as lawplagued as this one theyd escorted a very nice old lady to the timid niece who was going to take care of her in her old age an exceptionally lowpaying job but one that kethrys sword need had insisted that they take appropriately as it had turned out since the poor old woman evidently bore a striking resemblance to a very wealthy old woman in the same town and kidnappers had decided erroneously that they were one and the same still it hadnt done much to fatten their purses it had led them here the duchy of silverthorn possibly the most lawabiding part of the world that tarma had ever seen and no one wanted them worse everything was horribly expensive because of the taxes on everything that paid the salaries of the lawkeepers and constables worse still there were more than enough lawkeepers and constables keeping a jaundiced eye on strangers that when their money ran out and they had to leave their inn it was obvious that it was going to be difficult if not impossible to acquire food for themselves by underhanded means without getting caught so the only way to handle the situation was to saddle up and move out ignoring hunger pangs for the two or three days it was going to take them to get out of the duchy normally it would only take a day at most but but traffic was held by law to a snails pace here and constables enforced that as well the only members of the party that were happy were the warsteeds and warrl the steeds because not only was grazing the roadverge permitted it was encouraged so they were getting enough to content them and warrl because he was resorting to the usual foodsource of wolves and things that looked like wolves in the summer mice and rats and that too was encouraged once constables saw him pouncing and gulping in the ditches they were perfectly happy to leave him alone you really ought to try these warrl said happily in tarmas head theyre quite delicious fat tender i dont know why they have a rodent problem here but i am certainly pleased that they do tarmas stomach growled again suggesting that at this point fricassee of rat was sounding good but tarmas brain went into revolt no matter that she had eaten worse things this was not something her mind wanted to contemplate surrounded as they were by civilization there should be meat pies stew bread and cheese her mind insisted pease porridge bread and onions at least it was not going to put up with the idea of eating mice youve eaten voles she reminded it those were clean wilderness creatures her mind said primly mice are not you dont know where theyve been well her mind had a point and if they couldnt afford to eat they most certainly could not afford to get sick they taste just fine to me warrl said gleefully as he pounced tossed and gulped their current pacestalled actually while they waited for a big hayladen cart to negotiate a difficult turnwas so slow that warrl was having no trouble in hunting for such small prey urg said her mind and she resolutely turned her thoughts away from the idea properly speaking warrl should have been kethrys familiar not hers kethry was the sorceress kethry was the one who had cast the spell to summon a familiar but warrl was his own kyree and he had decided that kethry who already was bound to the spellsword need that gave her fighting powers equal to just about any swordswoman tarma had ever seen did not need a familiar but tarma evidently did so the two of them were bound to exceedingly useful but occasionally vexing partners kethry to a sword that forced her to come to the aid of any female in jeopardy and tarma to a calfsized wolfishlooking beast with a penchant for sarcasm a weakness for bards and a distinct and unique sense of humor usually at his mindmates expense the haywain was still stalled in front of them now the driver was arguing with a constable her stomach growled she resisted the urge to ride along the verge the last time shed done that the constable had threatened to fine them the only reason he hadnt was because kethry turned out their purses proving they had nothing and pointed out that if they were jailed they would be housed and fed at the expense of the duchy mind that was beginning to look attractive except that the warsteeds and everything they owned would be confiscated and sold no not a good option tarma was all in favor of laws but this place was ridiculous kethry couldnt even earn some money by performing minor sorceries because she wasnt licensed as a magician in this duchy which license of course cost money kethry was looking around with impatience the other side of the roadreserved for traffic going the other directionwas absolutely clear well of course it was the hay wagon was blocking it is there any reason why we have to go in this direction she asked tarma well no but tarma didnt get to finish that statement kethry nudged hellsbane with her heels turned the warsteeds head and set off down the clear and open side of the road its all the same to me warrl said philosophically there are just as many mice in that ditch tarma had no idea where they were and she didnt much want to stop long enough to find out as long as they got out of the duchy that was all she cared about were heading for the pelagirs warrl remarked philosophically oh bloody hell keth warrl says were headed for the pelagirs yes i know the pelagir hills were as chaotic and magicinfested as the duchy of silverthorn was lawabiding thats probably the reason why these people are so lawobsessed its their way of dealing with the insanity on their doorstep kethry who was usually far more cautious about venturing into the pelagirs than tarma was seemed entirely cavalier about this idea but why kethry turned in her saddle and looked back at her partner because if id had to look for another candlemark at the back of that haywagon i was going to kill someone because they longer we stay in this place the more likely we are to do something that gets us thrown in jail because my stomach is growling and because im getting a faint twinge from need that is sending my head in this direction oh bloody hell oh no oh hell no not this time tarma protested the last time is what got us stuck out here in the first place so were due for a change of luck kethry replied with no hint of irony she owes us one maybe shes responding to our hunger pangs by finding us a good client maybe youre living in a dream world tarma growled under her breath not that it matters all that much we still have to get out of here and whoever this is if they have food well already be ahead of where we were in answer kethry nudged the gray flanks of the warsteed again moving her into a slightly faster pace tarma knew that sign by now the magical pull on kethry was getting stronger they rode over the top of a hill and found themselves staring down a long flat slope that went on for leagues until abruptly as if at an invisible line that marked a place where sanity ended the landscape changed abruptly from the rolling manicured fields to steep rockcrowned hills whose tops rose above a forest of trees so tortured and twisted it looked as if some sadistic giant had been wrenching their limbs about in the pelagirs then tarma sighed oh hold back my surprise they were stopped at the border by guards who were immensely suspicious of anyone who wanted to go into the pelagirs and from the look of the fortified wall they were going to have to pass under the duchy put a lot of time and effort trying to keep things from the pelagirs out after dealing with their questions for the better part of a candlemark tarma finally lost patience she glared at the guards and silently summoned warrl who rose up from where he had been hidden in the grass of the ditch he moved in to stand by her side as the guards became very still tarma looked their officer in the eyes we just want to go home she said tonelessly within moments they were looking back at the closed gate from the pelagirs side of the wall you know theyre never going to let us back in there kethry remarked in a conversational tone i can live with that tarma replied at least there are enough normal animals in here that we can hunt her stomach growled agreement at least kethry didnt take off across country following the sometimeselusive trace that her sword would give her she allowed hellsbane to trot sensibly along what passed for a road here which was a faint track among the trees tarma kept a sharp eye out for game but just as importantly so did warrl warrl with his keen nose and sharper eyesight should be able to pick out what was safe for them to eat but the forest was deserted she would have said strangely deserted but these were the pelagirs and nothing much was strange there ever her stomach growled mushrooms she suggested to kethry watercress kethry shook her head i wouldnt try it she advised very bad idea you can have no idea whats been changed in the blasted things maybe they wouldnt be poisonous but do you really want to find yourself in the middle of hallucinations or intoxicated to the point you cant stand up well no silent forest with the silence interrupted only by the faroff drip of water and the dull thudding of the warsteeds hooves on the turf and of course by the growling of tarmas stomach i believe mindmate i have found kethrys goal came the familiar voice in tarmas mind at the same time that kethry said by the feel of things my target is they rode up over a rise there kethry finished it certainly looked that way in the valley below in what looked like a temporary camp was a woman a particularly agelesslooking woman with a relatively unlined face despite a coiled mass of silver hair fastened in place with pins a little plump but otherwise in very good physical shape there was no way of telling what she was from her costume a wellmade set of brown riding leathers with a split skirt rather than breeches or trews there were three horses with her all with saddles there were two ominous mounds of earth off to the side of the camp she looked up and spotted them at the top of the ridge line and regarded them thoughtfully tarma knew what she would see sitting on a matched pair of ugly gray horses bigboned and bigheaded were two women the one in the buffcolored traveling robes also with a split skirt or a sorceress of the white winds school had a pretty soft face a mass of ambercolored hair pulled back into a tailand the end of a sword sticking up over her right shoulder the other in the allblack leather and armor of a shinain swordsworn had the hawklike features black hair prominent nose and goldentanned skin typical of her race her hair had not yet grown out and only brushed the tops of her shoulders it was held in place by a leather headband to keep it out of her eyes a sword hilt also protruded over her right shoulder there was a quiver hanging from her left hip a bow in a bow sheath at the saddle and probably far more knives than the woman even dreamed possible both hidden and openly sheathed on tarmas person beside tarma was warrl a kyree a creature who came from this part of the world about the size of a young calf with a wolfish head but a body more like that of one of the big speedster hunting cats of the dhorisha plains warrl was a small army in and of himself whatever was wrong the woman did not appear to be in immediate danger that was probably why need hadnt been prodding kethry with the goad of pain into speeding down the road at a breakneck speed she also wasnt intimidated by them which was interesting although there were not many female bandits such things werent unknown which implied that whoever or whatever she was the woman thought she could handle herself against two armed people and a large and dangerous beast they looked down she looked up finally she spoke so she said i dont suppose youre for hire they rode down the slope slowly tarma was all for saying yes then and there but kethry for once was more cautious what happened here she asked the woman sighed im on my way to keep an appointment with acolleague i had two temporary fighters with me while i was off taking the horses to water them i left them here to set up camp and something attacked them i heard the commotion but by the time i got back here it was too late tarma did not bother to ask what because clearly if the woman had known she would have told them signs she asked instead something large with a lot of teeth and claws she replied magic the aura was all over the place and it didnt want to face me so magic probably was its one vulnerability she glanced away from them up the road leading deeper into the pelagirs ive been here before that condition isnt going to hold for long sensible too once again tarma almost said were available when keth forestalled her conditions of employment she asked coolly well that was a change needs prodding must be nothing but a little nag in the back of her head the woman started to answer when tarmas stomach announced to the universe just how hungry she was the woman looked startled then laughed first condition is that i feed you she said with a shrewd smile id much rather negotiate with the sleepy and satisfied than the lean and hungry it was trail food dried beef bread you could drive a nail with tarma didnt care at this point she would readily have broken teeth into order to get something to her stomach her stomach wasnt objecting either negotiations and meal concluded about the same time the woman drove a hard hard bargain nothing up front fee to be paid only at the conclusion of the journey on the other hand what did they have to spend coin on out here and finally they got their employers name nanca jente sorceress who claimed no particular affiliation how do you feel about riding in the dark nanca asked as they shook hands on the bargain full moon tonight and ive lost most a lot of time here the two exchanged glances ive got no objections tarma said but im not the one that makes the decision on whether or not to move in the dark and she cast a significant look at hellsbane and ironheart nanca followed her look and raised one silver eyebrow all right she said if your horses refuse to move we stop and as it happened the moon rose large and bright and though the warsteeds slowed their pace to an ambling walk they were able to see well enough that they didnt actually object to moving through the night at least until the moon began to descend and at that point both mares snorted and made their objections to going on in pitch dark known for her part tarma was nodding off in the saddle and though nanca groused and grumbled she didnt do so for long the camp that they made was sketchy at best they only unpacked their bedrolls arranged the horses around them and crawled into the blankets in the dark they were on their way again at dawn tarma got the impression of a certain amount of urgency as if their employer had a deadline she had to meet so she pushed the warsteeds a little more than she might otherwise have done and with three mounts to switch off nanca was well able to keep up and so it was that they reached their goal on the second day just as the sun began to set which was about at the point where tarma gave serious thought to walking on their deal because their goal was a gate you didnt say anything about a gate kethry said as the three of them stared down into the little valley the thing was alive and active too the pillars on either side shimmered with energy and the strange blackness that was the hallmark of any active gate pulled and tugged on the eyes in a way calculated to make whoever was looking at it feel sick you didnt either their employer pointed out is it an issue you dont know where those things come out tarma objected with a glance at her partner ah but i do nanca replied with the faintest of smiles it comes out in the place where i am supposed to meet my colleague of course it did and then what tarma demanded then you continue to do what i contracted to you for you guard me and fight off anything physical that comes to attack me and i deal with anything of a magical nature until we reach my colleague and once we are there i pay you and he provides the exit point which will drop you through another gate relatively near the dhorisha plains nanca shrugged after that where you go is your business that was another thing granted kethry was probably not the magician that nanca wasbut why forbid her to work magic at all unless it was because the nature of what lay on the other side of that gate was of such a strange nature that nanca didnt want a sorceress unfamiliar with it meddling with it tarma and kethry exchanged another glance and finally tarma fingered the mindbond that held her to warrl what do you think she left lying on the surface of her thoughts i think that i sense deception in her but no harm whatever is going on here she intends nothing unfortunate for us nor does she foresee anything unfortunate hmm nanca dug into her saddlebags and passed over journey bread to both of them tarma gnawed on it while she thought looking and notlooking at the gate in the end it was her full stomach that decided her nanca was certainly right about that part lets go now it was nanca who hesitated a moment but before she could say anything tarma was already drawing her sword and parryingdagger and looping ironhearts reins through the pommel hold on the saddle she felt ironheart shift under her into full alertness ready to answer to leg and weightshift signals rather than rein she heard the sound of need clearing her sheath and knew that kethry was doing the same she turned her attention to their employer shinain proverb she said it is better to prepare for an ambush and look foolish than not and look dead nanca smiled broadly and gestured in that case after you warrl went through first gates were probably tarmas least favorite way to travel and thus far she had only had to endure two this was the third and as usual it was horrible there was a sense of dislocation with the world the bottom dropping out of everything a freezing cold that wasnt really cold blackness like the inside of the head and a myriad of other sensations all awful that passed too quickly to be identified then they were on the other side there was an ambush warrl had already gone after them the ambushers must not have counted on anything that wasnt human because he already had control of the group locked down with a harsh shinain warcry tarma waded in and it had to be the strangest bunch she had ever fought somebodys retainers because they were identically dressed buff trews red surcoats chainmail three archers already down and a dozen swordsmen but what was strange was the way they fought exactly alike every one of them had the same fourmove fighting pattern overhand slash shield block underhand thrust parry absolutely the same and in the same order once she realized that tarma had them down in no time and realized the second thing no blood automata said kethry constructs and she looked directly at nanca nanca nodded these are the simplest there will be more i was about to warn you there might be an ambush but you were already preparing for one so i kept my mouth shut now tarma looked out at the land on the other side of the gate and found it no different than the part of the pelagirs they had just passed through wooded hills plenty of places for more ambushes the one difference was the nice clear road that cut through the woods she looked at it and sighed i suppose we have to stick to the road nanca nodded it would be a very very bad idea to get off the road she said the landscape itself is not predictable once you get off the road and at the same time its too predictable what the hell is that supposed to mean tarma asked frowning that features can appear and vanish at random sometimes nanca told her but worse than that landmarks repeat so that you cant tell where you are landmarks repeat tarma got a bewildering vision of identical trees identical rock formations repeating over and over again like decorative tiles and suddenly bloody hell she blinked and looked straight at nanca as all of the pieces came together this is a game and your colleague is really your opponent and this she waved her hand at the landscape is a giant playing board ha rather than being offended nanca seemed delighted by the gods you are smart ones and you cant tell us because that would violate the rules kethry said slowly nanca nodded but us figuring it out for ourselves is fine rather than feeling offended tarma was actually delighted has anyone done this before ive never brought fellow players in here before nanca said her eyes now very bright with interest only the two constructs im allowed as helpers but there was nothing in the rules that said i could not bring fellow players in and when my constructs met an untimely end before i could enter the gamespacei thought maybe i would try putting out a gentle magical probe for help she raised her eyebrow my friend and i invented this to keep each other sharp but i must tell you that i would not have permitted either of you to come to serious harm practice is one thing being hurtwe both have ways to bring the game to an end still she pursed her lips this game is timed and we are already late and it does get a great deal tougher the closer we get to our goal tarma felt a wide grin spreading over her face lets see if we can win this thing shall we now that they knew what to expect tarma concentrated on understanding the logic laws by which the constructed opponents they met operated she sent warrl out ahead knowing that whatever he found was all they would have to worry about for the moment and one of the first laws she determined was that there was a set distance at which the constructs noticed them they sat their horses just outside that predetermined distance and watched the constructed ambush party stand there like so many mannequins while tarma assessed them and worked up a strategy the usual i think she said finally you sweep in from the left flank kethry ill come in from the right warrl circles around and comes in from behind ah nanca nodded before tarma could add the last and i keep their attention from the front because i have better ability to strike from a distance id never tried that before but then my constructs were never bright enough to operate with a lot of reliable independence heh thats encouraging then tarma said with a grin lets see if this works be prepared to retreat if you have to nanca urged theres no shame in that kethry sighed and grimaced you just told a shinain swordsworn that there is no shame in retreat this is a trifle like telling the village drunk that there is no shame in putting the wine bottle down and walking away from the tavern nanca laughed as tarma made a face of her own im not that bad she protested then added am i kethrys silence and significant stare were answer enough tarma flushed lets just do this shall we was all she managed to say it would not be fair to say that they cut across the landscape like a team of experienced mowers across a hayfield nanca had been correct the closer they got to their goal the more difficult and numerous the foes became and the closer to their goal the more magicianconstructs also appeared designed specifically to neutralize or at least occupy nanca herself this were the most clever and the closest to actual intelligence and tarma was very glad that she and kethry were not the ones directly facing the things they were not coming out of this unscathed that much was certain too at the end of each battle they were at the very least completely exhausted and the injuries they got were quite real yes nanca could and did heal them almost immediately but they did hurt and they did incapacitate but tarma at least was finding something exhilarating about this it was like having the perfect training scenario you didnt learn anything in fighting by not getting hurt after all and the closer they got to the endgame as nanca called it the more cheerful she became if we can pull this off as a draw she said finally i will be happy quite quite happy actually coming into this handicapped i am not settling for a draw tarma had opened her mouth to declare something of the sort but kethry to her astonishment beat her to it eh the swordsworn said looking curiously at her partner who was at the moment looking rather the worst for wear with her robes more than a bit cut up her hair straggling out of its tail and the beginnings of a black eye that was just one of the many sets of bruises they had both collected bruises after all were not incapacitating and nancas reserves of healing energies were limited i am not settling for a draw i think we can win this one but id like to suggest a strategy change myself kethry settled an unsheathed need across her lap am i right in thinking we are going to encounter your opponent in this endgame nanca nodded absolutely and rather than relying on the constructs going through their patterned moves hell be directing some of them personally thats what i thought kethry looked over at her partner weve been taking out the weakest of the constructs first then concentrating the fighting of all three of us on the strongest this time i think we should ignore all that instead we all converge on this magefriend of nancas and take him out once hes down the game is over right right nanca pounded a fist into her cupped hand with delight and that is the last thing he is going to expect because weve been doing the opposite of that until now the essence of what is going to work is that we cant be predicted is there any way you can give us an overview of the battle site kethry asked i dont nanca began and thenher eyes fell on warrl and she began to grin mindmate warrl said with alarm backing up a pace i am not at all certain i like where this is going i knew i would not like where this was going warrl complained bitterly as he hovered in place four paws dangling limply in midair if the gods had intended us to fly they would have made us gryphons hush up and practice tarma admonished him just do what nanca told you to do run as if you were running on the ground its undignified he protested ears laid back flat but obeyed finally even nanca was satisfied with what he was doing youre no tayledras bondbird but youll do she said with satisfaction now just make sure jendran doesnt see you and youll be fine im doomed warrl said bitterly im a calfsized flying predator how is he not going to see me but he galloped clumsily up into the sky anyway tarma closed her eyes and concentrated on what warrl was showing her the layout of the troops the disposition of the special constructs that their opponent would be operating himself and most importantly the whereabouts of jendran himself ack bleated warrl as suddenly crossbow bolts from three separate units came hurtling toward him and warrl came hurtling back at top speed now displaying a great deal more agility than he had going out or at least agility in the air he landed like a sack of wet sand three crossbow bolts sticking out of his improvised battlearmor and he glared at tarma if you ever ask me to do that again he said savagely i will bite you i will remove a very large piece of your flesh and forever after you will be known as tarma the halfa they know were coming tarma said hastily the advantage of surprise is over lets move people the victory feast was very real it was held outside the gameworld in no small part because what was inside the gameworld was not entirely real jendran had a small but comfortable keep literally on the threshold of the gate terminus complete with several servants and a really good cook none
