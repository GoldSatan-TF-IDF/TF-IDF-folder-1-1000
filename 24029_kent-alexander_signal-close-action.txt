alexander kent signalclose action bolitho like leviathans afloat lay their bulwarks on the brine while the sign of battle flew on the lofty british line campbell the squadron beneath gibraltar s towering and craggy protection the mixed collection of anchored shipping tugged at their cables and waited for the sudden squall to abate despite streaks of pale blue which showed themselves occasionally between the brisk clouds the air was cold with a bite in it more common in the bay of biscay than the mediterranean considering its strategic importance gibraltar s anchorage was unusually deserted a few storeships some brigs and schooners finding shelter or awaiting orders made up the bulk of vessels there and of major menofwar there were but three anchored well apart from the other hotchpotch of local craft were three ships of the line seventyfours which in this month of january were still the most popular and the most adaptable vessels in any plan of battle the one anchored nearest to the land bore the name lysander across her broad counter a name to match the figurehead which stared angrily from beneath her bowsprit it was a fine figurehead with the blackbearded spartan general adorned in crested helmet and breastplate originally carved by henry callaway of deptford like the rest of the big twodecker it was well painted with a look of newness which belied the ships eleven long years in the kings service back and forth up and down her wide quarterdeck her captain thomas herrick walked with barely a pause to peer towards the shore if he considered his ships appearance and condition it was more from anxiety than pride the months of work in england to get lysander ready for sea the whole wearing business of recommissioning and gathering what amounted to practically a raw company had gone on without a pause stores and powder water and provisions weapons and the men to handle them herrick had more than once questioned the fates which had given him his new command and yet despite the delays and infuriating slackness amongst dockyard men and chandlers he had seen his ship grow from a disorganized chaos to a living vital creature frightened men brought aboard by the unrelenting pressgangs and others gathered by motives as varied as patriotism or merely fleeing into the navy to avoid a hangmans halter had been slowly and painstakingly molded into something which if still far from perfect could offer hope for the future the first squall in the bay as lysander had crawled south towards portugal had brought some weakness to light too many seasoned hands in one watch too many landsmen in another but under herricks careful watch and the efforts of lysanders remaining backbone of professional warrant officers they had at least come to terms with the awesome maze of rigging the rebellious and treacherous folds of canvas which made up their daily lives at sea once at anchor below the rock herrick had waited with growing apprehension for this particular day more ships had arrived and anchored nearby the other two seventyfours osiris and nicator the frigate buzzard and the little sloop of war harebell were no longer separate entities but part of a whole by order of the admiralty in london they had become one the squadron in which herricks ship would hoist the broad pendant of commodore and over which and through all imaginable circumstances richard bolitho would at any moment now be exercising his right of command it was strange when herrick hesitated to consider the matter it was only four months since he and bolitho had returned to england from this same sea after a bloody battle in which herricks own ship had been destroyed and a complete french squadron routed or taken they had gone to the admiralty together it still seemed like a dream a memory of long past the result of that visit had been farreaching for richard bolitho an immediate promotion to commodore and for herrick the post of flag captain their admiral had been less fortunate packed off to govern a penal colony in new south wales the very swiftness of his fall from grace had somehow measured the step between authority and oblivion herricks first overwhelming pleasure of being appointed flag captain to bolitho had been slightly marred by another of the admiraltys changes of heart instead of bolithos own ship euryalus the great one hundred gun threedecker which he had originally seized as a prize from the french they had been given the lysander easier to handle than a great firstrate possibly but herrick suspected that another officer more senior than bolitho ha ampclaimed the exfrenchman for himself he paused in his pacing and ran his eyes along the busy decks seamen were working on the gangways and boat tier others swayed high overhead amongst the black crisscross of shrouds and stays halliards and braces making sure that no frayed lines no broken wisps of hemp would greet the newcommodore as he stepped through the entry port the marines were already in position no need to worry about their major leroux he was speaking with his lieutenant a rather vacant young man called nepean while a sergeant checked each marines musket and appearance the midshipman of the watch must have an aching arm herrick thought he was very conscious of his captains presence and was holding a heavy telescope to his eye obeying the last order to report immediately when the commodores boat shoved off from the jetty herrick shifted his gaze outboard towards the other vessels of the small squadron he had had little to do with them so far but already knew quite a lot about their various captains from the little sloop which regularly bared her copper as she rolled uncomfortably in the squall to the nearest twodecker osiris they all seemed to have some sort of link nicators captain for instance herrick had discovered that he had served with bolitho during the american revolution when they had both been lieutenants their reunion might present pleasure or otherwise he thought commander inch of the dizzily swaying harebell had commanded a bomb vessel with the old squadron here in the mediterranean of buzzards captain raymond javal he had learned little but gossip hasty temper hungry for prize money he had all the makings of a typical if awkward frigate captain he let his gaze rest on the osiris once again and tried to conceal his irritation she was almost a twin to the lysander and her destiny was firmly in the hands of captain charles farquhar all those years ago it was like another fate which had somehow drawn them together once more to serve under the same richard bolitho then it had been in the frigate phalarope in the west indies during the americans fight for independence bolitho had been his captain herrick his first lieutenant and farquhar one of the midshipmen arrogant highborn farquhar never failed to prick herricks resentment even looking at his osiris did nothing to help her ornate gingerbread and other carving at poop and beakhead displayed a lavish use of real gilt paint asan outward sign of her captains status and prosperity so far they had avoided meeting each other except when farquhar had reported his arrival at gibraltar any sort of fresh beginning had faded as farquhar had drawled i say you dontseem to have spent much on the old ship eh that same maddening smile our new lord and master wont like that yknow suddenly the lower line of black gunports opened along osiriss sloping side and with perfect precision the whole battery of thirtytwo pounders trundled into the weak sunlight as one something like panic ran through herricks mind farquhar would never allow his ambitious brain lv be fogged by some stupid memory or dislike he had kept his eye on what mattered most to him which at this particular minute was to impress the commodore it happened to be richard bolitho a man more dear to herrick than any other living being but if it had been satan himself farquhar would have been ready as if to make the final stab the midshipman of the watch shouted excitedly barge shoving off from the jetty sir herrick licked his lips they felt like dry ashes very well mr saxby my compliments to the first lieutenant he may muster the hands now richard bolitho walked to the quarter windows of the broad cabin and looked towards the other ships despite the importance of the moment the solemnity of being received aboard his own flagship for the first time in his life he could not contain his excitement it was like wine and laughter all bubbling up inside him held in check by some last reserve he turned and saw herrick watching him from beside the screen door some seamen were carefully arranging chests and boxes which had been swayed up from the barge and he could hear his coxswain allday bawling angrily at someone to take care well thomas that was a fine welcome he strode across the deck with its neat covering of black and white chequered canvas and took herricks hand over head he could hear the thump of boots as the marine guard departed the returning familiar sounds of normal routine herrick smiled awkwardly thank you sir he gestured at the baggage i hope youve brought all you need it seems we may be a while from home bolitho studied him gravely herricks stocky figure his round homely face and those bright blue eyes were almost as familiar as alldays but he seemed different somehow it was only four months and yet he thought of all that had happened since that visit to the admiralty the discussions with men so senior and powerful that he still could not grasp that promotion could mean so much whenever he had mentioned his anxiety over the progress being made with his new flagship he had seen that amused look in their eyes the admiral who had given him his appointment sir george beauchamp had put it into words youll have to forget that sort of thing now bolitho the captain must deal with the runningof a ship yours is a more exacting task eventually he had taken passage to gibraltar in a fast frigate pausing in the tagus with despatches for the flagship of the fleet employed on blockade duty there he had been given an audience with the admiral the earl of st vincent so titled because of his great victory eleven months back the admiral still affectionately known as old jarvy by many of his subordinates but only when he was well out of earshot had greeted him briskly youve got your orders see you carry em out its been months since we knew what the french were up to our spies in the channel ports reported that bonaparte visited the coast many times to lay plans for invading england he had given his dry chuckle i think my medicine off cape st vincent taught em to tread warily where the sea is concerned bonaparte is a land animal a planner unfortunately we have nobody to match him yet not on land that is looking back it was hard to measure how much the admiral had managed to explain and describe in that brief interview he had been on active duty with hardly a break and yet he had been able to sum up the situation in home waters and the mediterranean better than any admiralty official the admiral had walked with him to his quarterdeck and had said quietly beauchamp is the man to plan this sort of mission but it needs seagoing officers to push those ideas to reality your squadrons efforts last year in the mediterranean told us a great deal about french intentions your admiral broughton did not perhaps understand their true significance until it was all too late for him that is he had given bolitho a grim stare we must know the worth of putting a fleet into these waters again if we divide our squadrons for a bad purpose the french will soon explore our weakness but your orders will tell you what you must do only you can decide how you are going to do it again that dry chuckle i wanted nelson for the task but he is still sorely weakened by the loss of his ann beauchamp chose you for this tickle at bonapartes underbelly i hope for all our sakes it was a wise choice and now after all the discussions the searching through reports to discover the value of countless ideas of the enemys motives and objectives he was here in his own flagship beyond the thick glass windowswere other ships all linked by the dovetailed broad pendant which had broken at the masthead as he had climbed aboard to the slap of muskets and the din of fifes and drums and he still could not believe it he felt the same as before as eager to get to sea as he had been in the past whenever he had joined a new ship but the difference would soon display itself in all manner of ways when herrick had been his first lieutenant he had stood between his captain and company the link and the barrier now herrick as flag captain would stand between him and his other officers his little squadron and every manjack aboard each individual ship five vessels in all way over two thousand souls divided amongst them it was that kind of assessment which brought home the reality of his command he asked how is young adam i did not see him when i came aboard as he said it he saw the stiffness come to herricks face i was about to tell you sir he is with the surgeon he looked at the deck a slight accident but thank god no real harm done bolitho replied the truth thomas is my nephew ill herrick looked up his blue eyes suddenly angry a stupid argument with his opposite number in the osiris sir her sixth lieutenant gave some sort of insult they went ashore on their separate duties but arranged to meet and settle the matter bolitho made himself walk slowly to the stem windows and stare down at the swirling water around the rudder a duel just the sound of the worn made him feel sick despairing like father like son it was not possible high spirits more like herrick sounded unconvinced neither was badly hurt though i gather adam nicked the other fellow the worse bolitho turned and regarded him calmly i will see him directly herrick swallowed with your permission sir i should like to deal with the matter myself bolitho nodded slowly feeling a great gap yawning between him and his friend he said quietly of course thomas adam pascoe is my nephew but he is one of your officers now herrick tried to relax i am deeply sorry to trouble you in your first hour sir not for the whole world would i wish that i know he smiled gravely it was foolish of me to interfere i was a flagcaptain and often resented my superiors hand in my own affairs herrick looked around the big cabin eager to change the subject i hope everything is to your liking sir your servant is preparing a meal and i have had some hands detailed to stow your chests for you thank you it seems most satisfactory he stopped it was happening again the formal tones the offering and an acceptance when they had always been used to sharing understanding herrick asked suddenly will we be putting to sea soon sir aye thomas tomorrow forenoon if the wind stays favourable he pulled the watch from his pocket and snapped open the guard i would wish to see my officers he faltered even that was changed he added to see the other captains as soon as is convenient i received some more despatches from the governor here but after i have read them i should like to tell the squadron what we are about he smiled dont look so troubled thomas it is as hard for me as for you for a brief moment bolitho saw the old light in herricks eyes the warmth and trust which could so easily turn to hurt herrick replied i feel like an old foot in a new shoe he smiled too ill not let you down he turned and left the cabin and after a discreet pause allday and two seamen carrying a large case strode through the door allday glanced swiftly round the cabin and seemed to approve bolitho relaxed very slowly allday was always the same and for that he was suddenly grateful even his new blue jacket with the large gilt buttons the nankeen trousers and buckled shoes which bolitho had purchased for him to reveal his new status as a commodores own coxswain did little to hide his thickset rugged individuality bolitho unfastened his sword and gave it to him well allday what do you make of her eh the man eyed him calmly a wellfound ship he hesitated over the word sir even allday had been made to alter his ways never in the past had he called him anything but captain it was their own unrehearsed arrangement the new rank had changed that too allday read his thoughts and grinned ruefully sorry about that sir he glared at the two seamen who were watching them curiously the case balanced between them but i can wait itll be sir richard afore long and thats no error allday waited until the seamen had gone and said quietly i reckon youd like to be left alone now sir ill see that your servant is warned about your customs bolitho nodded you know me too well allday closed the door behind him and glanced coldly at the ramrodstiff marine sentry outside the cabin to himself he murmured bettern youll ever know on the quarterdeck once more herrick walked slowly to the nettings and stared at the other ships it had been a bad beginning for both of them perhaps it was all in his own mind like his dislike for farquhar the latter obviously did not give a damn for him so why should he get so easily ruffled bolitho had looked exactly as he had known he would the same gravity which could alter in an instant to a youthful exuberance his hair was as black as ever his slim figure no different apart from the obvious stiffness in his right shoulder he counted the months nearly seven it must be now when bolitho had been marked down by a musket ball the lines at the comers of his mouth were a little deeper pain responsibility parts of each he decided he saw the officer of the watch eyeing him cautiously and called we will signal the squadron mr kipling all captains repair on board when i so order he pictured them putting on their best uniforms inch in his tiny cabin farquhar in his lavish quarters but each and all would be wondering as he was where bound what to expect the price for both alone in his cabin bolitho heard feet thudding along the deck overhead and after a momentary hesitation threw off his dress coat with its solitary gold stripe and seated himself at his desk he slit open the large canvas envelope but still hesitated over reading the neatly written despatches he kept seeing herricks anxious face they were almost the same age and yet herrick seemed to have grown much older his brown hair marked here and there like hoar frost it was hard not to see him as his best friend he had to think of him as a strength the flag captain of a squadron which had never acted as a single unit before a rough task for any man and for thomas herrick he tried to hold back the sudden doubts herricks poor beginnings the son of a clerk his very honesty which had marked him out as a man who could be trusted under any known circumstances could hinder his overall judgement herrick was a man who would obey any lawful order without question with no consideration for his own life or ruin but to assume control of the squadron if its commodore should die in battle it was strange to realise that lysanders original masters had fallen at st vincent her commodore george twyford had been killed in the first broadsides and her captain john dyke was even now enduring a living hell in the naval hospital at haslar too cruelly maimed even to feed himself the same ship had survived them and many more he looked around the neat cabin with its wellcarved chairs and dark mahogany table he could almost feel them watching him he sighed and began to read the despatches bolitho nodded to the five officers who stood around the cabin table and said please be seated gentlemen he watched them as they eased their chairs towards him their mixed expressions of pleasure excitement and curiosity it was a very special moment and he guessed they were all sharing it with him if for varied reasons farquhar had not changed slim and elegant with the selfassurance he had carried even as a midshipman now a postcaptain of thirtytwo his ambition shone in his eyes to match his gleaming epaulettes francis inch bobbing and horsefaced could barely restrain his great beam of welcome as commander or the sloop he would be vital for inshore work and sweeping ahead of the squadron raymond javal the frigates captain looked more like a frenchman than an english sea officer very dark and swarthy with thick greasy hair he had features so narrow that his deep set eyes seemed to dominate his whole appearance he looked at captain george probyn of the nicator and gave a brief smile they had served together in the old trojan when the american revolution had erupted to change the face of the whole world yet it was almost impossible to see him in those times he sat hunched against the table like a large shabby innkeeper a year or so older than bolitho he had left the trojan in much the same manner as himself to take command of a captured blockade runner and sail her as it prize to the nearest friendly port unlike bolitho however whose chance had led directly to his first command probyn had been captured by an american privateer and had fretted out most of the war as a prisoner until an exchange had been made with a french officer those vital years in his early service had obviously cost him dearly he looked uneasy with a sly darting way of examining his fellow captains and then looking down into his clasped hands herrick said formally all present sir bolitho looked at the table in his minds eye he was seeing his written orders you are hereby authorised and directed to proceed with your squadron to ascertain by every means in your power the presence and destination of considerable armaments he began quietly as you will know the enemy has spent much time in seeking out some flaw in our defences apart from our successes at sea we have been able to do little to stop the spread of french progress and influence in my view bonaparte has never changed from his original tack which was and still must be to reach india and seize our trade routes the french admiral suffren almost succeeded during the last war he saw herricks eyes flicker towards him no doubt remembering when they had sailed together in the east indies seeing for themselves the determination of their old enemy to regain ground lost in that uneasy peace today bonaparte must know that any delay in his preparations can only give us time to gain strength they all looked around as inch exclaimed cheerfully well show them sir he grinned at the others like we did before bolitho smiled glad that inch if ignorant of the facts had not changed thankful that his excited comment had broken some of the distance between himself and the others thank you commander inch your optimism does you credit inch bobbed and flushed with pleasure however we have no real intelligence of which way the french will move first the bulk of our fleet is operating from the tagus to keep a wedge between the french and their spanish allies but the enemy may attack portugal because of our presence there or indeed he may attempt to invade ireland again he could not conceal his bitterness as they intended when our own navy was beset with misfortune which broke last year in the great mutinies at the nore and spithead farquhar looked at his cuff should have hanged a thousand of the devils not a mere handful bolitho eyed him coldly perhaps it a little more thought had been given to our sailors wants in the first place no punishment would have been needed at all farquhar smiled up at him i take the point sir bolitho looked at his scattered papers giving himself time he had risen too easily to farquhars intolerance he continued our duty will be first to examine the progress of french preparations in the gulf of lions at toulon marseilles and any other port about which we can discover enemy activity he looked at each of them gravely our fleet is stretched to the limit we cannot afford to allow the enemy to scatter it to the extent it can be devoured piece by piece likewise we must not have a large fleet atone end of the ocean while the enemy is at the other seek find and bring em to battle it is the only way javal said harshly and mine is the onlyfrigate sir is that an observation or a complaint javal shrugged a malady sir probyn darted him a quick glance iris a vast responsibility he looked at farquhar if we meet with superior forces we will be without support farquhar eyed him coolly but at least we will know they are nearby my dear george herrick said it is a serious matter apparently farquhars eyes flashed so let us tackle it seriously bolitho made them all turn towards him one thing is certain we must work together i do not care what you may think of the value of these orders we must interpret them into deeds drive them to a rightful and profitable end farquhar nodded i agree sir the others remained silent now if you will return to your commands and relay my wishes to your people i will be pleased to have you aboard to dine with me tonight they all stood up already planning how they would rephrase his words to their own subordinates like bolitho each one of them except inch would probably wish to be alone in his own ship to prepare himself and his ideas for whatever lay ahead but they would have little enough time together bolitho thought he needed to know each of them better just as when a signal broke from lysanders yards his captains would read the mind of the man who made it one by one they made their farewells probyn was the last to leave as bolitho knew he would he said awkwardly good to see you again sir they were great times we once shared i always knew you would be successful famous even his eyes moved hurriedly round the cabin i have been less fortunate through no fault of mine but without influence he did not finish it bolitho smiled if makes my appointment all the easier to have old friends in company the door closed and he walked slowly to the heavy mahogany wine cabinet which he had brought from london it was beautifully worked every join and surface the mark of a craftsman he was still looking at it when herrick returned from seeing the other captains over the side into their various boats he sighed went well i thought sir he saw the cabinet and gave a low whistle now there is a thing of beauty bolitho smiled it was a gift more useful than some id say thomas herrick was examining it carefully and said i have your nephew outside sir i have dealt with his foolishness some extra duties to entertain his busy mind i thought youd like to see him he touched the cabinet adding may i enquire who gave you this fine piece sir bolitho replied mrs pareja you will recall her of course he checked himself as something like a shutter dropped behind herricks eyes herrick said flatly yes sir i remember her well what is it man herrick faced him with ships coming fresh from england sir there is always rumour scandal if you like there was some talk about your meeting with the lady in london bolitho stared at him in gods name thomas this doesnt sound like you herrick persisted because of it your nephew crossed swords with another lieutenant he added stubbornly a matter of honour they call it bolitho looked away and he had been imagining it was use of pascoes background his dead father traitor and bade he said thank you for telling me somebody had to sir the blue eyes were pleading youve done so much for all of us id not wish to see it thrown away because of a i thanked you for telling me thomas not for your opinion of the lady herrick opened the door i will call him in sir he did not look back bolitho sat down on the bench seat below the stem widows and watched a fishing boat sculling below the twodeckers counter the fisherman glanced up at him without expression probably in the pay of the spanish comandant across the water in algeciras he thought taking names of the ships tidbits of information which might convey something in return for a few coins the door opened and adam pascoe stood inside the cabin his hat tucked under his arm bolitho stood up and walked towards him feeling something like pain as he saw the way the youth was holding his arm away from his ribs even in his lieutenant s uniform he looked the same lean boy who had first been sent to him as a midshipman he said welcome aboard sir bolitho forgot the weight of his new responsibility his unwanted clash with herrick everything but the youth who had come to mean so much he embraced him and said youve been in trouble adam i am sorry it was of my doing pascoe watched him gravely i would not have killed him uncle bolitho stood back from him and smiled sadly no adam but he might have finished you eighteen years is a beginning not an end pascoe pushed the black hair from his forehead and shrugged the captain has given me enough extra duties for my pains he looked at bolithos shoulder how is the wound uncle forgotten he led him to a chair like your own eh they smiled like conspirators as bolitho poured two glasses of claret he noticed that pascoes hair was cut in the new style without any queue at the nape of his neck like most sea officers he wondered what sort of a navy it would be when his nephews broad pendant flew one day pascoe sipped the wine they are saying in the squadron that this command would have been nelsons had he not lost his arm he watched him questioningly bolitho smiled there were few secrets in the fleet perhaps pascoe nodded his eyes distant a great honour uncle but but what a great responsibility also herrick reappeared at the door may i ask what time you would wish the other captains to return aboard sir he looked from one to the other and felt strangely moved about twenty years between them yet they looked like brothers bolitho replied i will leave it to you when herrick had gone pascoe asked simply is anything between you and captain herrick uncle bolitho touched his arm nothing that can harm our friendship adam pascoe appeared satisfied im glad bolitho reached for the decanter now tell me what you have been doing since i last saw you small beginning bolitho moved restlessly around his day cabin one hand reaching out to touch objects not yet familiar around and above him the lysanders seventeen hundred tons of timbers and spars artillery and men creaked and groaned to the pressure of a rising northwesterly wind he had to forcibly restrain himself from peering from one or other of the quarter windows to see how the rest of his squadron were getting on with preparations for weighing he heard occasional shouts and the thump of bare feet as seamen raced in all directions to complete last minute tasks and he could picture herrick as he too fretted over each delay it was all bolitho could do to leave herrick alone on the quarterdeck as a captain bolitho had been made to take his ships to sea in every sort of condition from a lively sloop to the towering threedecker euryalus in which he had been flag captain he had experienced the anxious moments before the anchor broke from the sea bed for herrick it would be much the same if not worse to look at a captain on his own quarterdeck remote and aloof from the bustle and confusion all around him protected from criticism by his authority and his gleaming epaulettes any idler might think he was beyond ordinary fears and feelings bolitho had thought much in that way when he had been a junior lieutenant or for that matter a midshipman a captain had been a sort of god he had lived an unreachable existence i beyond his cabin bulkhead and had but to scowl to have every officer and seaman quaking but now like herrick he knew differently the greater the responsibility the greater the honour equally you had i further to fall from grace if things went badly allday came into the cabin and rubbed his large hands there were droplets of spray on his blue jacket and he had a kind of wildness in his eyes he too was feeling it eager to quit the land again like a hunter who goes to pit his strength against the unknown needing to do it but never knowing if each time was the last the coxswain grinned theyre doing well sir ive just been up to the boat tier to watch over your barge theres a fair breeze from the norwest the squadron will make a goodly sight when we beat clear of the rock bolitho tensed his head to one side as something clattered and dragged along the deck above a voice bellowed harshly belay that line you bugger he bit his lip imagining all manner of things going wrong allday watched him thoughtfully capn herrick will see us clear sir i know he nodded as if to seal the conviction i know hell not be wanting to let you down allday removed the sword from its rack on the bulkhead and waited for bolitho to lift his arms while he buckled it round his waist he said softly same old sword sir he touched the worn hilt weve come a few leagues together bolitho looked at him gravely aye he let his fingers run over the swords guard and i dare say it willoutlast the both of us allday grinned hugely thats better sir you sound just like a flag officer the door opened silently and herrick stepped into the cabin his hat under one arm the squadron is ready to weigh sir he sounded very calm anchors hove short very well captain herrick he kept his tone formal i will come up directly herrick hurried out and his footsteps could be heard clattering quickly up the ladder to the poop above the stern cabin he would be taking into account the position of other shipping which mercifully was sparse the strength of the wind and the nearness of shoals he would be aware that there were more eyes than bolithos on him this forenoon the other captains who had appeared so relaxed and jovial around the cabin table last night at dinner would be gauging his skill as a sailor measuring it in lysanders sail drill the smartness of getting under way there would be glasses trained on the ships from the garrison too and from the enemy defences at algeciras bolitho said quietly i am ready allday allday hung back below the cabin skylight and gestured above him up there sir bolitho stood beside him and stared up towards the black mass of rigging and beyond it to the towering main mast with its whipping broad pendant at the truck yes i see it allday studied him gravely that pendant is yours by right sir theres many watching it this day whod have it off you if they had the chance but while it flies they will obey so leave the worrying to others sir youve got fatterfish to cook bolitho faced him with surprise admiral beauchamp said much the same if not in the same words then in the i same sense he slapped alldays arm and thank you as he strode beneath the poop and out past the big double wheel he was very conscious of the watching men all around him once on the quarterdeck with the wind throwing beads of spray above the nettings and gangway he saw the press of figures at halliards and braces the scarlet coats of the marines in the afterguard where they waited to add their weight to that of the seamen attention on the quarterdeck that would be gilchrist the first lieutenant and herricks right hand man tall and lean like a bean pole with a permanent frown he looked much like a disapproving schoolmaster beyond him were some of the lieutenants the midshipman of the watch and numerous other nameless faces bolitho touched his hat to the deck at large comparing despite his determination to avoid it all this with what he had known and loved as a captain he would have made certain that he had met and memorised the features and name of every officer aboard just as soon as was possible the first lieutenant especially he glanced at herricks stocky figure by the quarterdeck rail and wondered if he too was making a i comparison a voice at bolithos elbow said thickly a fine day sir if i may make so bold bolitho turned and saw a broad redfaced lump of a man who seemed to fill the space of three not so much in height but in beam and depth he stood with his fat legs straddled as if for a sudden gale his heavy mournful features studying bolitho with unmasked curiosity he added im grubb sir sailing master bolitho smiled thank you mr grubb he should have known there had been many tales lingering in the ship about ben grubb lysanders master at st vincent he had it was said played on a tin whistle as the seventyfour had nudged through the enemy formation and after the marine drummer boys had been cut down by grapeshot he looked overgrubbs vast untidy shape and decided it was probably true he was an odd mixture his features were like the rest of him wrecked by countless winds and storms the damage well aided by heavy drinking there was something rather fearsome about him too and from now on he would be one of the most valuable men in the squadron grubb took a watch the size of an apple from one pocket and examined it before saying bout now id suggest sir bolitho nodded and turned towards herrick he saw pascoe and one of the midshipmen ready and waiting with the signal party a petty officer writing on his slate very well captain we will get the squadron underway if you please he made himself walk slowly across the littered deck trying not to look down at the various blocks and tackles which the quarterdeck division had been preparing since dawn it would be a splendid sight for the lysanders people to see him catch his toe and pitch headlong amongst them strangely enough the dreadful picture helped to steady him and he was able to concentrate on the other ships as one by one the flags soared up to the yards to acknowledge herricks signal up anchor he heard a midshipman call all acknowledged sir then pascoes voice quivering slightly to betray his own excitement stand by on the quarterdeck gilchrists feet thudded across the planking and even through his speaking trumpet his tone was disapproving mr yeo have more hands put to the capstan bars i want no delays bolitho did not turn yeo was the boatswain he would meet him in due course he saw the little harebell rolling drunkenly her yards alive with busy seamen her cable was up and down and he thought he saw inchs scarecrow figure by the quarterdeck rail one arm pointing across the countless white catspaws which moved down with the wind and turned the anchorage into a miniature sea bolitho took a telescope from the midshipman of the watch as he trained it towards the other twodeckers he asked and what is your name the midshipman was staring at him almost transfixed saxby sir bolitho watched the seamen dashing aft along nicators gangways saxby was about thirteen roundfaced and innocent looking his otherwise pleasant appearance was spoiled when he opened his mouth as both his front teeth were missing he steadied the glass and shut gilchrists metallic voice from his mind it was all taking far too long caution was one thing this amounted to a nervous crawl he snapped there is some delay captain herrick sir herrick sounded off guard execute the signal if you please he hated doing it but there was more at stake than personal feelings he heard the bark of orders the muffled shouts of the topmen as they clawed along the vibrating yards then as the signal was hauled down at the rush the cry echoed aft from the forecastle anchors aweigh lysanders broad hull dipped heavily to one side as with her anchor swinging free and the wind already banging and thundering in her released topsails she started to swing down across the choppy wavelets man the braces there feet skidded on damp planking arid more men ran wildly from the capstan to lend a hand one by one the three ships of the line went about like ponderous beasts while further to seaward the frigate buzzard and inchs sloop were already spreading more sail to stand clear of their big consorts somebody cried out sharply and bolitho heard the crack of a starter across a mans naked back high above the deck the topmen were racing each other in their efforts to beat the rest of the squadron as herrick shouted get the forecourse on her mr gilchrist he added sternly and tell that bosuns mate to be less free with his ropesend or i will know the reason bolitho walked to the opposite side and watched as osiris tacked heavily astern of the nicator she made a fine sight her topsails set and hardbellied to the wind she was heeling so steeply that her bow wave was almost up to the lower gun ports her forecourse and then mainsail flapped and then filled as one so that in the hard sunlight they looked like white metal he said nicator is falling astern signal her to make more sail it might be that captain probyn was too busy to notice that his ship was already badly out of line with the other seventy fours equally he could be testing his commodores mettle and powers of observation the signal midshipman called nicators acknowledged sir probyns topmen were already setting the fore topgallant sail it was just a bit too quick bolitho decided probyn was testing him grubb was peering at the sails overhead the compass and his helmsmen and all without apparently shifting a muscle only his eyes moved swivelling up and down forward and abeam like lanterns in a rough scarlet cliff within an hour the squadron was free of the approaches the three ships of the line making a proud sight under reduced canvas as they stood clear of the land to leeward their pyramids of pale canvas already blurred in haze buzzard and harebell tacked busily under all possible sail to take station well ahead of their commodore herrick called very well mr grubb steer eastsoueast then he crossed to the nettings where bolitho stood with one foot on the truck of a quarterdeck ninepounder bolitho looked at him and gave a quietsmile well thomas how does it feel now herricks face lost some of its lines it was like seeing a cloud moving away bolitho thought herrick replied better sir he let out a deep breath a whole span better bolitho shaded his eyes to look towards the land there were probably couriers already galloping along a coast road even at this very minute but there was no point in slipping like poachers through the gibraltarstrait under cover of darkness he had his orders but the earl of st vincent had made it very clear it was up to him how he interpreted and executed them it would do no harm for the enemy to know a british force was once more abroad in the mediterranean he let his gaze move up to the masthead to the big dovetailed flag which was now as stiff as a plank in the steady wind his flag he looked along the crowded decks at the scurrying seamen the great coils of rope and lashings which to any landsman would seem like a hopeless tangle and still further to the beakhead beneath which he could just see one of the spartan generals massive shoulders inchs sloop was a mere sliver of white against the horizon haze leading the squadron he smiled to himself as he had once done in his own first command at the chesapeake another ship another war herrick asked do you have any instructions sir he looked at him seeing pascoe watching from the lee rail one hand on his hip the ship is yours thomas he made to turn away and added what did you have in mind i should like to exercise the gun crews herrick tried to relax i am satisfied with the sail drill at present bolitho smiled so be it he realised that gilchrist was hovering close by and added i will be in my cabin as he walked towards the wheel he heard gilchrist say coldly i have two men for punishment slackness on duty and insolent to a bosuns mate bolitho hesitated floggings at this early stage would be bad enough under any conditions with the little squadron standing out to sea where almost any sail might be a frenchman or a spaniard it was hardly in keeping with their proud mission he heard herrick say something and gilchrists quick retort his word is good enough for me sir bolitho strode aft beneath the thick deck beams he must not interfere he passed the marine sentry by his cabin door and frowned not yet anyway a full day after leaving gibraltar the promise of a fast passage to the gulf of lions received a setback perverse as ever the wind dropped away to a faint breeze so that even with all available canvas set to her yards the lysander was barely able to command three knots the squadron was scattered from its original formation and each of the twodeckers moved with little enthusiasm above her own perfect reflection bolitho had sent the frigate to scout far ahead of the main force and as he paced restlessly back and forth across the poop deck he was thankful for taking that one small precaution captain javal would be able to take advantage of the inshore winds and it was to be hoped he would use them to some purpose he smiled despite his impatience both he and farquhar were still frigate captains at heart and the thought of javals freedom out of reach from any signal was enough to rouse the envy of a man tied to a ponderous seventyfour he heard herrick speaking with his first lieutenant and thought suddenly of the flogging on the previous afternoon the usual brutal ritual of administering punishment had aroused little excitement amongst the assembled company but as bolitho had watched from the poop as herrick had read briefly from the articles of war he had imagined he had seen something like triumph on lieutenant gilchrists narrow face he had expected herrick to take gilchrist aside and warn him of the dangers of unnecessary punishment god alone knew that the penalties for thoughtless hardship could be harsher than the actual event the mutinies at spithead and the nore should have been warning enough even for a blind man but as he paused to glance down at the quarterdeck he could see little between the two officers other than what you might expect under normal circumstances gilchrist touched his hat and then walked forward along the weather gangway his shoes clicking on the planking as he strode in the strange bouncing manner which bolitho had already noticed after a moment he ran lightly down the larboard ladder and joined herrick at the weather nettings he said a snails pace i wish to heaven we could find that wind again herrick watched him warily lysanders copper is clean sir and i have checked each sail myself and there is nothing we could do to gain even half a knot bolitho turned surprised at his tone that was not a criticism thomas i know a captain can do many things but controlling the elements is not one of them herrick forced a smile i am sorry sir but i have been feeling it badly so much is expected of us if we fail before we have begun he shrugged a whole fleet may suffer later bolitho stood up on some bollards and steadied himself against the nettings while he peered across the quarter to where nicator was steering lethargically on the same larboard tack her topsails were barely filling and her masthead pendant lifted only occasionally against the empty sky of the land there was no sign although the lookouts clinging like tiny monkeys high above the deck would be able to see it as a purple blur the southern shore of spain he shivered in spite of the clammy heat remembering the other times he had come this way he wondered why herrick was being so evasive it was so unlike him to concern himself with what might happen because of maybes again that nagging doubt was it because he was feeling his responsibility as too heavy a burden he said without turning your senior thomas what do you know of him herrick sounded guarded mr gilchrist hes competent in his duties he was in lysander as second lieutenant when she fought at st vincent bolitho bit his lip he was angry with himself for being unable to hold his silence for more than a day at sea more than that he was hurt in a way he could not explain thomas herrick was a friend and over the years when they had fought and almost died in one battle after another had endured thirst and fever fear and despair he had never felt such a gulf between them he said i did not ask about his appointments he had not meant it to sound so blunt i want to know about the man i have no complaints sir he is a good seaman and that is enough it has to be sir herrick was watching him with some thing like desperation its all i know bolitho stepped down and took out his watch i see look here sir herrick moved his hands vaguely things change as change they must i feel so marooned from my ship and people whenever i try to rouse the old style of things i become entangled with the affairs of the squadron most of my wardroom are young lieutenants and some have never heard a gun fired in anger young pascoe the most junior lieutenant aboard has seen more action than they have he was speaking quickly unable to check the sudden flow of words ive excellent warrant officers some of the best ive sailed with but you know how it is sir the word has to come from aft it must bolitho studied him impassively he wanted to take herrick aside to the cabin or a place beyond the scope of watching eyes to tell him he understood but then their roles would be as before bolitho thinking of a ships routine and crowded world between decks and herrick waiting to put his thoughts into deeds like the excellent subordinate he had always been he made himself say yes it must be so a ship relies on her captain as i do herrick sighed i had to speak bolitho added slowly i did not agree to your appointment because of our friendship but because i thought you were the most fitting man for the task he saw his words hitting herricks face like blows and continued i have not changed my mind about that from the comer of his eye he saw the masters vast bulk surrounded by seriousfaced midshipmen as they gathered for the noon ritual of using their sextants to estimate the ships position by the rail lieutenant fitzclarence the officer of the watch was making a convincing show of studying the men working above on the main yard but the stiffness of his shoulders betrayed that he was also trying to hear what his two superiors were discussing bolitho said so lets have no more gloom eh therell be enough to fret about if we close with an enemy that has not changed either herrick stepped back a pace aye sir his face was grim i am sorry if i disappoint you he watched as bolitho returned to the poop ladder before saying quietly i will endeavour not to do so again bolitho strode right aft to the taffrail and clasped the gilded scroll work with sudden despair try as he might he seemed unable to meet herrick to cross the bridge between them deck thar the lookouts hoarse cry made him start harebells signallin bolitho hurried to the poop rail and checked himself fretting until fitzclarence lysanders second lieutenant came out of his thoughts to shout aloft with your glass mr faulkner i want that signal and i want it now the midshipman of the watch who seconds earlier had been drowsing by the nettings congratulating himself on being spared mr grubbs formidable instruction in the intricacies of navigation fled to the lee shrouds and began to climb rapidly towards the maintop fitzclarence surveyed his progress hands on hips his elegant head thrown back as if he expected the midshipman to slip and fall the lieutenant seemed to like striking poses he was very smart even dapper and what he lacked in height he obviously tried to replace with a constant show of authority herrick stood by his elbow hands behind him bolitho noticed that the hands were clasping and unclasping making a lie of his outward calm eventually the boys shrill voice floated down to them from harebell sir buzzard in sight to the noreast bolitho thrust his hands into his pockets his fingers gripping his watch to steady his sudden anxiety captain javal was retracing his course to rejoin the squadron he must have sighted something either too powerful to deal with or to warn his commodore that the enemy were even now giving chase he saw herrick hurry to the ladder and seconds later he joined him at the rail bolitho said signal the squadron to close on the flagship we will shorten sail directly to make their task easier herrick stared astern his gaze very clear in the reflected glare he said with surprising bitterness osiris is already gaining sir captain farquhar must have eyes like a cat bolitho watched him in silence reading herricks mind as if he had shouted it aloud he knew that if farquhar was here as flag captain there would have been no hesitation no need for the commodore to suggest the obvious herrick touched his hat and returned to the ladder but gilchrist was already on the quarterdeck his speaking trumpet in his hand as he snapped bosuns mate pipe all hands to shorten sail take the name of the last man aloft he turned to look at herrick adding council of war sir it sounded like a challenge herrick nodded aye mr gilchrist he hesitated captains repair on board bolitho looked away realising that he had been willing herrick to speak out to silence gilchrists arrogance once and for all the hands came hurrying from their work above and below in answer to the shrill of calls barely glancing round as they ran to their stations for shortening sail bolitho saw pascoe buttoning his coat as he followed his own men to the quarterdeck touching his hat to gilchrist who responded with take a firm hand of your people mr pascoe pascoe looked at him questioningly his eyes flashing in the sunlight then he nodded i will sir by heaven you will indeed gilchrists voice made several seamen pause to stare ill have no favourites in my ship pascoe glanced briefly at bolitho on the poop and then turned on his heel his seamen closing around him like a protective barrier bolitho looked at herrick but he was on the weather side withdrawn from all of them he relaxed very slowly gilchrist had made his play openly but too soon he had displayed to his commodore that he would expect to be upheld by him even against his own nephew gilchrist was a remarkable man there was a lot more to him than herrick recognised or understood no mere lieutenant would dare to speak as he had done at such short acquaintance no amount of personal influence could save a lieutenant from a flag officer even a mere commodore should the latter choose to use his authority to his own ends he had never sailed with gilchrist before nor had he even met him but lysanders first lieutenant knew a great deal about him nonetheless knew enough to understand that bolitho would never use personal ties to show favouritism but for what purpose he walked to the opposite side of the deck feeling the sudden heat on his face as the great main course was brailed up to the yard allowing the glare to enfold the deck like a dying fire and from whom was gilchrist drawing such confidence he turned to watch the other twodeckers overhauling steadily and moving into a short uneven line farquhar was he so eager for promotion that he had gained an ally for just that reason he certainly had both influence and the funds to tempt a man or was it probyn from what he had seen of that one it seemed unlikely he was lucky to hold a command in this squadron at all let alone risk his good name for spite he thought of herrick impossible allday appeared on the poop deck and touched his forehead itll be an hour or so afore buzzards up to the squadron sir he looked meaningly at the open skylight your servant has cooled some wine in the bilge for you bolitho hardly heard him i hope javal brings us good news allday studied him momentarily taken aback it was not like bolitho to speak so openly about his thoughts he must be worried about something to allday it seemed impossible that bolitho should be troubled about the squadrons affairs for in his eyes he could do almost anything nor about the darkeyed catherine pareja back there in london there had been talk in plenty but that had probably been born of envy he thought god knows she was a fine looking woman and did not give a damn for what people might say about such goingson one thing was certain she was responsible for bolithos recovery from his wound after their last visit to this sea but that was over and past it was unlikely they would meet again so what then lieutenant pascoe he grinned he was a lively young devil very like his uncle and the same as some of the faces in the portraits allday had seen at the old house in falmouth he started as bolitho said sharply the wine will be redhot by the time you have decided to stand clear of the companion way allday stood aside feeling slightly better he waited until he heard bolitho speaking with ozzard the cabin servant through the open skylight and then sauntered down to the quarterdeck where the afterguard were still busily making up halliards and securing the braces after trimming the sails pascoe shook his head advantage of you when that day comes bonaparte will be crowned king of england allday grinned now then mr pascoe its not fair to take advantage of a poor sailorman pascoe shook his head advantage of you when that day comes bonaparte will be crowned king of england gilchrists shadow fell between them i believe that you have been given extra duties mr pascoe he stared at him flatly by the captain yes sir pascoe regarded him without expression then be so good as to get on with your tasks mr pascoe he glanced at allday and not waste time with the commodores coxswain he tapped one foot gently on the deck a good seaman no doubt but hardly fitting company for a kings officer eh allday saw the sudden flash of anger in the youths eyes and said hastily my fault sir gilchrists mouth twisted very slightly really i do not recall asking for the opinion of a common seaman i am not accustomed to passing the time with they all turned as bolitho appeared beside the wheel he said harshly in that case mr gilchrist i would be obliged if you would take a glance at the weather forebrace and attend to it instead of what was it you said passing the time in idle gossip gilchrist opened and shut his mouth like a landed fish then he said at once sir herrick appeared by the rail is something wrong sir bolitho looked past them his eyes angry very captain and when i discover what it is i will be glad to let you know he glared at the others all of you show me again on the chart bolitho stood beside the cabin table as javal leaned across it the other captains waited in silence their bodies swaying while lysander lifted and dipped heavily in irregular troughs javal explained sighted her at first light sir his tanned fingers cradled the spanish coastline as if to trap what he had seen small vessel schooner most like he glanced calmly at bolitho his greasy hair still showing droplets of spray asevidence of the haste with which he had been pulled to the flagship by his boats crew i expect her master took sight of buzzard and thought prudence to be more use than valour farquhar did not try to hide his disappointment a schooner you say god damn it javal id hardly think it proper to run for the squadron because of a mere toy javal ignored him his dark eyes still on bolitho i have good men for lookouts i reward em from my pocket if they do their work to my satisfaction i find that more profitable than flogging em for failing in their vigilance his eyes seemed to flicker towards osiriss captain unlike some herrick stepped nearer as if to stop a flareup of tempers then tell us javal my sailing master assures me that a wind is close by and ive little room for passengers especially the squadrons captains javal showed his teeth like the man they were jagged she was running with the wind and had all canvas spread yet she was making precious little headway he looked at bolitho strange for a mediterranean schooner id have thought sir bolitho leaned above the chart his mindgoing back and forth over javals report with buzzard and harebell sweeping ahead and to windward of the squadron it was unlikely they would have failed to sight the schooner had she over reached them along the coast he saw javals strong fingers touch a point on the chart almost to himself he said out of malaga you think javal nodded almost certain sir and heading to the eastrd in my opinion shell remain at anchor here he tapped the chart again until nightfall or such time as she believes her way is safe bolitho walked quickly to the stern windows and watched the slow caress of wind over the blue water here and there just the merest dab of white foam grubb was right the wind was returning as he had prophesied captain probyn said thickly this damn schooner might be anything at all or nothing i agree with farquhar theres nopoint in he turned as farquhar strode to bolithos side his hand some features suddenly eager i think there is a point after all farquhar watched bolithos profile the dons have an arsenal at malaga i believe a great foundry for artillery bolitho smiled slightly his eyes searching yes i could be mistaken as could captain javals lookouts but a coastal schooner makes good speed unless well laden he returned to the table the others crowding on either side of him the dons will wish to show their ally they can help in any future campaign against us bonaparte needs armaments of every kind and the waters around malaga dictate that small ships be used to carry just such weapons he straightened his shoulders feeling the wound beneath his coat like a bum it is a small beginning but it is sooner than had hoped we will close the land at dusk and cut her out at best we may gain information at worst will seize another vessel for the squadron eh he could not contain his smile of excitement it was like a tonic does anyone not agree probyn shook his head his features still brooding over farquhars change of heart javal said i know the bay where she is anchored he was thinking aloud after dark we should be able to take her with little trouble bolitho could sense them waiting for his next words he said you will take charge captain javal i will make a signal to harebell to assume your duties until this affair is settled he looked at herrick i will transfer to buzzard with some of our own people say twenty or so good hands seamen not marines i want no boots and bayonets for this venture he smiled at javal i trust you will agree to that javal gave a wolfish grin willingly herrick asked quietly and the squadron sir i will give you your orders he said it deliberately excluding the others showing probyn and farquhar where his trust lay you can stand closer inshore tomorrow if you feel it prudent if not we will make a rendezvous to fit in with captain javals plan of attack he glanced quickly around their faces farquhar cool and expressionless but his fingers tapping a little tattoo on the table betrayed his true feelings thinking perhaps that he could do the work better than javal better than herrick probyn his heavy face lined with doubt watching javal as if to discover something considering maybe the extent of javals prize money if he succeeded in taking the schooner or what would become of the squadron if buzzard and the commodore came to grief and herrick he was never any use at hiding his doubts his face was set with worry his eyes almost hidden in a frown as he peered at the chart seeing perhaps the whole venture laid in bloody ruins there was no such anxiety troubling javal then i suggest we make a start sir he rubbed his hands or the bird may quit the coop if he was feeling any dismay at being accompanied by his commodore he was concealing it admirably bolitho thought he replied yes return to your ships my flag captain will make known the final orders by signal he lowered his voice i wish to make one thing clear the squadron will stay together i want no foolhardy risks taken but if an opportunity presents itself i want no hesitation either they hurried from the cabin and he added slowly pass the word thomas some volunteers and a boat to ferry them to buzzard without delay send allday to manage it if you will he looked up seeing the same wretchedness on herricks face well herrick said must you go sir let me take charge of the attack bolitho watched him he was more afraid of controlling the squadron than he was of the raid of being killed even no javal is a hard man and two captains in one ship are never close to success rest easy man i have no wish to end up dead or rotting in a spanish prison but we must make a beginning show our people that we can lead as well as we can command their daily lives he reached out impetuously and touched his arm it was as stiff as a teak rail it applies to the pair of us as well you know herrick gave a deep sigh i tell myself that i must never be surprised at your ideas ever since i can recall he shook himself i will pass the word to allday at once he swung round his sudden determination making him appear almost pathetic but ill be greatly pleased to see you back inboard again bolitho smiled and walked to his sleeping compartment and the big chest in which he kept a pair of pistols as he knelt over the lid he felt the ship tilting more readily to the wind the urgent clatter of blocks and rigging to betray its growing power he looked up seeing himself in the small cabin mirror the unruly lock of black hair above his right eye he grimaced sadly touching the deep scar which was partly hidden beneath the lock an early reminder of what could happen in a split second like the dull ache in his shoulder the small step between life and oblivion allday clattered into the adjoining cabin the hilt of his cutlass glinting under his blue jacket party ready sir he was already reaching up for bolithos sword all fighting jacks he grinned picked em myself bolitho let him buckle his sword around his waist he asked mildly were they not volunteers the big coxswain grinned all the broader of course sir after i told em my point of view so to speak bolitho shook his head and strode out of the cabin without looking back a cutter was pitching and creaking at the main chains and the picked seamen were crowded amongst their weapons and the hands at the oars in an untidy mass bolitho glanced around the quarterdeck and at the men who were already at the braces and along the yards overhead preparing to make more sail once the cutter had returned herrick stood with the side party at the entry port his features composed again bolitho was about to reassure him to tell him to take good care of the ship in his absence but lysander was herricks ship not his instead he said lightly until we meet again captain herrick then he swung himself out of the port towards the waiting boat by the time he had reached the sternsheets and regained his breath the cutter was clear of the ships side the oars losing their confusion and falling into a slow rhythm across the choppy water it was then bolitho realised that pascoe was also in the boat his dark eyes alight with excitement as he waved to someone on the twodeckers gangway allday hissed angrily i knew youd want him left on board sir no sense in putting all the eggs in one basket so to speak he hid his face from the oarsmen it was mr gilchrist who gave the order bolitho nodded if he had harboured any doubts about herricks first lieutenant they were gone now by ordering pascoe into the cuttingout party he had achieved two things he could say that bolitho was taking his nephew as an act of favouritism he would share fully in any glory if the attack was successful and if it was not he looked at the youth seeing his excitement as he had once known it at eighteen years if that happened then alldays comment would be only too true he stared across pascoes shoulder and watched the frigates masts spiralling and swaying in the wind pascoe said brightly by god id like to command a ship like buzzard he saw bolithos expression and added one day sir bolitho said we will deal with this business first mr pascoe he smiled but i understand your feelings allday fingered his cutlass and looked from one to the other now he had two to watch over he frowned as the boats coxswain failed in his first attempt to steer under the frigates lee chains and if anything happened to either of them he would settle lieutenant bloody gilchrists hash for him no matter what the last seaman had barely scrambled aboard when javal shouted hands aloft and get the ship under way mr mears weve a lot of distance to cover before nightfall he looked at bolitho and doffed his hat you are most welcome sir though i fear you may find my quarters a mite cramped bolitho returned his smile and replied evenly i have commanded three such vessels in my time captain javal but thank you for the reminder allday glanced down as pascoe nudged him in the ribs pascoe murmured quietly i think my uncle made his point very well dontyou allday grinned suddenly reassured and thats no error mr pascoe alone under topsails and jib the thirtytwo gun frigate buzzard stood closehauled on the larboard tack her yards braced round so tightly that from the deck they appeared almost fore and aft bolitho gripped the hammock nettings and strained his eyes through the gloom the light had gone suddenly as was natural in these waters and he was conscious of the muttering between buzzards master and her first lieutenant as they peered at the compass or inspected the set of each flapping sail javal seemed confident enough and content to leave the navigation to his subordinates like him they were well used a trained and selfreliant team there was nothing false about javal and no trimmings in his quarters which for a successful frigate captain were spartan the cabin furniture consisted mostly of heavy chests scattered about and within easy reach when required javal joined him his eyes screwed up against the spray which spattered above the nettings with each steep roll he said the coast is about a mile or so on the larboard bow sir if i am to weather the headland ill have to stand clear very soon or come about for another approach i wanted a wind but this one blows too merrily for my liking he pulled a stone bottle from his coat a drink sir a warming swallow of hollands will do you good there was no offer of cup or goblet so bolitho held the fat bottle to his lips feeling the gin running down his tongue like fire javal remarked offhandedly took quite a few bottles off a blockaderunner last august in the channel better than nothing he swung round his voice harsh watch your helm damn your eyes youll have us in irons before the next hour he became calm again id suggest we make our play soon now sir bolitho smiled that sudden spark of anxious rage had shown that javal was mote human than he wished him to believe it was never easy to close a little known shore in the dark harder still with a senior officer breathing down your neck he replied i agree javal said im putting my first lieutenant in charge the launch and the cutter should suffice but in case there is a chance of a hue and cry being carried inshore to some spanish garrison id suggest a small landing party below the headland he hesitated your lieutenant perhaps very well bolitho looked across the blurred procession of whitecapped waves mr pascoe is young but has seen action enough javal studied him curiously i will attend to it he hurried away barking out orders to the already assembled seamen blocks squeaked noisily and the boats began to move above the tier the hands guiding them without effort as if it was all in broad daylight bolitho tried not to listen to the clatter of weapons the occasional hesitation as a man failed to answer his name on a check list allday loomed out of the darkness and said itll be a hard pull in this wind sir he seemed to sense something can i help javal strode past we will heaveto if you please in a louder tone he called mr mears stand by to lower boats bolitho said swiftly go with mr pascoe he will take the jolly boat allday understood but replied awkwardly but my place is with he grinned but you are right sir bolitho saw the gleam of white breeches against the opposite bulwark and heard pascoe say im going now sir bolitho moved to his side see you take care adam he tried to make light of it your aunt would never forgive me if anything happened pascoe turned his head as some seamen dashed past their chequered shirts very pale and stark i must go sir bolitho stood aside good luck moments after the frigate had laboured round into the wind her remaining sails booming in confusion the three boats were in the water alongside and then soon pulling away towards the land javal rubbed his hands bring her about and steer soueast by east mr ellis and put two good hands in the chains just to be sure we do not gut the keel out of her he crossed to bolithos side and waited in silence until his ship was once more under command of wind and rudder then he said cheerfully this is always the worst part the waiting bolitho nodded his ears trying to hold on to the swish and creak of oars but they had gone swallowed in the other sea noises he said aye id prefer to be going with them javal laughed gods teeth sir i wish to make the navy my career for many years yet what chance would there be of that if i allowed my commodore to be taken it seemed to amuse him greatly bolitho snapped i dare say javal cleared his throat and said in a more sober tone it will be all of four hours before we know anything sir my first lieutenant is very experienced he has been with me for some eighteen months he has cut out several such vessels without many losses to us bolitho nodded i will use your cabin again if i may a short sleep will refresh me for tomorrow he could almost hear the lie being thrown back in his face sleep it would be easier to walk on water javal watched him grope towards the cabin hatch and shrugged bolitho was probably worried about this first action under his overall command surely he would not be troubled at the thought of a man or two being killed he reached for the stone bottle and shook it against his ear it would help the hours to pass more quickly he decided bolitho felt his way to the glowing compass bowl and peered at the steeply tilting card buzzards head was almost north east the master said helpfully beg pardon sir but the wind as backed two points or so an some rain as bin fallin bolitho nodded and walked forward his body angled against the deck and the wet pressure of wind across the quarter it would be dawn soon and already he could see the ninepounders on the gun deck standing out like black bars below the weather gangway javal was by the quarterdeck rail hatless and with his hair whipping in the wind he said shortly nothing yet he looked at him briefly did you sleep well sir bolitho rested his hands on the rail feeling the hull shivering and straining like a living thing he had been unable to remain in the cabin a moment longer the hours had been an eternity and javals quarters like a damp unsteady prison a little thank you deck there land on th weather bow javal snapped leadsmen to the chains again mr ellis lively now in a calmer voice he added that will be the headland we have clawed round in a mad circle during the night with the damned wind backing on us i feared we might be blown hard aground bolitho said i see he looked away hiding his feelings from the other man i what had happened where was a signal any sign that the i raid had been completed javal remarked mears should have fired a gun or a rocket even he sounded uneasy god damn it well be too close inshore within the hour bolitho ignored him and tried to imagine what it was like beyond the dim shadow which the lookout had reported as land if lieutenant mears and his boats had failed to take the schooner or for some reason had been unable even to grapple with her they would have to pull back to the buzzard as best they could in a stiff wind and after a night at the oars they would be in need of help and quickly from forward came the cry by th mark seven javal said quietly jesus the master called anxiously it shallows fast hereabouts sir i am aware of that fact thank you javal glared at him watch your helm by th mark five the leadsmans chant sounded like a dirge javal muttered i will have to alter course to starboard sir the words were being dragged from his throat bolitho looked at him noticing how the people and objects around the quarterdeck had assumed shape and reality in the first dull light he said briskly do your duty captain javal he turned away sharing the other mans despair deep four bolitho thrust his hands behind his back and walked aft the frigate was sailing in about twentyfour feet of water it was only minutes before she ran her full length ashore over his shoulder he saw the land reaching out towards the bowsprit mocking him man the lee braces feet scampered across the decks put up the helm with a squeal of blocks the yards creaked ponderously above the decks and as the wheel was hauled over and over buzzard started to swing once again towards the open sea javal said harshly steer due east lay her as close as you dare to the headland by th mark ten bolitho watched the land as it started to slip past the forecastle the faint marks of white at its foot where the wind drove the sea into beaches and small coves deck there sail on the weather bow comin round the point javal sucked in air run out the larboard battery mr ellis he added sharply belay that order his face glowed faintly in a bright red flare which had just burst clear of the land stand by to shorten sail to bolitho he exclaimed the schooner by god mears has taken her even without a glass bolitho could see the lowhulled vessel thrusting away from the encroaching land her great sails rising like wings above the choppy wave crests at her counter he saw the darker shapes of buzzards boats being towed astern a lantern rising and dipping at her foremast to confirm the capture perhaps mears feared that because of the delay his failure to signal earlier he might be met with a broadside rather than cheers javal snapped we will come about lay her on the starboard tack and steer sou by west until we have more sea room he glanced at bolitho by the nettings you will wish to rejoin the squadron sir yes he walked clear of the busy seamen and marines as they ran to obey the pipe it was over and as far as he could tell without a shot being fired he found he was shaking badly as if he had been there with them when buzzard leaned steeply on her new tack bolitho saw the schooner following suit her lee bulwark almost awash she was certainly deep laden he said abruptly heaveto at your discretion captain signal your lieutenant to close within hailing distance javal eyed him doubtfully aye sir if you say so he saw bolithos expression and said no more bolitho walked slowly to the nettings shutting out the sounds of the unexpected preparations to heaveto once again he did not even hear the squeak of halliards as the signal flags ran up the yards and broke to the wind he was watching the boats surging along under the schooners stern the jolly boat was not one of them lieutenant mears had no intention of shouting his news from the captured schooners deck while buzzard rolled heavily in short steep waves he crossed the narrow gap between the two ships in his cutter its sleek hull lifting and rearing like a dolphin until it was made fast to the frigates chains in the stern cabin the seas noises were muted like surf booming in a long cave bolitho kept his hands clasped behind him his head lowered between the deck beams as mears still panting told his story we pulled under the headland as planned sir then we separated i took my boat direct for the schooners seaward side and mr booth headed his around and under her bowsprit there is no doubt that the schooners master was expecting the weather to worsen and was anchoring for the night our suspicion he had sighted buzzard was illfounded bolitho asked quietly and the jolly boat mears rubbed his eyes your lieutenant was ordered to take it to the western side of the headland and beach it if the dons had tried to send for help from the land mr pascoes party would have been able to intercept them javal snapped you took your damn time toby the lieutenant shrugged limply the first part went well there was only an anchor watch and they didnt even raise a shout until our fellows were amongst em no boarding nets no swivel guns they almost died of fear he hesitated sensing the tension around him for the first time we waited for the jolly boat to come around the point and join us again when it failed to appear i sent mr booth in the cutter he spread his hands helplessly with dawn close by and every minute adding to the chance of discovery i dared not fire a signal until i had received news of the landing party javal nodded grimly that was well said mr mears some would have left the few to save the many bolitho asked what did your people discover it had been raining sir mears looked at the stern windows streaked with salt and droplets of spray as it is now booth found the beached jolly boat with its hull stove in and two seamen dead nearby another was lying in some dunes they had all been killed by sword thrust sir he fumbled inside his stained coat mr booth found this in the sand i could not understand it it is surely an admirals sword he broke off as bolitho snatched the glittering hilt from him and held it to the windows the blade was snapped like a carrot halfway from the ornate guard it was like yesterday vice admiral sir lucius broughton on the splintered quarterdeck of his flagship handing his beautiful sword to an astonished adam pascoe and saying gruffly any damn midshipman who tackles the enemy with a dirk deserves it besides a lieutenant must look the part eh he heard himself say it was an admirals once it belongs to mr pascoe he touched the stain on the hilt blood and wet sand he added quietly he would not part willingly with it the others stared at him then mears said mr booth searched as long as he could sir there were many hoofmarks in the beach leading from inland he feared that his own party might be challenged at any moment and i had given him a direct order to return to me if he did not find the lieutenant anywhere mears shook his head nor your man either no bolitho stared out of the streaked windows allday would not leavehim sir bolitho turned towards them what of the schooner mears collected his wits you were right sir she is filled to the deck beams with powder and shot and he looked at javals grim face two of the finest cannon i have ever laid eyes on siege artillery if im any judge and only newly tested i see bolitho tried to concentrate his mind on what their capture could mean adam was gone allday too probably out there dying waiting for a rescue which could never come mears said i am afraid the schooners master was killed when he tried to jump overboard but i found papers and charts in his cabin enough to show that he had orders for toulon javal exclaimed by god you were right about that too sir the dons are working like fiends to help their powerful ally at toulon he dragged a bottle from one of his sea chests you did well toby take a drink while we decide what to do he looked at bolitho the wind is rising sir we had best get under way again yes bolitho felt the deck lurching unsteadily as the wind hissed against the hull detail a prize crew to take the schooner direct to gibraltar fetch your clerk and dictate a despatch for the admiral there he will know what best to do about the cannon mears grinned wearily she is a fair little prize sir worth a penny or two javal glared at him and said quickly i am sorry about your lieutenant sir had you known him long he is my nephew the two officers looked at each other appalled javal said by god if id only known sir i would have sent one of my other officers bolitho looked at him gravely you did what was right you were shorthanded but in any case honour and danger must be shared as equally as possible mears suggested if i took one of the boats under sail sir no bolitho looked past him in daylight you would stand less than a dogs chance he turned his back carryon with your duties captain javal there is nothing we can do here the screen door slammed shut and bolitho sat down heavily on the bench seat below the windows he turned the broken sword over several times in his hands seeing the boys pleasure at receiving it his pitiful pride when they had met for the first time he looked up startled as if he expected to see allday nearby as he always was when he sensed he was needed now there was not even him there was nobody somewhere beyond the bulkhead he heard a sailor singing some strange song which he did not recognise probably dreaming of his tiny share of the prize money or of some girl back in england feet clattered overhead and he heard someone bawl bring the boats alongside and man the tackles the recovered boats were thudding against the hull and he thought he heard someone give a cheer as the schooner made ready to part company javal opened the door his face wet with rain schooners about to leave sir are you sure you do not wish to send a separate despatch to the admiral no thank you you were in charge of the cuttingout it is right that your name should be on the despatch javal licked his lips well thank you indeed sir i just wish there was something i could do about he broke off as voices shouted across the upper deck and the hull dipped more heavily in the wind id better go sir get her under way before we lose a spar or two he hurried out and moments later bolitho heard his voice through the partly open skylight set the forecourse mr mears though i fear we will have to take in a reef or so before long we are rejoining the squadron by god id not have his conscience on a matter like this sir javals reply was swift and sad conscience does not come into it toby responsibility sweeps it out of the window allday sat with his shoulders against a slab of broken rock and watched the horses which were picketed at the foot of a slope across his lap pascoe lay quite still his eyes shut in a tight frown as if he were dead squatting or lying dejectedly nearby six other sailors were waiting like allday to see what was going to happen next he squinted up at the sky wishing the rain would return to ease his raging thirst by the set of the sun it must be about noon he decided around him the rough winding track appeared to turn inland he sighed away from the sea he felt pascoe stir on his cramped legs and placed one hand across his mouth easy mr pascoe he saw his dark eyes staring up at him the pain and the memory of what had happened flooding back we are resting a while he nodded carefully towards the soldiers by the horses or they are any rate as pascoe made to move he pressed one hand on his chest it felt cool despite the sun overhead he brushed a flyaway from the livid scar on pascoes ribs the mark which had been left by the duel at gibraltar what what happened pascoe felt his body as if to seek out his limbs one by one like the rest of them he was without shoes or belt and wore only breeches and the remains of his shirt allday murmured the bastards took everything they could i think they killed two of our lads back on the road because they were wounded and couldnt keep pace with the horses he thought of the pitiful screams and then the silence and was glad pascoe had been unconscious then how did i pascoes eyes clouded over you carried me this far allday tried to grin the soldiers are not dons but native troops moors most likely but even these bastards recognise an officer he watched the soldiers warily wondering where they were being taken and it had all happened so suddenly the sound of horses hoofs squeaking in the wet sand just a few yards from the beach where they had dragged the boat a patrol some soldiers returning to camp he still did not know or care in minutes the horsemen would have passed them by too busy with idle chatter to notice the inert shapes along the beach but pascoe had said they will see lieutenant mears and the two boats allday there had not even been a slight hesitation if they warn the schooner our people will be cut down whatever they try to do and so while mears and his men had taken the schooner intact on the other side of the headland pascoe had made his stand with drawn sword he had run up the beach shouting at em lads it had ended just as swiftly the clash of steel men cursing and slashing in the darkness while the horses wheeled like great shadows from all sides pascoe had been knocked senseless by a sabre and the seamen had thrown down their weapons the soldiers had stripped them of their possessions and had beaten them systematically without emotion or any sign of pleasure then kicking and punching the dazed men they had driven them ahead of the horses on to the road away from the sea pascoe licked his dry lips and then touched the bruise on his head it feels like hammers on an anvil aye allday tensed as the senior horseman shouted something to his companions they were well armed a dozen in all he glanced at the surviving sailors they looked beaten frightened the horseman walked slowly towards the little group and stood looking down at pascoe he was tall and very dark and wore a palecoloured fez with a dangling cloth to protect his neck from the glare he pointed with his whip and nodded at pascoe teniente teniente he gave a slow smile displaying some very yellow teeth then spat deliberately on pascoes leg allday struggled free of pascoes body and lurched to his feet you mind your manners you bloody hound when youre talking to a kings officer the man stepped back the smile vanishing as he yelled to his men allday felt his arms pinioned by at least three soldiers before he was thrown face down on the wet sand his wrists wedged to the ground by the boots of his captors he kept his eyes on pascoes pale face willing him to remain still the biting slash of a whip across his spine was like a hot iron he clamped his jaws together holding his breath as the shadow of the mans arm rose and fell again and again he concentrated his stare on two small insects which were moving by his face shutting out the voices above him the swish of the whip the searing pain on his bare skin then it stopped and he rolled to one side as one of them kicked him savagely in the ribs half blinded with sweat and sand he staggered to his feet seeing pascoes face and knowing that the soldiers wanted just one excuse to kill all of them but they were mounting their horses calling to each other as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred pascoe gripped his arm let me help he tore off his shirt and dabbed at alldays scarred back it was all my fault now dontyou think like that mr pascoe you did what was right an proper and well you know it you could have lain low and wed have got back to buzzard with no bother he gritted his teeth as the bloodied shirt moved across his skin but a whole lot of our lads would have paid for it the horsemen wheeled round them and a sailor cried out as one struck him with his whip they moved off along the road again their bare feet soon bleeding on stones and rough chippings their tongues almost clinging to their lips with thirst allday looked up briefly as the senior horseman cantered to the head of the ragged procession and felt slightly better he had someone to hate someone who would be the first to know it if once he got the chance he turned painfully to watch pascoe he was striding along at the head of the little group his jaw set against the pain his dark eyes fixed on some point in the far distance god he thought our dick would be proud of him if only he was here to see the air in lysanders cabin was oppressive and heavy bolitho spread the chart beneath his hands and stared at it for several minutes he had returned aboard less than an hour back and was still wearing the same clothes his chin rough for the want of a shave over his shoulder her hull and reduced sails bending and wavering through the thick glass windows the osiris followed obediently in lysanders wake with the other two decker astern of her farquhar and probyn were sitting on opposite sides of the table while herrick waited by bolithos elbow his face anxious as he watched the brass dividers and rule moving across the chart bolitho said the schooner which captain javal took two days back carried a few other items of interest she was en route for toulon but there was a letter addressed to the captain of another and i suspect larger ship which is now lying here he rested the points of the dividers on the coastline some forty miles souwest of cartagena a small bay used by fishermen i believe but now probably taken for a safe anchorage by spanish transports the dividers ran along and up the coast towards the gulf of lions all the way there must be such ships waiting to carry materials of war to bonapartes army he must be preparing for an invasion herrick asked quietly what do you intend sir had i known the content of the letter i would have held on to the schooner and used her against her old masters the dividers beat a slow rhythm on the chart but no matter the dons will not know she has been taken yet there is still time probyn said bluntly unless some of the landing party were captured sir made to tell what they know of our intentions herrick snapped thats a bloody stupid thing to say no thomas bolitho looked at him impassively it is a possibility we must face up to it try as he might herrick could not drag his gaze from the broken sword which now lay on bolithos desk he said i find it hard sir i know he held his gaze for a few seconds he is close to you also he turned away forcing himself to retain control of his emotions is is is he must not allow himself to think of adam as gone into the past he looked at the other captains we must obtain a new element of surprise attack and probe gain all the knowledge we can of the enemys strength and hurt him when he least expects it farquhar nodded slowly if we attack this shipping sir and then put out to sea in another direction the enemy will not know what we are doing or what our true mission might be bolitho replied exactly it is something i learned and learned well from the french one determined ship can tie down a squadron a determined squadron can hamper a whole fleet they fell silent until probyn said the dons may send a force down from cartagena there is little sea room for what you plan to do i will post captain javal to watch our backs he faced him calmly watching for an argument the dons may be prepared for a local attack another cuttingout expedition or the like a ship of the line is not what anyone will anticipate probyn gasped no sane man certainly bolitho nodded grimly lysander will make the attack he looked at farquhar you will stay to seaward and act as the situation dictates farquhars eyebrows rose very slightly my decision then sir herrick interrupted harshly youll not rate a broad pendant yet dammit farquhar gave a cool smile the idea never entered my mind bolitho tugged at his neckcloth it seemed to be choking him he said i will send you written orders directly so now gentlemen herrick ushered them to the door and closed it behind them bolitho sat down in a chair and rested his head in his hands as the calls shrilled from the gangway to mark the captains departure outside the cabin the sea was deep blue like ruffled silk as the wind ghosted the ships gently eastward if only it had been like this when buzzards boats had taken the sleeping schooner it would have halved the time saved lives herrick returned and said i have ordered the squadron to take station again sir your servant is waiting to attend you thank you thomas herrick looked at the snapped sword if he is still alive there may be a chance to arrange an exchange bolitho stood up violently do you not think i have gone over and over what might or might not be done he swung away his eyes blurred send allday to me with he broke off and for a long moment they stared at each other like strangers then herrick said tonelessly ill attend to the details sir bolitho opened his mouth to prevent his leaving but no words came when he looked again herrick had gone ozzard the cabin servant slipped through the door and moved diagonally towards the sleeping compartment his eyes averted bolitho sat on the bench and watched him he knew little about ozzard other than he was capable and had served the previous commodore well it was said he had been a lawyers clerk and had volunteered for the navy because of some crime he had committed against his employer he was a very quiet man and was moving now like a softfooted poacher as he laid out a clean shirt for his commodore bolitho saw the way his hands moved the shirt shaking as he unfastened the collar he is terrified of me fearful that i will punish him merely to ease my own pain the realisation helped to steady him and he was suddenly ashamed he said quietly thank you ozzard i can manage now the man regarded him nervously if youre sure sir he backed away as if still expecting bolitho to turn on him by the door he hesitated and then said ive had some education sir if you like i could come back and read to you it might help to pass the time and you wouldnt have to say anything bolitho turned away from him hiding his face no not just now ozzard but i appreciate the thought he saw the mans reflection in the sloping windows as he moved silently from the cabin more than i can tell you the captives richard bolitho stood by the quarterdeck rail and watched the sunset it painted the sky in great rustcoloured patterns and gave a sharp edge to the western horizon lysander moved comfortably under forecourse and topsails her broad hull tilting hardly at all to the west wind which had followed her for most of the day he stared along the length of the ship through stays and shrouds and beyond a greasy plume of smoke from the galley funnel he could just make out the tiny outline of harebells sails as she moved ahead of her flagship her yards holding the dying sun like uplifted crosses the rest of his ships had disappeared to the south that afternoon and under farquhars command would even now be making more sail to beat their way around and ahead of lysanders point of attack he pictured the chart in his mind collecting the scraps of information which had formed into a loose strategy he could almost see the line of the shore the hills behind the bay the depths of the sea and places where there was no depth at all against that he had another list of items he did not know what the enemy were doing there or if indeed they were there for any purpose which warranted risking his ships the main topsail billowed and flapped noisily as the wind dropped and then gathered strength again the masters mate of the watch relaxed and made some joke with the helmsmen and at the lee side of the deck lieutenant fitzclarence readjusted his vigilant pose bolitho tried not to let his mind drift from what he had to do but with the ship so quiet and with no questions to answer or problems to solve he was unable to stay aloof from his anxiety two days since he had returned on board two further days since javals men had taken the schooner she would be at gibraltar by now opposing winds or not unless she had run foul of an enemy she would be sold in a prize court maybe taken into the kings service her few remaining crew members would either be sent to a prison hulk or offered an alternative fate that of signing on aboard a british man owar after five years of conflict you heard a dozen languages and dialects in any kings ship and adam he walked slowly to the nettings and stared hard at the sea the land was beyond even a lookouts vision and the sky was already so dark that it was difficult to see the horizons division which moments ago had glowed like hot copper another lieutenant had appeared on deck and was murmuring with fitzclarence while from forward and deeper in the fat hull he heard the shrill of a call the pad of bare feet as the next watch prepared to take over the ship until midnight a freak breeze fanned the stench aft from the galley and he realised just how empty his stomach was but the thought of oatmeal gruel and greasy lumps of boiled meat leftovers from the midday meal were enough to revolt him against eating anything herrick appeared through the cabin hatch and crossed the deck ive told mr gilchrist to muster all officers and senior warrants in the wardroom after eight bells sir he hesitated seeking out bolithos mood in the gloom theyre looking forward to meeting you very much thank you thomas he turned slightly as a bosuns mate ran along the starboard gangway followed by various other members of his watch a ships boy was inspecting the flickering compass light another the hourglass nearby two stiff marines swayed gently at attention as they suffered a close scrutiny by their corporal how black their red coats looked in the darkness bolitho thought made more so by their gleaming crossbelts and breeches they were the sentries one for herricks quarters one for his own the master was rumbling away to a midshipman the latter seemed bent almost double to write something on his slate the pencil very loud in the clammy stillness the newly arrived lieutenant straightened himself away from the rail and touched his hat formally the watch is aft mr fitzclarence fitzclarence nodded relieve the wheel if you please mr kipling more grunts and shuffles and then a helmsman called course eastbenorth sir steady as she goes grubb sniffed noisily and so it should be ill be back on deck afore the glass is turned it sounded like a threat bolitho shivered im ready thomas he heard the bell chime out from forward a gust of laughter as a topman slithered down a backstay nearly knocking another to the deck they walked to the cabin hatch and herrick said the fact that the wind has backed to the westrd makes me think mr grubb is right we will have an easier task to drive inshore than id thought possible down the ladder and past a seaman carrying a biscuit sack from the wardroom he pressed his shoulders against a cabin door as if afraid he might hinder or touch either commodore or captain bolitho saw the lantern light playing across the breeches of the nearest guns some of the ships twentyeight eighteenpounders yet they managed to look at peace it was hard to picture them enveloped in smoke and powder bursting in board on their tackles as their cheering noisecrazed crews spongedout for another broadside further aft he saw the bright rectangle of the wardroom door and beyond it the movement of lysanders officers and every available man of warrant rank too who could be spared from duty on deck herrick paused and said uncertainly it seems a long time since a wardroom was my home bolitho looked at him and mine when i was twenty i thought that life became easy when you were promoted captain i soon learned differently and now i know that each span of authority has its snares as well as its privilege herrick nodded more the former than the latter in my opinion bolitho tugged his coat into place the movement involuntary and unnoticed herrick had not mentioned adam or any part of the cuttingout since his return aboard but he guessed it was rarely absent from his thoughts he remembered when pascoe had served with herrick as a midshipman aboard his little twodecker impulsive it was strange how he had felt about it jealous perhaps afraid that the boys trust in herrick might change to something closer than he himself could offer it all came surging up again like a demon which had been biding its time like the moment when he had arrived at gibraltar which should have been the proudest time in his service hearing about adams gesture on his behalf risking disgrace or maiming in a forbidden duel there must be something deep in our family he thought bitterly with little training or effort so many of them had proved unnaturally skilful with the sword he could recall exactly standing face to face with a french lieutenant aboard a privateer in the east indies face to face both almost spent but each holding on to that madness which only battle can sustain he had felt something like pity for the man willing him to give in knowing even as he parried the others blade aside for that last fatal blow that he could not help himself he said sharply well thomas let us be about it then the lysanders wardroom was packed with men as herrick led the way aft bolitho was again reminded of his own youthful days as a junior lieutenant in a ship of the line such as this then he had wondered about the men who lived and dreamed in the cabins above the wardroom admiral or captain it had made little difference then he glanced at the expectant faces as they stood back to make a passage for him some he vaguely recognised from their duties about the upper deck others he did not know at all the immature expressions of the lieutenants set against the more controlled scrutiny of the warrant officers grubbs great shape beside yeo the boatswain and against the stenmost eighteenpounder a severe looking man who he guessed was corbyn the gunner the scarlet coats of the marines seemed to overshadow the untidy clump of midshipmen there were about eight or nine of them present while managing to stay slightly apart from all the rest edgar mewse the purser and shacklock the surgeon completed the gathering gilchrist reported all present sir but for the fourth lieutenant mr kipling who has the watch and mr midshipman blenkame who shares it with him herrick cleared his throat and then laid his hat on a table thank you bolitho nodded be seated gentlemen i will be as brief as i can he waited impassively as they scrambled for chairs and sea chests the most comfortable places going to the most senior until a mere handful of midshipmen were left nothing but the hard deck to sit upon bolitho said the flag captain will have told you what we are about the bones of the plan are that we shall close the land on the day after tomorrow at first light and destroy what enemy shipping we cannot take as prizes he saw two of the midshipmen nudging each other cheer fully one he recognised as saxby his wide gaptoothed grin as broad as if he had just been promised a months leave on full pay if the wind goes against us we will stand off and act accordingly he glanced at grubbs battered face but the master has promised full cooperation from a higher authority than mine there was laughter and a good deal of humour at grubbs expense he remained immovable in their midst but bolitho could see the pleasure his comment had given him he knew herrick was watching him all the time he of all people would see through his mask his efforts to show the assembled officers that their commodore was a man beyond and above inner despair bolitho had lost many good friends at sea there was no friendship stronger than one born in the demanding hardship of a man war sea and disease the sword or a cannons harvest had pared away many such faces it was no wonder that these men could accept pascoes absence hardly any of them had been together long enough to know the pain of such a loss he realised they had fallen silent that he must have been standing for several seconds without speaking almost harshly he continued to create as much confusion as possible we will land lysanders marines under cover of darkness he sought out major leroux who was sitting arms folded and stiffbacked beside his lieutenant he had met leroux only formally but he had been impressed it was always difficult to break the inbuilt contempt for the marines the bullocks which was common amongst most ships companies their rigid ideas of drill and organised discipline in the worst of situations were at odds with the more casual and boisterous behaviour of the average seaman bolitho had come up against many marine officers and although he had soon grown to respect their loyalty and prowess in battle he had rarely discovered one who had displayed much initiative nepean the marine lieutenant for instance was fairly typical impeccably dressed and ready to answer the call to duty at any hour his eyes had the empty glassiness of one quite happy to obey rather than to lead but major jermyn leroux was totally different tall and squareshouldered he had the outward appearance of a scholar despite his military bearing bolitho had spoken with him on the quarterdeck about the training and recruitment of his marines but never once had leroux made an idle boast or suggested he could offer something beyond his means he said i will discuss the final details with you tomorrow major leroux nodded he had still rather sad eyes and an expression of a man who felt strangely out of place he replied allowing for marines who are sick and otherwise unfit for duty sir i can muster ninety men that will be sufficient bolitho turned to herrick swivels in the boats and grapnels in case we need to scale any defences he did not wait for any comment but added when captain javal took the schooner there was a need for stealth this time i want our force to seem far greater than it really is one of the eighteenpounders which shared the wardroom with its occupants squeaked slightly against its lashings as lysander dipped her massive bulk into a trough bolitho heard faint shouts from the watch on deck the groan of the rudder beneath the counter as the helm was corrected he said we have rare freedom to act as we choose on this mission we must lose no opportunity to discover what the enemy is planning neither can we turn from the chance to damage his security he looked at herrick if there are any questions gilchrist stood up his forehead partly hidden by a deck beam will there be no seamen in the landing party sir a minimum bolitho kept his voice calm the bay which lysander will have to enter and cross may be well defended there will certainly be a battery of sorts even if it is only light artillery captain herrick will need every available hand on brace and gun tackle i can assure you the hint of action ran round the wardroom like wind through ripe com but gilchrist stood his ground his bony figure angled slightly to the decks tilt he asked major leroux will be in overall charge then no mr gilchrist he felt herrick stiffen at his side i will gilchrist gave what could have been a shrug a risk surely sir he glanced at the other officers like someone sure of an audience we were all grieved to hear of mr pascoes erdisappearance to invite another disaster in your own family bolitho looked down at his hands it was strange that he could hold them so still when he felt like seizing the man and beating him senseless he replied calmly if captain herrick has no objection i am taking you ashore with me mr gilchrist you will be able to see for yourself where the value of risk may lie gilchrist stared at him then at herrick he stammered thank you sir it is an honour he sat down without another word herrick said if nobody else has anything to offer lieutenant fitzclarence stood up and gave bolitho a determined stare we will show them sir god help me well pistol the vermin he was almost glowing with excitement in his minds eye he probably saw gilchrist already dead and himself as first lieutenant bolitho gave him a nod well said mr fitzclarence but mark this he looked around the wardroom all of you whatever you may think of the dons do not imagine they are like the french when this war began the french fleet was almost in irons for want of good senior officers far too many were senselessly butchered in the terror merely to placate a mob but that is over and done with new men with fresh ideas are alive in their fleet the handful of older officers who survived the guillotine are respected again and their zeal will be all the sharper now that they know the price of failure armies can fight bravely under almost any conditions known to man but without power over the sea lanes without the lifeblood of supplies and replacements they are like marooned sailors halfway to a living death fitzclarence was still on his feet but his face had lost some of its assurance he said lamely well sir i am still confident of our success herrick waited for him to be seated his blue eyes were fixed on bolitho perhaps you would care to join me in my cabin thank you bolitho picked up his hat my throat is dry he walked between the silent officers knowing the air would explode into supposition and general excitement once the door was shut behind him outside the wardroom herrick said quietly let me go sir i asked before now im pleading they walked in silence to the ladder and up again to the next group of cabins herrick threw open the door of his quarters and gestured to his servant to leave as bolitho seated himself by the table he opened his cabinet and produced a bottle of claret bolitho watched him seeing all the arguments building up in his friends mind as he busied himself with the glasses if some other seventyfour was wearing the commodores broad pendant herrick would have the great stern cabin to himself strangely enough it was hard to see him there now thomas bolitho took a glass and held it to a deckhead lantern i know what you are about to say let me speak first he sipped the claret slowly hearing the sea sluicing along the lower hull and dashing spray against the closed port you think i feel my nephews disappearance so grievously that i am prepared to throw my life away as a gesture to say i do not feel it would be a lie equally it would be false of me to say that my upbringing my very way of life would not stop me from such a vanity like you thomas i have seen too many good men so many fine ships and ideals thrown to the winds because of the conceit of perhaps only one man in authority i swore i would never allow my own feelings to make others suffer and for the most part i have i think been true to that he was on his feet pacing slowly the few yards along the length of the cabin herrick sat on the breech of a ninepounder his eyes glinting in the yellow light as he followed his restless movements when my wife cheney died he broke off aware for the first time that he was moving round the cabin enough of that you shared it all you brought news of her death a burden for any man to carry let alone a friend herrick looked at him wretchedly i know i suppose that adam has come to mean so much because of my loss i told myself that if or when i fell in battle or died of some other cause he would gain the advantages of the bolitho family advantages which should have come his way by happier circumstances he shrugged helplessly you never think that fate might take one and leave the other behind thomas herrick rolled the glass in his fingers searching for the right words that is why i ask the chance to go with the marines he stopped seeing the refusal in bolithos grey eyes no the day after tomorrow we will land on an enemy coast not some rock or island or an outpost in the indies but in europe do you think it right to commit our people to such a venture without leadership he laid one hand on herricks shoulder come along thomas be honest were there not many times in the past when you have maligned your senior officer for leaving you to take the cuffs and stabs while he stayed clear of danger he shook him gently i asked for honesty herrick gave a half smile on some occasions some bolitho watched him with sudden affection by heaven you took me to task enough let alone a commodore or admiral herrick controlled the smile that was different because you are you thomas and i am the same man as i was then herrick put down his glass and mr gilchrist i need an experienced sea officer his tone hardened slightly he sent young adam into that boat perhaps because he had experience of battle despite his years or maybe for some other less praiseworthy reason herrick looked at the deck i find that hard to believe sir he faced him again his features more determined than they had been since the ship had left gibraltar but if i discover a truth in it he will know it his eyes were like a strangers and pay bolitho smiled gravely easy now perhaps i am speaking hastily he moved to the door and heard the marine sentry drawing his boots together but we had best concentrate on the immediate future otherwise we will all be made to pay for it allday thrust the hair from his eyes and said hoarsely it seems we have arrived mr pascoe his lips were so dry from thirst that he could barely speak and the sun across his head and shoulders burned as mercilessly as it had all day and the one before that pascoe nodded and lurched against him behind them the five gasping seamen staggered like drunkards staring without comprehension at the lip of the hill track the hard glittering horizon beyond the sea once again the forced march had been a nightmare and while the mounted troopers had made a show of drinking as much as they pleased they had made certain their prisoners were given hardly anything when two wrinkled peasant women had offered some water by the roadside the horsemen had ridden at them threateningly driving them away laughing when one had gone sprawling in the dust like an untidy bundle they had lost one more of their number a seaman called stokes he had sat watching the troopers on the previous evening as they had prepared to make camp for the night he had been unable to drag his eyes from the great skin of coarse red wine which was being handed round amongst the troopers his raging thirst the pain of his lacerated feet making him a picture of misery and despair after a muttered conversation the troopers had beckoned him over and to the other prisoners astonishment and envy had offered him the skin of wine gesturing and grinning at him to take his fill when they had finally realised what was happening it was already too late as stokes drank and drank to his capacity his face and chest soaking in spilled wine the soldiers urged him on and then supporting him bodily while others poured more into his gaping mouth starved sundried and already terrified as to what his fate might be stokes had changed in that instant into a raving madman capering and reeling vomiting and falling in all directions he was pitiful to watch and whenever he had dropped choking on the ground they had begun allover again this morning as the prisoners had been freed from their ropes and herded on to the rough track they had seen stokes still lying where he had last fallen his body surrounded in a great red stain of dried wine like blood his face a mask of flies when pascoe had tried to reach him he had been kicked back to the others none of the troopers even went to see if stokes was still breathing it was as if they had tired of a game and wished only to get on towards their destination allday shaded his eyes and studied the blue sea beyond the hill rise what a barren place it was mountains inland and this part all ups and downs in stony gullies his torn feet told him he had walked every inch of it a whip cracked and once more they started to shuffle forward as they panted up the last slope allday said breathlessly ships by god pascoe nodded three of them he seized alldays arm look at all those people the track which led down to the foreshore and joined another bettermade road was alive with tiny moving figures like ants which at a distance appear to move without purpose or direction it was evident as they drew nearer that the activity was well ordered dotted about were armed soldiers and civilian supervisors who stood like rocks amidst the tide of human movement pascoe said prisoners slaves more like allday saw the whips in the hands of the guards the fearful way the ragged prisoners moved around each vigilant figure he turned his head towards the ships two brigs and one larger vessel a transport all three anchored close inshore and the water between them and a newly constructed pier was an endless coming and going of oared boats and lighters there were lines of neat tents by the hillside and across the bay scored out of the grass and gorse of a low headland was what appeared to be a battery the flag of spain lifting and curling high above it pascoe murmured the ships look well laden they fell silent as the senior horseman cantered towards them his whip trailing down his leg and along the road he pointed at the seamen and barked an order two troopers dismounted and gestured with drawn sabres towards the first line of tents the whip swung round separating pascoe and allday from the others and at the same time pointing to another smaller line of tents outside one allday saw an officer watching them shading his eyes with his arm as the horseman urged them towards him allday silently thanked god the officer might be a spaniard but he was far better than their captors the horseman dismounted and reported to the officer who after a slight hesitation walked towards them he was very slim and wore a white tunic and scarlet breeches as he drew closer allday noticed that his smart uniform and gleaming cavalry boots were less so and like the man himself showed signs of having been out here in this terrible place for some while he walked around them very slowly his dark features thoughtful but without any sign of emotion he stopped in front of them again and said in careful english i am capitan don camilo san martin of his most catholic majestys dragoon guards he had a sensitive face marred by a thin even cruel mouth i would be obliged if you would honour me with your er titles he held up one neat hand but before you begin i must warn against lies that fool of a man told me how his patrol discovered you and your sailors how after a great fight he was able to overpower you and bring you to mehe seemed to draw himself up in stature i am in command of this er enterprise at the moment allday breathed out slowly as pascoe replied i am lieutenant adam pascoe of his britannic majestys navy the spaniards sad eyes moved to allday and this i understand he too is an officer his mouth lifted slightly of some lesser value perhaps yes pascoe swayed but kept his voice level a warrant officer allday found time to marvel at pascoes quick thinking after what he had just endured the spaniard seemed content with the lie if they were to be separated now there was no chance of escape if chance there was good capitan san martin smiled you are very young teniente i am right therefore to suppose that you were not alone that you are from an english ship eh he held up his hand in the same tired gesture i know you are an officer and bound to your oath that i respect in any case the question must have an obvious answer pascoe said hoarsely my men capitan could you order your soldiers to take care of them the spaniard seemed to consider it in good time but for the moment you and i have matters to discuss he pointed to his tent within the sun is cursed hot today inside it was cool and as alldays eyes grew accustomed to the shaded interior he realised he was walking on a thick carpet after the rough road it was like a gentle balm for his tom and blistered feet san martin remarked i see from your back that you had some rough handling on your way he shrugged they are ignorant savages but good fighters my grandfather used to hunt them for sport it seemed to amuse him but we must change with the times an orderly brought some goblets and began to fill them with wine san martin nodded sit down if you wish you are now prisoners of war i suggest you make the most of my hospitality he smiled again i was once a captive of the english and exchanged a year back i learned to improve my understanding of your people as well as the language pascoe began i must insist sir he got no further san martin stared up at the roof of the tent and shouted do not insist with me teniente the sudden effort brought a rash of sweat across his features i have but to say the word and i can make you vanish how do you enjoy that eh those animals you saw out there working on the road and defences are criminals who but for the urgency of this task would be in their rightful places chained to the oars of a galley or rotting on gibbets i could have you flung amongst them teniente how would you like to eke out your life chained to a great sweep sitting in your own filth and living hour by hour to the beat of a drum the lash of a whip eh he was almost beside himself you would have very little time to insist that i promise you allday saw the soldier with the wine bottle shaking badly he was obviouslv used to his masters violent outbursts he continued more calmly your ship or ships perhaps are in our waters to do us some harm he gave a slow smile your commander do i know of him he did not wait for answer but strode from the tent pascoe whispered quickly he does not know about the schooner to hell with the schooner mr pascoe what will you tell him before he could reply the spanish captain was back again with great care he laid a loop of stout cord on the table and stood back to examine it you will see that it is joined at both ends he sounded matter of fact there are two large knots in it here and here he tapped it with his finger a circle of pain our inquisitors found it of some use for obtaining confessions of guilt in the americas i believe he looked hard at pascoe if i had this placed around your head each of the knots would fit against an eye by twisting the cord from behind tighter and tighter i am assured the agony is unbearable he picked up the cord and threw it to the orderly and of course the climax comes when both eyes are forced from their sockets he snapped an order to his orderly who almost ran from the tent like grapes allday exclaimed hoarsely youll not let those devils use it on our lads i have told you san martins face was working with emotion you are prisoners of war you will be treated as such while you are under my guard he sat down his chest working painfully now drink your wine allday dropped his goblet as a terrible shriek echoed round the tent as pascoe made for the entrance two pistols appeared in san martins hands as if by magic stand it is not one of your wretched sailors it is only a prisoner the effect will be the same after they have watched his pain san martins eyes remained as still as the two pistols as he studied pascoes horrified face the terrible screams continued for what seemed like an hour but when they ceased the sound remained in the tent like a curse from hell san martin replaced the pistols in his belt and said sailors talk a great deal i will go now do not try to leave the tent or i will have you killed he picked up his hat and banged dust from its yellow plume when i have spoken to the sailors i will know about your ships and probably much more as well the tent seemed very silent after he had gone pascoe sank down on to the carpet and retched uncomfortably hes right allday watched his despair the quiver of his blistered shoulders as he tried to control himself no one but a fool would stay voiceless after being made to watch that torture the spanish captain true to his promise was back within an hour he seated himself on one comer of a brassbound chest and said calmly one of your men was very willing to speak with me he smiled sadly do not look so troubled teniente mine would sell my very soul if they were in the same position he became formal your ships have been in these waters for over a week yes you are sailing to spy upon the french our ally such matters are not my concern my orders are to command over these dogs until the bay is properly defended he tapped his chin with the rim of a wine goblet i did discover one piece of news which may be of use to those better placed to use it your ships took a spanish vessel his mouth twisted with sudden fury those fools who brought you here were so drunk with their victory they allowed a ship to be stolen from under their noses allday thought of the knotted cord and could almost feel pity for the senior horseman with the whip as if to confirm his thoughts san martin snapped it will not happen again he calmed himself with an effort no matter your war is over i will have you transported to more er secure quarters where you can be held in accordance with your station he eyed them dully i will send for some food he was obviously disinterested in matters relating to any ship friend or foe now that he had attended to his prisoners two armed soldiers escorted them to a nearby tent and a short time later the same orderly brought a basket of bread and fruit and a large earthenware jug of coarse wine pascoe said bitterly then its over allday well not see england for a long while he looked away if ever allday stood by the tent flap careful not to show himself to the sentry outside he replied nothings over yet he added grimly be thankful for one thing that gibbering seaman who spoke with the don was one of cap n javal s men they all were in our party pascoe looked up at him what difference does it make allday walked from the flap and poured a mug of wine any lysander would have known you to be the commodores nephew he saw the shot go home think what the don would have made of that eh theyd have used you as something to bargain with maybe pascoe stared at him i am sorry i did not think not that our dickd he broke off and grinned beg pardon i was forgetting my place go on please allday shrugged ive sailed with your uncle for a long time his voice was far away weve seen and done a lot together ive watched him ache for the brave lads whove fallen at his bidding seen him walk about a deck as if in a dream while the planks have spouted splinters from sharpshooters trying to mark him down he shook himself ashamed at betraying a deeply guarded confidence he would not risk his people even for you pascoe scrambled to his feet and crossed to his side for us you mean allday smiled ah well its good of you to put it like that but coxns are easier to get than blood relations pascoe sighedi wish i could do something for him a shouted challenge made allday peer through the flap again theres a rider dashing into the camp as if the goblins of exmoor were at his tail pascoe said let me look together they watched san martin as he stood outside his tent his dark head lowered as he squinted at a mounted trooper who was gasping for breath and shouting his message from the track below the tents allday muttered somethings afoot pascoe gripped his arm i understand a little spanish something in his tone made allday forget the scene by the tents pascoe added quietly a fisherman has sighted a ship a big ship they stared at each other for several seconds then allday said thickly if its one ship on her own we know which one shell be dontwe mr pascoe they turned back to the sunlight as san martin yelled a stream of orders which were terminated by the urgent blare of a trumpet allday thought of the headland battery the one bitter turn of luck which had let a spanish fisherman send a warning you just said you wished you could do something he saw pascoe nod with slow understanding so be it then for if lysander or any other kings ship pokes her beakhead into the bay now itll be the last damn thing she does on this earth an thats no error san martins voice was suddenly very close and pascoe said quickly well have some wine he thrust a full mug into alldays fist say something allday gulped on the wine and nearly choked i can remember as if it was yesterday when i was in the old hyperion and san martin threw open the tent flap and strode into the shade good he looked at the wine and the bread good pascoe asked the trumpet sir does it mean danger san martin studied him searchingly of no importance to you he moved round the tent like a trapped animal i was going to have you put aboard a ship today but i will have to wait until tomorrow i am sending you to toulon the french admiral has more time than i to deal with such matters allday said gravely it is war sir san martin regarded him for a long moment riding a fine mount into battle is war commanding this miserable rabble is not he paused by the entrance i will probably not see you again they waited until his footsteps had receded and then allday said thank god for that pascoe ran his fingers through his hair combing out grit and sand he is keeping the ships here until tomorrow he was thinking aloud so our ship must be very near allday watched the side of the tent as it pressed inwards with the hot wind if the wind holds as it stands now mr pascoe lysander will bestanding inshore right enough youre sure it will be lysander the youth watched him gravely and arent you he nodded yes then it will be tonight or first light i reckon allday swallowed another mouthful of wine so wed best put our heads together and think of some way to warn her off he remembered what pascoe had said earlier well not see england again for a long while if ever whatever they could do to warn the ship and whatever the result of their sacrifice might be one thing was certain they would both pay for it dearly the only way out bolitho tugged his hat firmly over his forehead as lysanders heavy thirtyfour foot launch dipped into the lively wave crests and soaked the occupants with spray he peered astern but the ship was already lost in darkness while on either quarter he could see the white splashes from oars as the two cutters held their station on him despite the careful preparations oak looms tied with greased rags and the tight stowage of weapons and equipment the combined sounds seemed tremendous he turned his attention ahead of the launch and could just discern the outline of the gig the occasional splash of phosphorescence as a seaman in her bows marked their progress with a boats lead and line the gig was commanded by lysanders senior masters mate named plowman who had been highly recommended by the master himself bolitho thought that if grubb could not take part in the raid personally then plowman was the next best choice grubb had confided in his thick wheezing voice that plowman had served in a welsh trader along these shores in happier times leastways thats what e says sir i reckon e was doin a bit of blackbirdin with the arabs slaver or not plowman was taking the little procession of overcrowded boats straight inshore without the slightest show of hesitation it was strange that the more important the work the lowlier the man who was most needed he felt gilchrist shifting his bony figure beside him the quick nervous breathing as he clutched his sword between his knees bolitho tried not to think of the possibility of disaster that already out there in the blackness muskets and blades were waiting to cut them down in the shallows perhaps gilchrist was thinking much the same someone lost the stroke in one of the cutters and he heard steere the fifth lieutenant call anxiously easy there together the boats were so heavily laden with marines as well as their oarsmen that it took plenty of brawn to pull them the resulting splashes and creaks grunts and curses were only to be expected the bowman called gigs eavedto sir bolitho leaned forward suddenly aware that the white writhing patterns no longer came from plowmans oars but from sea against land easy all the launchs coxswain tensed over his tiller bar stand by in the boat gilchrist snapped i cant see a damn thing the two cutters were backing water vigorously their pale hulls gleaming in the darkness as an offshore swell swung them in a dance metal rasped and boots shuffled as the marines prepared to quit the boats it only needed one of them to loose off his musket or fall against the seaman who was holding the lanyard of a stemmounted swivel gun and stealth would go by the board bolitho held his breath watching plowmans gig loom from the darkness and touch the launch with barely a shudder hands reached out to hold them together and after a few more fumbling thuds plowman appeared in the sternsheets his teeth very white as he muttered there seems a fair beach up yonder sir his breathing was even as if he was actually enjoying himself remembering perhaps when he and his men had gone after live cargo not very big but by the looks of the water id say were safer here than gropin to the next bay i agree bolitho tried not to think of the time it was like a mental hourglass the sand running away remorselessly plowman added ill lead then he made to turn towards the bows but stopped as bolitho said once we are ashore you will take charge of the boats you have done well mr plowman to get us this far ill see its not forgotten plowman protested i could put one of my lads in charge sir no we will need you again later i dontwant mr grubbs righthand man getting lost in spain the master would never pardon me several men chuckled arid plowman sighed thats true sir fifteen minutes later the gig and then the big launch thrust into hard sand and while seamen stumbled waistdeep in water alongside and oars and weapons went in all directions bolitho ran with gilchrist up the beach their swords in their hands this would be the moment bolitho halted by some scattered rocks his eyes straining in the darkness trying to pitch his ears above wind and sea but no challenge came no ripple of flashes from the higher darkness above the beach and with each precious minute more and more men were squelching out of the shallows and hurrying to their allotted positions the crossbelts grew in numbers and when the cutters which had watched warily for any sign of attack came in also the small cove seemed to be full of silent figures major leroux strode up the beach all mustered sir very well have the boats stand off pass the word to mr plowman to remain close inshore for one hour and then return to the ship as arranged he watched leroux beckoning to his orderly one hour it should be long enough to know if they had an even chance of success as the boats and their depleted crews splashed astern from the beach bolitho could sense the uncertainty around him despite their military code the marines were not land animals the thought of being left in foreign territory denied a link with their ship and the only way of life most of them understood would be uppermost in their minds he said send out your scouts major leroux the marine nodded we will need some good men to flank us too he hurried away and in no time at all the whole landing party was on the move it was much as grubb and plowman had described although the track which followed the high ground above the beach was rougher than expected men swore savagely in the darkness and occasionally bolitho heard nepean or one of his sergeants demanding silence under all manner of threats after an hour bolitho ordered a rest and while the marines sat or crouched on either side of the track he called his officers together it will be growing lighter in five hours he saw midshipman luce shaking stone chippings from one shoe and thought again of pascoe in the poor light he was not unlike him they had been no were good friends according to my calculations we have a gully to cross and then we will be very near to the bay the chart describes the first headland as loose and worn down by the sea so it is my guess that any defending battery must be mounted on the opposite headland gilchrist said angrily we can never march all that way before lysander begins her attack are you speaking to me mr gilchrist his voice was so mild that luce jammed on his shoe and stood very still to listen im sorry er sir gilchrist sounded off balance it was an opinion i am glad to know that he looked at the others but we must seize any pieces which might be capable of crippling lysander before the attack begins unprepared for our visit the spaniards may well be but the bay will be like a nest of hornets once the first shot is fired leroux tightened his swordbelt i agree sir and the sooner we get to the gully the better ill be pleased bolitho looked round feeling the dust and grit against his face the wind was holding it was to be hoped that herricks lady luck did the same he said get them moving again leroux strode away and after a few whispered commands the marines clumped on to the track in the darkness their belts made a long undulating snake of crosses and still nothing moved from the outer darkness not a stray dog nor some befuddled fisherman groping his way to a boat to prepare for the dawn it was as if the whole of the shore had been abandoned stranger still bolitho found that he was able to think without interruption his gait almost relaxed as he strode beside the middle section of marines he thought of the times he had sailed past this coastline in both directions now he was actually walking along it names on the chart crossed through his mind like memories cartagena which lay less than forty miles away alicante valencia each held a place in his memory and five years back in this same war spain had been an ally of england he realised that a whispered command was coming back down the line and as he hurried forward he saw leroux and nepean in close conference with a corporal leroux did not waste words this is corporal manners sir a good skirmisher by any standards he looked steadily at bolitho hes been leading the scouts bolitho kept his tone level although he knew that some thing was very wrong your advance party has reached the gully leroux nodded tell the commodore manners the marines dialect was like a sound of home manners explained the gully is there as we expected zur but there must have been a great cliff fall its almost sheercut like the side of an abbey he hesitated i was a tin miner in cornwall afore i signed on zur then you will know what you are talking about bolitho looked past them his mind grappling with the totally unexpected manners added i could try an get down with the grapnel an line zur bolitho shook his head under cover of darkness it would be fatal he looked at leroux what do you think the major replied it would take hours even if we could do it the men would be in poor shape for a pitched battle afterwards and lysander would already be in the bay he felt despair crowding in on him he had been blind too stupid to plan for this one real barrier which made all other preparations a waste of time and lives he had relied on the charts sparse information and his own eagerness his mind rebelled at the word for vengeance we will have to march them around the gully sir leroux was watching him sharing his anxiety however indeed major leroux that one word however tells all lieutenant nepean remarked we will circle whatever defences there are in the bay sir and storm the battery from inland leroux sighed pass the word to sergeant gritton we will follow the scouts as before in a quieter voice he said to bolitho there is nothing else we can do now it could have been a reproach but it was not gilchrists tall figure carne out of the gloom i hear that we are cut off by the gully sir that is so he tried to discover his reactions so we will have our forced march after all he saw the marines plodding past again muskets slung heads bowed as they watched the legs of the men in front most of them did not know where they were let alone what they were doing here trust the word came at him like a shout it was all they had and he had thrown it back at them gilchrist said in a dull voice it is what follows that troubles me sir he turned to take up his position with the next file of marines leroux snapped that man puts an edge to my patience sir bolitho glanced at him captain herrick is satisfied with his competence leroux slashed at a gorse bush with his curved hanger and replied it is not for me to speak of others behind their backs sir remember that word we were using major bolitho heard the hanger cut angrily at another patch of gorse however i know that captain herrick has served with you before sir the whole squadron knows it he is a fine man and a fair one it is hard to be either in a ship of the line from my experience i will agree to that major thomas herrick has been my friend since the american revolution he has saved my life more than once and you his to all accounts sir leroux darted a swift glance at his panting file of marines he has a sister sir did you know that yes she means a lot to captain herrick the poor girl has had much to endure that i also know yes she is a cripple i met her once when i went to kent on a mission for the captain when we were refitting lysander to see a face so fair and so betrayed by her useless limbs is enough to break a mans heart he added slowly mr gilchrist has asked for her hand in marriage bolitho gripped his sword hilt and stared into the darkness until his eyes hurt him he had been so busy with his own affairs he had not once considered herricks other world herrick had begun his service as a poor man without privileges compared with officers like farquhar or himself for that matter he still was poor but over the years he had managed to save to swell his meagre beginnings with prize money and the reward from his promotion to postcaptain leroux said captain herricks mother died just before we sailed from spithead so you see sir his sister is all alone now he did not tell me bolithos mind went back over those first moments when he had joined lysanderat gibraltar but maybe i gave him no chance he fell silent and leroux hurried on towards his scouts leaving him to his thoughts herrick loved his sister dearly to find her a husband would be more important than almost anything even his loyalty to him he thought too of gilchrists hostility and forced himself to ask why he should want to marry a crippled girl he could find an explanation for neither he lifted his head and stared up at the stars so cool and aloof from all their pathetic efforts on earth so often in the past when he had served fretting and impatient under his superior officers he had told himself he could do better but they had had fleets to command great events to consider and manipulate he had been given just one small chance to show his ability to prove that he could now join that elite group of men whose flags flew with pride for all to see and obey as he listened to the weary dragging boots of the marines at his side he knew he had failed what can you see now pascoe kept his voice to a whisper as he watched the sentry outside the tent flap at the back of the tent allday was bent almost double while he peered through a small hole cut with an improvised blade which he had fashioned from a drinking cup allday held up his hand to silence him from the rear of the tent he could see part of the beach below the camp the glitter of stars on choppy water and a riding light from one of the ships there was no moon so that any small glow from fire or lantern shone out with false brightness even from as far as the other headland it was past midnight from what he could judge but there had been plenty of activity in and around the camp with barely a pause since that trumpet call it was quieter now but above the headland he could see a few pinpricks from lanterns and guessed that the battery was fully manned and getting ready for the dawn something red wavered for just a few seconds and then died as quickly he felt sweat on his neck and chest that was a furnace door being opened and closed they were heating shot to welcome the ship with fire he ducked down and together the two of them lay side by side on the ground faces almost touching allday whispered the batterys heating shot that must be why weve got a native trooper as a sentry every don in the camp will be an artilleryman and needed for those damned cannon pascoes face was pale in the darkness what shall we do allday gestured at the flap just one guard is there aye they seem to think were safe enough allday grinned in spite of the mounting tension with good reason mr pascoe not much harm we can do if we start walking is there i know it sounded like a sob easy he touched his shoulder feeling the rawness left by the sun if we can make an explosion like the way we spoke of we might be able to drive the ship away pascoe nodded firmly how can we cross the camp it must be all of a mile to the other side allday looked at the rear of the tent if there is more than one guard we are dead before we begin he let his words sink in but if i take this one before he shouts for aid one of us can wear his uniform pascoe wriggled on his stomach to the flap again hes sitting down he came back again moving like a poacher i think he may be asleep but take care he touched his wrist there could be more guards close by allday examined his crude knife and said if i get taken before i can do anything you stay still and pretend to be asleep dont let on that we were doing it together pascoe showed his teeth the hell with you allday allday smiled thats more the sound of it mr pascoe pascoe stayed by the flap shutting his ears to the steady scraping sound of allday cutting through the tough canvas the sentry did not move and pascoe was certain that some one would hear the steady thud of his heart against his ribs the noise stopped and he took a quick glance across his shoulder are you going now but he was alone he rose on one knee holding his breath as alldays shadow flitted round the side of the tent his bare feet soundless on the sand it was as if he had transformed himself into a great enveloping cloak one moment he stood there towering above the dozing soldier then he was down and around him merging the shadows into one with little more noise than a brief yawn he tugged open the flap as allday came back through the narrow entrance dragging the inert soldier behind him allday spoke through his teeth dare not light a lantern youll have to dress best you can here pull his tunic off while i get his breeches he stinks like a sow he groped quickly for a belt ah he has a pistol too pascoe felt the mans skin under his fingers it was clammy and hot but unmoving allday muttered i think i broke the bastards neck pascoe stared at him and tore off his own breeches he stood naked for a few hesitant seconds before struggling into the dead soldiers his own breeches were almost tom to shreds but they were part of his remaining link he tightened his lips there was no link any more next the tunic and belt allday was right he would never have been able to get his powerful bulk into this mans clothing he heard allday moving across the tent the gurgling of wine and wondered how he could drink at a time like this he gasped as alldays dripping hands clamped around his face and neck and down the open collar of his tunic allday said grimly got to make you as dark as possible see god help us if they see you in daylight dont reckon theyd have seen a redfaced trooper before he clapped the fez on pascoes head and draped the neckcloth carefully to hide as much of his face as possible pascoe picked up the musket and checked it fortunately it was a new one probably french im ready allday dragged the corpse aside and covered it with a piece of canvas good now just loop some cord round my wrists behind my back this has got to look right an proper he grinned not too tight mind they looked at each other in silence then pascoe said if they take me alive allday shook his head they wont me neither outside the tent it seemed almost cool the deep shadows of tents and earthworks unreal and menacing allday wondered what the guards did with the slaves and prisoners during the night all being well they would get a rude awakening wherever they were it was all so easy they walked quickly down the slope from the officers tents and onto a rough partly completed track which allday guessed led towards the new pier dying embers from a fire glowed redly by an unlimbered wagon and between the big wheels he could see several sleeping figures he heard pascoes footsteps close behind him the regular tapping of his musket against his hip as he carried it slung over one shoulder something moved away from a pile of timber and he hissed a vast mr pascoe pascoe unslung his musket and jammed the muzzle into his spine pushing him along as fast as he dared the shadow called something and then laughed before turning away again into the darkness allday murmured well done but i hope youre watching your trigger finger they continued in a straight line using the dark margin below the stars to show the way to the headland there were no lanterns there now the gun crews would be resting by their weapons they had little to fear allday halted and felt pascoe stop immediately what is it allday said quietly theres someone directly ahead of us right in our path pascoe whispered we darent stop here were out in the open aye something about the figure standing in their way worried allday just laugh if he says anything ill try and jump on his back as we pass but the man did not challenge them nor turn as they moved abreast of his lonely vigil he was tied to a post his eyeless sockets huge and black above his bared teeth allday stayed silent knowing it was the senior horseman who had beaten him with his whip pascoe said it all for him if they do that to one of their own after a few more minutes allday said i think wed better rest here take our bearings they were almost on the seas edge the sand made uneven by the comings and goings of many feet as the anchored ships and lighters had been loaded the nearest one a brig seemed harder in outline allday thought the dawn was closer than he had believed how inviting she looked he thought of the task they had set themselves and shuddered any ship would seem so just now he turned his attention to the low headland two humps about a cable apart marred the otherwise level outline so there were two batteries it was unlikely there would be more than one magazine the spanish captain had hinted that he had enough to do without adding to his work at this stage well take the inner one if you agree pascoe nodded the one with the oven he nodded again its more likely that the magazine will be there theyll not want too many delays when cradling heated shot into a primed gun allday watched his silhouette it could have been the commodore speaking i think i can see a path well follow it if were wrong well double back and try elsewhere pascoe added firmly itll be a quick death but their choice of direction was the right one the path widened as it curved around the back of the headland and even to alldays sore feet felt smoother sheltered once more from the sea it was much quieter they heard other sounds rustlings in the saltdried grass the distant neigh of tethered horses a persistent whistle from some nightbird on the search for prey they turned yet another bend and found themselves staring straight at a tall wooden gate it was wide open and in the dim light of a hanging lantern they saw some crude steps leading up the hill to a point which must be directly below the first battery allday asked quickly do you have that whip pascoe fumbled with the unfamiliar belt yes why he broke off as two figures moved slightly from inside the doorway allday snapped use it lively or well never reach that bloody gate both of the sentries were armed allday could see their bayonets glinting in the yellow glare they were both spaniards artillerymen by the look of their boots and wide breeches he caught his breath as the whip passed against his shoulder harder for gads sake pascoe gasped and struck out again remembering with sudden clarity the way the horsemen had beaten them without emotion or pity the two sentries were watching with little curiosity in this awful place it was a regular spectacle then a musket clattered as one of them brought it up from the ground and allday bounded forward dragging it from the astonished sentrys grip and driving the butt into his face in one savage thrust pascoe ran to join him but the second guard was already dashing wildly up the steps his voice yelling like a mad mans allday threw up the musket and fired seeing the man hurled round by the force of the ball before falling out of sight they heard his body rolling down a slope in a small avalanche of loose stones and earth come on pascoe ran up the steps and almost charged headlong into a sentry who was trying to let himself through another entrance which was guarded by a stout studded door allday reached out and seized his neck turning him easily and then smashing his head into the door it swung open into a narrow passageway and as more shouts and running feet echoed overhead pascoe said breathlessly bolt the door he held up a lantern this must lead to the powder room its dry enough allday dragged two heavy barrels against the door be easy with the lantern he sniffed ill wager theyre wondering what the hell is happening down here he cocked the second musket boots and muskets hammered on the heavy door and then just as suddenly fell silent pascoe looked at his companion here goes then major leroux handed bolitho a small pocket telescope i doubt if you will be able to see much yet sir bolitho raised himself up on his knees feeling the ache in his limbs and back from the long march overland scattered around the hillside gorse and dried grass he could see the belts and breeches of the marines as they lay gasping for breath in untidy clusters the sky was paler as were the stars there was no doubt about that but horizon and land were still interlocked and only where the shoreline was edged with pale sand could he get a true idea of their position they were on a hillside behind and about level with the headland in the small glass he could see the crude gashes where the ground had been dug into earthworks and pallisades the occasional flicker of light from a single lantern it played on a pair of fat gun breeches probably twentyfour pounders hethought leroux was leaning on his elbows sucking quietly at a round pebble down this steep slope and up the next to the pallisade sir even allowing for there being no other protection at the rear we might lose half our men in a charge he glanced at his weary marines shipboard life takes the wind out of em theyre not infantry or line soldiers somewhere in the distance a dog barked with sudden vigour it was like the beginning of another day bolitho snapped this morning they will have to act like soldiers major we must attack without delay before the trumpet calls the garrison to arms he felt the other officers moving closer to him he kept his gaze directed towards the sea the three dark shapes of the anchored ships perhaps they could silence the battery and then fight their way to some boats all because of that gully and his own blindness he said shortly mr steere you will take what seamen remain with us and head for the beach mr luce will accompany you he nodded to leroux carryon we had best move directly leroux touched his sergeants arm in the gloom the man jumped as if he had been hit by a ball the major said curtly sergeant gritton pass the word fix bayonets check each man when i give the signal the whole line will advance at the trot the marine straightened his hat yes sir he might just as well have been ordered to polish his boots from the little emotion he showed men stirred along the hillside and steel clicked against steel as the bayonets emerged to glint feebly in the dull light bolitho drew his sword and said quietly we will make as much noise as we can it is the best weapon today he swung round as a single shot echoed and reechoed round the hills like a ricochet for a moment he imagined that a picket had sighted his marines or worse still they had been out manoeuvred even as they prepared to mount their attack on the battery nepean called down there sir i saw a flash a man fell i think there were muffled shouts and the single lantern on the battery began to move across the flat ground behind the earthworks as if carried by a spirit leroux muttered its no signal by god there must be a madman at work he added bitterly in heavens name look at the confusion theres no chance of a surprise now bolitho could see even without the majors telescope the surging figures along the battery wall most were very pale as if only partly dressed rudely awakened by that mysterious shot he replied harshly it is our only chance major he lurched to his feet and waved his hat towards the astonished marines are you with me he could feel the madness rising in his throat like bile the fierce pounding against his ribs as if his heart was trying to break free with something like a growl the marines stumbled from their positions and as one and then another pointed his bayoneted musket towards the battery leroux yelled charge down the slope yelling and cheering like wild things the marines soon forgot the order to keep down their speed faster and faster feet kicking over grass and stones the wavering line of bayonets brighter now as a faint glow showed above the headland here and there a man fell only to stagger upright again find his musket and double after his yelling companions bolitho heard a few shots but who was firing and where they went he did not know he knew it was getting harder to maintain the pace and realised they were going up now instead of down he gasped out lively make for the pallisades some louder bangs came from above and he heard a man gurgle and roll away down the slope but several marines had fallen behind and were kneeling to take aim above the heads of the others a ball slammed past bolithos head and he heard a voice scream out with agony from the battery wall leroux was yelling a path sergeant gritton take em up there crack crack crack balls ripped into the pallisade from both sides and as if from a great distance bolitho heard the urgent clamour of a trumpet they had to reach that wall breach it before help came from the camp they had all heard the horses cavalry would disperse the tired marines and destroy them piecemeal he almost fell across a sprawled soldier in a gateway before he was pushed aside by a yelling marine at the head of the leading section his mind reeled but clung to the strange fact that the gate was open the sentry killed up some steps and around a narrow bend where he saw some half dozen spaniards beating against a board door with weapons and fists oblivious it seemed to the onrushing marines one turned then the whole bunch of them scattered from the door fighting each other to climb up and over a partly finished wall whooping like fiends the marines charged amongst them the bayonets lifting and stabbing the awful cries drowned by their own excited madness bolitho shouted stand fast marines to leroux he gasped stop them for gods sake we must get through that door shots banged down from the battery and several marines fell kicking but as others were still hurrying up the steps it seemed likely they would soon be unable to move to escape the hidden marksmen he saw sergeant gritton with a great axe standing framed against the door heard the mighty clang as the blade hacked into the studded timber leroux fired a pistol and handed it to his orderly as a body spilled over the rampart and pitched amongst the yelling marines hell never get it down in time he fired his other pistol and cursed as the ball whimpered harmlessly towards the sky ready lads gritton was almost screaming its openin bolitho thrust himself through the press of men aware that the door was swinging inwards knowing that no axe had done it and that in the next seconds his men might be smashed down by a blast of canister gritton was bawling shoot lads lets be at the bastards then another voice louder even than the sergeants avast there sergeant gritton hold your fire damn you bolitho felt himself being carried bodily through the door on a tide of cursing cheering marines and as they burst into a roughlyhewn passage and fanned out on either side he stared at the two figures who were etched against a solitary lantern leroux gasped one of us shoot that soldier gritton the soldier threw down his musket and as his arms were seized by two marines he called hoarsely its me bolitho pushed the marines aside and gripped the youth around his shoulders i must be dreaming allday shouted then so must we sir leroux was at his side again this is the main magazine sir he stared at pascoes stained face did you i mean were you going to pascoe said huskily we planned to blow the magazine the commandant here knows a ship is nearby he looked at allday the strength suddenly gone out of him and we knew she would be lysander allday nodded his filthy face split into a grin what we didnt know was that wed see the bullocks this fine morning bolitho controlled his reeling thoughts they might still be too late to do anything but it no longer seemed so black so impossible as it had just moments ago major take some men to the battery tell your sharpshooters to fire with care i doubt youll get much opposition theyll not be keen to shoot down here and build their own inferno he looked at pascoe and allday as you were quite prepared to do allday said one thing sir theres a second battery on the outboard end of the point i think this is the only magazine but he broke off as the passageway shook to a sudden explosion there was cheering too and the sporadic clatter of musket fire bolitho nodded that was a gun from the other battery im thinking pascoe made to follow him as he ran after the marines but he said no adam yours has been the lions share of danger remain here with these wounded marines until i know what to do as he hurried along the dimly lighted passageway past great vats of shots barrels of powder and cradles for carrying the massive balls up to the furnace he kept thinking of what had happened pascoe and allday had survived not only that they were here with him though how they had man aged it he could not begin to comprehend if he had been turned back completely by the gully or had arrived at the camp perhaps minutes later they would have blown up the magazine and battery and themselves also he felt the emotion pricking his eyes to make that sacrifice such a reckless gesture without even waiting to see if a ship was actually entering the bay they had known she was lysander it had been enough another great bang brought dust filtering from the beamed roof but he took time to sheath his sword to compose himself as leroux hatless with blood above his eye ran down some steps and shouted lysander is in sight sir the other battery has opened fire on her but this one has struck to us he sighed heavily listen to my lads their huzzas are a reward enough bolitho flinched as another bang echoed around the magazine traverse some of the cannon to point on the other battery there is heated shot i believe leroux led the way up the steps his coat scarlet again in a rectangle of dull light from the sky bolitho felt the salt air across his face and watched the cheering marines as they hurried about the earthworks firing as they went towards the other battery he ignored the hiss of balls which flicked past him and stared fixedly at the high pyramid of canvas which appeared to be rising from the sea itself the seventyfour was moving very slowly into the bay her lower hull still in deeper shadow herrick was coming in just as he had known he would no battery on earth would prevent his attempt to complete the plan of attack nor frighten him from his attempt to rescue the landing party a gun crashed out from the battery and he gritted his teeth as a tall waterspout erupted violently alongside the ships hull too close he snapped hurry your men major tell them that the sea is their only way out attack at dawn course noreast sir the helmsmans voice was hushed very well herrick moved restlessly to the weather side of the quarterdeck and peered towards the land as he turned to look along the upper gun deck he realised he could see some of the crews quite clearly although at first glance it seemed as dark as before he walked aft to where grubb stood near the wheel with plowman his best masters mate there should have been a signal by now mr grubb he ought to have held his silence and kept his anxiety to himself but it seemed endless lysanders slow and careful approach towards the hidden land the nervestretching tension as the men stood to their guns on each deck while others waited at braces and halliards in case he should order a sudden change of tack occasionally from right forward in the chains he heard the leadsmans cry the splash beneath the bows as he made another cast there was no chance of a mistake with the wind holding steady across the larboard quarter the sea depth checking with that shown on the chart plus grubbs vast local knowledge there was no room for doubt the sailing master looked even more shapeless with his arms thrust deep into the folds of his heavy coat mr plowman repeats e saw the landin party safe away sir no challenge nor even a sight of a whisker from the dons he shook his head and added gloomily i agrees with you sir there ought to ave bin a signal long since herrick made himself walk forward again to the foot of the great main mast where fitzclarence was surveying the gun deck below the rail herrick said its damn quiet he tried to imagine what bolitho and the marines were doing hiding captured perhaps already dead fitzclarence turned and looked at him its lighter sir much he raised one arm to point towards the land herrick could see without being told that the nearest wedge of darkness had mellowed and it was possible to see a crescent of sand the lively movement of spray across some scattered rocks lysander was standing very close inshore but the depth was safe at any other time it would have been the perfect approach the ideal conditions which were usually missing when most needed by th mark ten grubb confirmed it by muttering the ead land must be fine on the larboard bow sir he coughed throatily well be able to spit on it within alf an hour below the quarterdeck rail he heard someone give a short laugh the immediate bark from a gun captain to silence him the hands had been at their quarters since last night when they had dropped the boats and he had watched them pull towards the land down there and deeper still on the lower gun deck the waiting seamen were probably whispering their doubts making jokes about their captains caution what would they say if he lost the ship and them with her fitzclarence remarked pity we are out of contact with harebell sir herrick snapped attend to your duties mr fitzclarence it was perhaps only a casual comment or did the lieutenant mean that if he was too nervous to make a decision one way or the other he should signal for the little sloop to make the first move he walked a few paces up the tilting deck feeling the crews of the ninepounders watching him as he went past every gun was loaded and ready behind its closed port the cutlasses and boarding axes had been honed on a grindstone on the main deck it seemed hours ago he saw lieutenant veitch who was in charge of the upper deck battery of eighteenpounders lounging by the hatchway chatting with his two midshipmen perhaps they did not even care they were like he had once been content to leave it to others when the events moved too swiftly for thought it was always too late anyway he shifted his feet and watched the dawn light growing above the land he had been in many sea fights had seen so much and had known the mercy of survival but this sort of work was beyond him high above the deeplyshadowed decks he heard the topsails and forecourse flapping and then filling hungrily to a sudden thrust of wind higher still the topgallant sails were set and drawing well and he thought he saw one of the masthead lookouts kicking his legs to hold back the chill of the damp air he moved across to the opposite side of the deck strangely spacious without the marines he tried to picture each one of the officers throughout his command from fitzclarence with his elaborate guise of complete self confidence to those like lieutenant kipling on the lower gun deck and veitch who was apparently so relaxed with his crews below the bulging canvas with gilchrist ashore and lieutenant steere with him he was shorthanded enough but those who remained were barely moulded into a team as yet and the progress of their gunnery under fire was still to be tested by th mark seventeen he heard himself say bring her up a point mr grubb aye aye sir herrick ignored the sudden scuffle of bare feet as men hurried to trim the yards he had made a small decision there was time yet to change it he thought of the rest of the squadron and mostly of captain farquhar farquhar had his instructions with the other twodecker and buzzard to watch over their flank he would be ready to come to his aid as soon as he received the word when daylight made it possible to contact harebell herrick shook himself with sudden desperation it would all take time too much time bolitho and the landing party had not made their signal as arranged to take lysander into the bay without either support or intelligence from the shore was madness bolitho had made that plain enough course noreast by north sir very well herrick thought of farquhar once again he would love to have him ask for help equally he would despise him if he failed now to make a decision he was flagcaptain how sour the title tasted at this moment he said slowly we will enter the bay mr grubb he looked towards fitzclarences squared shoulders run out the larboard battery if you please as the pipe ran from deck to deck and the port lids were heaved open herrick heard a muffled cheer as squealing like disturbed hogs the lysanders guns were trundled out he tried to compose his thoughts seeing bolithos calm face in his mind fitzclarence reported warily larboard guns run out sir thank you pass the word forrard to the carronades fire only on my command it is always hard to mark a land target he broke off sensing the lieutenants curious stare as you will discover lysander was heeling quite steeply to the press of sail but herrick knew from experience that it was better to hold on to as much agility as possible under these circumstances no ship had ever got the better of a wellsited shore battery it was like trying to kill a flea with a feather he crossed to the weather side and held on to the hammock nettings and watched the surge of white water below some fallen rocks the western headland was slipping abeam and as lysanders jib boom picked up the first thin ray of light like a lance he saw the bay and the solid landmass beyond he snapped alter course two points mr grubb steer nor by east he knew grubb was protesting silently behind him but concentrated on the span and depth of the little bay it might be empty perhaps they had all been wrong from the beginning as the braces were manned again the yards trimmed to hold the wind he made himself walk aft to the compass feeling the eyes of the two helmsmen on him as he checked the course and then turned to examine the set of each sail nor by east sir he nodded good grubb added shes full an bye sir as close auled as she can be herrick was peering up at the great sails noting how they were starting to flap and shiver the yards were braced tight round and the ship must be losing way despite the press of canvas but it would give him the maximum time and room to move deck there musket fire on the larboard bow a pause and then from the foremast lookout ships at anchor sir three on em the sudden crash of a large cannon made more than one man yelp with alarm herrick held his breath counting seconds until with a whine and a loud splash the ball plummeted down well clear of the opposite side let her fall off a point mr grubb herrick listened to the squeak of steering gear the noisy response from the topgallant sails as the lysanders jib boom edged round very slightly towards the outthrust pointer of the other headland bang he was astonished to realise he could now see a pale beach behind the anchored vessels and some running figures like insects without personality bang there was a great chorus of shouts as a ball smashed down hard alongside the bow hurling a curtain of spray over the forecastle plowman remarked good shootin grubb said means they was waitin for us must ave known all along fitzclarence shouted one of the ships shes trying to get under way herrick wiped his forehead he felt frustrated at every turn sickened with the new understanding that even surprise was denied them a brig sir young saxby shouted wildly shes cut her cable herrick saw the flutter of pale canvas as the brig set her foresail and jib the way her outline was shortening as freed from her anchor she started to payoff towards the sea the same wind which carried lysander towards the telltale waterspouts of falling shot would take her to safety he drew his sword and walked briskly to the quarterdeck rail it was a climax of bitterness and worry of concern for bolitho and for his own ability mr veitch as you bear i want that brig held the lieutenant came out of his trance and yelled gun captains on the uproll he crouched behind one of his eighteenpounders peering through the open port fire the whole battery belched fire and smoke in a long ragged salvo as the smoke came funnelling back through the ports and the gun crews threw themselves into action with sponges and rammers herrick saw the sea around the brig pockmarked with great circles of white spray gun trucks squealed as the eighteenpounders were heaved and manhandled up the sloping deck to their ports captain by captain held up his hand and then veitch roared fire again the longdrawnout crash of cannon fire the bright red and orange tongues spitting out from the hull their heavy balls skipping across the water and throwing up great hoods of spray over and around the brig when the smoke had drifted clear herrick saw that the brigs main mast was gone and she seemed to be drifting helplessly out of command her decks in chaos he shouted cease firing mr fitzclarence i want both cutters ready to lower in five minutes he was wiping his eyes as more stinging powdersmoke breezed up over the quarterdeck you take command he gripped the lieutenants arm and swung him towards the nettings that middle vessel is a transport of some sort deep hulled cut her out before they try to scuttle her if you get any resistance stand off and ill rake her as we pass he pushed him towards the ladder and yelled mr veitch shorten sail get the togansls off her grubb peered aloft as a ball slapped through the main topsail like a great metal fist leaving a hole as big as a mans waist he said gawd amighty herrick strode about the deck his mind grappling with one situation to another as the ships angle lessened to the reduced pressure of sails the boarding nets were raised and with a chorus of yells and cheers the two cutters were swayed up and across the gangway men tumbled over the side cutlasses and muskets held high while other hands unlashed the oars and thrust away from the ships fat side more crashes came from the land and one ball shrieked through the weather shrouds and made a seaman drop gasping on to the nets which were spread to protect the guns from falling debris and how quickly the light had filtered and strengthened within the bay herrick turned from watching the two boats thrashing around the counter and realised he could see the hill battery a plume of smoke above it it would soon be time to wear ship he thought beat back across the bay and cover the cuttingout party and their boats bang he turned swiftly as a ball slammed into the lower hull shaking it to the very planks under his shoes under topsails forecourse and jib lysander was making very slow progress and as a target she could not have looked better herrick said harshly we will stand off shortly mr grubb he shut his ears to someone screaming we have done all we can two more balls skipped over the blue water like a pair of darting sharks one whipped between the two cutters narrow ly missing the frantic oar blades the other thudded into lysanders side just below the beakhead he made himself watch the efforts of the two cutters one had already grappled the heavy transport ship the other was exchanging musket fire with darting figures along her poop he must recall the boats also the whole venture was a shambles he turned to midshipman saxby who was standing with the signal party when he heard a man yell with disbelief sir on t other battery sir from the yards and the gun decks men began to cheer and as herrick stared fixedly at the hairline mast above the spanish battery he saw the flag jerking to the top the same one which was streaming from lysanders peak grubb muttered i can see scarlet them bloody bullocks got there after all the rest of the voices were drowned in one tremendous explosion it swelled out and down from the headland hurling rocks and fragments right along the beach and scattering some soldiers who had been trying to approach the battery from there herrick tried to control his grin heaveto mr veitch he nodded sharply yes you promotion comes fast in a ship of war he pointed at the transport the explosion in the remaining battery had finished all resistance and he could see fitzclarences men swarming aboard the spanish flag dipping to confirm the capture the second brig was under way her sails filling as she made all possible speed to escape destruction herrick watched her calmly harebell will catch that one sails awry and thundering lysander came up into the wind no more shots were fired from the land and along the foreshore only the dead and injured remained to mark the extent of the bombardment get more boats lowered herrick gauged the slow drift across the bay we may have to anchor but i want every manjack picked up saxby shouted commodores coming along the beach now sir he was hopping up and down and here come the marines herrick gripped the rail and watched the untidy procession with something like awe he saw lieutenant steere standing up to his waist in water beside a boat which his seamen must have unearthed somewhere the hesitant steps of the wounded being carried aboard the two cutters speeding from the prize ship to help the others grubb ambled to his side itll give the dons somethin to bite on sir herrick nodded one ship sunk a larger one captured and the defences in ruins he stiffened mr saxby give me your glass grubb stared at him what is it might i ask sir herrick handed him the glass and replied quietly the commodore has his nephew with him the master gave a low whistle his coxn too be god he snapped the glass shut i dontreckon i can stand any more miracles in one day herrick walked slowly along the gangway unable to take his eyes from the approaching boat it had been a near thing he had almost not made the decision perhaps grubb was right about miracles he sought out veitchs figure on the quarterdeck stand by to receive the commodore moments later bolitho clambered up and through the entry port his face was grimy with smoke and his elbows were showing through his sleeves but he was smiling in a way which herrick had almost forgotten bolitho said that was a fine piece of timing thomas i almost obeyed your orders sir herrick grinned awkwardly then i remembered what you would have done in my place bolitho threw back his head and took several deep breaths it had been very close lerouxs men had fired three heated balls into the other battery and he had thought they might surrender but they had been urged on and rallied again and again by a slim fanatical officer allday had said he was the camps commandant the spaniard had also managed to keep up an accurate bombardment with his seaward cannon and at least two balls had hit lysander maybe more then as the ship had seemed about to tack away from the merciless cannon fire one of lerouxs heated shots had ploughed into the batterys powder store it had ended there and he had seen the spanish captain torn apart in the blast his sword still waving in the air he turned and watched as pascoe limped through the port accompanied by cheers and laughter as some of the gun crews clustered round to slap his shoulders or point at his wine stained uniform herrick shook his head and i doubted if we could do it sir bolitho eyed him sadly with men like these i could do just about anything thomas allday walked past his bare feet held painfully away from ringbolts and gun tackles bolitho unbuckled his tarnished sword and handed it to him here allday ill be down directly allday looked at him the strain coming back to his face aye sir bolitho added quietly ill take it amiss if the level in my decanters is still high when i examine them he watched him fondly im grateful for your safety herrick waited until allday had vanished through the cabin hatch before saying it is the first time i have known him robbed of a reply sir bolitho watched the marines climbing or being hauled bodily through the port the looks of bewilderment pain and sheer pleasure at being safe and alive he could feel his own wildness ebbing away and imagined what it had been like for pascoe and allday he shook himself from his thoughts well captain herrick get the boats secured and signal our prize to upanchor and take station to leerd he clapped him lightly on the shoulder his smile returning we will rejoin the squadron directly bolitho waited in silence until herrick had completed his examination of the chart through the stern windows he could see the captured spanish transport wallowing heavily in lysanders wake and wondered for the hundredth time at his decision not to send her to gibraltar as another prize herrick straightened his back and looked at him j agree sir according to our calculations we are standing into the channel between spain and the island of ibiza mr grubb assures me that capesan antonio is some twentyfive miles off the larboard beam bolitho leaned across the chart and studied the scattered bearings and soundings along the spanish coastline two days since herrick had sailed into the bay to rescue them before ordering inchs harebell in hot pursuit of the remaining brig either the brig was faster than she had appeared or inch had lost his sense of direction the latter was more than likely he decided herrick said bluntly i can discover no reason why we have not met with the squadron sir his eyes remained steady as he added captain farquhar knew very well that we might need support bolitho walked to the stern windows and watched the spanish ships foresail billowing in the uncertain wind she was a strange catch filled to the deck seams with powder and shot with fodder for horses and mules and enough tents to shelter an army she remained a mystery she was named segura and once clear of the land he had sent for her master a squat furtive looking man who had been openly dumbfounded by bolitho producing a letter which javals men had brought from the captured schooner the spanish master had insisted in halting english that he did not know his ultimate destination indeed there was nothing in his quarters to prove otherwise and unless he had hurled his orders overboard at the first sign of danger he was as much in the dark as his captors he did not seem like a clever liar he had admitted that he had been told to take his cargo to a rendezvous in the gulf of valencia where he could expect an escort and maybe other merchant vessels under charter for the military he had pleaded that he was a poor sailor who had no wish to become involved in war the spanish commandant who had been in charge of loading his vessel had given him instructions which would place him under french control there were many vessels the master had said which the french were using throughout the mediterranean to support their newlyfounded outposts should he ignore this unexpected catch if some sort of rendezvous did lie ahead it would be better to reform the squadron before making a new intrusion into enemy waters but farquhar was not here there was little variation in wind nothing in fact which should have prevented the other ships from making contact he said slowly perhaps captain farquhar was involved with the enemy perhaps herrick sounded doubtful but the fact remains sir harebell has not returned with or without a prize and we are alone very much so bolitho nodded true i think we will maintain the present course farquhar may decide for reasons of his own to rejoin us closer to our final destination he ran his fingers over the chart and the area marked golfe du lion the french are stirring up an ants nest thomas they have more in mind than invading england i think he moved his hand to the shores of africa i am certain it will be here he thought suddenly of the vivid flash above the ramparts as lerouxs men had fired a glowing ball into the spanish powder store in this short while how his men had changed they had rarely hesitated and he had been moved by their efforts even when the attack had seemed hopeless the news must have reached higher authority by now even as far ahead as france if the squadron was feeling its way so too the enemy must be wondering at its intentions he walked aft yet again and stared at the prize ship lieutenant fitzclarence was in command no doubt relishing his unexpected promotion herrick said if harebell doesnt return within a day i fear we must assume her lost he rubbed his chin and thatll mean we will be without eyes he added with sudden bitterness damn that javal ill wager hes away after some fat capture to line his pockets bolitho watched him thoughtfully that is as may he or perhaps the whole squadron is destroyed he touched his arm and smiled that was a joke thomas but do not imagine i am untroubled he turned as a tap came at the screen door it was pascoe a stranger almost in his proper uniform you sent for me sir yes bolitho gestured to a chair have you had any more time to think about your ordeal he saw the youths dark eyes go distant and added it could be important adam pascoe stretched his legs i had the impression that the spaniards are so willing to aid their ally that they will do anything but fight they were using galley slaves felons anyone who could lift and carry to build defences and prepare ways of loading all manner of vessels bolitho looked at them and smiled with the earl of st vincents ships watching cadiz and the biscay ports i think it unlikely that all this is for england s benefit he nodded firmly this is what i intend on to toulon and the smaller french ports close by where with luck we shall meet with our other ships then southeast to sicily where we can water our vessels and make discreet enquiries his smile broadened as he watched herricks doubt i know thomas the kingdom of the two sicilies is at peace with france it does not follow it is at war with us eh he looked at the open skylight as he heard the lookouts hail deck there sail on the larboard bow herrick stood up if you will excuse me sir he gave a shy grin though i fancy you still find it hard not to run on deck with the rest of us bolitho waited for him to leave and then said and you adam how are all the aches and pains pascoe grinned i never knew a body had room for so many bruises feet padded overhead and bolitho could picture the midshipman of the watch being chased to the shrouds with the biggest telescope available harebell was obviously alone no matter onemore prize might have helped their esteem with the admiral it would not have been worth risking their only sloop pascoe asked quietly i would wish to ask something sir bolitho faced him seeing the determination a touch of anxiety youve earned the right to ask as you will pascoe did not return his smile the lady uncle catherine pareja the one yqu he faltered you knew in london well he waited what of her i was wondering did you take her home i mean to your house in falmouth bolitho shook his head slowly seeing her face feeling her warmth her need of him no adam not to falmouth pascoe licked his lips i did not mean to pry it is all right bolitho crossed the cheque red deck and gripped his shoulder it is important to you i can see that but my feelings mean a lot to me too pascoe tossed the hair from his eyes of course he smiled i understand he hesitated again i liked her which was why i bolitho eyed him gravely which is why you crossed swords for my name yes bolitho walked to his desk and took out the broken sword take this it was a comfort to me when everyone else thought you were dead he saw him holding it as if it was redhot but save it for the enemy not for those who try to hurt you with words he looked round as feet clattered down a companion ladder and seconds later luce who was apparently midshipman of the watch hurried into the cabin and reported captain herricks respects sir it is harebell in sight and she will be in signalling distance within the halfhour his eyes flickered towards pascoe no other sail in sight sir thank you mr luce bolitho compared the pair of them pascoe was a year older than luce if that he was glad they had each others friendship in the teeming and often heartless world of a ship of the line my compliments to the captain he needed to go on deck up to the foretop if necessary despite his hatred of heights to see what was wrong with inch and his overdue sloop he sighed it was quite useless while his own broad pendant remained above this or any ship he was bound to stay immovable to keep his energies for decisions beyond shiphandling the others were watching him and pascoe asked may i go with mr luce of course he watched them leave nothing changed he had just completed writing his notes on the raid when herrick came to the cabin again his face relaxed into a smile harebell has signalled sir two sail to the norwest if i wronged captain farquhar then this is the moment to admit it bolitho moved quickly to the chart recalling the change of wind the feel of sand and dust on his cheek as he had listened wretchedly to the cornish marines news about the impassable gully he said admit nothing thomas not even farquhar could drive his ships that fast to get them to the norwest of us he snatched up his hat inch must have lost his brig but by god hes brought bigger fish to us today herrick hurried after him his face working with fresh doubt and apprehension it was very bright on the quarterdeck and the sun was almost directly above the main yard bolitho nodded to veitch who had the watch and then strode to the weather side his eyes reaching out beyond the forecastle to the glittering horizon and its attendant haze herrick yelled make to harebell investigate keep station to lee rd bunting slipped and slithered in colourful confusion across the deck until to luce s satisfaction it was properly bent on to the halliards and was soon breaking to the wind harebells acknowledged sir herrick said sourly should damn well think so francis inch always was too quick off the mark he grinned despite his anxiety the idiot minutes dragged by and groups of seamen who moments earlier had thought of nothing but their midday meal poor though it was were thronging to shrouds and gangways to stare towards the sloops small outline luce had swarmed halfway up the weather shrouds and had his glass steadied against the ships easy plunge and roll below him pascoe was looking up his eyes slitted against the fierce glare hands on his hips remembering perhaps bolitho thought when he had been a signals midshipman grubb said mournfully if theyre to be two more prizes well be ard put for trained ands to manage this ship luces cry brought sudden silence to the quarterdeck gossip from harebell sir enemy in sight bolitho walked slowly to the cabin hatch and leaned against the handrail in his mind he could already see them beating down the coast towards him he had seen them long before the sloops confirmation perhaps when luce had come to the cabin he said signal inch to close on the segura he waited seeing their mingled expressions of doubt and excitement when he draws nearer you can signal him to keep the prize under his lee well not lose her if we can help it herrick asked flatly and us sir luce called again from harebell sir two sail of the line us thomas herrick moved closer shutting out the watching officers nearby will we take on the pair of them bolitho pointed slowly along the bare horizon unless you can see anyone else thomas gilchrist came hurrying aft his feet tapping in his strange bouncing gait he looked straight at herrick orders sir bolitho said calmly beat t quarters mr gilchrist and i want the ship cleared for action in ten minutes gilchrist strode away his long arms beckoning urgently to the marine drummer boys bolitho turned to herrick again and get the tgallants on her thomas i want the enemy to see how eager we are he held him back adding softly no matter how we feel eh he walked to the poop ladder and started to climb at his back he heard the staccato beat of drums and the immediate stampede of hurrying men as lysanders company answered the call bolitho leaned on the poop rail and shaded his eyes to watch the sloops outline changing yet again as she heeled on another tack trying to fight her way across the wind to rejoin her flagship soon now the enemy would show his face bolitho examined his own feelings it was his first sea action since last year he watched the haze around harebells masts remembering the other times was that why he had ordered more canvas to be set to get it over with if only to discover his own strength or weakness below decks he heard the screens being torn down the clatter of gear being dragged free of guns and hatchways from the age of twelve he had been a part of this life shared it endured all it could offer and threaten he looked at the men darting around their guns on the upper deck the marines marching stolidly along either side of the poop as if on a routine parade now he was the commodore he smiled grimly but without a squadron one company cleared for action sir gilchrists face was inscrutable nine minutes exactly bolitho did not hear herricks reply and walked unhurriedly to the weather side of the deck with her great mainsail brailed up and every visible gun manned and ready the ship had taken on an air of tension and of menace herrick came towards him and touched his hat apart from seven sick or injured men sir the ships company is at quarters he watched him enquiringly shall i pass the order to load and run out later bolitho took a telescope from its rack and trained it towards the larboard bow the seas face glittered painfully in the glare like a million tiny mirrors more silver than blue he stiffened as first one and then the other of the ships swam across his lens herrick was still watching his face searching for something their fate perhaps bolitho said seventyfours at a guess this wind is making it heavy going for them he held the glass on the leading ship she was turning away displaying her length the twin lines of chequered gunports her sails were in disarray he could see them crisscrossing with shadows as her master tried to hold the wind until he had completed his change of course he said she handles badly thomas he bit his lip trying to picture his own ship from the enemys viewpoint it would take an hour before they were at grips to have a chance against two powerful seventyfours he must hold on to the windgage at least until he could rake one or pass between the pair of them he added slowly too long in port maybe like us they need all the drill they can manage bolitho watched harebells slender hull passing across the bows on a converging tack her officers steeply angled on the small quarterdeck he thought he saw inch waving his hat but forgot him as luces men hoisted the signal for harebell to take up her new station as a mere spectator at worst a survivor who would carry the news to the admiral or farquhar he walked to the gangway and ran his eyes along the upper deck the worst part the waiting it was a pity only half the company had found time to eat before the call to quarters he asked do we have any beer left thomas herrick nodded i believe so though i doubt that the purser will be pleased to broach it at this moment but he will not be fighting bolitho saw his remark rippling along the nearest group of gun crews pass the word for it to he issued directly he turned away it was a cheap way of raising their morale but it was all he had he returned to the quarterdeck and stood with one foot balanced on a ninepounder its captain peered up at him and knuckled his forehead bolitho smiled at him the man was old or looked it his hard hands covered with tar his arms entwined with fierce bluecoloured tattoos he asked and who are you the man showed his uneven teeth mariot sir he hesitated doubtful at prolonging a conversation with his commodore then he said served with your father sir in the old scylla bolitho stared at him he wondered if mariot would ever have told him had he been on another gun in some other part of the ship he asked were you there when they took off his arm mariot nodded his faded eyes far away aye sir he were a fine man i served none better he grinned awkwardly savin your presence sir herrick stopped beside him his face questioning bolitho said this man served with my father thomas he shaded his eyes to look for the enemy what a small world is bound up in a navy herrick nodded and asked mariot how old are you the man shook his head i cant rightly recall sir he patted the guns breech but young enough for this little lady bolitho walked slowly back and forth across the deck his ears deaf to the cheerful shouts which were welcoming the first of the beer all in one company a man who had been with his father in india allday his trusted coxswain and friend who had first been brought to him by a pressgang herrick once a junior lieutenant under him and adam pascoe his brothers only son perhaps the link between all of them herrick was saying they may be handled poorly sir but id be happier if we had had some support even a frigate to snap at their damned backsides bolitho paused at the nettings realising that he was soaked in sweat lysander fought and defeated the athenian fleet nearly four hundred years before our lord was born he captured athens a year later if my old tutor was to be believed he smiled at herrick surely he will not let us down today he added in a quieter tone be easy thomas your people are watching you show one sign of doubt and we may well be done for herrick linked his hands behind him his chin on his neckcloth aye im sorry it is strange how you never get used to the one thing youve worked and trained for the sight of an enemys sail the sound of his broadside keep going until hes struck or gone under he added with unusual bitterness those fancy people in england who go all weepy at the sight of a kings ship working out of harbour never spare a thought for the poor devils who have to man em who die every day just to keep them in comfort and safety bolitho watched him impassively it was easier to see the old herrick now quick to speak out for the underdog no matter how much wrath he incurred from his superiors which was probably why he was still a junior postcaptain he asked and your sister thomas how is she keeping herrick brought his thoughts under control emily he looked away she is missing our mother no doubt although she took some lookingafter towards the end bolitho nodded and you have hired someone to take care of emily while you are at sea herrick faced him his eyes staring into the sun may i ask sir are you coming to the matter of mr gilchrist i had heard something thomas he was surprised at herricks tone his readiness to defend an understanding herricks eyes were almost colourless in the glare emily is taken with him he is a reliable officer if hastytempered at times he lowered his head and what he has he has earned sir like you thomas indeed herrick sighed and i care very much for what emily wants god knows she has had precious little in this world deck there gilchrist was striding across the deck his hands cupped what is it leadin ship is makin more sail herrick snatched a telescope and hurried to the rail damn their eyes they will try to divide our defences bolitho watched him seeing his mind at work with how best to present his ship to the enemy yet still holding on to what they had been saying gilchrist said sharply theyll not get too near sir theyll more likely use chainshot or langridge to try and cripple us then rake our stern at leisure and at little risk bolitho said make a signal to harebell we will alter course steer soueast herrick asked huskily is it wise sir theres less than a league between us if we hold on as we are we might be able to out sail them with the wind in our favour itd be hours before the frogs could beat round and come after us bolitho took the glass from him and trained it on the two ships they were moving wide apart towards lysanders larboard bow they were having a hard time to stay so closehauled and turning any more towards the wind would put them all aback less than three miles herrick had always been good at estimating distance lysander would touch the leading twodecker bow to bow almost at right angles and then the second frenchman would act as he saw fit go to larboard and present a broadside as lysander fought herself free from the first embrace or luff and work round under their stem while they were actually engaging the other one herricks plan gave them and the prize an excellent chance of escaping both it also meant running away with a real possibility of a long sternchase until they met up with another enemy force he cursed farquhar silently with three ships facing them the enemy would soon change their tactics he walked aft feeling grubbs eyes on him as he checked the compass northeast by north with the friendly west wind holding across the quarterhe looked at grubbs ruined features well will it hold dvou think the wind sir he wiped his watery eye aye he nodded his head towards the nearest gun crews and beyond to the upper deck its them i aint so sure of gilchrist was striding past and halted on the other side of the wheel his voice scornful really mr grubb if we are to weep before we fight i see no hope for anyone grubb stared at him stubbornly you was in this ship at st vincent sir like me an some of the others yes gilchrist had a way of speaking to grubb but projecting his words to bolitho im proud of it grubb shrugged they was a trained company capn dyke ad ad this ship in more scrapes than i can shake a stick at he turned to bolitho you knows sir he did not actually look at gilchrist bettern anyone if im a judge bolitho walked forward to the rail deep in thought have harebell and the prize acknowledged gilchrist followed him his shoes tapping aye sir then tell me im not a damned magician he calmed himself execute the signal he looked at grubbs reddened face lay her on the starboard tack men rushed to the braces the afterguards boots keeping perfect time as they hauled the mizzen yards round letting the sails empty and then billow out again tilting the ship on an opposite tack bolitho raised his glass his legs straddled as the deck dipped under him he found he could shut out the bellowed orders the flap and thunder of sails overhead and hold on to the small silent world in the lens he saw a darker shadow pass across the leading ships foresail she was edging slightly away feeling a new strength as she allowed the wind to move a few points further abafther beam course sou east sir gilchrist snapped mr luce what of the others luce was equally sharp in his reply well aware of the tension between his superiors harebell and prize on station astern sir bolitho pursed his lips and watched his two enemies they were getting larger every minute and he could see the bright tricolours at their peaks the flash of sunlight on raised telescopes or weapons they would have seen the commodores broad pendant a valuable capture a suitable ending to this impudent gesture herrick was beside him theyre both falling off a few points our change of course has aided them they could take the windgage from us if we overreach them which is why we must make certain they dont he pointed his arm at the other ships i have given them more wind as you say thomas if we continue on this tack we will be abeam of the leading frenchman in a halfhour his consort may then try to rake our disengaged side however he saw major leroux turn slightly and smile at him what they will not be able to do is steer upwind with us so near they would be in irons herrick was unimpressed i know but now they donthave to worry about that sir bolitho looked at him consult with the master and your first lieutenant in ten minutes i intend that we shall wear ship he saw an unspoken protest on herricks face but continued we will then lay her on the same tack as earlier and steer noreast he watched the slow understanding moving over his features like sunlight through departing cloud herrick said slowly by god well either collide with one of em or or we shall pass between them they cannot luff without risking damage to spars and canvas if they turn and run downwind we will rake their sterns if they stay as they are we will engage from either battery as we sail through he held on to herricks stare after that your guess is as good as mine he added now attend to it im going to speak with the people he strode to the quarterdeck rail and waited until most of the seamen were peering aft towards him he saw lieutenant veitch arms relaxed standing with his back to the enemy his hanger already unsheathed and glinting near him two midshipmen and a gunners mate all part of the pattern the redcoated marine at each hatch ready to stop any terrified man from fleeing below and along either side half hidden by the gangways which joined forecastle to quarterdeck were the men who would see the enemy through the ports would keep their heads no matter what or go under bolitho said up yonder lads are two fine french gentlemen he saw the stiff grins of the older men the nervous twisting of heads of the others turning as if they expected to see the enemy right here on board for most of you this is the first time while you serve your country it will not be the last a few days ago you did well a prize taken another ship sunk by these eighteenpounders he pictured two similar lines of men on the deck below waiting in almost complete darkness for the ports to open and run out the massive thirtytwo pounders they would be trying to hear what he was saying the word being carried by ships boys and midshipmen and probably distorted along the way but this is no brig lads nor a newlybuilt shore battery he saw the words reaching them two ships of the line and fine vessels they are he heard grubb whisper anytime now sir bolitho looked along the crowded deck well sanded to save the men from slipping in battle but they have a fault nonetheless they are crewed by frenchmen not englishmen he turned aft seeing the men waving and cheering the grins on the faces of the midshipmen as if they were going on a royal cruise he felt sickened with himself angry that he could make it sound so simple he said sharply pass the order to load if you please then run out the larboard guns he saw a flash of doubt and added yes the larboard ones they must be made to think w im here sir he raised his arms and allowed allday to buckle on his sword allday was no better he was doing this deliberately letting the seamen and marines see how calm they were he looked at him and said softly we are a fine pair allday gave a secret smile at least we are a pair again sir he stared towards the enemy his eyes calm itll not be easy he watched the ship with professional interest still i dontsuppose theyre looking forward to it either run out the pipe was repeated to the deck below and hesitantly at first as if testing the quality of the air the lysanders larboard guns trundled into the sunlight like black teeth frenchies are running out too sir good bolitho pulled out his watch and flicked open the guard it was warm from resting against his thigh he snapped it shut within a short time it could be as cold as its owner a dull bang echoed across the choppy strip of water and seconds later a thin spout of spray burst up alongside it brought a baying growl of anger from lysanders gun crews but bolitho heard veitch yell be ready starboard guns prepare to run out he squinted at the quarterdeck and saw herrick nod both sides will engage independently a youth at one of the ninepounders whispered something and mariot the old gun captain replied e means separate see he saw bolithos brief smile and added wern ready for th buggers sir he moved inboard from his gun paying out the trigger line as he went just like we done in th old scylla pascoe called the enemy are shortening sail bolitho nodded watching the leading frenchman s topgallant sails vanishing as if by magic preparing to meet lysanders challenge if they continued on this converging course either of the french captains would be well placed for the first broadsides he looked at herrick beyond him gilchrist was poised by the rail his speaking trumpet already raised bolitho said very well this is the time captain herrick he held his gaze put up your helm and lets be amongst them gilchrist yelled braces there he was weaving from side to side his voice like metal as he urged the seamen to greater efforts heave heave bolitho gripped the poop ladder and felt the ship shuddering every stay and shroud humming with strain as the great yards started to creak round he heard the helmsmen panting with exertion as they threw their weight on the spokes hauling the wheel over and further still veitch was shouting above the thunder of billowing canvas starboard battery run out bolitho looked aloft at his pendant willing it to hold direction whileall around him seamen and marines were rushing to obey the demands from their officers and bosuns mates he lowered his head and watched the leading french ship was it imagination he held his breath and then as the deck under his shoes began to heave over the opposite way he saw the french ship gathering speed swinging past lysanders bowsprit and flapping jib as if caught in a tiderace older steady grubb sounded fierce nother man on th wheel ere the yards ceased their creaking and steadied on the larboard tack the topsails hardbellied again thrusting the ship over until spray sluiced above the lower line of port lids where the gun captains were already shouting their readiness to fire herrick tugged at his hat as the wind blew more spindrift over the hammock nettings and across the smooth planks between the guns it dried almost as soon as it had fallen like summer rain bolitho thought course noreast sir steady as you go bolitho raised his glass feeling the wind whipping at his coat as he trained it on the enemy his sudden alteration of course had caught the two french captains by surprise he saw the leading ships ornate stem slipping past lysanders starboard bow the gap widening more and more until he could see the second seventyfours jib boom pushing through the left side of his lens a ripple of orange tongues darted from the leading frenchmans hull and he heard some of the balls hissing overhead the sharp crack of a stay parting somewhere in their path he strode across the deck and seized herricks arm the fool fired too soon he gestured towards the waiting seamen starboard batterv thomas give him a broadside with luck therell be time to reload before we cut across his stem herrick waved his arm as you bear the earsplitting roar of the broadside the great spouting bank of choking smoke as it was blown towards the enemy made several of the marines loose off their muskets they had no hope of finding a target and sergeant gritton bellowed punishment for the next bugger to fire without orders bolitho stood on a bollard to peer above the hammock nettings his eyes smarting in smoke as he watched for some sign of damage the enemys sails were pockmarked with shot holes and he saw a gap in the boat tier an upended launch split in halves but the tricolour was still there and the ship was holding direction as before he heard his men cheering and whooping and snapped reload i want three rounds every two minutes he saw gilchrist staring at him gunnery is all we have now there was a ragged crash of cannon fire from larboard and he realised that the second frenchman was trying to hit lysander with his forward guns the only ones which would bear veitch was yelling larboard battery his hanger glittered above his head as you bear lads bolitho saw one of the midshipmen scuttling to the hatch to pass the order the hanger cut downwards fire once more the ship shook and bucked violently as both gun decks erupted in a slow and regular broadside men were already hurling themselves on the tackles and handspikes reaching blindly for charges and fresh shot many of them retching as smoke funnelled downwind to hide the deck from view veitch shouted wildly faster come on number three sponge out bolitho wiped his streaming face his mouth like dust as he watched the frenchmans foresail flapping in all directions like a torn sheet the long black scars along the enemys forecastle where some of the broadside had gone home the leading french ship was still on the same course her captain probably unwilling to expose his stern until the last moment or hoping his consort might produce some kind of miracle herrick said all loaded and run out again his face was streaked with grime less than two minutes by my reckoning fire the starboard guns hurled themselves inboard on the tackles the orangetinged smoke rolling downwind towards the frenchman which now appeared to lie diagonally across the starboard bow bolitho gritted his teeth seeing lysanders drifting smoke light up again to the enemys immediate reply the deck jerked under him and he saw men duck as the balls shrieked low over the quarterdeck some dropping in the sea almost a mile away bolitho shouted now thomas pass the word to the carronade crews forrard herrick nodded his face a stiff mask as more shots crashed into the side or sliced between the sails bolitho strode down the deck to the lee side seeing the leading french ships stern rising like a golden horseshoe above the eddying smoke lysanders forecastle was already passing through the gap between them he winced in spite of his warning as a carronade blasted out its great grape packed ball with an accompaniment of veitchs foremost eighteen pounders as they came to bear on the enemys most vulnerable point veitch was almost screaming stop your vents sponge out load the thunder of cannon fire the squeal and rumble of guns being run out the endless mad chorus of yells and cheers seemed to be reaching out from another world or from the depths of hell severed rigging twisted like snakes on the protective nets across the upper deck and as the gun crews stooped and heaved their naked bodies running with sweat and powder they looked like the servants and not the masters of their bellowing black charges fire bolitho heard a man scream saw a body bounce down from the main top before pitching over the side more shots slammed through the smoke but he heard grubb exclaim hoarsely the old smasher as done it sir he took off his crumpled hat and waved it over his head must ave got er rudder bolitho watched narrowly realising that although lysander had sailed through the gap the leading frenchmans stem was still pointing straight at him the murderous charge of grape from the carronade accompanied by the forward guns which by their harsher bark suggested they had been doubleshotted for the purpose must have ripped through the stern and disabled the steering she was falling downwind swinging her stem round and he saw that her once ornate gallery was in ruins her poop pitted and splintered from the onslaught as he watched he saw her mizzen stagger held upright by stays and shrouds a while longer and then begin to fall tiny figures were sliding down from the mizzen top others ran like mad things to escape the great plunging mass of rigging and spars as with a crash audible even above the thunder of guns it swayed down into the smoke the bright flapping tricolour with it t other one is tryin to follow us round sir grubbs eyes were streaming ell take our wind bolitho pointed towards the second ship mr gilchrist prepare the larboard carronade he saw the other ships jib boom thrusting through the smoke like a black lance the tiny pin pricks of musket fire from her beak head and foretop with her yards hardbraced and the wheel over she was struggling round to starboard presenting more and more of her scarred side as the range shortened rapidly the larboard carronade slammed back on its slide the ball exploding in a whirling mass of splinters and broken rigging directly abaft the enemys beakhead herrick yelled by god his fore is coming down as the enemys foremast started to totter drunkenly towards the sea his broadside rippled along his exposed side a few of the gun ports remaining silent as a mark of veitchs earlier success but bolitho knew it was the most carefully prepared attack so far the deck bounded repeatedly and from below he heard a metallic clang and a great chorus of shrill screams the french marksmen were still firing too and as he paced restlessly about the deck bolitho saw thin splinters flying from the planking as a sharpshooter tried to hit lysander s officers a sharper bang came down from the pockmarked sails which now seemed to be towering above the nettings like a cliff and a second later the after end of the quarterdeck was filled with kicking screaming men the french had a swivel gun in the top and the canister fired at close range was evidence enough of the enemy captains anxiety herrick shouted the frogs out of control shes swing ing towards us he peered through the smoke mr grubb put up your helm but the master was coughing and cursing through the smoke dragging corpses and wounded alike from the wheel or what was left of it the whole charge of canister had struck the wheel like a target and had scythed away in all directions marking deck and guns men and fragments in a great pattern of blood more men ran dazedly to grubbs aid hauling at the remaining spokes their eyes squinting as if fearful of the mutilated bodies around them bolitho said harshly its too late the enemys bowsprit the great dragging mass of severed mast and yards was directly across lysander s bows the enemy was still firing as were his own men at the most forward positions the range was down to about thirty feet balls whimpered overhead or thudded into the hull with great hammerblows one burst through a port and ploughed into a gun crew which was sponging out for the next shot the eighteenpounder freed from its tackles careered across the tilting deck its trucks making little bloody lines as it thrust through the remains of its crew harry yeo the boatswain was bawling for his men to get the gun under control brandishing a boarding axe like some primitive warrior bolitho looked at herrick we will ram her he sought out gilchrist get the topsls off her he felt a musket ball zip past him we must fight free before the other frenchman recovers herrick nodded jerkily mr gilchrist pass the word repel boarders bolitho heard more cries and then lerouxs voice kill those marksmen in the main top he said urgently no thomas we must board her theyll cut our people to fragments he seized the rail as with a great groaning crunch lysanders jib boom smashed through the enemys beak head the impetus carried both ships in a slow embrace the guns falling silent and giving way to the sharper cracks of musketry bolitho drew his sword work the ship clear thomas he wanted to reassure him in some way and saw the uncertainty on herricks grimy face giving way to something worse as he replied let someone else go sir a great chorus of shouts and yells came from forward and through the dangling remains of rigging and drifting smoke bolitho saw men already trying to swarm down along the bowsprit he snapped theres no time then he ran along the starboard gangway pointing down at every other gun on the disengaged side shouting at their crews to follow when he reached the forecastle there were already a dozen or more corpses lying amidst the fighting seamen from both sides cutlasses rang against each other and from the shrouds and the forechains of both ships the marksmen kept up a haphazard fire to add to the chaos bolitho shouted carronade he thrust a wounded man aside and hacked a french petty officer across the neck feeling the blow lance up his arm and bring a stab of fire to his wounded shoulder a wildeyed marine seemed to understand what he wanted and threw himself on the carronades tackles while midshipman luce and some more seamen came running to his aid fire the carronades explosion made most of the boarders fall back in momentary confusion when they peered at their own ship and saw the bloody remains of the men who had been about to swarm on to lysanders decks they decided to retreat bolitho yelled boarders away lads he waved his sword feeling his hat plucked from his head by a pistol ball from somewhere and then he was leaping and half falling down on to the enemys shattered beakhead when he stared back to see how many of his were following he found himself looking into the eyes of lysanders massive unsmiling figurehead and he felt the insane grin coming to his lips the uncontrollable wildness which forced him on through upended ladders and broken spars gaping corpses and great coils of fallen rigging steel to steel the men swaying back and forth locked together feet stamping teeth bared in curses and fear as they hacked and slashed their way aft along the forecastle deck from one corner of his eye bolitho saw his flagship nudging firmly through the enemys torn shrouds the smoky scarlet of lerouxs marines as they maintained a murderous fire on the frenchmans upper deck from the direction of the drifting smoke he knew that both ships were standing downwind the darkened water between the arrowhead of their embrace littered with splintered wood and a few bobbing corpses sunlight lanced through the smoke and he saw the gap widening herrick had succeeded in easing lysanders bulky hull round to a point where she could use sails and rudder to work clear he saw a man darting towards him an upraised pistol aimed at his chest in those split seconds he shared the moment with the unknown french sailor he had a thin dark face teeth bared in frantic concentration as he took aim bolitho was too far away to reach him with his sword and his arm ached so much from fighting his way through the yelling press of men that he felt he could not raise it even to defend himself the blade of a heavy cutlass cut downwards across his vision so fast that it made an arc of silver in the hazy sunlight the french sailor gave a shrill scream and lurched away staring with agonised horror at the pistol still gripped with his own hand on the far side of the deck allday ran to bolithos side the cutlass edge red against his coat a moment sir he ducked under two fallen spars and hacked the wounded man across the neck felling him with no more than a sob he said between gasps bettern letting him live with one hand bolitho shouted fall back lads a few more minutes and they could take the french ship he knew it just as he knew that the other seventyfour was probably working round again to pour a broadside into lysander before she was able to return the fire fall back the cry ran along the bloodied decks and mingled with the cheers of lerouxs marines some of whom were squatting in lysanders beakhead picking off their enemy like wildfowlers in a marsh many hands reached out to haul the boarders back into lysanders protection as with a splintering jerking symphony she tore free from her opponents fallen spars and shrouds and swung heavily downwind the lower gun deck erupted in one more savage broadside the thirtytwo pounders smashing into the enemys side and making the holed and battered timbers shine with tiny tendrils of blood which ran freely from her scuppers pascoe yelled huzza huzza for the commodore bolitho strode aft taking his hat from a grinning pigtailed seaman who had somehow managed to retrieve it from the vicious fighting herrick greeted him hoarsely his eyes moving over him as if anticipating some terrible wound bolitho asked where is the other one herrick pointed vaguely over the larboard quarter standing off sir i thought she would bolitho looked from foremast to quarterdeck the fore topgallant mast had gone and several guns lay upended there were plenty of shot holes along the upper deck and the busy thuds of hammers the dismal clank of pumps told him that there was damage enough below the waterline also he said get the ship under way he saw pascoe kneeling beside a dying marine holding his hand and watching his face losing its understanding and recognition grubb peering at his compass and his new helmsmen staring fixedly at the flapping sails and waiting for them to respond their bare feet slipping on blood the marines falling back from the hammock nettings checking their muskets their faces dull now that the fight had gone out of them midshipman luce using one of his flags to staunch the terrible wound in a mans thigh the wounded seaman peering up at him repeating like a prayer promise youll not send me to the orlop mr luce but like ghouls their aprons scarlet the surgeons assistants came for him carrying him bodily down to the horrors of the orlop deck bolitho saw it all and more like so many that seaman who had faced the terrible demands of battle was unable to accept the horrors of a surgeons knife grubb muttered shes answerin sir steer noreast bolitho looked up as the wind explored the holed sails and signal harebell to stay in close company he wondered briefly how inch had felt as an impotent spectator herrick came aft and touched his hat we beat em sir bolitho looked at him it was no victory thomas he listened to a man sobbing from the deck below the rail like a young boy a child with all defences gone he added quietly but it has shown all of us what we can do he nodded to leroux as he walked past with his sergeant and next time we will do that bit better he walked to the poop ladder and paused halfway up it to look for the enemy ships with missing masts and spars and their attendant snares of trailing rigging they made a sorry sight lysanders company had done well in their first battle together but to attempt more even though he had been tempted would have invited disaster allday climbed up beside him it feels strange sir bolitho looked at him allday was quite right before they had been kept too busy after a sea fight to brood or to find pain in misgivings he saw herrick the captain the man who really counted just now allday sighed they did proudly all the same theres a different air in the ship bolitho walked slowly aft to the taffrail letting the wind explore his stained clothes and aching limbs like a tonic harebell was tacking across the larboard quarter very clean and bright in the glare he pulled out his watch the whole battle had taken less than two hours some corpses drifted astern palefaced in the clear water and he guessed they were some of the french boarders who had fallen in the attack and what of their own bill how many lay dying or awaiting burial two seamen ran along the poop marlin spikes in their hands as they peered round for ropes which needed repair for them it was over for now they chatted to each other thankful to be whole grateful to be alive bolitho watched them in silence perhaps herrick was right about people in england who did not spare a thought for men like this he nodded to the two seamen as he strode to the ladder if it were the case he decided then it was their loss for men such as these were worth a thought and much more beside aftermath joshua moffitt the commodores personal clerk tapped his teeth with a pen and waited as bolitho leaned back at his desk and took another swallow of coffee bolitho let the strong black coffee explore his stomach and tried to concentrate his mind on the report he was dictating for the admiral if it would ever be sent if it would ever be read he knew moffitt was watching him but was almost used to his strange opaque stare by now in the sleeping cabin he could hear ozzard his servant making up the cot his feet barely audible on the deck and wondered at the fates which had made these two men fill their present roles it would be better for them both if they were reversed he thought ozzard who attended his daily wants from shaving water to a clean shirt had been it was said a lawyers clerk he certainly had education more than some of the officers moffitt on the other hand whose duties involved the careful writing of every order and despatch of noting down each of bolithos personal signals and instructions for the other captains in the squadron was a product of the slums he had wispy grey hair and glazed staring eyes which peered out from his parchment face like those of a man near to death or as allday had remarked unsympathetically ive seen better looking rogues dangling on a gallows from the little he had been able to discover bolitho had learned that moffitt had been in a debtors jail awaiting transportation to the new penal colony at botany bay a hopeful lieutenant with a courts warrant for encouraging recruitment to his majestys navy as a direct substitute for transportation to the other side of the world had arrived at the jail and with several others moffitt had begun a new life his first ship had been an eightygun twodecker and in a brief skirmish off ushant her captains clerk had been killed by a stray musket ball moffitt had used the opportunity well and had made yet one more change in his affairs by assuming the dead mans duties transferred to lysander at spithead he had been ready and willing to offer himself as a commodores clerk unless or until a better fitted person could be found the rush to get the ship ready for sea and complete all repairs in time to receive bolithos broad pendant had allowed moffitt to slip into his new role with barely a ripple bolitho looked into his cup it was only too easy to send ozzard to make fresh coffee it was one of his weaknesses but he would stick to his rule and try to eke out his supply as long as possible he heard the insistent thud of hammers and the rasp of saws the work of repairing the damage was still going on without a break this was the morning of the fourth day after the battle lysander with the sloop and the prize in company had continued in a slow northeasterly crawl the hands turnedto until there was no proper light in which to work to get her ready to fight again when required in his minds eye he could see the chart when he had examined it before his meagre breakfast they had been forced to maintain a very slow progress tattered sails had had to be sent down from aloft for repair or replacement from their stocks the jib boom had been almost entirely refashioned after its thrusting collision with the french seventyfour and he could join with herricks report in complimenting tuke the carpenter for his energies and devotion to perfection herrick quite rightly had written well of lieutenant veitch the third lieutenant had controlled the gunnery throughout the battle but more than that he had decided without calling for permission or advice to doubleshot some of his guns to help the carronade s attack on one of the enemy ships doubleshotting was a risky thing under perfect conditions and with experienced seamen yet veitch had managed to keep his head enough to select such men from disengaged guns and use the bombardment to maximum effect midshipman luce yeo the boatswain and major leroux all had been placed on the captains record for bolithos approval on the other side of the coin lysander had lost thirteen dead either in the battle or later of their wounds the surgeon had reported another five who might die at any moment and ten who would almost certainly be fit for duty with any kind of luck the enemy had probably lost far more as well as the hurt of being driven off by a single ship but where men were concerned it was of little comfort they had weeks perhaps months yet to endure without additional support muscle and bone were more important than hemp and oak frames and men themselves more vital than all besides he tried not to think of his own report as yet unfinished at moffitts bony elbow the clerk asked will we continue sir his voice like the man was thin and scratchy his entry in the muster book described him as being aged thirtyeight he looked nearer sixty bolitho eyed him gravely where did we get to the pen moved across the papers during the action the ship was under control the whole time and only when entangled with the second french vessels rigging was she forced to lose way the opaque eyes were level again sir bolitho stood up and walked to the quarter gallery his hands behind his back he could not keep herricks face out of his thoughts in the battle at the moment when a collision had shown itself unavoidable that was the moment it stood out even above the thunder of gunfire the awful cries the twisting scarlet patterns around the wheel in those vital minutes herrick had hesitated worse than that at a time when the french had taken the initiative and might have used it to attack the ship from either side he had made a wrong decision it was like hearing his voice here in the cabin the anguish as he had ordered gilchrist to repel boarders and it had been the wrong order defensive action at that stage could have broken lysanders morale quenched her peo pies willingness to do battle as easily as if their flag had been tom down before their eyes he forced himself to think of herrick as the captain of his ship not as thomas herrick his friend in the past he would have despised any senior officer who had used friendship to cover up failure or incompetence but now he knew the choice was not that easy nor so free of prejudice herrick had almost pleaded with him not to leave the quarterdeck to join the fighting in the bows fondness for him or adesire to keep his advice and determination close by or both the effect could have meant complete disaster bolitho had noticed if only in hindsight that the french captain had remained aft during the time when lysanders boarders had been carving a bloody path through his men how would the fight have gone he wondered if the french captain had rallied his men in the forefront of the struggle even at the expense of his own life while his british counterparts had stayed clear and in comparative safety he leaned his hands on the sill below the saltstained glass herrick was no coward and could no more display disloyalty than he could betray his sister but up there on the quarterdeck when he had been most needed he had failed bolitho said shortly ill finish it later moffitt he turned and thought he saw a quick gleam of curiosity in his eyes you may copy out what we have already done it would keep moffitt busy and the report at arms length for a bit longer there was a tap at the screen door and herrick stepped into the cabin i thought you would like to know at once sir harebell has signalled that she has sighted two sail to the eastrd his blue eyes moved briefly to moffitt at the table it will most likely be the rest of the squadron he added bitterly this time bolitho saw his glance fall on the pages of the report and felt something like guilt as if herrick had read his mind his nagging doubt yes what is our estimated position herrick frowned at eight bells we fixed it as approximately forty miles north of the island of majorca with the poor progress and damage to canvas and helm even the master will not make a stronger estimate bolitho looked at moffitt you can go he heard ozzard letting himself out of the sleeping cabin herrick asked what are your orders sir when we can rejoin our other ships i intend to call a captains conference he walked to the windows again seeing herrick s reflection in the thick glass after i have heard captain farquhars explanation for waiting until this second rendezvous i will say what i think we should do as flag captain you must ensure that each ship from lysander to harebell understands my standing orders exactly to me initiative is a worthwhile substitute for blind obedience but ill have no selfish manoeuvres nor will i tolerate rank disobedience herrick said i understand sir bolitho turned to face him what do you think thomas he waited willing him to speak out really think herrick shrugged i believe that farquhar is pettyminded and eager enough for advancement that he will act as he thinks fit whenever possible i see bolitho crossed to his wine cabinet and touched it with his fingertips he could see her smiling at him hear her infectious laugh as she had watched his pleasure with the gift so warm so generous with her love reckless too with her hostility for anyone who had dared to show criticism of their brief affair is that all sir herrick was studying him his face tired and grim no thomas he turned hating the strain on herricks features he had probably not slept more than an hour or two at a time since the battle it is not ail he gestured to a chair but herrick remained standing as he had known he would he cursed inwardly that was the trouble they knew each other too well for any sort of conflict he said i must complete my report for the admiral sooner or later i will have to send a dispatch to him my personal understanding of the situation here upon it might well depend a whole new strategy if i am wrong there is far more than my head at stake if st vincent sends a great fleet to the mediterranean and we discover too late that the french have sailed west instead of east maybe to join their squadrons from the biscay ports england and not merely a battle will be lost i realise that sir a heavy responsibility bolitho stared at him are you deliberately being evasive you know damned well what i mean this is an important mission with no risk too great to complete it when i send my first despatch to the admiral i must also tell him the state of my squadron herrick faced him stubbornly while the rest of the squadron took itself elsewhere sir our people fought and acted better than id have believed possible ive said as much in my own report bolitho shook his head sadly and what of you thomas what must i write of your part in it he watched the strain growing on herricks face i am not speaking of your seamanship your bearing under fire nor would i dare to herrick looked past him i did my best bolitho hesitated but knew that this and only this was the moment he said flatly it was not good enough and you know it overhead a faint cry came from a lookout deck there sail on the lee bow so farquhars ships if they were such were in sight from lysander herrick replied if that is what you believe sir i suggest you say as much in your report bolitho stared at him dont be such a damnedfool he could feel the blood churning in his head the wildness from the battle returning you were slow thomas you waited too long before each decision you know as well as i that in a broadside battle youve no time for reflections herrick watched his rising anger with apparent calm do you think i dontrealise that he shrugged the movement helpless or despairing when i lost impulsive last year i began to feel doubts about my strength my nerve if you like he looked away i sailed lysander into that bay because i had to something drew me there like times in the past when i just knew it must be done you sent no signal but deep inside me i felt you were there waiting expecting me to come perhaps i felt as you did about adam pascoe it went deeper than logic bolitho asked quietly and four days ago herrick faced him again i watched those two ships hour by hour i watched them drawing nearer imagined their people at quarters peering along their gun muzzles at me and when you decided to attack them singlehanded and we had the second one right across our bows i could barely speak or move i heard my voice passing orders but beyond it i was like stone something dead he wiped his forehead with one hand the skin was damp with sweat i cant do it that battle last year decided it for me bolitho stood up and walked slowly to the windows he recalled herricks excitement at the admiralty when he had been appointed flag captain a pleasure rising to match his own they had not questioned the dangers or pitfalls of their mission and neither of them had once considered his own ability to manage it he said you are too tired to think properly please sir herricks voice was hoarse dont show pity or humiliate me with understanding you know what this is costing me in gods name spare me further shame feet clattered in the passageway and bolitho said leave me id like to think he tried to find the words despising himself for causing him such pain your value is too great for me to abuse it the door opened slightly and midshipman saxby poked his head into the cabin captain sir he smiled nervously as he saw bolitho and showed the gap in his front teeth mr gilchrists respects and could you come on deck when herrick remained silent bolitho asked is something wrong saxby swallowed nno sir the first lieutenant wishes to turn up the hands to witness punishment herrick came out of his thoughts and said harshly i am coming mr saxby he glanced at bolitho i am sorry sir bolitho looked for a long while at the closed door it had been like watching herricks eyes peering from a strange mask a prisoner what had he said something dead he turned as ozzard padded silently into the cabin from the other door overhead and beyond the bulkhead he heard the stamp of booted feet as lerouxs men tramped aft the more subdued movements of the company assembling to witness punishment ozzard asked mildly can i do anything sir bolitho looked up at the skylight hearing a dull thud as the grating was rigged for the man to be seized up and flogged yes close that skylight he frowned i did not mean to shout at you he strode to the opposite side damn gilchrist and his punishments what was he trying or prove and to whom ozzard said warily your clerks outside sir fetch him moffitt reentered the cabin and blinked in the reflected sunlight he said ive finished the first part sir and i thought wait bolitho had raised his voice as if to drown the sound of the lash across a mans naked back i wish you to write a letter overhead the drum rolled and stopped and the flat crack of the cat on bare skin intruded once again ready sir moffitt like ozzard who was humming quietly in the sleeping cabin was unmoved by the slow drawnout ritual of punishment while he bolitho snapped address it to captain charles farquhar of his brittanic majestys ship osiris he rested his forehead against the sunwarmed glass and looked down at the frothing water below the counter how inviting it was cool cleansing behind him he heard moffitts nib scratching across the paper it never faltered to the roll of the drum the crack of the lash farquhar would have a good reason for being off station of that he was certain sir he bunched his fists tight against his thighs until the painsteadied him upon receipt of this order you will make all arrangements to proceed on board lysander flagship the transfer to be effected immediately he hesitated again fighting his will and there take on the duties and appointments of flag captain this time the nib did falter he continued your present post will be assumed by captain thomas herrick he walked to the table and looked over moffitts narrow shoulder i will want two copies directly he reached out and took the pen he felt moffitt staring at it as if defying it to move almost savagely he wrote given under my hand aboard his majestys ship lysander signed richard bolitho commodore it was done with the hands dismissed from witnessing punishment and the approaching ships confirmed as osiris and nicator thomas herrick returned to the cabin to make his report bolitho sat below the great span of windows watching osiriss yards swinging smartly her sails retaking the wind as she assumed station astern of lysander he said quietly i want both captains aboard directly yes sir herrick looked tired i have already made the signal i will heaveto when all ships are on proper station osiris wishes to communicate immediately bolitho nodded farquhar would have news for him news important enough to explain his absence from the original rendezvous bolitho did not look at the sealed envelope on his desk the news he in turn would give farquhar would make even him take notice he said i have made no note in the official log or my own report about what you told me earlier he saw herricks shoulders sag but i accept your word naturally he heard the clatter of blocks and the groan of cordage as the ship rolled heavily under reduced canvas knowing that at any minute he would have to face the others to begin again he continued i could shift my pendant to another ship thomas but i recall only too clearly what happened when that was done when i held a similar command the whole company took it as a personal slight a lack of faith by the admiral in their ability and trust i thought it unfair then as i do now herricks voice was husky i understand i dontrelish the prospect of failure and what it will mean equally ill not protest against something which i have begun he shrugged helplessly because of my feelings for the navy and for you id kill myself rather than risk lives and a cause to cover my faults bolitho watched him sadly i am not removing you from duty herrick exclaimed then why have you agreed that bolitho stood up quickly what would you have me do eh give gilchrist command and send you home replace you with javal perhaps when we have but one frigate for this whole mission he looked away i am giving you osiris she is a wellfound ship and trained to a high standard he heard herricks intake of breath but went on remorselessly you will not have to worry about the affairs of the squadron for the present but concentrate instead on command what you make of it is up to you but i trust you above all else to do your duty well he turned slowly and was shocked to see that herrick was as before unnaturally calm farquhar will assume your present duties until herrick nodded if that is your order sir order bolitho made to move towards him do you think i want you faced day by day with the officers and men you have trained and commanded since you took lysander to know that every hour brings a doubt a fear that you will let them down in some way he shook his head that i will not do nor will i can i jeopardise the squadrons strength because of something which is precious to me herrick looked round the cabin very well i will prepare to leave no slur will fall onyou thomas i will see to that but id rather see you captain of some wornout brig than breaking your heart on the beach deprived of the one life you love and for which you have given so much herrick seemed momentarily confused he said farquhar i never liked him even as a midshipman i never really liked him he turned to the door i little thought it would end like this bolitho crossed the cabin towards him and held out his hands not end thomas but herrick kept his hands at his sides we will see sir he left without looking back allday entered the cabin and after a slight hesitation took the sword from its rack and examined it bolitho sat down on the bench seat again and watched him miserably capn herricks off then sir allday kept his eyes on the sword dont you start at me allday but there was no bite to his tone i have taken enough for one day for a thousand days allday looked at him his eyes very clear in the reflected light you did right sir he smiled sadly im just a common seaman who but for you would be working aloft or being punished for some petty fault or other but im a man and ive notions for those i serve an he seemed at a loss and feel strong for he drew the old sword carefully and held the blade in line with the sun apparently studying its edge capn herrick is a good man in another ship he will find his feet again the sword went into its scabbard with a sharp click but ifnot then the deck of the flagship is no place for him sir bolitho stared at him it had happened often in the past but never before had he needed alldays support more in his ship indeed the whole of his little squadron there was no man with whom he could really share his fears his doubts when he had crossed from wardroom to cabin and then been given his own broad pendant he had left such luxuries behind him for good allday added calmly when i was first pressed into your ship id planned to give leg bail at the first opening i knew the penalty for desertion well enough but i was that determined then at the saintes when all gods protection was thrown aside under the cannons bellow i looked aft and saw you and it was then that i knew there were some captains who did care for the likes of us the poor buggers who were expected to cheer for king and country when we sailed into the enemy line bolitho replied quietly i think youve said enough allday watched his lowered head with something like despair and you never sees it yourself do you sir you fret about cap n herrick or what chance we have against this foe or that but you never take a watch to think of yourself he tensed as ozzard padded through the other door bolithos coat and hat in his hand but its said and done now he watched bolitho stand up his eyes blind as he held out his arms for the coat and i reckon it will be all right bolitho felt the swordbelt around his waist allday had understood better than most would do had guessed his intention perhaps from the moment of herricks admission he said i will go on deck now and greet the others and afterwards say goodbye to herrick and thank you for he looked at alldays homely face reminding me allday watched him stride from the cabin and then put his arm around ozzards shoulders by god id not have his position for a dozen wenches and a whole ocean of rum ozzard grimaced not likely to get the offer id say on deck it was still clear and bright the afternoon sea choppy with lively catspaws and long shallow swells the three ships of the line sails in flapping confusion as they hoveto to drop and receive boats would have gladdened bolithos heart at any other time now as he stood on the poop deck and watched the two barges speeding towards lysander s side the marines already lined up at the entry port to receive the two other captains he felt a deep sense of loss he saw herrick at the lee rail his hat well down over his eyes and close by his first lieutenant gilchrist arms folded spindly legs apart to take the staggering motion of the action there was little to show brighter patches of planking where the carpenter and his mates had done their work well fresh paint to hide other scars and replacements above the busy decks the sails too were neatly patched and it was difficult to picture the smoke to remember the din of war what herrick was thinking at this moment he could hardly dare imagine he must be very proud of the way his company had faced up to battle and its backbreaking aftermath just months ago most of these hurrying seamen had been working ashore on farms in towns with skills or without life in a kings ship not even a possibility they would be sorry to see their captain leave for the new men especially herrick would be familiar in some way a beginner like themselves if they had displeasure to show it would be turned towards their commodore if necessary he would see to it himself he thought grimly herricks name was too valuable to be damaged because of his actions right or wrong the first boat hooked on to the chains it was farquhar naturally he came through the entry port as elegant and as smart as if he had just left his london tailor he doffed his hat to the quarterdeck and ran his eyes calmly along the swaying lines of marines and glittering bayonets his hair was very fair gathered at the nape of his neck and it shone above his collar like pale gold bolitho watched him shake hands with herrick how illmatched they were had always been farquhars uncle sir henry langford had been bolithos first captain at the age of twelve he had joined the eightgun manxman terrified and filled with awe fourteen years later langford then an admiral had given him command of a frigate his nephew had been appointed into her as midshipman now farquhar in his early thirties and a postcaptain was with him again if he survived the war he would rise to high rank and position both at home and in the fleet bolitho had never doubted it from the beginning just as herrick had never accepted it more shrills from the silver calls and he saw george probyn of the nicator heaving his untidy shape through the port on the other side of the quarterdeck pascoe was standing with luce by the signal party and bolitho imagined that he himself must have looked like that when as a lieutenant he had witnessed comings and goings of aloof and unreachable beings he sighed and walked to the ladder herrick said if you will come to my quarters captain probyn the commodore wishes to speak with captain farquhar farquhars eyebrows rose slightly pon my word bit formal arent we captain herrick herrick regarded him coldly yes bolitho watched farquhar as he strode into his cabin watchful wondering probably what his commodores reactions were going to be sensing something deeper around him too but confident above all i have my report sir bolitho gestured to a chair in a moment our attack as you will have realised was successful we have one good prize and despatched another spanish vessel in the bay four days ago we met with two french ships of the line and engaged them we broke off the action after crippling both vessels our losses were small considering farquhar smiled quietly he did not look quite so confident now he said i followed your instructions sir buzzard reported sighting a convoy of some five sail and we gave chase under the circumstances you acted correctly bolitho watched him gravely did you catch them captain javal managed to damage a couple sir but he only succeeded in making one heaveto unfortunately i was unable to reach the scene on time as i had lost my main topgallant mast in a squall nicator took the lead and due to some er misunderstanding of signals fired a halfbroadside into the french vessel so that she began to founder and then farquhar tugged an envelope from inside his elegant coat my boarding officer managed to save this letter from the masters safe before the vessel capsized and sank it is addressed to a yves gorse who apparently resides in malta it contains instructions for gorse to prepare watering arrangements he thrust the letter across the table for merchant vessels on their lawful occasions or words to that effect i believe the letter to be in some sort of code but the vessels master is such a dolt that i could get nothing from him but the small convoy was out of marseilles a french corvette was escorting them through these waters not because of any threat from us but because of barbary pirates and the like he was keeping the most important until the last my first lieutenant did manage to discover one thing sir i have several frenchmen pressed into my company and one of them told my senior that hed heard one of the survivors claim that the letter had been sent aboard their ship by order of admiral brueys himself bolitho looked at him brueys was perhaps the finest and most capable admiral in the french navy in any navy for that matter you did well bolitho rubbed his hands on his thighs this man gorse may be a spy or agent of some kind perhaps the french intend to attack malta or sicily farquhar frowned bonaparte is said to have intentions towards the kingdom they are at peace but he probably believes as i do that in war there is no such luxury as neutrality maybe bolitho tried not to think of herrick we will make haste to toulon and marseilles following your discovery we can now determine the strength of these preparations farquhar asked your prize sir what does she hold powder and shot and fodder fodder yes it troubles me too all the french and spanish preparations are for a fullscale attack they blend together into a sort of strategy but fodder it does not sound like a local attack it sounds like cavalry and heavy artillery and all the men and horses to sustain them farquhars eyes gleamed this vessel too was carrying fodder he looked around the cabin i am sorry sir but should we not wait for the others it will save time bolitho looked at the sealed envelope this is for you captain farquhar he walked to the stern and watched the other ships hearing the rasp of a knife as farquhar slit open the envelope farquhar said quietly you have me all aback sir bolitho turned and studied him thoughtfully it was a hard decision and captain herrick sir farquhars face was masklike is he ill not ill he added shortly execute the arrangements directly i want the squadron under way before dusk farquhar was still watching him the letter in one hand i cannot begin to thank you sir bolitho nodded you obviously think i made the right choice farquhar had blue eyes but they were not like herricks and in the light from the sea they were like ice well as you have asked sir yes i do then see that the squadrons affairs show some sign of this he looked at him evenly captain herrick is a fine officer the eyebrows moved again but no but captain farquhar i want him to feel his strength in a welltrained ship where he has no personal contact as yet he will be kept fully occupied i think it will be good for him and the squadron farquhar smiled my first lieutenant will be surprised it will do him good also he did not explain what he meant the first lieutenant in this ship is mr gilchrist i suggest you make his acquaintance without delay he waited for a sign but farquhar merely remarked gilchrist i dontthink i know him he shrugged but then why should one bother to know these people bolitho said i would appreciate it if you would keep your personal dislikes out of the meeting farquhar stood up of course sir you should know that i have never disliked captain herrick although i am well aware of his hostility towards me he gave his tightlipped smile i cannot imagine the reason for it bolitho saw ozzard hovering at the door show the other captains aft ozzard then you can bring some wine he tried to speak lightheartedly as if he was untroubled unreached ozzard bobbed his eyes on farquhar aye aye sir bolitho crossed to a quarter gallery and stared at the small whitehorses cruising down from the horizon each piece of news and every thin rumour took them deeper and deeper into the mediterranean each time it would be his decision one captured letter had taken him into a bay where men and ships had been destroyed now farquhars chance find would send them still further northeast to the harbours of the french navy pieces of a puzzle all set against a chart and the remorseless run of sand in an hourglass the door opened and he turned to see herrick and probyn entering the cabin he waited until they were seated and then beckoned ozzard to the wine cabinet at that moment there was a knock on the door and gilchrist peered in at them he saw herrick and said i am sorry to intrude sir but i wish to speak with the flag captain farquhars voice made him turn i am the flag captain mr gilchrist i will trouble you not to forget it there was an uncomfortable silence and he added i will also trouble you never to enter the commodores quarters without my permission the door closed and farquhar leaned sideways in his chair to look at the cabinet his voice was perfectly normal again a fine piece of joinery sir i know his work well bolitho glanced at herrick but he was already beyond his reach wine and cheese captain charles farquhar strode aft to greet bolitho as he came on deck in spite of being without coat or hat farquhar managed to retain an air of elegance and his ruffled shirt looked as if it was freshly laundered he said formally course eastnoreast sir bolitho nodded and glanced up at his broad pendant and the set of the yards the wind had veered slightly during the night and there was evidence that it was weakening also he took a telescope from the rack and trained it over the larboard nettings it was as if the scene stayed permanent and the sails were merely pretending to make the ship move and yet it was three wearying weeks since he had watched herrick pulled across to the osiris and two of those weeks had been spent along this stretch of coast he watched the familiar sharkblue blur of land it was maddening to realise that just out there was the busy port of toulon and behind its protective walls and batteries lay the answer to his speculation and doubts farquhar remarked not even a sign of a sail damn them bolitho replaced the glass and looked along lysanders upper deck the forenoon watch had begun one like all the others before it everywhere above and along the decks men were at work splicing painting blackingdown the standing rigging examining a hundred and one things for flaws and possible wear it was eerie to find the gulf of lions so empty it was like being laughed at the french must know that an enemy squadron was active in their waters any tiny fishing craft might have sighted it and passed the news to garrisons ashore perhaps they were too busy to care or were content to let the british ships tack wearily back and forth consuming their stores and resources and with nothing to show for it he said we must get some news soon or well have to push closer inshore farquhar eyed him calmly if we had some more frigates sir bolitho bit back an angry retort it was not farquhars fault but in every campaign they seemed to be short of frigates without which it was like trying to find a blind man in a dark room he peered astern watching osiriss big forecourse filling and emptying in the uncertain wind as if the ship was breathing heavily she was a mile away and beyond her he could just see the leeward side of the prize segura he wondered how probyn had been getting on with his separate patrol to the east of toulon to seaward of the small islands which protected the approaches he had javals buzzard in company while the rest of the squadron had to be content with the sloop he could just make out harebells creamcoloured topsails etched against the french coastline like seashells inch would be in no doubt of his importance it was to be hoped he did not allow his eagerness to tempt him closer inshore there he could lose the wind or fall foul of some wellsited artillery he turned to look at osiris again three weeks and on every single day he had wondered about herrick farquhar followed his glance and said she is handling well only a casual interest bolitho had already noticed that about the elegant captain once out of a ship and no matter how long he had served in her or what great events she had shared farquhar was able to dismiss her from his thoughts he was entirely without sentiment and seemed to live for today and where it would lead in the future nevertheless he had to admit that farquhars efficiency had showed itself throughout the ship gun drill and contests between batteries and decks had cut the time for loading and firing by minutes although he always appeared to have time for his own leisure farquhar was never far away when needed and his officers from gilchrist to mr midshipman saxby had been made to realise it farquhar had always borne a reputation for harshness but as yet he had not shown himself as a tyrant he had examined all the ships books within hours of getting the squadron under way from the punishment and muster books to the rarer ones about stocks of canvas and oil it was a new side to the mans character and bolitho being the man he was never considered that his own past example to farquhar was bearing fruit at last he saw lieutenant fitzclarence strutting busily back and forth on the lee side of the quarterdeck that was another thing farquhar had quite rightly removed the second lieutenant from the monotony of prizeduty aboard the segura and had sent instead a masters mate whenever the weather had made it possible he had recalled the prizemaster and had replaced him with another midshipmen warrant officers even a resentful gilchrist had had their share it made sense and kept them on their toes but farquhar had not asked permission as flag captain he had taken it as a right he had even cut the number of punishments if not their severity he had examined every case himself and if the unfortunate seaman had made a genuine mistake or one had been caused by a superiors carelessness he had dismissed it and to ram home his point had given the accuser an awesome pile of extra duties if on the other hand the case had been proved he had ordered stiffer punishment than herrick had ever permitted it was it seemed his one real failing farquhar said suddenly we shall have to lose harebell or buzzard shortly sir it sounded like a question yes bolitho paced slowly along the weather side the deck seams clung to his shoes and he could feel the heat thrown back from the bulwark and it was barely nine oclock in the forenoon each day brought hotter weather more tension to those who endured it farquhar had put his finger right on the point he could not delay much longer he would have to send word to the admiral his own estimation of the french preparations and intentions once he had despatched one of his badly needed scouts he would be committed set against the consequences if he was proved wrong that in itself was unimportant if only inch had been able to capture the spanish brig before the two french ships had chased him away he could have sent her to the admiral he paused and shaded his eyes to look for the prize she was too slow and vulnerable and she still might prove useful as a deception he thought of her packed cargo or as a bribe steel rang on steel and he walked to the quarterdeck rail to watch as the offwatch midshipmen faced each other for practice with sword and cutlass farquhar glanced at him j thought mr pascoe would be well employed sir there was nothing in his voice to betray his thoughts he has already proved his skill on one of my previous lieutenants he smiled briefly he has a good eye bolitho watched pascoe walking behind two of the midshipmen speaking to each in turn their faces were crimson with exertion and were obviously aware their commodore and captain were looking on clang clang clang the blades moved in a jerky rhythm how different in a real battle bolitho thought grimly the madness the eagerness to strike at a man before he beat you to the deck gilchrist appeared below the larboard gangway youll have to do better than that mr pascoe bolitho felt farquhar tense as he snapped what ails that damned fellow fitzclarence was making elaborate steps along the lee side trying to warn gilchrist that he was not alone farquhar called mr fitzclarence ill trouble you to stand still he turned and looked at gilchrists uplifted face you were saying mr gilchrist the first lieutenant replied the drill is untidy sir bolitho watched the little drama in silence the midshipmens arms still wavering in the air the swords in disarray seamen who had been working in the weather shrouds pausing to watch their tanned bodies gold in the sunlight pascoe in the middle of it his dark eyes on gilchrist only his quick breathing betraying his anger and farquhar he glanced at him and saw the look in his iceblue stare farquhar had kept gilchrist busy and obedient now it was out in the open again he recalled his hidden anger what ails that damned fellow farquhar snapped his fingers bosuns mate fetch my sword he walked to the lee gangway and leaned on the handrail his eyes on gilchrist below him and at the opposite side mr pascoe dismiss those ragamuffins he reached without turning his head as a worried looking bosuns mate hurried towards him i believe you lost your sword in some reckless scheme with the dons mr pascoe he drew his own from its scabbard and held it against the sky eyeing it critically this is a fair blade it was presented to me by my late uncle he looked up at bolithos grave features and added although i gather that sir henry preferred something heavier sir he added sharply with your permission sir then he flung the sword straight at pascoe catch bolitho tried not to flinch as the youth reached out and caught it in flight farquhar sounded very relaxed and composed and now mr gilchrist if you will be so good as to cross swords with our junior lieutenant maybe the midshipmen will learn something eh gilchrist stared from him to pascoe his eyes wild fight a duel sir he could barely get the words out not a duel mr gilchrist farquhar returned to the quarterdeck an instruction if you like as he reached bolithos side he said quietly have no fears for mr pascoe sir gilchrist had been handed his sword by the wardroom servant and was holding it before him as if he had never set eyes on it in his life he said at the first contact he stared desperately at the midshipmen luce was grimfaced and at the end of the line saxby stood with his mouth wide open his eyes like saucers gilchrist seemed to realise the absurdity of his position and snapped on your guard mr pascoe the blades touched wavered and flashed over the pale planking like steel tongues bolitho watched feeling the dryness in his throat as he saw pascoes slim figure moving around an eighteenpounders breech his shoes feeling the way his right leg forward to keep his balance he wanted to tear his eyes away and look at farquhar was he really trying to demolish gilchrists arrogance or was he using it and pascoes skill to remind bolitho of his dead brother perhaps farquhar was remembering at this very moment how they hadbeen taken prisoner by hugh bolitho in his american privateer he was not likely to forget it or the fact that hughs downfall had begun when he had killed a brother officer when he had been in the kings service in a duel he heard gilchrists sharp breathing saw the concentrated stare of anger and hatred as he parried pascoes guard and forced him back a few paces before he could recover farquhar said quietly see how his skill with a sword gives way to anger he was speaking almost to himself watch him pushing on using up his strength he nodded with silent appreciation he has a longer reach and is a harder man than mr pascoe but bolitho saw pascoes hilt dart up and under the other mans blade twisting it aside and making it fly across the deck gilchrist stepped back his eyes fixed on the sword point which was motionless in line with his chest good farquhar sauntered to the rail well done he looked at gilchrist both of you he turned to the spellbound midshipmen i think that was quite a lesson eh bolitho took a slow breath a lesson indeed for all of them the masters mate of the watch who had been following the spectacle with the others suddenly looked up his hands cupped around his ears gunfire sir bolitho wrenched his thoughts from the swordplay where away he heard it then like surf on a rocky shore muffled but plain for what it was the masters mate said to the eastrd sir he pointed across the starboard bow sure of it farquhar hurried past him that was well said mr bagley he reached the compass and peered at it for several seconds id like permission to investigate sir he watched bolitho his mouth half smiling before the wind leaves us with more time to er fill bolitho nodded signal the squadron to make more sail harebell too if you can attract commander inchs attention farquhar strode to the rail as gilchrist appeared on the larboard ladder pipe all hands his voice was crisp indifferent to gilchrists confusion get the maincourse on her and the stunsls too if need be he paused his head cocked to listen to the shrill of calls between decks we will let her fall off a couple of points he glanced at the masters mate and let us all hope mr bagleys estimate is correct as the men poured to their stations at the braces and at the foot of each mast pascoe hurried across the quarterdeck to supervise luce s signal party bolitho barred his way i am glad you are spared another cut adam the youths sunburned features split in a smile it was easy uncle bolitho snapped that time perhaps it was not of your making i know that too the smile vanished i am sorry er sir if you want to cross swords again then please ask me adam pascoe hesitated and then smiled awkwardly yes sir now be off with you i want our ships to see the signals today farquhar joined him by the rail a fine young man sir their eyes met then bolitho said calmly and id be obliged captain farquhar if we can keep him that way farquhar smiled and walked forward to watch the men dashing aloft to the yards major leroux appeared by the poop ladder and touched his hat it sounds like a pair of ships sir probably nicator or buzzard getting to grips with a frenchman bolitho looked up as the great mainsail billowed free from its yard the thunder of canvas drowning the distant sound of gunfire i hope you may be right major leroux was watching his own men at the mizzen braces in an almost conversational tone he said my corporal cuttler is an excellent marksman sir if he earned his living in a fairground he would doubtless be a man of wealth and property by now he walked away as lieutenant nepean hurried to him to make his report allday had come on deck and said hes a dark one is major leroux sir bolitho looked at him in what way allday gave a lazy smile he had that corporal cuttler down in the wardroom lobby with his long musket hes so proud of dyou mean that he was ordering cuttler to be ready to shoot he stared at alldays smiling face the coxswain shook his head not exactly sir he asked him if he could shoot a sword out of a mans hand if necessary like bolitho walked to the nettings i do not know about you allday he saw leroux watching him his features expressionless for that brief moment he felt quite sorry for gilchrist bolitho leaned back to watch lysander s towering spread of canvas ship of the line perhaps but farquhar was driving her with the fanatical demand of a frigate captain with the wind coming almost directly astern the ship was forging ahead well her yards and shrouds creaking and vibrating under the tall pyramids of sails every so often her bow would dip and the forecastle would then be drenched in great showers of spray like slivers of glass in the bright glare bolitho stood halfway up a poop ladder feeling his hair blowing wildly as he peered ahead of the lifting and plunging bowsprit the gunfire had ceased and he could see dark brown smoke drifting along the horizon the uncertain silhouette of a large ship under reduced sails from the mainmast crosstrees he heard luce yell shes nicator sir farquhar who had sent luce aloft with his big signals telescope paused in his restless pacing and snapped i should damn well hope so he glared at fitzclarence what the hell is she firing at luce called again his voice excited and totally unaware of the tensions far below his dizzy perch nother vessel on her lee side sir i think theyre grappling farquhar swung round mr pascoe if you think it not too undignified for a lieutenant to swarm up the ratlines like a damn monkey id be obliged for a more rational report pascoe grinned and threw off his coat before hurrying to the main shrouds farquhar saw bolitho watching and shrugged luce comes of a good family but i fear his powers of description would be better suited to poetry than to a man owar bolitho raised his eyes to see pascoe hanging out and down as he pulled himself around the futtock shrouds and up beyond the maintop how easy he made it look he turned his attention to the distant ships unable to torture himself with his hatred of heights a glass please he felt one handed to him and trained it through the angled rigging yes it was easy to recognise nicator s bluff outline the dull yellow paint of her figurehead beyond her hull he could see three masts only one of which was squarerigged as far as he could tell he heard pascoe shout barquentine sir i can see her flag a pause while farquhar stared up at the swaying masthead until his eyes watered a yankee sir farquhar turned and looked at bolitho he said sourly as if we havent troubles enough bolitho tried to hide his disappointment from those who were watching his reactions an american merchantman going about her affairs there was nothing they could do about that even if she was trading with the enemy blockade was one thing but to provoke another war with the new united states would receive no praise from king and parliament bolitho said signal the rest of our ships to remain in the patrol area he watched an outthrust spur of land almost hidden mist and haze we have enough risk as it is to be standing so close to the isles of hyeres without leading the whole squadron ashore farquhar nodded bosuns mate call mr luce to the deck minutes later in response to luces signals osiris and the prize tacked heavily away from their leader to begin the long beat back to more open waters bolitho said make to nicator that we are joining her directly what was probyn doing it was natural enough to feel resentment at the sight of an american flag especially to those like probyn who had been taken prisoner during the revolution but it was over and done with and time for it to become a part of history if a war was provoked by some act of stupidity england would be worse off than ever fighting france and spain and an america which was now far more powerful than she had been those fifteen years back nicator has acknowledged sir luce sounded breathless from his hasty descent down a backstay very well it took another halfhour to manoeuvre close enough to heaveto by that time nicator had ungrappled the american vessel but as she had drifted downwind bolitho had seen her poop spotted with the scarlet coats of probyn s marines he snapped call away my barge he looked at farquhar itll save time if nothing else the barge was swayed up and over the lee gangway the crew tumbling into her almost before she had touched the water alongside alldays voice pursued the bargemen like a trumpet and by the time lysander was hoveto and bolitho had reached the entry port all was ready he said quietly keep a weathereye open for buzzard she should be beating round from the eastrd shortly he looked grimly at farquhars handsome features i will send her to the admiral with my despatches farquhar shrugged i am sorry id hoped for something of value but bolitho was already climbing down the entry port stairs trying not to lower his head to watch the sea sluicing along the rounded hull and lifting the barge towards his legs he paused counting seconds and then as the barge swam up beneath him he jumped out and down alldays order to cast off coming before he had taken a proper breath he sat in the sternsheets with as much dignity as he could manage and said to nicator allday he watched the other seventyfours crossed yards towering above him the slackness of some of her runningrigging like the man he thought untidy allday steered the barge around the ships great counter and towards her entry port bolitho was too busy watching the barquentine to care for probyns feelings or the inconvenience of a visit from his commodore she was a lean graceful vessel and her name santa paula stood out in rich gold against a completely black hull toss your oars allday swung the tiller as the bowman hooked on to nicators main chains bolitho said return to the ship allday he saw the sudden doubt it is all right this time nicator is still an english vessel i trust allday touched his forehead and grinned ill watch for your signal sir bolitho scrambled up to the entry port noticing how scarred were the wooden stairs while the chain plates of the main shrouds were badly dappled with red rust he found probyn waiting with the sideparty his portly figure doused with spray he said i fear the reception is shorthanded sir but my marines are aboard the yankee so i see bolitho began to walk aft away from the curious faces by the port now tell me what happened probyn stared at him we ran down on the barquentine at noon sir i guessed she was a runner trying to pass through our patrol so i signalled her to heaveto he nodded sensing bolithos mood i know we are not supposed to get involved with american neutrality but there is no but about it bolitho glanced at the ships two helmsmen they looked as if they were dressed in the same clothes as when they had been caught by the press all the captains knew his opinion about that he had put it in his written orders to ensure that every man pressed or volunteer should begin life aboard ship in a proper issue of slop clothing it was such a cheap but vital thing that he was amazed at the stupidity of some captains who were so miserly they issued nothing until their wretched seamen were almost in rags probyn knew it well enough and had outwardly complied but out of sight out of mind apparently he would deal with that later he added what was your true reason probyn led the way aft to his quarters i am badly short of hands sir i had to sail from england before i was given a fair chance of recruitment otherwise bolitho stared at him and you sent a party into an american ship to press some of her people probyn paused and regarded him resentfully it is well known that hundreds many hundreds of our seamen desert to the american flag each year bolitho did know it and it was a very sore point indeed on both sides of the atlantic the british government had stated that they considered any seamen to be fairgame for a shorthanded naval vessel unless the american captains in question carried certificates of citizenship for all their people who were so entitled the american president on the other hand was equally firm he had demanded that once a man was signed into an american ship that was evidence enough the man was american documents could be destroyed or ignored the american flag could not he said we heard gunfire too probyn thrust past a marine sentry and answered the yankee refused to heaveto even after a warning shot ill not take that from anyone he hesitated in the small lobby to the cabin i have her master aboard under guard sir he sounded suddenly apprehensive now that you are here i suppose i had best hand him over to you bolitho watched him coldly take me to him the barquentine s master was seated in the stern cabin with one of probyns senior midshipmen for company he stood up and eyed bolitho with obvious surprise so there is some higher authority eh he had a soft accent but it failed to conceal his anger i am richard bolitho commodore of this british squadron he walked to the windows adding i have been hearing about your refusal to heaveto the american retorted hotly heaveto be damned ive a hard enough living to earn without being fired on by a bloody englishman bolitho sat down and looked at him a sturdy man with a neat brown beard the santa paula s master was about his own age and your name capn john thurgood he glared at him of new bedford well captain thurgood he smiled of new bedford the shortage of seamen is a constant worry for a kings officer in time of war thurgood sat down ignoring probyn completely that will have to remain your problem commodore i am not at war and my hands are not for king george herelaxed slightly my government will make the strongest protest and take all the action needed once i have laid my complaint bolitho nodded that is your privilege captain but you know as well as i that some of your crew will be no more american than westminster abbey he held up one hand and i know what you will say to that no matter you are obviously a shrewd man and i see no value in our arguing he stood up i shall have you returned to your fine barquentine captain and i will send you a gift of some excellent cheese which i brought from england i hope it will ease if not remove the hurt we have done you thurgood was on his feet you mean i can go he stared from bolitho to probyn s fuming face with amazement well ill be bolitho added evenly your cargo captain may i enquire what it is thurgood replied cheap red wine a full hold of the stuff in my home port theyd use it for paint he chuckled his eyes vanishing into craws feet by god you sure know how to scatter a mans anger probyn exclaimed i must protest bolitho said calmly please leave us captain probyn and tell your midshipman to go away i am not in danger of my life he smiled at the american am i thurgood grinned after the retreating probyn by god im glad you came commodore i think hed have liked me kicking at his mainyard he was a prisoner in the last war thurgood shrugged so was i bolitho picked up his hat there is one thing captain you sailed from marseilles no doubt he shook his head it is not a trap but it is unlikely you would have taken on a cargo like yours elsewhere and you are bound for thurgood watched him with amusement corfu then im off and away back home to new bedford ive a wife and three boys there i envy you bolitho did not see the look of warmth on the other mans face i have a spanish prize in company we took her a while back he looked thurgood in the eye now if you were to exchange some of your seamen for say double the number of spaniards he watched the mans mind working busily well id have thought you could drop them off when you return westward after you have delivered your cargo i am certain the spanish authorities would be very glad to reward you thurgood sounded doubtful i aint sure bolitho smiled and they would not have to be paid nor would you have to share your profit with a larger crew than you need for the homeward voyage thurgood thrust out his hand if ever you need employment commodore and i mean ever just come asking for me he shook his hand warmly ive got a few bully boys you can have trained seamen but i will not miss them bolitho smiled i dare say they will settle down on deck it was oppressively hot and the wind was rising and falling in gusts making the ships lurch and stagger in a sickening motion bolitho beckoned to probyn make a signal to lysander i want the prize segura to close with us after that send a good officer across to the santa paula with captain thurgood he will explain what is needed probyn looked as if he would burst if you say so sir bolitho smiled at the american when they are ready i will hail for my coxswain to bring a good ripe cheese across to you it might make even cheap wine palatable thurgood watched a boat being lowered from the quarter davits ill be off then commodore he studied him curiously bolitho eh we had a privateersman of that name in the war my brother bolitho looked away but he is dead now thurgood held out his hand good luck with whatever you intend i shall tell my wife and sons about this meeting he grinned an the cheese a lieutenant strode across the quarterdeck and touched his hat jolly boats at the chains sir thurgood made to leave but hung back his face set in a frown i want no part of this or any other war ive had a bellyfull he dropped one eyelid in a wink but if i was in charge of a force as weak as yours id be thinking very seriously of hauling off bolitho tried to conceal his excitement his anxiety you would thurgood grinned im told theres a fleet at toulon and three hundred transports for good measure thank you captain bolitho walked with him to the rail and a safe voyage to you also he waited until thurgood was in the boat and then said send for my barge a fleet and three hundred transports it was an armada probyns voice cut into his racing thoughts i must lodge the strongest protest i was humiliated in front of that yankee bolitho swung on him his eyes blazing humiliated were you and how do you imagine i felt to see a ship of the line firing on an unarmed vessel to know that one of my captains was prepared to risk unnecessary killing a war if necessary just to get what he wants for himself he kept his voice low and all because you knew that i would take any blame was that it that was unjust sir some of the bluster had gone i dare say bolitho regarded him evenly but do not take me for a fool that i do find humiliating he strode to the entry port seeing his barge curtsying across the blue water towards him youll get your men captain you would have probably been given them anyway had you used common sense instead of a broadside he nodded towards some seamen at the boat tackles look at them captain would you fight for anyone who kept you in worse comfort than a dog he did not wait for an answer care for them or theyll not fight for you he leaned over the rail and cupped his hands take your bundle to the barquentine allday then return for me allday waved one arm and steered the barge clear of the side an hour later bolitho was back aboard his own ship with farquhar barely able to hide his curiosity bolitho said make a signal to harebell to close with us immediately i cannot wait for javal commander inch can carry my despatches to the admiral he waited while farquhar shouted for luce and the barge was hoisted dripping on to the boat tier farquhar came back and asked may i enquire the nature of your plan sir he pointed to the segura which had almost reached the other ships and what is she doing i am sending some of the spanish seamen to captain thurgood in exchange for the barquentines er nonamericans farquhar pouted it will leave us shorthanded sir but it has provided us with information he could hide his relief no longer the french have a great fleet here harebell must sail with all speed before dusk if possible farquhar nodded captain probyn will be happy about his good fortune perhaps bolitho recalled the captains face he had made an enemy there maybe he had always been one all those years he said tomorrow if nothing is changed we will have a conference he unbuckled his sword and handed it to allday he discovered that he was suddenly ravenously hungry for the first time in many days as he made to walk aft he turned and looked at farquhar again if you were a french general and did not wish your transports to be involved in a battle before your main objective and if that objective was north africa and beyond that to india perhaps he watched farquhars eyes where would you go to prepare for the final assault farquhar rested both hands on the main bitts and frowned to avoid a battle he looked up sicily might be too dangerous a point on the coast of africa which was far enough away from my objective to avoid suspicion would equally be too far for men and horses to travel and be fit to fight at the end of it he nodded slowly i think i would choose an island already under my countrys control he paused does that sound sensible sir bolitho smiled do you know of such an island farquhar looked surprised yes sir corfu exactly he walked past the helmsmen and nodded to grubb farquhar crossed to the masters side and said the commodore believes that the french may be gathering at corfu grubb watched him warily aye sir but if youll pardon the liberty i thought it was your suggestion farquhar stared at him and then at the poop the devil you say he smiled tightly that was cleverly done committed for a further two frustrating weeks bolithos ships tacked back and forth keeping to the southwest of toulons approaches an area which would give them maximum advantage should the enemy emerge with harebell making all possible speed to gibraltar the work of inshore patrol fell to captain javals frigate while the seventyfours and their prize wallowed unhappily under reduced canvas javals topsails were usually to be seen sneaking around a distant headland or standing hoveto in direct view of the enemy but even javals taunting manoeuvres had no effect the french stayed where they were and did nothing and then on a hot sultry evening as buzzard fetched off the land for the fortieth time javal took it upon himself to lower a cutter in the charge of his first lieutenant mr mears it was more to ease the boredom than anything for the french had showed no sign of sending out a frigate or corvette to chase the prowling buzzard away on that particular night a french fisherman reacted in much the same way ignoring the instructions of the port admiral and garrison commander he put to sea in his small boat with his son and cousin for crew the first that bolitho learned of these coincidences was when buzzards cutter complete with captain javal and three french fishermen arrived alongside on the following morning the fisherman was elderly but defiant he showed little concern for his life and probably considered that as the english had rammed and sunk his little boat he had nothing left to live for bolitho listened to javals report before having the three frenchmen brought to his cabin it was strangely moving the old greybearded fisherman his cousin as red as a lobster with a belly like a puncheon of rum and the son straightbacked angry afraid bolitho explained through farquhar whose french was excellent that he wanted information about toulon not unnaturally the fisherman told him to rot in hell the son shouted death to the english before being cuffed into a flood of tears by sergeant gritton the cousin on the other hand was more than practical he explained that the boat had been all theyowned all they had to feed their families and eke out a poor living in a town where the military enjoyed the best of everything it was very likely true despite his great girth and his red cunning face the cousin was obviously the thinking member of the crew he suggested warily at first that if bolitho provided another boat and perhaps a little money or food he would be prepared to tell him what he wanted to know javal snapped ill have the varmint seized up and flogged sir ill give him boat that way we will learn nothing useful bolitho walked to the windows and watched some low banks of pale cloud a change in the weather perhaps tell him captain farquhar that he can have the boat and some food you can signal for a boat to be sent from the segura to javal he added those fishermen will be unable to confide what they have seen to their authorities the fact they disobeyed a portorder by putting to sea and return with a strange boat is proof enough of treachery javal swallowed hard then you intend to release them sir we may come i this way again captain javals astonishment settled it you cannot choose your friends in war and so while the fisherman and his son were taken to examine the spanish longboat the fat cousin described what he had seen everyday in toulon the santa paula s master had given bolitho a fair description but if anything it was a conservative estimate a well found fleet consisting of ships of the line aplenty and one of which according to the fisherman was of one hundred and twenty guns or more she it appeared wore the flag of vice admiral de brueys and another that of rear admiral villeneuve bolitho had heard of them both many times and respected them preparations went on daily to provision and service this great assembly of ships and the local victualling officers were making a special effort to purchase every available kind of food which had been the main reason for the fishermen putting to sea even their meagre catch would have brought ready money from the navy farquhar asked the man one careful question bolitho watched his reaction his gestures above his head and towards the sea farquhar explained softly the fleet is not yet ready to sail it is said to be waiting for the right time the leader of the expedition too his eyebrows lifted very slightly it could be so bolitho nodded he did not speak much french but knew enough to recognise the name bonaparte farquhar said he insists that one portion is ready to weigh sir several storeships and some kind of escort he glanced meaningly at the mans red features he is too much of a coward to lie i think he says that the ships will not sail because of our presence their cargo is probably very valuable and their destination bolitho made his decision send them off in their boat then signal the squadron to close on lysander we will stand further to the southrd will they risk it sir i would bolitho looked at javal i will report your first lieutenants part in all this he did well as did you risk luck coincidence all had shared in this first real piece of vital intelligence with his three seventyfours staying well out to sea and only buzzards lookouts watching for the enemys dash from port bolitho was in the best position to act as the situation dictated and when harebell reached the admiral it would be just a matter of time before a fleet and not a mere squadron came to complete what they had begun on the day that he watched the fishermen put over the side to begin their long haul back to the coast bolitho ordered his ships to their new position some twenty miles southwest of toulon he wrote his orders and had them passed to each captain he discussed the final details with farquhar and grubb and when dusk finally descended he went to his cabin and enjoyed a filling meal of boiled pork from the cask and the last of his cheese which he had carried from england as he sat at his table drinking a cup of coffee and listening to the creak and rattle of ships gear he thought of falmouth and the empty house there he thought too of the american captain and the wife who was waiting for him in new bedford what a homecoming it would be he could almost see it in his mind how long would it be he wondered before he saw falmouth again he had been in lysander for two months and already it felt ten times as long perhaps now that luck was with them again time would pass more swiftly with that thought uppermost in his mind he went to his cot and within minutes was in a deep dreamless sleep it seemed as if his head had been on the pillow but a short while when he felt a hand on his shoulder he awoke staring into alldays anxious face which shone yellow in a lantern above the cot what is it his senses returned and he struggled over the side of the cot he had no further need to ask and he cursed himself for sleeping so deeply the night was alive with noise and violent motion so that he almost fell as he groped his way to his chest allday said its come on to blow sir getting worse by the minute bolitho dragged on his breeches staggering as the deck plunged and threw him against allday in the name of heaven why wasnt i told of this allday said nothing but turned as ozzard appeared blinking in the door another lantern above his head get the commodores things man but bolitho snapped just a coat i must go on deck even before he reached the quarterdeck he knew it was no mere gale it was a fullscale storm and as he ducked beneath the poop deck beams he saw that the wheel was doubly manned the seamen clinging to the spokes while the deck heaved violently to leeward it took several more moments to accustom his eyes to the dark to pitch his hearing above the moan of wind the boom and thunder of canvas overhead figures darted past him crouching and groping for hand holds as spray lifted above the nettings and doused them violently before gurgling away through the scuppers every stay and shroud seemed to be vibrating and humming and he found time to pity the awakened watch below who even now must be fighting out along the yards to fist and reef the treacherous canvas he saw farquhar his slim figure very pale against the sea and sky his hands cupped as he yelled to one of the lieutenants he noticed bolitho and lurched towards him his fair hair streaming from his head he was dressed only in shirt and breeches and his feet were bare if anyother evidence was needed to show the height of the emergency bolitho could not think of it farquhar shouted winds veered to the norwest sir ive ordered the hands to reef topsls and take in the forecourse he swung round as a sound like a musket shot came from forward and then changed to a great rippling tear as the foresail exploded into a mass of flapping fragments they will be spared that bolitho clawed his way to the rail and peered along the slanting deck to one side the sea was as black as pitch to the other it lifted and surged in tremendous banks of foam building up beneath the quarter until the lee gunports were awash of the other ships there was no sign and he guessed that each captain would be too preoccupied to care much about lysanders plight he heard grubbs deep voice rising like a bellow ease off lads youll ave the sticks out of er else a man slipped beneath the weather gangway and fell kicking and yelling in a flood of swirling water he came up against an eighteenpounder and bolitho could almost im agine that he heard his ribs stove in in heavens name captain why so late the squadron will be driven for miles in this a broken halliard fell from aloft writhing about the upper deck like a live thing more would follow unless farquhar acted and immediately farquhar spat out spray and replied that fool gilchrist he left it too long by god where is that man ill have him bolitho gripped his arm there is no time now we must lieto and make the best of it farquhar stared at him nodding yes sir at once he sounded desperate bolitho did not release his arm bring her about as soon as youve shortened sail he had to shout to make himself heard we will lieto under the main topsls he ducked closing his eyes tightly as a wall of spray tumbled over the empty nettings and swept mercilessly across the deck and down to the one below but have the main staysl manned and ready to set in case the other carries away he heard farquhars voice receding as he struggled along the rail hand over hand saw the blurred shapes of seamen hurrying to obey above in the darkness he could see the wildly flapping sails where the topmen were still fighting to obey the last order voices too caught up in the deafening chorus of wind and sea of straining rigging and spars grubb shouted harshly pass the word stand by to come about he blinked at bolitho ill bet those damned frogs are laughin sir bolitho did not answer but it was uppermost in his thoughts a strong northwesterly was a curse to his squadron to any french commander trying to gauge the right time to quit toulon it would be merciful a chance he could not possibly ignore he watched as gilchrists beanpole figure emerged above the quarterdeck ladder shining dully in his long tarpaulin coat gilchrist had probably been more frightened of his captain than he had of the first storm signs or so eager to prove that he could manage any eventuality he had left it far too late for anything but submission he wiped his streaming face with one sleeve feeling the sting of salt in his eyes and mouth when he peered aloft again he saw that much of the canvas had vanished although the fore topsail was only lashed to its yard at one end at the other a great balloon of canvas filled and puffed as if it contained a living savage monster something passed across the scudding cloud formations and he ran to the rail as it struck the forecastle with a sickening thud a voice called hoarsely get that man below to the sickbay then lieutenant veitch belay that order theres nought the surgeon can do for him poor wretch he thought fighting the lashing sail with only his feet to support his body as he craned over the great swaying yard his messmates on either side of him all cursing and yelling into the darkness punching the wet hard canvas until their nails were tom out their knuckles raw one slip an extra gust of wind and he had fallen man the braces there stand by on the quarterdeck grubb snarled ease the spoke when i gives the word treat em like they was babies helm alee more figures staggered through the dismal gloom a midshipman bleeding from the head a seaman holding his arm to his side teeth bared with agony lee braces heale the lysander dipped her seventeenhundred tons of oak and artillery heavily into a maelstrom of bursting spray above in a shortened ironhard rectangle the reefed topsail seemed to swing independent of their muscle and bone every mast groaning to the strain of wind and sea bolitho saw it all heard his ship and seamen fighting to bring the bows round and into the wind to hold her under command if the rudder failed or the topsail was ripped to ribbons like the forecourse it might be too late for them to set the staysail and that could carry away just as easily but with the wheel hard over the helmsmens bare feet treading wet planking as if they were walking uphill the twodecker responded bolitho watched the sea boiling in board from the weather gangway to the beakhead saw it surging across and down to the opposite bulwark taking men and loose gear in its path much of it would find its way deep into the hull the pumps must be going now but in the din he could not hear them stores would be spoiled fresh water as precious as gunpowder polluted and rendered useless he released the nettings and allowed the wind to thrust him along the tilting deck until he fought his way aft to the compass grubb shouted ships ead is almost due north sir he turned to watch as a whimpering man was carried past she might be able to old it she must bolitho saw his words go home if werun before this wind well never beat back in time grubb watched him go and then said to a masters mate how say you mr plowman plowman gripped the binnacle for support his coat shining like sodden silk in the feeble lamp i told mr gilchrist to call all ands he added angrily god rot im e might ave been the death of us all grubb grimaced still time for that bolitho was on his way forward to the rail again when he heard a yell heads below fore tgallants coming adrift before anyone could move or act the uppermost spar on the foremast tilted violently to leeward hung for a few agonising seconds and then plunged down like a tree stays and shrouds all followed it in a great mass of rasping cordage and blocks until with a jarring crash it came to rest below the starboard bow the furled topgallant sail showing through the darkness like some nightmare tusk grubb shouted shes payin off sir he threw his considerable weight on the wheel its like a bloody anchor up forrard bolitho saw farquhar staggering along the weather gangway drenched to the skin one shoulder bare and bloodied by some fallen object from above it was all plain to see as if he were studying a diagram instead of watching a ship fighting for survival hadherrick been in command at this moment none of it would have happened no lieutenant would be too frightened to call him and no matter what herrick was like as a strategist and the squadrons secondincommand he was a superb seaman bolitho shouted get a strong party up forrard he strode past farquhar knowing that allday was close on his heels we donthave time to waste calls shrilled and voices responded bolitho saw marines and seamen some fully dressed some naked fighting through the torrential spray to where the boatswain and a handful of older men from the forecastle party were busy amidst the tangle of rigging bolitho felt the ship lift and then dip heavily into a long trough and heard several cries of alarm as the trapped top gallant mast and yard crashed against the hull he realised that pascoe was already there and shouted are you in charge pascoe shook his head mr yeo is cutting some of the rigging adrift sir he ducked like a prizefighter his arms bent as a great wall of water surged amongst the gasping men and mr gilchrist is leading the main party outboard by the cathead bolitho nodded good to allday he said well add our weight theres nothing more we can do aft he groped his way down and through the huge coils of tarred rope his shins and hands scarred within seconds a voice said gawd its the commodore lads another muttered then we must be in a bad way bolitho peered over the side seeing the frothy undertow beneath the bows the broken mast surging and veering into the hull like a battering ram in the darkness the jagged wood gleamed as if to mock their efforts to put a seal on their hopes he saw gilchrist waving his arms through the tangle like a man seized by a terrible seacreature axes mr yeo save the yard but hack the mast away as soon as you can a man tried to claw his way back from his precarious perch on the cathead but gilchrist seized him and forced him to look down past the massive anchorstock to the surging water below him we save the ship or go under together now catch a turn with that line or ill see your backbones tomorrow gilchrists fury his unintentional hint that there was indeed going to be a tomorrow seemed to have an effect grunting and swearing they threw themselves into battle with the fallen spars using their anger to hold fear at bay and drown the wail of the wind bolitho worked alongside the anonymous figures using the backbreaking work to steady his thoughts the topgallant mast could be replaced herrick had made certain of a good stock of spare spars before leaving england if the yard could be saved the ships sailpower should be normal again in a few days once they enjoyed calmer weather but it would take time tune when they should have been on their station the one lie had so carefully selected to snare the enemy supply ships gilchrist yelled mr pascoe take some men aft along the starboard gangway and grapple the spar pascoe nodded and touched the nearest men on shoulders or arms aye sir gilchrist peered up at him if you cannot save it then at least make sure it causes no further harm to the hull he broke off choking as spray leapt up and over the bowsprit when the water subsided in a great hissing torrent bolitho saw that the man gilchrist had been threatening had vanished he was probably somewhere in the darkness watching his ship moving away his cries lost in the angry wave crests more likely he had gone straight down it was a sad fact that few sailors could swim bolitho found himself praying that the man had died quickly and had been spared the agony of being left out there alone thud thud thud the axes hacked savagely at the rigging while other hands worked at hastily rigged tackles to sway the undamaged yard up and around the foremast there she goes the cry was taken up as with a grinding clatter of severed gear and cordage the released topgallant mast plunged freely down the lee side bolitho watched pascoes men struggling along the gangway trying to control the stilldangerous spar and then caught his breath as a line parted and another went bartaut scraping along the gangway rail and catching pascoe around the shoulders belay those lines midshipman luce dashed down the gangway heedless of the bursting spray cut him free another linesnapped and bolitho felt his blood chill as pascoe appeared to bow over the rail dragged helplessly towards the sea by the surging mass of rigging but luce was beside him now his slim frame bent under the black ropes as he hacked upwards with an axe yeo strode along the forecastle his quick eye and twenty years at sea telling him instantly of the midshipmans danger avast there mr luce but it was too late as the keen blade slashed away one of the broken stays another tightened automatically so that as pascoe fell gasping into the arms of two seamen luce was pinned against the side his arm taking the full weight when the ship lifted sluggishly to the wind he cried out once oh god help me then as yeo and the others reached him and cut the rigging free once and for all he fell senseless at their feet bolitho said quick allday take him below then he hurried along the gangway and helped pascoe to his feet how does it feel pascoe felt his spine and grimaced that was near he stared along the desk where is bill luce sir he struggled against the rail is he he was injured bolitho felt the ship responding slowly to her freedom indifferent perhaps to those who had suffered in the process i have had him taken to the surgeon pascoe stared at him oh no not after he saved my life bolitho sensed his distress could see the grief despite the enclosing darkness he added i will go below adam you remain here it hurt him to continue others need you now he walked aft seeing farquhar by the quarterdeck rail as if he had never moved farquhar blurted out thank you sir seeing you there helped the men to rally bolitho looked at him i doubt that but one captain aft is enough he peered up at the reefed topsail still ironhard but holding well in spite of the enormous pressure he said lam going to the sickbay are you hurt sir call me instantly if anything changes he walked to the companion no not physically that is as he made his way down and down by one ladder to the next he was conscious of the sea noises becoming muted the new sounds of straining timbers the smells of bilge and tar rising to greet him lanterns swayed and cast leaning shadows as he continued through the lower gun deck and below lysanders waterline where natural light was un known the year round outside this small sickbay he found several seamen resting after treatment some bandaged some lying in an escape of sleep and rum the air was thick with the combined smells of pain and blood he entered the sickbay where henry shacklock the surgeon was talking to some of his assistants as they arranged two more lanterns above his table shacklock glanced up and saw bolitho sir he was a tiredlooking man with thin hair in the swaying yellow light he appeared almost bald although he was not yet thirty bolitho had found him to be a good doctor which was unfortunately rare in kings ships how is mr luce the men stood aside and bolitho realised that the midshipman was already lying on the table he was naked and his face was set in a frown the skin very pale shacklock lifted a rough dressing from his shoulder bolitho guessed that the rope had cut through the flesh and muscle like wire through cheese the lower arm lay at an unnatural angle the fingers unclenched and relaxed shacklock held his own hand above the midshipmans arm the palm open like a ruler it was less than six inches below the point of his shoulder he said it must come off sir he pursed his lips even then bolitho looked down at luces pale face seventeen years of age no age at all are you certain what was the point he had heard it asked so often yes shacklock nodded to his assistants the sooner the better he might not come to his senses before it is done at that moment luce s eyes opened they stayed fixed on bolithos face unmoving and yet in those few seconds they seemed to understand everything which had happened and what was to come he made to move but bolitho gripped his uninjured shoulder his skin was like ice and his hair still wet with the spray from that other howling world three decks above he said you saved mr pascoes life he kept his voice steady adam will come as soon as he can beyond the boys head he saw shacklock taking two knives from a case one short the other long and thin an assistant was wiping something below a lantern and as the deck tilted and the man lurched sideways he realised it was a saw luce whispered quietly my arm sir he was starting to weep please sir bolitho reached out and took a cup of rum from a loblolly boy drink this he forced it to his lips as much as you can he saw it slopping out of his mouth could feel his body trembling as if in a terrible fever it was all they had rum with opium to follow the operation as a sedative he heard footsteps and then pascoes voice taut and barely recognisable the captain sends his respects sir we have just sighted nicator bolitho straightened his back but kept his hand on luce s shoulder thank you around him the shadows loomed nearer like angels of death as shacklocks men waited to begin stay with him adam he made himself look at the midshipman he was staring up at him the rum and tears mingling on his throat only his mouth moved as he whispered again please he waited until pascoe was by the boys head and then said to shacklock do your best the surgeon nodded i have had the blades warmed to lessen the shock sir as bolitho made to leave he saw the surgeon give a signal heard luce cry out as the assistants gripped his legs and held his head back on the table bolitho had reached the upper deck when luce screamed the sound seemed to follow him up and into the wind where it ended abruptly bolitho rested both hands on his chart and studied it for several more seconds the storm had blown itself out in two long days and nights so that the warm sunlight and the gentle breeze in the sails made it feel as if the ship was all but becalmed around his table the other captains sat watching him each wrapped in his own thoughts all weary from the storms anger and the battle for survival throughout the scattered squadron seventeen men had been killed by falls from aloft or being swept overboard some had vanished without trace as if they had never been it was midafternoon and with the ships sailing in a loose formation once again bolitho had ordered all his captains to gather for a conference he looked at javals dark features his news had been expected and yet perhaps even to the last he had still hoped but as they had sighted buzzards topsails shortly after dawn the signal had been shouted down from the maintop the french had put to sea a dozen ships maybe more had sailed with the stiff northwest wind under their coattails while javal and his men had watched helplessly while they fought to keep the enemy in view the french commander had even allowed for such an eventuality two frigates had swept out of the storm and had raked buzzards rigging before standing off to follow the convoy into the darkness for a fighter like javal it must have been terrible with his rigging slashed and the storm mounting every minute he had been forced to watch the french slipping away he had tried to make contact with the squadron by firing signal guns and loosing off a flare but while gilchrist had waited too late and the ships of the line had steered comfortably along their allotted course the storm had made even that contact im possible bolitho said slowly the admiral should have examined the despatches sent in harebell he will assume that we are capable of standing watch over toulon or of shadowing any vessels which try to elude us overhead he heard the stamp of feet as lerouxs marines completed another drill hammers and adzes added their own sounds to show that the carpenters crew were also busy completing storm repairs he looked at herrick wondering what he was thinking probyn said heavily now that the french have avoided your er ambush it must leave us all in some doubt perhaps we placed too much value in hearsay in rumour who knows where those french ships may be now he looked slowly round the table let alone what we can hope to do without information bolitho watched him impassively probyn had been careful to use we he had meant you javal shrugged and yawned i could detach from the squadron sir i might be able to find some if not all of the frenchmen after all the storm will not have made their passage an easy one bolitho felt them looking at him some would understand perhaps share his dilemma if he sent the buzzards in pursuit he would be without eyes the twodeckers and the prize ship would have their visibility reduced to the vision of the best masthead lookout so with little agility or speed to investigate he had to hold on to his one and only frigate probyn added of course we could return to gibraltar sir better to add our strength to any fleet which may be assembling than to wander blindly to no purpose herrick spoke for the first time that would be an admission of failure it would be the wrong decision in my opinion he looked at bolitho his eyes level we know how you must feel sir farquhar snapped abruptly it is the devils own luck javal said its the devils own choice he looked at bolitho curiously for you sir yes bolitho let his gaze move along and down across the chart of the mediterranean all those miles even if he were right in his guesswork and it was no more than that as probyn had stated he might still fail to make contact with the enemy ships could pass one another in the night or in foul weather and be none the wiser an empire could fall because of a wrong choice a hasty decision he said this is what we will do it had come as if it had been there in his mind from the beginning our present position as far as we can estimate is about sixty miles west of corsica s north coast he tapped the chart with his dividers capecorse the storm carried us too far to the eastrd to make another passage profitable he saw them crane forward above the table so we will continue and once around the north cape of corsica we will steer southeast he watched his dividers moving remorselessly further and further down the italian coastline we will put into syracuse to take on water and land our badly injured people the sicilians may have news for us they are at peace with the french but have little love for them he looked up sharply while we are at anchor buzzard will sail independently around the eastern side of sicily by way of the messinastrait and make a rendezvous with the squadron off malta i will be able to give you better information captain javal once we have made some progress he eyed them separately he was committed and he had com mitted each one of them and every manjack in the squadron herrick cleared his throat and then sir then captain herrick he held his gaze seeing the worry building up on his face we will know what to expect he smiled briefly i hope probyn spread his heavy hands on the table they were like pink crabs if we fail there also sir id not be happy to face the admiral bolitho faced him calmly it is support i want captain probyn not sympathy spray pattered against the stern windows and he added i think it best if you return to your ships the wind is freshen ing by the feel of it the chairs scraped back from the table and they looked at each other like strangers probyn gathered up his hat and sword and said i trust that new orders will be passed to us sir he did not look at him as he spoke herrick snapped there is no need for that surely i think there is probyn fiddled with his sword belt i would not wish to insist upon it bolitho nodded it will be done farquhar rapped on the screen door with his knuckles and when the sentry appeared he said signal for the boats tell the first lieutenant to assemble the side party probyn asked how is your first lieutenant by the way adequate farquhar watched him coldly bolitho turned away you know him then probyn coughed not really sir perhaps a passing acquaintance they took their leave as boat by boat they were pulled back to their various commands herrick was the last he said simply the fore tgallant mast sir when i knew of lysanders difficulties in the storm i got to thinking maybe she took a ball through the forerigging and the rope woolding around the mast hid the damage it is not unknown bolitho smiled perhaps but it was none of your doing bolitho saw him looking around the decks and tried to read his mind loss anxiety or merely curiosity and you thomas is everything satisfactory herrick turned to watch his barge pulling for the main chains osirisis a smart ship sir ive no complaints but shes no heart no zest bolitho wanted to reach out for him to make him know that the sense of loss went both ways but it was not yet time and he knew it he said take care thomas the marine guard shuffled to attention and the bosuns mates raised their silver calls in preparation to see herrick over the side but he hung back his face lined with emotions then he said if you take the squadron to the turkish forts and beyond youll not find me far astern he faltered his eyes pleading i just wanted you to know to understand bolitho held out his hand i do thomas he gripped it tightly now he watched farquhar and herrick exchange salutes and then walked slowly across the quarterdeck to the weather side the sails were booming in confusion while the ship lay hoveto to rid herself of her visitors and bolitho did not hear the footsteps beside him it was pascoe his dark eyes heavy with strain he had been standing watches and carrying out his duties throughout the storm but at every available moment he had been below with his friend bolitho asked is something wrong pascoe lifted his arms and let them fall again sir i he shook his head he is gone he died a minute ago bolitho watched him seeing his distress sharing it he was a fine boy he touched his arm turning him slightly so that some passing marines should not see his face and it is often harder to accept that sailors give their lives to the sea as much as they do in battle pascoe shivered he never complained not after that first terrible cut i held his hand and just today i thought he was a little better and then he broke off unable to finish farquhar strode to the rail and touched his hat permission to get the squadron under way sir he glanced at pascoe his eyes without compassion the wind is certainly freshening if you please and signal buzzard to take station to leerd and ahead of the squadron he knows what to expect he stepped in front of pascoe i think this officer might be excused from duty for the present farquhar nodded very well but pascoe said im all right now sir he adjusted his hat and moved towards the ladder id like to attend to my work if i may farquhars lips twisted in a smile then it is settled bolitho followed them to the rail seeing the seamen manning the braces and halliards waiting to execute the first part of his new orders pascoe hesitated his foot in the air above the gun deck there is one thing sir when will we be burying him at dusk he watched the pain in pascoes eyes i just thought my sword id like it to go over with him ive not much else bolitho waited until pascoe had joined his division and then returned to the poop ladder grubb remarked quietly a fine young officer ell be one day sir bolitho nodded he suits me very well as he stands aye the master shaded his redrimmed eyes to watch the flapping pendant high above the deck theres some oo can give orders but never learn nuthin thank godes not one o them bolitho continued up the ladder and walked right aft to the gilded taffrail below the poop he heard the helmsmans cry course due east sir steady as she goes he watched the lithe frigate forging swiftly ahead of her bulky consorts but for once felt no envy of her freedom this was his place and only the rights of his decisions would decide if he should hold it he thought of pascoe and herrick and allday who was moving about in the cabin below and this time he had to be right if only for men such as these the letter will that be all for now sir moffitt the clerk regarded bolitho gloomily his weedy frame angled to the deck yes thank you bolitho leaned back in his chair and loosened his neckcloth tell ozzard to light some lanterns he looked astern through the great windows at the fiery orange sunset one more dragging day it was two weeks since he had committed his ships to the passage south and to all intents they had the sea to themselves day after day using the light winds to steer southeast along the italian coastline and then tacking around to the westward to follow the hazy shores of sicily lying about thirty miles off the larboard bow and apart from a few arab craft with their strange lateen rig they had been unable to make contact with another living soul they had sighted some isolated sails but they had made off before the slowmoving seventyfours could draw near enough to examine them bolitho stared at the empty desk wondering why he bothered to dictate another empty days report for moffitts benefit it was unlikely to carry much weight unless as additional evidence at his own court martial he wondered what the buzzard was doing and if she had had any luck in finding information about the vanished frenchmen or if once free of his commodores eye and his needs blurred by distance javal had gone off to seek gains of his own he knew he was being unfair to javal just as he understood that it was his own desperation which was causing t he stood up and strode to the door it had been his custom for as long as he could remember to find peace if not answers to his doubts while watching sunsets he ran quickly up the ladder and on to the poop deck allowing the northwesterly to play through his shirt to ease away the heat and staleness of the day he walked to the weather side and gripped the nettings watching the vast spread of copper and gold strengthening as it hardened along the horizon it was very beautiful even awesome and he was not surprised to find he was still moved by it he had watched the suns parting display from every sort of deck from the chill wastes of the atlantic to the scorching magnificence of the greatsouthsea bolitho saw nicatots fore topsail flapping and then refilling as she changed course slightly astern of osiris how untroubled the three ships must appear if there had been anyone tosee them pass nothing to reveal the teeming life within their rounded hulls or the work of repairing storm damage which even now was still going on changing watches sail and gun drill eating and sleeping it was their world his world and yet even after a full day of it probably a twin of the one before and the next beyond it these men could still find time to escape from each other in their own way bone carving and scrimshaw work intricate designs made out of rope and scraps of metal it was difficult to understand how such delicate and finely made objects could come from the hands of british seamen snuffboxes too much prized in the wardroom by less experienced officers which had been worked and polished from chunks of salt beef such boxes were as hard and as brightly polished as mahogany and said much for their makers skill as well as for their digestion under normal circumstances deck there land on the lee bow bolitho walked to the opposite side and peered towards the other horizon already deep purple as the sky followed the retreating sun like a curtain that would be a part of malta he thought gozo most likely below the poop rail he heard a masters mate bark you whats yer name larssen is it a mumbled reply and then the same voice i told yer i told yer an i told yer watch the compass and watch the set of the sails dont just stand agawpin until the ship pays off under yer jesus youll never rate quartermaster not in a undred years another voice this time bolitho recognised the haughty lilt of lieutenant fitzclarence whats the fuss mr bagley the masters mate replied nuthin much just that the poor old ship is so full of furriners i ave to tell em every thin twice bolitho began to walk loosely back and forth across the empty poop bagley was right of course like many kings ships lysander had gathered a good portion of foreign seamen into her belly swedes and spaniards hanoverians and danes there were eleven negroes and one canadian who spoke better french than farquhar he thought suddenly of the american captain john thurgood he would have dropped his cargo and be on his return run by now his would not be the only happy homecoming the spanish sailors whom bolitho had sent to the barquentine from the prize ship segura would make their wives and mothers weep and laugh when thurgood sent them ashore in their own country he paused by the rail again and looked astern but the segura was too well hidden by the other ships to be seen he sighed he had sent some of her crew to an american barquentine and one of her boats he had given to some french fishermen in exchange for information information which he had been unable to transform into results because of the storm or because he had failed to grasp the situation completely and by so doing had failed his squadron feet clattered on a ladder and the midshipman of the watch approached him warily well mr glasson the midshipman touched his hat mr fitzclarences respects sir the masthead has reported sighting land to the southeast the master confirms it is malta sir thank you bolitho looked at him gravely glasson was seventeen and had taken over as signals midshipman following luces death there was no other similarity glasson was hard and sharpfeatured with a tongue and a sense of discipline to match he would make a bad lieutenant if he lived that long it was strange and pitiful how many there were like glasson who never learned from the frightful stories of mutiny when the power of the quarterdeck became a small and isolated community in the twinkling of an eye between the wars there has been blighs bounty which had captured the nations imagination civilians were ever eager to seek out the good or evil of happenings in which they were not involved and where they suffered no threat or inconvenience then the great uprisings at the nore and spithead both caused by grievances longoutstanding by the men of the fleet and just before he had sailed for gibraltar to hoist his broad pendant in lysander bolitho had listened shocked and appalled to the latest evidence of what could happen when men and their resources were pressed beyond limits hm frigate hermione had sailed into the spanish port of laguaira and surrendered herself to the enemy her officers had been butchered in the most horrible manner and some of her loyal hands had suffered a similar fate the mutineers had offered their ship to an enemy in exchange for their own freedom bolitho did not know much more of the mutiny other than that the frigate had been under the command of a tyrant as he looked at glasson much of whose confidence was fast departing under his commodores stare he marvelled that the lesson still went unheeded what are your hopes for the future glasson drew himself up to serve my king sir and to gain my own command very commendable bolitho added dryly did you learn anything from duties aboard our prize the midshipman relaxed slightly the dons who man her are dolts they know nothing and their vessel is in a filthy state bolitho did not hear him he was thinking of the letter the french agent named yves gorse he could feel the blood rushing through his brain like fire suppose the frenchman did not know which vessel should be bringing instructions from toulon with communications so difficult and the final french intentions still a wellguarded secret it was likely he would know little about the form of delivery he turned to glasson my compliments to the flag captain i should like him to join me on the poop farquhar arrived five minutes later to find bolitho striding from side to side hands clasped behind him as if he were in a state of trance farquhar suggested you have come upon a fresh idea sir bolitho stopped and looked at him i think maybe others gave it to me i was too involved with my anxieties to heed the obvious sir i heard the masters mate bagley reprimanding one of the helmsmen because he did riot understand him immediately farquhar frowned that would be larssen sir i can have him removed no no bolitho faced him it was not that and something glasson said about the segura just now i see sir farquhar was lost at least i think i do bolitho smiled segura we have been keeping her with out knowing why vanity perhaps evidence that we did not fail at everything and as time went on we forgot she was there farquhar watched him doubtfully his eyes glowing in the sunset shes too slow for scouting sir i thought wed agreed on that bolitho nodded have a new prize crew detailed and send the remaining spaniards into the squadron tell a lieutenant of your choice that i want the prize crew to be as foreign as he can find aye sir there was not even surprise now farquhar probably believed the strain and responsibility had at last driven him mad and i want it done immediately signal the squadron to heaveto before the light goes completely farquhar made to hurry away what will the lieutenant be required to do if i may venture to ask sir do captain he turned away to conceal his sudden excitement he will sail the segura into malta under false colours american i think and there he will deliver a letter for me farquhar exclaimed the french agent just so he started to pace i suggest you start at once farquhar waited a moment longer its a great risk sir you told me that before as did thomas herrick have you never taken risks farquhar smiled the men will most probably desert once they are m malta and the officer in charge will be seized and likely hanged the knights of malta are only too aware of the danger in incurring france s displeasure they have been friendly to us in the past he shrugged but the french army and navy are much nearer than they were then i agree nor would i expect a junior lieutenant to be used in this way farquhar watched him with new interest you intend to go with segura under all circumstances yes midshipman glasson had been right about one thing bolitho decided the prize ship segura was not only dirty but also contained so many smells of varying ages and strength that it was hard not to retch when between decks it was pitchdark by the time the new prize crew were ferried across in exchange for the remaining spaniards and with two good hands on the wheel and canvas reduced to a minimum for the night segura was left to her own devices bolitho sat in the tiny cabin and munched some salt pork and ironhard biscuits which he tried to dissolve in the ships plentiful supply of red wine farquhar had picked lieutenant matthew veitch to accompany him and he had already proved that he was as good aboard an unfamiliar vesselas he had been directing lysanders eighteen pounders during their fight against the two frenchmen in his middletwenties veitch appeared a good deal older and more experienced than his age suggested he came from the north of england from tynemouth and his hard accent added to his normally stem features made him seem too advanced for his years but he could wipe it away with a ready smile and bolitho had noticed that his seamen liked and respected him plowman the senior masters mate was again selected to join the expedition and mr midshipman arthur breen a carrotheaded sixteenyearold whose face was a mass of freckles completed the vessels senior authority they had been so busy settling into their new ship that the shadowy topsails of the three seventyfours had vanished into the gathering darkness before anyone had found time to comment bolitho looked up as veitch entered the cramped cabin watch yourself but it was too late veitch gave a gasp as his head cracked violently against a deck beam bolitho pointed to a chest sit down and save your skull he pushed a wine bottle towards him is everything se cure aye sir veitch threw back his head and drained a metal goblet ive got em standing watch and watch it keeps em busy and makes sure we dontget pounced on by some enemy patrol bolitho listened to the vessels unfamiliar sounds the rattle of rigging the very near movements of the rudder segura was roundlybuilt probably dutch originally whenever originally had been her holds were spacious for her size and packed to the seams with cargo and gunpowder her sail plan was austere and manageable with the minimum amount of hands again it made her almost certain to be dutchbuilt profitable both in space and size of crew she had doubtless worked every coastline from the baltic to the african shores but she was old and her spanish masters had let her go badly plowman had already reported on the poor quality of her standing rigging and topping lifts some of which he described as being as thin as a sailors wallet but plowman was grubbs righthand man like the master he was not content with unreliable workmanship bolitho smiled to himself if plowman was bothered the seamen selected for the prize crew appeared quite the opposite even aboard the lysander as he had spoken to them briefly before they had clambered into the boats he had noticed their grins and nudges the cheerful acceptance of their surprise role escape from boredom something to do to break the daily routine or maybe the fact that each was handpicked helped to extend this carefree atmosphere the notion they had been chosen mostly for their foreign tongues had not apparently arisen he could hear someone singing a strange lilting song and a regular chorus of voices as the watch below joined in there was an unusual smell of cooking in the damp air between decks too further evidence of their new identity veitch grinned theyve settled in well sir thats larssen singing and the one detailed to cook is a dane so god knows what well be eating tonight bolitho looked round as plowman entered the cabin he said ive left mr breen with the watch sir he took the wine and regarded it gratefully well thankee sir bolitho glanced at them approvingly each including himself wore a plain blue coat and a scruffier trio it would be hard to find typical he hoped of the countless hundreds of trading captains who sailed under every flag and carried any cargo they could find for a profit tomorrow well run for malta bolitho watched as plowman tamped black tobacco in a long clay pipe i am captain he smiled gravely richard pascoe you can keep your own names mr veitch will be first mate mr plowman second my coxn allday will be filling the part of boatswain plowman hesitated and then thrust a great pot of tobacco across the rickety table if youd care to try it sir its well its fair bolitho took a pipe from a sandalwood box above the small chart table and handed another to veitch anything once mr plowman he became serious i will go ashore with allday and a boats crew you will appear to be preparing to open hatches but be ready to cut the cable and put to sea if anything goes wrong if this should happen you can stand inshore for a further two nights where i have marked on the chart if there is still no signal from me you must rejoin the squadron at syracuse captain farquhar will act accordingly the air thickened visibly with smoke and bolitho said fetch some more wine from the locker like our people up forrard i feel strangely at peace tonight anyway shoes clicked overhead and veitch smiled young mr breen is alone up there he is feeling like a postcaptain no doubt bolitho let the drowsiness move over him he thought of pascoe his dark eyes eager and pleading as he had asked to be allowed to join him he touched the old sword which lay against the table perhaps he should have left it in lysander if anything happened to him the sword would probably disappear forever and it was important in some strange way that pascoe should have it one day he did not see veitch give a winkto plowman who rose and said id better go an relieve mr breen sir veitch nodded and i must go forrard and see that all is well he stood up and cracked his head again damn these stingy shipbuilders sir he grinned ruefull y a ship of the line maybe is crowded but she keeps a man s head on his shoulders alone once more bolitho leaned over his chart and studied it beneath a spiralling lantern he removed his blue coat and loosened his neckcloth feeling the sweat running freely down his spine it was stiflingly hot and the wine had not slaked his thirst allday entered the cabin im bringing something to eat in a minute sir he wrinkled his nose this hull stinks like exeter market the heat is no help to us bolitho threw down his dividers i will go on deck for a breath of air directly as you will sir allday watched him pass i will send word when your meal is ready he looked round the untidy cabin and shrugged damp dirty and smelly it certainly was but after the oppressive heat of the day it felt almost cool he saw the empty wine bottles andchuckled the commodores heat was probably an inner one brail up the foresl bolitho shaded his eyes to examine the untidy sprawl of sandcoloured fortifications which protected every entrance to valletta harbour as they had made their slow approach and had watched the sun rise behind malta s weatherworn defences it had been hard for some of the seamen to see it for anything but a fortress steady as you go plowman shifted his sturdy frame around the helmsmen a pipe jutting from his jaw bolitho knew that he like most of the others was finding it difficult to act in this casual and slack fashion after the rigid discipline of a kings ship and at no other time was there anything more important about a ships appearance than when entering harbour bolitho ran his eye along the littered deck seamen lounged against either bulwark pointing at landmarks some with genuine interest others with elaborate pretence midshipman breen said ive heard of this island many times sir i never thought id ever see it plowman grinned aye valletta was so named after the grand master of the knights in honour of is defence of it against the turks were you here then breen watched the masters mate with undisguised awe ardly mr breen that was over two undred years back he looked at veitch and shook his head was i ere indeed the nearest fortress was gliding abeam now its upper rampart crowded with colourful figures it was apparently used as much as a thoroughfare as a bastion beyond it bolitho saw the glittering water opening up to receive the segura the harbour was busy with shipping and tiny oared boats which scurried back and forth from vessels to jetties like waterbeetles there were a few schooners gaunt arab dhows and the more common feluccas with their huge lateen sails two painted and giltencrusted galliasses lay beside a flight of stone steps like things from the past they might have looked not too much out of place when the romans had conquered england bolitho thought the knights of malta had used them very successfully over the centuries for harrying turkish ports and shipping and had done much to drive the turks influence away from the west it was hoped for good but now malta s role had changed again it had with drawn on to its own resources combing revenue and trade from ships which came to the harbour or anchored out of sheer necessity through storm or attack by corsairs stand by the anchor bolitho strode to the foot of the mainmast and watched for any sign of a challenge in fact there was little interest so he guessed that segura was not the first vessel to enter wearing the american flag allday whispered by god it will take mr gilchrist a year to get these lads to jump like seamen again he grinned as one of the men spat deliberately on the deck and then grinned somewhat sheepishly at his companions such an act would have cost him a dozen lashes in lysander veitch called hands wear ship bolitho took a brass telescope and trained it on the longest stone jetty boats were already shoving off laden to their gunwales with fruit basketware and probably women as well for despite the original christian standards and guidance within these stout walls the core had long since deteriorated and it was hinted that even the knights themselves looked more to personal enjoyments than to heaven helm alee the segura tilted above her shadow the patched sails barely moving as she headed into the wind and her rusting anchor splashed into clear water mr veitch if you allow these bumboats alongside i suggest you make certain their occupants stay in them you can let a few aboard at a time theyll get out of control otherwise veitch gave a rare smile aye sir itd be a powerful combination eh a hold full of wine some british tars and whatever mischief these traders are about to offer allday was already mustering a small but fearsome looking anchor watch each man was armed with a cutlass and in addition a heavy wooden stave lower the boat bolitho wiped his face and throat it was more stifling in the harbour than below decks the first craft were already alongside the merchants and boatmen standing upright to display their wares and vieing with each other in a variety of tongues veitch came aft again all done sir ive got two swivels loaded with canister and a stand of muskets hidden under the focsle i noticed that the harbour batteries face seaward so well be all right for the present bolitho nodded people who build fortresses often make that mistake they never expect an attack from the rear he thought of the charge down a spanish hillside the crackle of musket fire and the marines cheering like fiends as they went in with their bayonets fixed just as well boats lowered sir allday strode to the bulwark by the main shrouds as a darkskinned little man wearing a turban and hung about with beads bottles and gaudy daggers tried to climb on to the deck wait for the order mustapha allday cupped his hand under the mans chin and sent him pitching back into the water it raised a chorus of laughter and jeers from the unfortunate bumboatmans companions who probably considered that this vessels master if hardhearted was at least going to be fair to all veitch followed bolitho to the rail if an official comes aboard sir shall i bluff it out bolitho had been in malta before he smiled grimly be guided by mr plowman i suspect he has visited here on other unorthodox missions the port officers may decide to wait until you show signs of unloading but if they come and ask for your papers tell them what i told you to say that we had to throw them overboard when chased by an unknown ship you will find a bag of gold coins in the cabin to grease the hawse for you plowman grinned at the lieutenants uncertainty love you mr veitch port officials are the same everywhere an with more an more yankee ships finding their ways into the mediterranean theyll not want to lose a new sort of trade bolitho threw one leg over the rail and watch our people there may be french spies amongst these bumboat men itll do no harm to spread the notion anyway he clambered down into the segura s remaining longboat shove off as the boat pulled away he saw one of the traders tap smartly on a pile of rugs and from beneath it he also saw a smooth rounded arm pushing the covering aside it was no mans arm with segura s captain out of the way the real trading was about to begin allday murmured top of the stairs sir two officers of some kind but the officers paid them little attention other than a courteous nod and continued to watch the anchored newcomer possibly judging the right moment to board her bolitho stood on the hot stonework and waited for allday and one other to climb up beside him the seaman was the swede larssen he had a cheerful trusting expression and one of the broadest pairs of shoulders bolitho had seen allday remarked in case we run into a spot of trouble he paused and looked at him you all right sir bolitho replied of course dont fuss he turned away send the boat away we will attract as little attention as possible he heard allday speaking to the boats crew and tried not to keep plucking the shirt away from his body it was wringing with sweat and he felt strangely lightheaded the wine some of the food he had eaten last night inwardly another more likely reason was already forming and it was all he could do to conceal his sudden anxiety it was improbable surely he gritted his teeth willing allday to finish with the boat and follow him into some shadow but it was not impossible nearly nine years ago in the greatsouthsea the fever had all but killed him he had had a few bouts of it since but not for a year or so he almost cursed aloud it could not be it must not happen now of all times allday said ready sir good now let us find that address and finish the matter he swayed and touched alldays shoulder damn as he pushed his way through a group of chattering traders allday watched him with sudden alarm larssen asked the captain is he not well allday gripped his arm tightly listen and listen good if its what i think it is hes going to be all aback within the hour stay with me and do whatever i do see the swede shrugged yes sir mr allday mercifully the address was not far from the harbour stairs in fact the white walled building was attached to one of the smaller fortresses as if for support and from a broad balcony bolitho could see the end of a large telescope trained across the anchorage like a gun he felt beneath his coat to make sure his pistol was loose and ready to draw he was taking a great gamble perhaps this french agent already knew of the vessels fate which had been entrusted with this letter the convoy which buzzard had chased and with which the ship had been sailing might have been into malta left word and gone on to its intended destination but he still believed it unlikely a letter of such importance if such it was would have been carried by one of the french escorting frigates and then sent ashore by boat probably at night he said shortly come along we shall have to make haste the lower part of the building was filled with wine casks and mounds of straw for packing bottles a few maltese labourers were rolling empty barrels down a ramp to a cellar and a boredlooking man with a ruffled shirt and mustardcoloured breeches was writing in a ledger on the top of another cask he looked up his eyes wary sit he could have been almost anything from greek to dutchman bolitho said i only speak english im master of the american ship which has just anchored the man did not reply at once but there was no doubt in his eyes no lack of understanding then he said american yes i understand bolitho cleared his throat and tried to keep his voice steady i wish to see msieu gorse again the unwavering stare but no cry of alarm no rush of feet from this mans assistants he replied eventually i am not certain that i can arrange it allday stepped forward his face bleak if the capn says he wants to see him thats it matey we aint come all this way with a goddamn letter just to be kept waiting the man gave a tight smile i ave to be careful he looked meaningly at the harbour so do you he closed the ledger and beckoned them to some narrow stone steps bolitho looked at allday stay here with larssen his mouth was completely dry and the roof of it was burning like hot sand he shook his head with sudden impatience no arguments if things go wrong now one will have as much of a chance as three he tried to smile to reassure him i call soon enough if need be he turned his back and followed the man up the steps through a door and into a long room one side of which was open to the harbour and the spread of ships and buildings which shimmered in the sunlight like a great tapestry ah capitaine a white figure moved from the balcony i alf expected it would be you yves gorse was short and rotund he had a thick black beard as if to compensate for his complete blandess and small delicate hands which were never still bolitho eyed him calmly i would have been here sooner but i ran foul of a british frigate had to throw my papers overboard but managed to shake the bastard off in a storm i see gorse pointed one delicate hand to a chair please be seated you look unwell capitaine im well enough peraps gorse walked to the window and stared down at the water and you are called pascoe its a cornish name i am aware of that captaine he turned with remarkable lightness but i am not aware of any captaine pascoe bolitho shrugged in this game we must learn to trust each other surely game gorse moved around the room it was never that although your country is still too young to appreciate the dangers bolitho retorted angrily have you forgotten about our revolution i seem to recall it came a goodly few years before yours touche gorse smiled showing small but perfect teeth i meant no offence now this letter may i aye it bolitho pulled it from his pocket you see msieu i trust you gorse opened the letter and held it in a patch of sunlight bolitho tried not to watch him to search for some sign that gorse had noticed how the letter had been resealed gorse however seemed satisfied no relieved was more the word for it he said good now peraps you will take some wine better than the muck you will be carrying toer where are you bound bolitho clenched his fingers in his pockets to control his limbs they felt as if they were shaking so badly that gorse must surely have noticed this was the moment if he tried to fence with gorse or attempted to trick him further the man would know immediately gorse was a trusted enemy agent his outward cover of wine merchant and chandler would have been built up carefully over many years which meant he would have no wish to return to france a country very different from the one he must have left a long while ago many of his fellow merchants had breathed their last while staring down into a bloodied basket and waiting for the blade to drop malta stood like an awkward sentinel in the gateway between the western and eastern mediterranean his work in gathering intelligence for france would stand him in good stead especially when that fleet sailed from toulon as sail it must he replied casually corfu of course theres no change id have thought my friend john thurgood would have anchored here in his santa paula he had the same destination as i expect you well know gorse smiled modestly i know many things bolitho tried to relax to find comfort that his lie was accepted but he was feeling much worse and he knew his breathing was getting faster visions flashed across his mind like parts of a nightmare the pale beaches and waving palms at tahiti and beyond to other islands pictures at odds with men dying horribly of fever and the remainder drawing together in terror and despair he heard himself ask the letter was it good news it was captaine although the maltese people may think otherwise when the time comes he appeared concerned i realiy i must insist that you rest you do not seem well at all bolitho said fever long time ago coming back again he had to speak in short sentences but i will be ready to sail but there is no urry you can rest a look of alarm crossed his face unless it is dangerous to others bolitho stood up and steadied himself against the chairback no call my men i will feel better aboard the ship as you wish he snapped his fingers to someone outside the door even through his dizziness bolitho was able to grasp that gorse had been prepared to kill him had posted men out of sight for the purpose if he had failed to convince him he managed to ask do you wish me to carry any letters to corfu msieu no gorse regarded him worriedly my next letters will come by more direct means allday loomed into the room the swede at his back gorse snapped your captain is ill bolitho felt allday gripping his arm easy sir well soon have you safe down the steep steps and out into the merciless sunlight again he was more carried than aided and he was dimly aware of passing maltese grinning at the three sailors who had emerged so unsteadily from a wine store allday barked go on ahead larssen an signal for the boat he added harshly if youre not at the jetty when we gets there ill find you if it takes a lifetime bolitho felt himself being helpedinto some shade his body was streaming with sweat but unlike the previous time it was icecold so that he could not stop shivering he gasped must get on it was no use his strength was fading fast must tell the squadron then he collapsed completely four seamen led by larssen came running up from the harbour and stared at allday with surprise allday rapped lively carry him to the boat he pulled off his coat and wrapped it round bolitho and dontstop for anyone it seemed an endless stretch of water between jetty and ship and every foot of the way allday held bolitho against his body his eyes on the segura s loosely furled sails willing them closer as far as he was concerned the squadron the french and the whole bloody world could go their own way if anything happened to bolitho nothing else would matter divided loyalties almost identical in a relentless heathaze the three ships of the line lay quietly at anchor within a cables length of the land captain thomas herrick crossed to the larboard side of osiriss quarterdeck and stared at the unfamiliar hills the lush greens and the hostile crags where some of the headland had fallen into the sea below syracuse remote even unfriendly so that their powerful presence anchored amongst the unhurried movements of small coastal craft made the impression doubly vivid in herricks mind he bit his lip and toyed with the idea of going below again but the great stern cabin always seemed to be waiting lying there like a trap part of farquhar he shifted his gaze to lysander and felt the old longing and despair welling up to join his other constant anxiety they had been at anchor for over two weeks the syracuse garrison commandant had been aboard lysander several times accompanied on each occasion by a rotund worried looking englishman john manning who was as herrick understood it one of his brittanic majestys last official representatives in the island for even if sicily showed no sign of helping france she was equally determined not to display open friendship to king george herrick moved restlessly about the deck only partly aware of the blazing heat across his shoulders whenever he showed himself beyond one of the awnings when he had first heard of bolithos intention to find and contact a french agent in malta it had already been too late to protest segura had been swallowed up in the darkness and from that moment on herrick had fretted and worried continuously and now it was all of three weeks since segura had parted company not a sign of the prize ship nor any word from the british representative in syracuse that she had entered or left valletta harbour john manning was more concerned about finding reasons for the three seventyfours to stay at anchor in a port which was officially neutral repairs taking on food and water all the usual reasons had been sent ashore and still no word came bolitho must have been seized by the maltese authorities they were even more frightened of the french than the sicilians if half herrick had heard was true or the enemy agent might have caught andkilled him herrick looked towards the open sea until his eyes watered bolithos place was here in a world he understood where he was known by name if not by personal contact by most of the men in the fleet he thought suddenly of javal and found himself hating him he had not come into syracuse at all after his own passage through the messinastrait he had been ordered to rendezvous with the squadron off malta failing that and bolitho had always given them plenty of alternatives he would anchor here and await developments perhaps he too had run foul of an enemy force but if only he would come farquhar would have no choice then but to send buzzard in search of segura and her small crew herrick had visited lysander several times without being invited to discover what farquhar intended to do as always he was met by a blank wall a manner and attitude which rarely failed to rouse and confuse him farquhar was imperturbable if he was troubled at bolithos absence he was certainly hiding it very well his visits to his old ship had been made more painful by the obvious pleasure of those who had hurried to greet him leroux and old grubb and yeo the boatswain in gilchrist he had seen the biggest change of all since farquhars taking command like a man on a razors edge someone who rarely found time to rest or be at ease he was almost a stranger quite unlike osiriss first lieutenant he thought bitterly lieutenant cecil outhwaite a bland young man in his middle twenties was very like a frog in appearance low forehead wide mouth and eyes which were very dark and limpid he had a slight lisp and went about his duties as if bored by the whole business outhwaite like farquhar came of a powerful family and why he ever became a sea officer was beyond herrick completely but then the two ships were totally unlike each other also off watch in lysander the seamen had skylarked and found time to joke about their lot under all but the most harsh circumstances in this ship there was no such feeling like outhwaite the sailors went about their work catfooted and when below were as silent as monks herrick had tried to ease this unnerving tension aside but as with osiriss last captain he was met at every level by an unbreachable wall farquhar had run the ship to the highest point of efficiency cleanliness and appearance for the people who made all that possible he had allowed nothing and yet some especially outhwaite showed a ready respect for him he donttolerate fools yknow the froglike face had watched him curiously an hes a damn quick temper for the scoundrels too the officer of the watch snapped ship rounding the point he saw herrick and added harshly take the lookouts name for not reporting sooner herrick snatched a glass and hurried to the nettings for a while longer the newcomers topsails were riding lifelessly above a drifting curtain of haze and then as her jib boom and beakhead thrust into view herrick knew she was the sloop of war harebell he pounded one fist into the other his eyes misting with strain at last her commander francis inch would do anything for bolitho and his little sloop was even better suited for looking for him ah sir i see you have sighted her outhwaite joined him by the rail his hat tilted rakishly over his eyes he was an odd bird herrick thought he wore his dull brown hair in a queue so long that the end of it was level with his sword belt when most sea officers followed the new army custom of wearing their hair shorter outhwaite apparently intended to retain his grip on the past harebell herrick watched the sudden activity aboard lysander the signal flapping listlessly from her yards farquhar would want to know what was happening elsewhere and as quickly as it took inchs gig to cross the water harebells dropped her hook sir outhwaite showed only mild interest shes too soon back from her mission to have visited england so well not know how things are in london eh herrick did not know what things in london were nor did he care im going below mr outhwaite call me the moment that lysander signals for captains to repair aboard aye sir outhwaite smiled and touched his hat he felt an unusual admiration for captain herrick rather like his father did for a rustic gamekeeper or groom reliable but quaint the way he was so obviously worried about the commodores disappearance for instance outhwaite could not imagine what sort of experiences and dangers they must have shared in the past to create such a bond a bond which evenbolithos action about a change of commands had not diminished he watched the boat pulling away from harebell towards the flagship inchs goldlaced hat in the sternsheets somewhat different from charles farquhar he thought he looked on one mans loss as an opening for his own gain outhwaite nodded as it should be but for most of the afternoon while herrick sat or paced restlessly in farquhars beautifully equipped cabin no signal came nor any rumour of what harebell had carried with her to syracuse with a telescope he had examined the sloop more than once through the quarter gallery and had seen the great scars of bared woodwork where the sea had done its best to hamper her the patches in her loosely furled sails as evidence of inchs determination to lose no time with his despatches he glared at the skylight as someone stamped overhead damn farquhar to hell even this moment he was unwilling to share with his fellow captains there was a sharp rap at the door and a midshipman stared in at him beg pardon sir but mr outhwaite sends his respects and herrick stood up the flagship has signaled for me at last he did not bother to hide his sarcasm nno sir the midshipman stared at him warily captain farquhar is coming to us herrick snatched his hat i will come up he tried to imagine what was happening whatever it was had moved farquhar to act swiftly at last later as the calls trilled and the marines banged their muskets to the present herrick watched farquhars handsome face for some indication but there was nothing beyond a slight smile at the comers of his mouth he snapped cabin and strode past herrick with barely a glance at the assembled marines in the cabin he turned and faced herrick harebell has brought despatches from gibraltar he darted a glance around the cabin some wine would not come amiss herrick asked then there is no news of the commodore farquhar stared at him did i say there was he shrugged really thomas you are the most stubborn of men i thought perhaps that harebell might have sighted commander inch has brought news of more pressing matters he sounded irritated at herricks interruption admiral lord st vincent has been kept fully informed those heavy guns which we captured must have convinced him he has appointed rear admiral sir horatio nelson to command a fleet which will be powerful and ready enough to enter the mediterranean and seek out the french once and for all herrick looked away it was good news of course or should have been bolitho had been given the trust he needed to bring this plan into being but now that an idea was fast becoming a reality bolitho was not here to share in the rewards he deserved farquhar eyed him coldly i have written my despatch for the admiral harebell will be making sail as soon as she has taken on water herrick faced him his eyes filling with astonishment but you will not release the sloop without sending her first to malta you are wrong butbut farquhar snapped when you were flag captain you had your opportunity to put your ideals into operation it is too late now for misgivings so do not blame me captain herrick if anyone failed the commodore it was you herrick stared at the deck and at the bulkhead seeing neither it was true what farquhar had said ail of it farquhar added quietly the squadron will remain here until we receive new orders i have persuaded mr manning that further repairs are vital to our survival herrick heard the words but their meaning did not reach him for several long seconds he exclaimed but you mustnt ignore all that the commodore has discovered the prizes weve taken the information weve gathered it all points to corfu he heard his voice pleading but no longer cared you cant just stay here and do nothing farquhar shrugged rumours i cannot afford to squander the squadron to the points of the compass when the first supporting ships arrive i intend herrick stared at him disgusted you will be ready to meet them to visit nelson in person is that it farquhar frowned do not press me too far i only came to you because i intend to give you back lysander herrick looked around the beautiful cabin far more soiled to a flagship than lysander could ever be farquhar added harebell brought other less rousing news my father sir edward died two days after i left england herrick could only stare at him his mind clearing and sharpening the pain farquhar had everything now there was no remorse on his face no sense of loss he had the title at last and all the land and property which went with it and when nelson came to the mediterranean he would appoint a new commodore for this squadron sir charles farquhar he asked huskily have you told captain probyn yet all in good time farquhar was far away his eyes reaching beyond sicily and beyond again probyn behaves as if stupidity was a virtue you should know that he walked to the stern windows i have ordered my servant to bring my things across before dusk you may transfer back to lysander as soon as you receive my written appointment that pleases you surely ive small room for pleasure at present sir charles he watched for some reaction but farquhar had already accepted and grown into the title within hours of hearing the news he looked away in case farquhar should see his sudden anxiety i have a favour to ask and i dontfind it an easy task well i believe that the commodore was right perhaps we shall see one day herrick persisted you could detach a ship if you are remaining here under sicilian protection one ship less would aid the deception continue farquhar watched him calmly and where would this one ship be heading might i ask you know that too sir charles corfu to discover what the french are doing there i see farquhar walked a few paces to the table and looked with distaste at herricks chart and the mass of scribbled calculations please herrick watched him desperately ive never asked you for anything before he hesitated im asking now very well your orders would be such that you would act on your own initiative thank you farquhars eyebrows lifted you thank me it is your own ruin you are demanding corfu is of no consequence the big fight will be outside toulon or on the shores of egypt he shook his head sadly when i was a midshipman in the phalarope and you her first lieutenant eventually i used to listen to the men talking about you how you would always speak up for them he turned away i hope there will be someone to speak up for you when the time comes but i doubt it he became impatient and banged sharply on the door sentry pass the word for the first lieutenant then he looked at herrick again return to your precious lysander now before i change my mind ill send you your orders at once herrick nodded and if you get the chance sir yes ill try to discover what happened to the commodore although he did not finish it outhwaite appeared in the door sir captain herrick is returning to his own ship the frog face was expressionless by whose order sir farquhar smiled tightly mine as herrick made to leave he added one thing ill need a good signals officer i will keep your sixth lieutenant yes sir herrick sighed at least pascoe would be spared although he suspected that farquhars was no mere gesture of confidence more one to advertise his humanity in saving pascoe from a wasted death he strode out beneath the poop and into the sunlight the news of his leaving wasalready making itself shown glum faces curious stares followed him as he strode towards the entry port perhaps they would miss him after all outhwaite hurried along with him ill have all your gear and chests sent across sir your coxn is already in the barge he held out his hand i doubt well meet again sir but id not have missed it herrick studied him suddenly very calm nor i it taught me a great deal which was intended it did sir outhwaite was surprised yes about people mostly about myself he touched his hat abruptly and walked to the open port outhwaite waited until the boat had thrust away from the side and then snapped turn the hands to mr guthrie well have no slackness he thought of herricks face in those last few moments he had halfexpected to see humility but had found only pity for him perhaps when he glanced across the wide quarterdeck he was strangely troubled it no longer seemed like the same place herrick stood motionless by the open stem windows looking down into the swirling water below the counter he could see the stars reflected there and by leaning slightly over the sill he could also see the solitary lantern by his head and the line of bright windows from the wardroom below his feet the ship was unusually quiet as if holding her breath there had only been one break in the stillness and that had been when he had returned aboard some two hours ago an unknown voice had begun it and then as if at a signal and despite gilchrists anger the ship had burst alive with cheering the noise had drowned out the calls and the marine drummers completely and even old grubb had removed his hat and had waved it in the air his ruined face scarlet with his uzza lads the capns come back he walked away from the windows and glanced momentarily at the empty swordrack on the bulkhead bolitho had been unwilling to take the sword with himozzard had told him that perhaps he had for seen something a warning he sighed farquhar had kept his word and the wording of lysanders orders made it perfectly clear where the blame would lie if herrick acted wrongly herrick told himself that farquhar was correct that he would have done the same but the doubt was there there was an uncertain tap on the door it was pascoe his hat under his arm even in the light of a solitary lantern herrick could see the strain on his face the brightness in his eyes yes pascoe said mr manning is come aboard sir he has a lady with him they came to say goodbye to captain farquhar as they are leaving for gibraltar in harebell as soon as a wind returns herrick nodded there was no wind at all and it added to the sense of brooding despair he said quietly tell ozzard to bring more lanterns then show the visitors aft ill explain about captain farquhar he thought of his orders again signed actingcommodore pascoe said id like to stay in lysander sir i know he faced him but you must transfer to osiris at first light tomorrow it is probably for the best id like to think you at least were here if pascoe asked are you going to corfu just to show that you believe he is right sir yes it is all i can donow he crossed to his side and added take care adam a lot may depend on you now pascoes eyes were wide you speak as if he were already dead im nor sure not any marc herrick looked around the quiet cabin but i am certain of one thing people in england who do not understand as we do will try to smear his name it is a common custom with our countrys heroes and hero your uncle is and never forget it his voice was loud but he could not bottle his thoughts any longer i met his father once did you know that your grandfather a fine man from a proud tradition youll have a lot to live up to and many will try to splinter your defences with envy and hate so just you remember this day adam and treasure it he swung away now bring those damned visitors aft he heard pascoes footsteps retreating and felt the pounding of his own heart matching them light flooded around him as ozzard hung fresh lanterns and with a start he realised that manning was in the cabin door a lady in a dark boat cloak and hood at his side manning said stiffly i regret the intrusion captain it now seems i have wasted time and effort and will have to take a boat to the osiris herrick tried to smile but his face felt numb i am sorry mr manning it was typical of farquhar of course i expect you would have been told of the new arrangements in the morning manning searched his face and replied dryly indeed i would like to think so to the lady who had remained silent he said we will go over to osiris right away i have some matters to discuss with captain farquhar before you leave herrick said therell be no wind before dawn you can rest assured of that i see manning seemed irritated this is my sister by the way mrs boswell she threw back the hood of her cloak and gave a quick smile manning continued better be off then she said i am sailing in the harebell captain herrick but my brother is remaining in sicily for the present she looked sadly at manning though how the poor dear will manage i cannot imagine he glared at her and then snapped are you coming dulcie no she walked further into the cabin her boat cloak swishing behind her i will have enough of cramped quarters and boats before i reach england again and i have seen enough of captain farquhar anyway she gave herrick a smile i should like to remain here until you have finished your business john if the captain has no objections herrick shook his head no maam my pleasure she was a very pleasant looking woman with the fresh cheeks and bright eyes of someone raised in the country he wondered what she was doing out here perhaps her husband was like manning a man who served the king without wearing his coat manning tutted and grunted and then said oh very well ill be back in an hour the silence closed in again and herrick felt as if he was too large to be in the cabin she watched him thoughtfully and then loosened her cloak before sitting easily in one of the chairs so you are captain herrick i have been hearing about you one of your men told me you are sailing soon i hope you have a safe voyage herrick looked at her wanting to be left alone needing her to stay aye maam theres plenty of talk in ships he changed the subject i gather you are bound for england yes we live in she dropped her eyes that is my husband died two years ago so i am returning to canterbury i have been dreading it in many ways i came out to live with john he has never married poor lamb but he insists that the war is getting closer each day she sighed so home i must go herrick sat down opposite her but maam i come from kent too my home is in rochester he smiled awkwardly though i fear not as fine as yours will be she watched him her skin very pale under the lamplight that young officer who brought us to the cabin she lowered her eyes i couldnt help hearing what you said to him herrick flushed maam i do apologise he recalled his anger bring these damned visitors aft had i realised no captain before that you were deeply upset as i believe that goodlooking boy was too herrick nodded slowly he is the commodores nephew a fine young man shesaid quietly ive heard about your commodore i was very distressed i understand he was greatly liked aye maam none better none braver theres no hope not much your brother would have heard something by now tell me about yourself captain do you have a family in england and that was how it all began herrick speaking his thoughts and memories aloud while she sat quietly listening when someone cried a challenge and a boat surged alongside herrick could hardly believe an hour had passed so fast he stood up anxiously if i have bored you maam she patted his sleeve and smiled at him i should like to call upon your sister if i may captain it will help to keep us both cheerful until she fastened her cloak until you returnto kent again she looked up at his face her gaze level i hope youll not forget us herrick grasped her hand it was small and firm and made him feel all the clumsier ill not forget your kindness to me maam he heard mannings voice drawing closer id like to think we might meet again but no buts captain she moved back from him i can now understand why your commodore is sadly missed with friends such as you he must have been a man indeed herrick followed her on to the quarterdeck where her brother was speaking with major leroux pascoe called boats ready sir herrick said roughly go with this lady in the boat mr pascoe my compliments to commander inch tell him to take care of his passenger she touched his arm inch another friend aye herrick guided her around the projecting humps of gun trucks and ringbolts youll be in good hands she moved her elbow gently in his grip no better than now i think the nightmare was rising to another great climax leaping patterns of dark red like solid flame interspersed with cruder shapes sometimes human other times obscure and all the more frightening bolitho wanted to get to his feet to cry out to escape the surging movement and encirclement once against the molten banks of fire he saw a woman deathly white her arms beckoning him her mouth calling silent words when he had tried to reach her he realised that both his legs had gone and a ships surgeon was laughing at his rising terror all at once it was gone silence and a darkness too unreal to accept so that bolitho felt himself drawing in his muscles and limbs to resist another terrible nightmare it was then that he realised he could feel his legs his anus and the sweat which ran across his neck and thighs slowly fearfully like a man climbing back from the dead he tried to assemble his thoughts to separate reality from that which he had been enduring since he struggled on to his elbows staring at the darkness since when as his senses returned he noticed a sluggish movement beneath him the shudder and tilt of a vessel under way blocks and rigging creaked and he felt a new sensation that of dread he remembered the return of the fever the signs he had known were there but had refused to recognise alldays face above him lined and anxious hands carrying him the enfolding darkness he groped up to his eyes and winced as his fingers touched them he had gone completely blind a great slackness came over his limbs so that he fell back on the bunk exhausted better to have died to have sunk deeper into the haunting nightmares of fever until it had ended completely he thought of the naked woman catherine pareja trying to sustain him as she had done before when he had all but lost his life with a gasp he struggled up in a sitting position as a thin yellow line opened the opposite darkness like thread wider still and then a face unfamiliar against a lantern in the passageway beyond the door the face vanished and he heard someone yell hes awake hes going to be all right the next few minutes were the worst in some ways allday cradling him against the vessels motion lieutenant veitch peering down at him his face split into a wider grin than he had ever seen midshipman breens carrot head bobbing about in a sort of jig and others crowding into the small cabin and giving vent to what sounded like a dozen different tongues veitch ordered clear the cabin lads allday made bolitho lie back and said good to have you back with us sir god youve had a bad time and thats no error bolitho tried to speak but his tongue felt twice its proper size he managed to croak hhow long he saw veitch and allday exchange quick glances and added must know veitch said quietly all but three weeks sir since you bolitho tried to push allday aside but was helpless no wonder he felt weak and empty three weeks he whispered what happened veitch said after we got you back aboard we thought it better to stay at anchor in valletta it seemed safe enough and i was troubled fearful if you like of taking you to sea as you were allday stood up slowly his head bowed between the beams ive never seen you so bad sir he sounded exhausted we was at our wits ends as to what to do bolitho looked from one to the other some of his anxiety giving way to warmth for three weeks while he had been helpless and confined in his own private torment these others had fended as best they could had nursed him without caring for themselves or what delay might cost them as his eyes grew accustomed to the yellow light he saw the deep shadows around alldays face the stubble on his chin veitch too looked worn out like a prisoner from the hulks he said i was thinking only of myself he reached out take my hands both of you alldays teeth were white in his tanned face bless him mr veitch he must be feeling a mite better but he had to look away at a rare loss for words bolitho said tell me again i will try to be patient and not interrupt it was a strange tale which veitch and allday shared strange because it represented part of his life which he had missed which now he could never regain within a day of his return aboard an official had come alongside and ordered them to remain at anchor until all risk of fever had gone veitch had been worried at bolithos desperate condition but had not missed the fact that two of his seamen had deserted a coincidence he could not be sure but from that moment he had made plans for leaving harbour before some unbreakable restriction was placed upon them for several days the segura had remained apparently unheeded a warning yellow flag at her masthead while the morale of her small company had crumbled and stores had run lower and lower as he listened to their story bolitho wondered if the french agent yves gorse had received some word that seguras crew were imposters by having them held at anchor he may have done his best to delay them while he sent word elsewhere that the enemies of france were no longer at gibraltar or off toulon but inside malta he could after all do little else without revealing his own role as a foreign spy allday took up the story two sentries came aboard next mr plowman suggested that it was the best time to leave others on shore would drop their guard once responsibility was shifted bolitho managed to smile plowman if he was an exslaver would certainly know about such matters there was a squall one night sharp and fierce an not too much in our favour but it was then or not at all mr plowman said so we cuts the cable and makes sail the sentries allday grinned we met with a genoese trader two days later and we put em aboard her he became serious again it was a good thing by speaking with the trader we heard that a french man war was nearby a corvette by the description looking for us waiting to contact the agent in malta we dontknow he patted the crumpled bunk and added quietly we had more important things to attend to bolitho ran his fingers through his hair bring more light i must get up but why three weeks weve been lying up in a little bay to the southrd of sicily the squall which damn near flung us back into valletta was a hard one but it was gone again in no time veitch could not suppress a great yawn so we anchored and did what we could i think you nearly died sir breen entered the cabin with another lantern unlike the others he was able to walk upright bolitho swung his legs to the deck and allowed allday to help him to a broken mirror on the bulkhead he studied the hollows in his cheeks the feverish stare the filthy stains on his shirt he said ill not tell you what you should have done veitch shrugged we did not know what had passed between you and the frenchman sir he added grimly but in any case id have made the same decision your life would have come first bolitho studied veitch in the mirror thank you for that allday said we sighted the corvette a couple of times but she didnt come near our little anchorage he watched bolithos worn features and explained as it is sir were now under way and steering north for syracuse mr veitch said that with all the calms weve been having it was best to sail at night this old barrico is no match for a frog corvette i see he rubbed his chin and despised himself for his sudden thought a shave and a bath seemed more precious than anything allday continued yesterday morning it was i was forcing some brandy into your mouth and you spoke to me i think we knew then that we must quit the bay a proper surgeon is what you need now bolitho grimaced the squadron will have sailed long since even without my new information farquhar will have weighed veitch asked you were right then sir i think we all knew mr veitch he recalled the cool wine store the sweat on his back changing from fire to ice gorse hinted that the french will seize malta on their way to egypt im not surprised sir veitch sounded weary from what i saw in malta most of the defences have been allowed to fall into ruin with malta taken and a goodly supply of weapons and stores for a full scale invasion building up in corfu the french have nothing to stop them he gave a tired smile so we must send word to the admiral in this wretched vessel if necessary veitch walked to the door it will be dawn in an hour sir with luck and provided that this whisper of a wind does not desert us we will reach syracuse during the afternoon watch he paused by the door i must relieve mr plowman sir allday waited until the door was closed and then said he has the makings of a good officer sir you think that aye allday helped him to a chair he is better tempered than some bolitho watched him content to remain where he was despite all the urgency at the back of his mind he could tell merely by watching allday what the days and the weeks had cost him he could not have slept for more than minutes at a time allday said brightly i washed a don shirt that i found in a locker and larssen cleaned up your breeches he turned into the lantern light a razor in his hand so now sir well make you a bit more presentable shall we later as a pink glow showed itself through the filthy cabin skylight bolitho stood up in his spanish shirt and examined himself in the mirror allday was wiping his razor on part of a flag you know sir and i know but the lads will think youre just as you were the razor froze in midair as a voice called deck thar sail on th weather bow allday reached out and gripped his arm easy now sir mr veitch is able to manage bolitho looked at him gravely mr veitch has been made to manage for too long and so have you he fought against the ringing in his ears help me on deck for such a small vessel it seemed a vast distance to the poop the sea looked very calm and the hint of sunrise gave the water a strange pink hue beyond which the vague humps of land seemed ugly bolitho seized the rail and sucked in great gulps of air after the cabin it was like wine he looked up at the loosely flapping sails barely enough wind to hold them on course he nodded to veitch and plowman not daring to trust his voice or his breath when the sun showed itself in earnest he would see the sicilian coastline across the larboard bulwark more clearly be able to fix their position he stiffened as the pink light touched a small square of sail far away across the larboard bow the uncertain light made it seem a great distance off but soon she would cut the range down as if by magic he turned and looked at veitch one of ours perhaps veitch closed his class with a snap no sir its that same damned corvette again bolitho sensed the bitter despair in his voice after all he and the others had done the corvette was still with them standing like a pike between a helpless duckling and the nearest reeds he thought of seguras armament and dismissed it two or three swivels and the mens own muskets it only made the comparison more cruel he snapped how far from the land are we he was surprised by the strength in his voice two leagues sir no more by my reckonin plowman regarded him doubtfully the waters very deep hereabouts and id hoped to run closer inshore but for the bloody wind beggin your pardon sir he wished he could pace up and down and gather his thoughts but knew his strength would fail instantly six miles out it might as well be six hundred he heard breen say shakily with all that powder stored below well blow to dust at the first shot bolitho turned and looked at him well said mr breen he lurched to the wheel and held on to it allday have the boat lowered it is sir allday peered at him anxiously through the pink gloom towing below the counter good good he had to keep talking to stop the dizziness returning rig a mast and sails in her and warp her around to the lee side so that the frenchman wont see her veitch exclaimed wed never outrun a corvette sir dont intend to he bared his teeth pretending to grin make up a long fuse and set it to the powder hold he saw veitchs disbelief but hurried on well let the corvette grapple us and then bear away in the longboat plowman cleared his throat but suppose the frogs dontgrapple sir they might send a boardin party instead he looked meaningly at veitch as if to indicate that he thought the fever was still controlling bolitho as before bolitho took the glass from his hand and trained it across the rail the french corvette was much sharper already she had the windgage and was setting her topgallants to take full advantage of it he returned the glass and said slowly we shall have to wait and see mr plowman now get that fuse and be sharp about it as allday made to leave he caught his arm and asked when i called out during the fever did i ask for anyone yes sir allday looked towards the sunrise you called for cheney sir your wife bolitho nodded thank you midshipman breen hurried after allday and whispered nervously but is not the commodores wife dead aye he paused above the bobbing longboat and looked towards bolitho by the wheel an mores the pity for it pursuit bolitho crouched over the segura s flaking companion hatch and scribbled on a small piece of paper he was aware of the strengthening light a hint of warmth after the first dawn air but forced his mind to concentrate every so often he had to pause and gather his strength for fear that the fever was returning once when he half rose to peer above the larboard bulwark he saw the french corvettes yards and sails edging round her slender jib boom displaying her intention to run down her quarry on a simple converging tack not much more than a mile separated the smart manofwar and the badlyused segura bolitho folded the paper carefully and moved to veitch s side take this with you he slipped it into the lieutenants pocket it tells all i know suspect was more the word so if i fall you must get this message to higher authority as best you can plowman called hoarsely the frenchies shortenin sail sir veitch nodded hell be up to us very soon now bolitho ran his eye along the deck it was tilting even less now and with the light airs barely able to fill each sail his plan was decided if there had ever been any choice he thought grimly allday came aft fuse set and ready sir should give us a quarterhour bolitho trained a telescope on the corvette too long cut it as close as you dare five minutes he heard them gasp but watched the french ship drawing nearer her sails braced round to retain the wind showing her bilge in the strengthening sunlight as she heeled jauntily on her new tack plowman remarked look at er copper shes not long out of port bolitho felt a shiver of excitement one of de brueyss vessels perhaps part of a scattered line of scouts which in turn would lead the admirals mighty fleet into open seas and to egypt he thought of all the information certain and hearsay and knew it represented far more than the solitary corvette which was blocking their path to safety like a great colossus de brueyss fleet of transports and ships of the line would stride via malta using it as a steppingstone before setting down again on the egyptian shore and thence to india and all the trade and possessions which england had so nearly lost in that other war he said get the hands into the boat if you please he waited expecting further argument from veitch or plowman the lieutenant merely said ill not cast off without you sir and thats my last word on it bolitho smiled youd disobey your commodore mr veitch in time of war it could hang you they both laughed and veitch answered a risk ill take sir the seamen were already scrambling over the lee bulwark and bolitho hoped that nobody aboard the french ship had noticed anything unusual after all there was little point in trying to outpace a manofwar as lively as a corvette and to attempt an escape in a longboat with the mediterranean and not dry land across the bows was a measure of madness allday came aft again breathing heavily fuse ready sir he squinted at the other vessel three guns had been run out small sixpounders they would be enough for the elderly segura even without her lethal cargo he added theres just us left he gestured to the wheel and this mad swede larssen grinned his face as devoid of fear as a childs aye so i am sir there was a sharp crack and as they turned to see a puff of smoke from the corvettes side a single ball ripped through the forerigging and threw up a thin waterspout away on the starboard quarter bolitho gave a quiet smile signal received and understood he nodded to allday get forrard and start shouting at your invisible crew he knew that the french captain must be watching segura and probably himself he darted a quick glance at the longboat as the bows and then the rest of it slewed awkwardly away from the lee side every inch of it filled with men and oars and the jumble of mast and canvas which veitch was preparing to raise bolitho took the spokes and said hoist the flag larssen the swede grinned and moments later the american colours broke once again from the gaff it brought an instant response in another sharp explosion and this time the sixpound ball smashed into seguras hull shaking her violently like a great hammer bolitho had not expected the corvette to be fooled but it all took time and from one corner of his eye he saw veitch waving his hat back and forth to show that he was ready there was a thump from forward and he watched allday jump clear with an axe as the tanned jib sail came crashing down around him in a flailing heap it seemed to satisfy the frenchman for her captain was already bringing her round to run almost parallel keeping segura to leeward while her men shortened sail yet again in readiness to drive alongside sailors were clambering into the shrouds with grapnels and there was a glint of metal as a boarding party ran smartly towards the forecastle for the first contact bolitho felt the wheel bucking in his hands as deprived of her jib segura idled heavily her sails in trembling agitation light the fuse he heard allday dash below and then handed the wheel back to the swede he saw a seaman on the corvettes main yard pointing and gesticulating and guessed he had seen the longboat and was trying to yell his information to the poop above the din of sails and blocks of shouting men eager for a fight even a onesided one bolitho made himself remain beside the wheel if he ran too soon the frenchman would still be able to sheer away he thought of the hissing fuse below decks and hoped allday had not been too exhausted to estimate the proper length fuse burning allday was covered in wisps of hay as if he had just fought his way out of it farmyard stack he had probably taken the fuse clear of the stored fodder in the other hold to avoid a premature explosion stand by the boats stern rope he waited until allday was at the bulwark with his axe you too larssen move smartly now he saw a shadow by his feet and then looked up at the american flag he grimaced and said ive dirtied that flag enough for one day ill cut it down but when he groped for his sword he realised that in all the excitement and his return from feverish oblivion he had forgotten to bring it on deck a musket barked across the fastnarrowing strip of water and he heard the ball smack into the opposite bulwark the french boarders were all yelling now baying like enraged hounds at the thought of their enemy trying to escape allday saw bolithos expression and thrust his axe into the seamans hand hold this im going for the sword bolitho yelled leave it another ball zipped past him and then a whole fusilade of shots which threw splinters from the deck like darts and ricocheted in every direction bolitho heard larssen cry out and saw him sag to his knees his eyes tightly closed as he tried to stem the blood which ran freely from his thigh bolitho controlled his racing thoughts tried not to see the fuse in his mind five minutes it must have been burning that long already he dragged the seaman against the bulwark and heard allday panting across the deck to join him he gasped hold him well jump together then they were up on the bulwark the wood still misty from the night air and as allday cut the boats long line the three of them fell like untidy bundles into the water the severed rope wrapped around them down and down the sunlight fading through a pink mist which bolithos reeling mind told him must be larssens blood and all the while he could feel the rope dragging like a snare and knew veitchs crew were pulling at their oars like madmen despite all which was happening he found he was thinking of the two men who had deserted at malta they would never know how fortunate their crime was at this moment had they remained aboard it was doubtful if there would have been room for them in the one remaining boat nor space to pull an oar he saw the water brightening over his head and as he broke surface shaking hair from his eyes and gasping for breath he caught sight of the longboat its sail hoisted and several figures waving and maybe cheering towards him larssen had fainted and it was all he and allday could do to hold his face above water and at the same time cling to the boats sternrope which was being hauled handoverhand against the pressure of oars sail and the drag of undertow around their legs allday gasped by god id not want to do this very often bolitho turned his head to speak and then felt his ears cringe as a deafening explosion tore the morning apart he felt the shockwave surge against his legs and chest knocking the wind from his lungs and twisting the three of them round in the trailing rope like helpless puppets fragments of wood and cordage huge yellowcoloured bundles of hay rained around them a whole section of timber plunged straight down beside allday only to shoot up again like a jagged batteringram missing him by inches allday croaked jesus that was a near thing bolitho managed to pivot himself treading water as the deluge of shattered pieces subsided and peered back at the two ships in fact there was only one segura having vanished completely leaving a great widening circle of froth and bubbles flotsam and scattered fodder which would never feed french cavalry now it was as if the segura had bled to death even as she plunged to the bottom for the froth which continued to swirl around in confusion was tinged with red every cask of wine must have burst apart with the gunpowder the corvette was in a bad way at first glance he had imagined that she had escaped the worst of the explosion but as she swung unsteadily across the disturbed water he saw the weak sunlight play over a deep rent in her hull where her copper had been slit open like the belly of a shark her rigging and sails were in shreds swaying like creeper as the hull tilted more steeply hiding the hole in the side as the sea surged into her why she had not caught fire was a miracle but bolitho knew her captain would be hard put to save his surviving men let alone prevent his command from following segura a shadow loomed above him and he felt hands under his armpits others reaching down to lift the inert swede to safety veitch watched him grinning as he was hauled unceremoniously inboard with allday you see sir i waited bolitho lay back and stared at the sky it was close allday was wringing out his shirt across the gunwale i gave the fuse ten minutes sir otherwise he said no more bolitho turned to look at him his chest heaving painfully he saw the weals across alldays back where the mounted trooper had used his whip they were still very red and would never vanish completely he felt strangely sad about that allday had served at sea for most of his life and had avoided the lash throughout that time in the navy it was no mean feat and now because of his courage and unwavering loyalty he would wear those stripes to the end of his days impetuously he reached out and touched alldays shoulder it was well done and i am sorry about these allday twisted round on the thwart and looked at him still a long way to go to catch up with you sir he grinned the tiredness or some of it fading i reckon youve got more scars than a eats got lives bolitho smiled sharing the moment only with allday but none more honourable my friend veitch cleared his throat where now sir bolitho struggled against the gun wale watching the listless sail and then turning to study the corvette someone fired a musket and a seaman in the boat stood up to jeer bolitho said quietly easy lads i know how you feel but it was not fired at us that time the corvettes people are trying to rush the boats he looked at veitch seeing the slow understanding a few officers a terrified crew it had happened to bolitho it was something which veitch might never experience if he was lucky shes gain the little corvette was beginning to turn turtle her decks bared as she tilted towards the silent watchers white feathers of spray showed where fragments from the explosion were falling from her masts and a sixpounder cannon tore loose from the upended side and charged through the other bulwark taking a handful of struggling figures with it across the blue water they could hear the faint cries and screams the jubilant roar of inrushing water the masts hit the surface almost together smashing amongst some swimmers and cutting the one successfully launched boat in halves plowman said roughly nuthin we can do for em sir bolitho did not answer the masters mate was right of course the boat would be swamped or at best his men would be taken prisoner by the overwhelming number of french survivors to know it was one thing to merely accept it was another he heard midshipman breen sniffing loudly and when he glanced along the boat he saw he was perched on a cask the swedish seaman larssen cradled against his lap plowman climbed across the other men and asked what is it the boy stared aft at bolitho and murmured hes dead sir allday said poor fellow he sighed put him over lads but the midshipman clung to the mans body his eyes still on bolitho bbut sir couldnt shouldnt we say something for him his freckled face was streaming with tears and in the boat he alone seemed totally unaware of the sinking ship nearby of anything but the man who just died beside him bolitho nodded slowly you do it mr breen he turned to watch veitch hearing breens highpitched wavering words as he stumbled through a prayer he had learned probably from his mother nearby he noticed that one of the seamen a tough experienced gun captain had removed his neckerchief which he had been wearing over his head in readiness for the sun he said quietly it is a hard lesson mr veitch aye the lieutenant touched his arm but gently as if afraid of disturbing breens words there she goes the corvette was slipping beneath the water and already some of the survivors still afloat were swimming purposefully towards seguras longboat there was a splash and bolitho saw larssen s face very pale and misty below the surface as his body drifted clear of the side out oars stand by a man in the bow yelled god damn them here comes another out of the lands shadow and morning mist a small rectangle of pale canvas showed itself with sudden brightness in the sunlight some of the frenchmen who were clinging to pieces of wreckage and broken spars raised a cheer while in the longboat there was no sound at all bolitho snatched the brass telescope from the bottom boards and trained it on the other vessel she might stop to pick up survivors a wind might rise in time to save them he felt his mouth go dry then he said rest easy lads shes the harebell with what wind remained held firmly under his coat tails inch brought the sloop steadily towards them his boats already swayed out ready for launching the corvette had practically gone now and only her stem section complete with its tricolour was still visible bolitho watched harebell turning into the wind the boats dropping alongside as she idled close to the nearest cluster of swimmers a jolly boat was speeding towards them now and a young lieutenant stood up to hail his face red with anger god damn you for a coward msieie leaving your people to drown while you have a boat the boat surged closer and allday cupped his hands barely able to restrain his huge grin is that the way you always greet your commodore attention in that boat i say while hands reached out to draw the two hulls together and bolitho clambered across to join the blushing lieutenant he said calmly a few moments ago i had a ship too mr mclean he patted his arm but i can understand how it looked by the time they had reached the sloops side bolitho could see what excitement his appearance had caused the embarrassed lieutenant mclean had already explained that harebell was on her way to gibraltar with despatches for the admiral commander inch it appeared was making a longer passage than he should have done just in case he might have sighted the segura mclean left bolitho in no doubt that it was just a brave gesture and that hope had long since been given up bolitho hauled himself up the side and was greeted by a beaming inch whose voice was completely drowned by cheering sailors he wrung bolithos hand his long horseface shining with pleasure and relief while others pushed forward to pound their returned commodore on the shoulders veitch said harshlythe commodore was near dead with fever i fear hell die of bruises in a minute sir inch led bolitho aft bobbing with excitement bolitho realised with surprise that there was a woman in the small cabin and she too seemed as overcome as inch inch said this is mrs boswell sir on passage for england i am to take her to gibraltar with me bolitho nodded to her i must apologise for all this maam he looked meaningly at inch we will return to syracuse with all speed yes of course i understand she dabbed at her eyes bolitho asked well commander inch tell me every thing is all the squadron still at anchor then some of inchs pleasure seemed to fade all but lysander and buzzard sir javal is away on his own mission but lysander had gone i am told to corfu bolitho sat down and plucked at his frilled spanish shirt so captain farquhar intends to use his own initiative eh inch looked uncomfortable even wretched no sir captain herrick has been given lysander sir charles farquhar as he now is commands the squadron in syracuse he intends to wait there he wavered under bolithos grim stare until a fleet comes under the flag of sir horatio nelson bolitho stood up ducking beneath the beams until he had reached the open stem windows herrick had gone alone the rest was as clear as the water below the transom he heard the woman say he is a good man i met him before he sailed bolitho turned towards her he is maam inch said when we heard the explosion we thought some great vessel had blown up seguras cargo we had to rejoin the squadron that corvette thought otherwise he recalled the midshipmans face the swedes cheerful acceptance of orders he sometimes did not even understand alldays scarred back he added harshly so rejoin it we will and as fast as you can manage the harebell s first lieutenant appeared in the doorway his eyes avoiding bolitho as he reported we have picked up thirty frenchmen sir the captain was not one of them he said as an afterthought the master says that the wind is a piece stronger and has backed further to the souwest inch nodded his long face set in a frown to bolitho he said i believe you have met mr mclean my senior sir bolitho smiled gravely indeed i had met him before when he came aboard lysander with you on one occasion it seems that the navy is unchanged whereas lieutenants never remember their superiors even commodores can recognise their lieutenants inch glared at the lieutenant call all hands and make sail it will be hard work but i want harebell at her anchor by midafternoon bolitho sat down again his limbs suddenly weak inch said i will go on deck if i may he hesitated i am indeed glad to be the one to find you sir captain herrick would have been pleased if he hurried from the cabin the woman said quietly we spoke for a long time i found captain herricks story his life quite fascinating bolitho studied her for the first time she was a pleasant looking woman probably in her early thirties she had a nice skin and dark brown eyes to match her hair it was all there in the way she had spoken of herrick love denied love still to offer perhaps he replied i intend to find him maam when i have spoken with captain farquhar i hope to know a great deal more than i do now he had spoken with unusual sharpness and she said i think that captain farquhar is a man with great ambition he smiled liking her and her quick appreciation superior ambition does not necessarily breed superior ability maam i should have known that earlier much earlier i pray to god ive not learned the lesson too late her hand moved to her neck for captain herrick for thomas and a whole lot more maam allday peered through the door could you get him to lay down maam hes done enough for a regiment today she nodded i will as allday withdrew she asked is he one of your contemporaries bolitho lay back in the chair and shook his head feeling the strain fading with his strength no he is my coxswain and a good friend but as a contemporary i fear he would soon be my superior and that would be too much she watched his eyelids droop his head loll to the sloops easy motion bolitho was not quite as she had expected from what herrick had told her he seemed younger for one who had carried so many and who had experienced so much sensitive too something he obviously regarded as a flaw and tried to hide with sternness she smiled she was quite wrong he was exactly as herrick had described farquhar stood quite still by the cabin screen watching while bolitho read carefully through the admirals despatches bolitho sat on the bench seat the papers spread on the deck between his feet while he leaned above them his elbows resting on his knees on the seat beside him was a piece of fresh bread and a crock of butter which manning had sent aboard that morning bolitho hat eaten almost a whole loaf liberally smeared with butter and had washed it down with to farquhars estimation seven cups of coffee bolitho looked up his eyes searching and you were going to remain here were you he tapped the scattered papers did this mean nothing to you farquhar faced him calmly if my assessment of the situation was different from yours sir then bolitho stood up his eyes blazing dont make speeches to me captain farquhar you read these despatches the findings in the report on the artillery we captured yet you saw nothing he stooped and snatched up two sheets of paper and thrust them on the table in a single movement read it these cannon are fortyfive pounders the military tested one although to them it was probably unnecessary he tapped the table in time to his words it can fire a fortyfivepound ball over five thousand yards if you rate that unimportant then you must be a fool how far does the biggest gun in the fleet fire he strode to the quarter windows his voice bitter let me refresh your memory a thirtytwopounder can reach three thousand yards with luck and a good gun captain farquhar retorted angrily i do not see what that has to do with us sir no that is quite obvious he turned to face him the french people expect a great victory after their bloody revolution they may well demand such matters and so to conquer egypt and reach far beyond their fleet must first command the sea once safely beneath the protection of artillery such as these great cannon the french could anchor an armada several armadas and know that there was not an english ship which could not be pounded to boxwood before she could grapple with them farquhar bit his lip coastal batteries at last captain bolitho looked at him coldly the pieces begin to fit for you also there was a tap at the door and the sentry bawled officer of the watch sir farquhar said pass him in he was probably relieved at the interruption the lieutenant stood just inside the door we have just sighted buzzard sir coming from the north thank you mr guthrie bolitho sat down and massaged his eyes get my clerk i will dictate a despatch for inch to carry to gibraltar he could not hide his anger somewhat different from yours farquhar was expressionless i will send for my clerk sir i am afraid yours is still in lysander he will suffice for the present he walked to the door i will get mine back when i recover my flagship farquhar stared after him but i have had your broad pendant hoisted aboard osiris sir so i see he smiled gravely yours or mine were you that sure i was dead he walked to the companion without waiting for an answer he found mrs boswell on the poop talking with pascoe seeing his nephew had brought home to him how desperately he needed to find herrick how much they needed each other if he understood herrick too well it was his own fault probably more so than herricks he had been searching for something different in farquhar when herricks real value was so obvious that neither of them had seen it the woman turned and smiled shyly i came over in the boat to say goodbye commodore she slipped her hand through pascoes arm we have been getting along very well bolitho nodded im certain of it he saw through her cheerful tone and added as soon as i have met with buzzards captain i will order the squadron or what is left of it to weigh she understood and walked with him to the poop ladder i will leave you now i am glad you are recovered i know something of medicine as fever killed my late husband it is always hotter in these climates aboard ship than on the shore in sicily it has been quite cool until these last weeks she faced him sadly if your men had left you in malta or worse taken you ashore where you anchored i fear you would have perished a boat was waiting at the chains and bolitho saw the osiriss froglike first lieutenant peering impatiently from the entry port he said quietly i have one piece of advice mrs boswell he guided her across the sunwarmed deck oblivious to watching eyes and his own strange appearance if you feel something for thomas herrick i beg you to speak it he felt her tense as if to pull away from his hand but instead sheasked is it so obvious there is nothing wrong in that he looked away towards the green slopes of land my own love was too short and i begrudge every second of it which was wasted also he forced a smile i know that if you say naught thomas will remain as tonguetied as a nun in a room full of sailors i shall remember she looked at pascoe take care of yourselves i have the strangest feeling that something great is about to happen she shivered i am not sure i like it bolitho watched her being lowered into the boat by boatswains chair and then strode aft to watch buzzards topsails edging slowly so painfully slowly around the north ern headland pascoe said a nice lady sir a bit like aunt nancy aye bolitho thought of his sister in falmouth and her pompous husband he had always been very close to nancy who though younger than he had always tried to mother him pascoe continued they say that nelson is coming to the mediterranean sir im thankful that somebody at last believes there is a real threat here the battle and battle there will be may be decisive which is why we have work to do before that day dawns he saw pascoes face and smiled whats the matter adam dont you want nelson to come he is the best we have and the youngest that alone should please you pascoe dropped his gaze and smiled one of the foretopmen said it for me weve got our own nelson already i never heard such nonsense bolitho made for the ladder adding youre getting as bad as that coxn of mine that night as bolitho sat in osiriss unfamiliar cabin writing his report on his conclusions he listened to the creak and mutter of the hull around him the wind was rising slightly and had already veered more to the northwest the sloop harebell which had set sail just before darkness would be making heavy going tacking back and forth back and forth merely to stay in the same place he thought of javal s swarthy face as he had come aboard surprised at seeing the broad pendant above osiris relieved to discover that farquhar was not yet the commodore he had explained bluntly that after failing to discover the ships at the prearranged rendezvous and hearing from a fisherman that they were at anchor in syracuse he had made a second patrol of the messinastrait and with the wind backing had gone farther north in search of news he had explained i make no excuses sir im used to in dependence but i dontabuse it i put into naples and visited the british minister there i had to come back with some thing his hard face had eased slightly had i known that you were off on your own er expedition sir id have sailed right into valletta and brought you out knights or not javal knew his weak spot as an exfrigate captain bolitho had acted rashly by going to see yves gorse but in keeping with his old calling perhaps javal had used the point to dilute his own guilt javal had explained sir william hamilton may be old sir but he has a vast knowledge of affairs and the communications to inform him bolitho signed his report and stared at the opposite bulkhead his tarnished sword looked out of place against the ornate panelling javal had delivered only one piece of news to be more precise he had brought a name sir william had been informed through his chain of associates and spies that the one man who could determine the next weeks and months was known to be making for toulon that man would not be prepared to waste time on empty gestures his name was bonaparte run to earth any hopes of a quick passage to corfu or of javal s lookouts sighting lysander far ahead of the depleted squadron were dashed within days of weighing anchor the wind veered violently to the north and as all hands worked feverishly to shorten sail even osiriss master expressed his surprise at the intensity and speed of the change swooping down from the adriatic the wind transformed the gentle blue swell into a waste of steep savage crests while above the staggering mastheads the sky became one unbroken cloud bank day after day the two ships of the line used their bulk and strength to ride out the storm while behind shuttered gun ports their companies fought their own battles against the sickening motion and waited for the call all hands hands aloft and reef tops is then to a more perilous contest against the wind clinging to dizzily swaying yards and fighting each murderous foot of canvas buzzard unable to withstand such a battering had been made to run ahead of the storm so that to the remaining ships it seemed as if the whole world was confined to this small arena of noise and drenching seas for the visibility dropped with the hours and it was hard to tell spray from rain or from which direction the wind would attack next for bolitho the endless days made him feel remote from osiriss own struggle the faces he met whenever he went on deck were unfamiliar shouted opinions as yet carried no weight he saw farquhar in a different light as well several times he had given way to displays of anger which had made even the urbane outhwaite quail and once he had reprimanded a bosuns mate for not striking a man hard enough when he protested at being sent aloft in a full gale the bosuns mate had tried to explain that the culprit was not a proper seaman but a coopers assistant so many hands had been hurt in the storm that like the officers the bosuns mate was trying to gather as much extra muscle as he could farquhar had shouted dont you dare argue youve had to flog men you know what it will feel like if you cross words with me again the man had been driven aloft and had fallen outboard without even a cry as he had lost his hold on the futtock shrouds bolitho wondered how herrick was managing to ride out the storm and where he was during each sickening day farquhar had said but for this bloody weather id have caught up with lysander i doubt it bolitho had reached beyond empty agreement lysander is a faster ship and she is well handled it was unfair on farquhar but he had shown such indifference to herricks possible fate that it was all he could do to restrain some more biting comment like a nagging con science a small voice seemed to repeat it was your decision you drove herrick too hard too soon it was your fault and then a week after leaving syracuse the gale eased and backed to the northwest but as the sky cleared and the sea regained its deep blue bolitho knew it would take several more days to recover lost ground to beat back through time and distance which they had surrendered to the storm whenever he went on deck he was aware that the officers on duty were careful to avoid his eye and stayed well clear of his lonely pacing on the poop his chosen solitude gave him time to think although without fresh information it was like reploughing old land with nothing to sow during the forenoon on the ninth day he was in the cabin studying his chart and drinking a tankard of ginger beer something which farquhar had stored in some quantity for his personal use how farquhar would laugh if after all there was nothing in corfu to sustain his theories he would not show it of course but it would be there just the same it would not merely prove farquhar correct in his actions but also that he was far more suited to hold this or some other command sir charles farquhar it was strange that he should be so irritated by the mans title he was getting like herrick perhaps no it went deeper than that it was because farquhar had not earned it and now would never want for anything again you only had to look at the navy list to see where the promotion went he thought of pascoes words and smiled the nelsons of this world gained their rewards and even titles on the battlefield or facing an enemys broadside their precarious advancement was often admired but rarely envied by those more fortunate ashore bolitho walked restlessly around the cabin hearing the seamen working on deck and in the yards above it splicing and rerigging after a storm each job was doubly essential he smiled again those more fortunate ashore in his heart he knew he would fight with all his means to avoid a post at the admiralty or in some busy naval port he returned to the chart and stared at it once more corfu a long spindly island which seemed about to lock itself snugly to the greek mainland a narrow approach from the south about ten miles across for a ship under sail from the north much less inviting selfdestruction if the french had shore batteries along the high ground although the island was separated from the mainland by what was to all intents a small private sea some twenty by ten miles in size the two real hazards were the narrow channels north and south also the one good anchorage was on the eastern shore so any sort of surprise there was out of the question herrick would know it too he was stubborn and determined but he was no fool and never had been he thought suddenly of the young widow mrs boswell strange he had never pictured herrick being married but she was exactly right for him she would not stand by and let others step on his good nature she would never have allowed hl to admit that he could not sustain the posting of flag captain bolitho straightened his back and marvelled that he could even consider such things he had two ships and might never find lysander at all but whatever happened he was about to penetrate the enemys defences in a sea area which was almost unknown to him beyond his charts and available hints on navigation there was a tap at the door and the sentry called cautiously midshipman of the watch sir it was the redheaded breen well mr breen bolitho smiled at him it was the first time he had spoken with him since being rescued by harebell the captain sends his respects sir the lookout has reported a sail to the norwest too far off to recognise i see bolitho glanced at the chart even allowing for their drift and loss of way during the storm they could not be that far out in their calculations osiriss beakhead was pointing approximately northeast and with luck they would sight the highest range of hills to the southernmost end of corfu before nightfall buzzard had run with the storm and although javal would be quick to rejoin the squadron and might appear even today he would come from the south and not the northwest where this newcomer had shown herself he asked how dyou like being temporarily attached to osiriss gunroom the boy looked past him towards nicators tall outline some three cables astern nnot much sir they treat me well enough but bolitho watched him gravely like the lieutenants most of the midshipmen in this ship were of good family stock farquhar had evidently planned his wardroom and his midshipmen with great care it was quite common for a captain to take a boy to sea as midshipman the son of an old friend perhaps or as some special favour farquhar appeared to have taken the custom right through his command breen seemed to think he was expected to add something i keep thinking about the seaman sir larssen but im all right now iim sorry about the way i acted dont be a sword must bend if it is made too hard it will snap when it is most needed he wondered why he was trying to save breen from the inevitable it came to all of them sooner or later he recalled his own feelings after a sea fight when he had been a young lieutenant the guns working so hard and the battle so fierce that there had been no time to treat the dead even the wounded with care or respect the corpses had been pushed overboard from friend and enemy alike and the wounded had added their cries to the thunder of battle when the firing had ceased and the ships had drifted apart too damaged and hurt to claim victory or offer defeat the sea had been covered with drifting corpses because the wind had dropped during the battle as if cowed by its savagery they were made to watch them for two whole days it was something he often thought about and could never forget he said quietly have some ginger beer poor breen with his rough scrubbed hands and grubby shirt he was more a schoolboy than a kings officer but who in his town or village had seen malta had been in a sea fight and how many would ever know the full extent of naval power as it really was and the men and timbers which made it farquhar appeared in the door and stared coldly at the boy with a glass in his fist to bolitho he said that sail has sheered off sir not lysander too small farquhar nodded curtly to breen as he hurried away brig according to the masthead lookout a good man hes usually right farquhar seemed much more controlled now that the storm had gone a waiting game perhaps standing aside to see what bolitho would do bolitho walked to the open stem windows and leaned out above the small bubbling wash around the rudder a good clear sky and the horizon astern of nicator s fat hull was hard and empty the brig would see more of these two ships than they would of her tell the lookouts to take extra care send telescopes aloft too you think the brig was french sir farquhar sounded curious she can do us little harm maybe in falmouth my sisters husband owns a large farm and estate he looked impassively at farquhar he also has a dog whenever a poacher or vagrant comes near his land the dog tracks him but never attacks or barks he smiled until the stranger is within range of a fowling piece farquhar stared at the chart as if he expected to see something there following us sir it is possible the french have many friends here they would be willing and eager to pass information which might ease their lot once the tricolour has extended its estates farquhar said uneasily but supposing that is so the french cannot know our full strength they will see we have no frigates if i were a french admiral that would be very valuable news indeed he walked to the door an idea emerging from the back of his mind fetch your sailmaker will you on the quarterdeck several hands paused to watch him before returning to their work with added vigour they probably thought him unhinged by the fever bolitho allowed the light wind to cool him and smiled to himself he was still wearing his spanish shirt and had declined any of farquhars spare clothing his own was still aboard lysander he would get it when he found herrick and find him he would sir the sailmaker was at his side watching him with a mixture of caution and interest how much spare canvas do you have that which is useless for making new sails and the like the man glanced nervously at farquhar who snapped tell him parker the sailmaker launched into a long list of stores and fragments item by item and bolitho was impressed that he retained so much in his memory thank you er parker he moved to the starboard gangway and stared along it towards the forecastle i want a strip of canvas sewn and lashed along the gangway nettings on either side of the ship hammock cloths unwanted scraps which you may have been keeping for repairing awnings and windsls he faced him calmly can you do that well that is sir i expect i could manage if he looked at his captain for support farquhar asked for what purpose sir i think if this fellow knew what you required and i too for that matter it would help him bolitho smiled at them if we join focsle to quarterdeck in this manner then paint the canvas the same as the hull with black squares at regular intervals he leaned over the rail to gesture at the eighteenpounder gun ports we can transform osiris into a threedecker eh farquhar shook his head damn me sir it would do the trick at any sort of distance wed look like a firstrate and no mistake the frogs will begin to wonder just how many of us there are bolitho nodded inshore we may stand a chance but we cannot afford a pitched battle in open waters until we have discovered the enemys real strength i doubt that the french will have many ships of the line here de brueys will save them for the fleet and for protecting his transports but i must know deck there sail on the larboard quarter bolitho said our willothe wisp again as soon as it is dusk we will begin the disguise we can change tack during the night and maybe give our inquisitive friend the slip another hail made them look up deck there sail on the lee bow company bolitho prodded the sailmaker with his fist get your mates to work parker you may be the first man in history to build a kings ship out of canvas scraps he saw pascoe hurrying up the weather shrouds to join the lookout who had made the last report he washampered by a large telescope slung over his shoulder but ran up the ratlines with the ease of a cat moments later he shouted shes the buzzard sir farquhar muttered about time too bolitho said make a signal to buzzard take station ahead of the squadron farquhar replied shell not be in signalling distance for quite a time sir shell have to claw every inch of the way against the wind she cannot see the signal captain but the other vessel will her master will know there is another maybe several ships close by it may give him something to chew on bolitho thrust his hands behind him seeing the boatswain and some seamen already broaching the paint while others dragged the canvas across the upper deck he began to pace slowly along the weather side willing buzzards topsails to show themselves to him above the horizon three ships now instead of two he thanked god for javals determination to find him weak they may be but they were no longer blind as well while osiris and her consort continued at a snails pace to the northeast and javal worked the frigate through countless zigzags to join them the small blur of canvas which betrayed their follower was rarely out of sight all afternoon as the sailmaker and his mates sat cross legged on every spare piece of deck heads bent needles and palms flashing in the sunlight bolitho prowled about the poop or visited the cabin in a state of near exhaustion in the last dog watch when the lookout shouted land ho he guessed that the pursuing brig would be satisfied that the squadron large or small was indeed making for corfu bolitho examined the purple shadow of land through the rigging and shrouds and pictured the island in his mind the brigs master had been too faithful to his orders now with night dosing in more rapidly he would have to bide his time and hold the information to himself under similar circumstances bolitho thought that he would have taken the risk of his admirals displeasure and called off the chase long ago he would have been more use to his admiral alongside the flagship thanriding out a long night off this dangerous coast curiosity had been the brigs weakness it was not much but it might be vital he returned to the cabin and found farquhar waiting for him with veitch and plowman farquhar said you wanted these two i believe sir he sounded disdainful bolitho waited as a servant hung another lantern above the chart now mr plowman i need a good volunteer to spy out the land for me the masters mate looked at the chart and the marks which denoted cliffs and deep soundings along the western shore he gave a slow grin aye sir i take your meanin farquhar asked sharply are you sending men ashore at night sir bolitho did not reply directly he looked at plowman and asked simply can you do it if it was not important i would not ask ive tackled worse once in west africa he sighed but thats another story sir good bolitho studied him gravely he was probably asking far too much sending plowman and others to their deaths he toyed with the idea of going himself but knew it would be pointless either way conceit desperation anxiety none came into it he would be needed here and very soon to farquhar he said they will want a cutter and a good stout crew he turned to veitch im putting you in charge of the landing party choose your men carefully men used to the countryside wholl not fall headlong down a cliff he saw the gravity on the lieutenants face giving way to something else satisfaction pride perhaps at being offered such a demanding task without restriction if bolitho had doubts they were in himself veitch had already proved his worth and his ability plowman was still examining the chart this looks a likely place he jabbed it with a thick finger an therell be a good moon tonight we can run under sail till were close in then pull the rest of the way bolitho said you can take all night but tomorrow try to discover what is happening the island is about five miles across at the point you have selected mr plowman the hills rise to a thousand feet or more from there you should see enough for our purposes veitch said slowly it may be difficult to hide the cutter sir do what you can he looked at each of them otherwise you will have to sink it where you land i will send another to take you off later farquhar coughed there is a fact to be faced sir the whole party may be taken prisoner within minutes of getting ashore bolitho nodded grimly so even farquhar was now accept ing the reality of their situation the enemy was fact not shadows we will attack from the southrd at dawn the day after tomorrow if mr veitch can discover the whereabouts of shore batteries and their strength it will make our task less demanding he smiled at their tense expressions although i fear our arrival will not be welcome veitch breathed out noisily well do our best sir let us hope that the french have none of their new guns along the coast that i doubt bolitho pictured the great cannon smashing his little force into submission before they had even got to grips they are being saved for something more important to bonaparte veitch and plowman left the cabin to gather their men and weapons and he said i would like to see my signals officer tomorrow we will head northwards under our new guise but hold buzzard well to windward javal may get a chance to catch that brig or any other spy if hes in the right place one more vessel under our flag would be welcome he suddenly saw himself at spithead awaiting the boat which would carry him out to the frigate to gibraltar to lysander and all those countless hours and miles sailed since to here a small cross on the chart he shivered despite the heavy air it was almost symbolic and this was when he needed herrick most his loyalty and devotion he wondered what farquhar thought about it really thought dilthe see this as his chance to add fame to his new status or did he see it only as an end to all his hopes they made light of risk they always did beforehand but he was asking much of every single man far too much when battle was joined causes and grand ideals counted for very little it was the speed you could fire and reload the strength you held to withstand the awful sights and sounds he shook himself from the lingering depression well captain farquhar he saw him come out of his own thoughts we will do this together or if one of us falls the other will carryon with it either way it must be done yes farquhar looked around the quiet cabin i can see that now within hours of full daylight the brigs topsails appeared again tipping the horizon but taking care to stand off well to windward either her master had managed to send word ashore by boat during the night or he was eager to learn more about bolithos ships bolitho made certain that their attendant spy had plenty to hold his attention pascoes signal party hoisted several meaningless flags which were acknowledged with equal vigour by nicator and buzzard then when bolitho made a genuine signal to call the other captains aboard for a discussion of their position he played his other card with sails aback osiris came round into the wind displaying her broadside to the distant vessel and her impressive new height above water when javal arrived in his gig he exclaimed admiringly i thought i was seeing things sir or that st vincent had arrived in his flagship from my gig she looks every inch a firstrate probyn was less enthusiastic a novel idea i agree but we cant shoot with painted canvas once more in the great cabin bolitho looked at his captains javal seemed strained after his long fight against the sea and wind but otherwise unworried farquhar tight lipped and pale but neither a hair nor a gilt button out of place probyn was as untidy and as brooding as ever he looked heavyeyed and his cheeks were redder than one would expect from wind alone drinking more than usual it was strange but bolitho found he had forgotten how probyn had used to drink when they had been lieutenants together more than once he had stood a watch or a duty for him when the first lieutenant had drawled see to it dick poor old george is in his cups again he waited until each of them had a glass of farquhars claret in his hand then said calmly tomorrow gentlemen we will make our play i hope to pick up mr veitch and his party tonight what he tells me may alter our tactics but cannot postpone an attack probyn kept his eyes on his lap what if he doesnt come back it will keep us in the dark he thought of veitch out there on corfu the villagers if he was unlucky enough to stumble on them might take them as frenchmen he was not sure if that was good or bad veitch had shown himself to be a quickthinking and intelligent man bolitho would make certain his name went forward for early promotion if he survived another night on the island he had toyed with the idea of telling him beforehand but had decided against it such a promise could make an ambitious man too careful an eager one too reckless we have shown ourselves as preparing to attack the enemy will still not know our full strength but as they may now believe we have a threedecker supporting us they must decide on their own plan of defence or attack probyn slammed his empty glass on the table and looked meaningly at the cabin servant then he asked why not wait sir watch and wait until we get more support he looked from the comers of his eyes at farquhar if lysander had been here then i might have said otherwise bolitho watched probyn emptying another glass of claret we do not know enough to wait at any day the enemy might try to sail out of corfu and if their numbers are what i believe we could not hope to contain them he saw probyn was unconvinced and added besides which the french fleet may even now be steering in this direction to escort their precious supply ships elsewhere he tapped the chart with his glass caught on a lee shore or worse bottled up on the eastern side of the island what chance would we have then he kept his gaze on probyn willing him to accept if not condone the reasoning for captain george probyns part could be the most important of all tomorrow hours not days now and his nicator might be the sole survivor he said quietiy osiris will force the southern channel at dawn the supply ships will be anchored anywhere from fifteen to twenty miles up the coast and once amongst them it will be a busy time for us all he saw javals hard face break into a smile the french i believe see themselves in a strong position they will know we are coming and move what guns they have ashore to command our approach javal nodded aye it makes sense a threedecker would be seen as the real threat bolitho thought of grubb and wished he was here osiriss sailing master seemed capable enough but lacked grubbs knowledge and philosophy on the weathers habits he had been a mate in an indiaman before joining a kings ship and his early service had been spent weighing the value of a fast passage against goods lost by poor navigation if so much depended on what his ships could do tomorrow the wind was almost equal in importance he shut it behind him and said to probyn you will leave us at dusk steer to the northrd when the time is ready you will enter the top channel i am hoping unopposed the defenders should think the real menace is from us in the south if lady luck he hesitated seeing herricks blue eyes crinkling to his favourite talisman blesses us and the wind holds we will hit the enemy hard and where it will do our cause most good they all stood up knowing it was over bolitho added god be with you they filed out in silence then bolitho heard farquhar shouting for someone to recall the captains boats allday entered the cabin by the other door and asked cant i get you a uniform coat from somewhere sir he sounded more worried by bolithos appearance than the prospect of battle bolitho walked to the quarter windows and saw probyns barge pulling strongly away he thought of this ship osiris the men who would work her up that channel would fight and if need be die it was not a happy ship he frowned nicator judge of the dead he felt suddenly chilled he answered no matter allday tomorrow they may look aft as you insist they do in action he saw him nod i want them to see me more like one of themselves than as one more oppressive uniform this ship has no warmth about her she carries all the marks of discipline and efficiency but he shrugged allday said theyll fight well enough sir youll see but bolitho could not shake off his feeling of foreboding if anything should happen he did not turn from the windows but heard allday tense i have made provision for you in falmouth you will always have a home there and want for nothing allday could not restrain himself he strode aft to the gallery and exclaimed ill hear none of it sir nothing will happen nothing can bolitho turned and looked at him you will prevent it allday stared at him wretchedly if i can i know he sighed perhaps like thomas herrick i am here too soon after that other time allday insisted the surgeon was right sir your wound is not properly healed yet your health more set back by the fever than youll allow for he added meaningly capn farquhars surgeon is no butcher hes a proper doctor capn farquhar took good care of that bolitho smiled gravely he would ask mr pascoe to lay aft i have some signals to prepare alone again he sat down at the table and stared unseeingly at his chart he thought of catherine pareja and wondered what she was doing now in london twice a widow yet with more life in her than most young girls just free of their mothers arms never once had she mentioned marriage not even a hint something seemed to hold it back an unspoken agreement he opened the front of his spanish shirt and examined the tiny locket which hung around his neck kate had never even shown resentment for that he opened it carefully and examined the small lock of chestnutcoloured hair it caught the sunlight from the stem windows and shone as brightly as the day he had met her an admirals bridetobe cheney seton the girl he had won and had married he closed the jacket and rebuttoned his shirt it never changed no wonder he had cried her name pascoe entered the cabin his hat beneath his arm a signalbook in one hand bolitho faced him concealing his sudden despair as best he could now adam let us see what other ideas we can invent shall we course noreast by north sir full an bye bolitho heard the master whispering with his helmsmen but hurried to the nettings now packed with neatly stowed hammocks and starkly pale in the moonlight farquhar joined him and reported winds steady sir we are about twenty miles southwest of the island buzzards to windward you can just make out her topsls in the moons path no sign of a boat none i sent the other cutter away under sail three hours back if veitch saw it he made no signal with either lantern or pistolshot very well how long does the master think we can remain on this tack an hour more at the most sir then ill have to recall my cutter and by that time ill be ready to come about otherwise well be too close to lieto and if we continue round in another great circle well be further away from the southern channel than i care for when dawn comes i agree bolitho added reluctantly another hour then farquhar asked are you certain you did right by sending nicator to the northern channel sir it will be a disaster if probyn fails to engage in time the channel is narrow i know but with favourable winds nicator will be able to manage i was not referring to the channel or the danger sir farquhars face was in the moons shadow his epaulettes very bright against his coat i have to admit i feel no faith in nicators captain when he sees our dependence on his support captain farquhar he will do his duty he recalled probyns reddened features his indirect manner his caution but what could he do if things happened as he had predicted osiris would take the worst of it and would need the most tenacity he could not ask javal to thrust his frail ship into the teeth of a bombardment although his part in the attack was bad enough anyway without lysanders support the surprise would have to be left to nicator there was no other way he wondered if farquhar was cursing himself now for letting herrick go unaided for failing to act as a squadron against the enemy when he believed himself in overall command deck there light on th weather bow bolitho ran to the larboard gangway and peered above the painted canvas he heard farquhar snap the signal by god mr outhwaite heaveto if you please and prepare to hoist boats inboard the ship came alive the hurrying seamen like phantoms in the eerie moonlight as they ran without hesitation to halliards and braces someone raised a cheer as first one and then the second cutter bumped alongside and men scrambled down to them to bear a hand sailing and pulling at the oars it must havebeen an unnerving job for the crews bolitho thought he waited by the quarterdeck rail gripping his hands behind rum to prevent his impatience from sending him down to the entry port with the others he saw a sturdy figure limping aft and recognised him instantly mr plowman come over here the masters mate leaned against the hammock nettings and tried to regain his breath glad to be ere sir he waved his arm towards the invisible land and bolitho saw that his hand was wrapped in a stained bandage the blood soaking through it like black oil ad to lie low even when we saw t other boat stand in inshore place was alive with pickets we run into one of em bit of a fight he examined his bandaged fist but we done for em and mr veitch he waited for the inevitable but plowman said es fine sir i left im ashore e ordered me to find you an report even the cabin lanterns seemed too bright after the strange moonscape on deck and bolitho saw that plowman was filthy from head to toe his face and arms scarred from rock and gorse have a drink bolitho saw farquhar and his first lieutenant and behind them pascoe coming into the cabin anything you like plowman sighed gratefully then id like a measure o brandy if i may dare ask sir bolitho smiled you deserve a cask he waited in silence watching plowmans expression as he drank a complete goblet of farquhars brandy now tell me the news plowman wiped his mouth with his wrist it aint good sir he shook his head we did like you said and mr veitch was fair amazed by what we saw just like you told us it would be only more so farquhar snapped ships aye sir thirty or more wellladen too an theres a ship o the line at anchor offshore a seventyfour an two or three smaller ships a frigate an a pair o corvettes like the frenchie we done for with segura farquhar said softly what a find a small armada no less plowman ignored him but that aint all sir theyve hauled a pair o them new guns to the eadland he leaned heavily across the chart and jabbed it with his thumb there we thought for a bit they was unloadin all the ships but they just ferried these two beauties ashore we met up with a shepherd at dawn one of the lads won is confidence like speaks a bit of the language the locals dontcare for the frogs theyve bled the island white an the women too by th sound of it anyway he said that the ships are preparin to leave goin to crete or somewhere to wait for more ships de brueys bolitho looked at him gravely why did lieutenant veitch stay behind he had already guessed the answer mr veitch told me that e thinks youll attack sir said youd not let the nicator go in on er own he scowled but for this mangy fist id ave stayed there with im bolitho said your return is of greater value to me and i thank you veitch had seen it right from the beginning that without more ships they could not keep in contact with nicator nor could they reach her before dawn and the moment of attack plowman added wearily as bolitho refilled the glass mr veitch said e would try to elp sir he got three volunteers with im he gave a sad grin all as mad as im if youll pardon the liberty sir so i cant tell you no more his head lolled with fatigue and bolitho said quietly tell allday to help him to the sickbay and have his hand dressed and see that both boat crews are rewarded in some way he looked at their faces farquhars set in a grim frown outhwaites liquid eyes watching him with quiet fascination and pascoe his black hair falling across one eye as if he too had a scar to hide bolitho asked well captain farquhar what is your opinion on this he shrugged but for nicator s safety id advise you to withdraw sir there is no sense in putting your honour before the loss of a squadron we gambled on the french keeping all their precious artillery stowed in their holds and relying on more conventional weapons he glanced briefly at plowmans sagging shoulder he had fallen into an exhausted sleep but if fellows like plowman here and lieutenant veitch are prepared to throw their lives down the hawse i suppose i will do the same he looked calmly at his first lieutenant commodores instructions mr outhwaite one hot meal and a double ration oj rum for all hands after that you may douse the galley fires and then clear for action our people will sleep beside their guns tonight he looked at bolitho if sleep they can farquhar nodded curtly now if you will excuse me sir i have some letters to write bolitho looked at pascoe i wish you were in almost any other ship adam in any place but here pascoe regarded him searchingly i am content sir bolitho walked to the windows and stared at the silver glow across the water like rippling silk the patterns changing endlessly he thought of farquhar writing his letters to his mother to the admiralty he said in my stewards keeping at falmouth adam there is a letter for you he felt pascoe step beside him and saw his reflection in the thick glass like brothers in the strange glow dont say anything he reached out and put his arm round his shoulder the letter will tell you everything you must do the rest you will decide for yourself but uncle pascoes voice sounded unsteady you must not speak like that it must be said he turned and smiled at him as it was once said to me and now he forced the pain out of his thoughts we must help mr plowman below but when they turned from the windows plowman had already gone disaster steer nornoreast farquhar remained near the wheel looking towards bolitho we will weather the headland as close as we dare he glared at the master do you understand mr bevan aye sir the master shifted under his stare its a bad entrance shoals below the headland some others offshore but the charts cant fix them exactly farquhar walked down to the quarterdeck rail no sign of life yet sir bolitho raised a telescope and moved it slowly along the uneven summit of the headland about a mile across the larboard bow but it was still resting in deep shadow with only the paling sky to give some indication of height and depth but he could see the writhing movement at the bottom of the nearest point to mark the sea breaking and sluicing over a steep stony beach and jagged reefs too he heard farquhars sudden impatience with the sailing master and guessed it had been as much to relieve the tension as anything but he had been wrong to vent his feelings on him bevan the master exmate of an indiaman needed all his wits about him now and the complete confidence of his three helmsmen without his captain throwing his temperament to all and sundry i expect none bolitho stiffened as something passed above the nearest hump of land for a moment he thought it was smoke but it was a solitary feather of cloud moving diagonally towards the water beyond the headland which was still in semidarkness he saw that the forepart of the cloud was pale gold holding the sun which was still hidden to the men in both ships he strode to the nettings and climbed on the top of a ninepounder to peer across the quarter buzzard was right on station two cables astern with her mainsail and topgallants clewed up and her big forecourse braced round to contain the light southwesterly wind she looked very slender and frail in the dim light and he pictured javal with his officers watching the same jutting land and willing time to pass to get on with it but it would be some while yet he thought the french would bide their time and not risk their enemys escape by opening fire too early he stepped down from the gun and almost fell despite the liberal scattering of sand along every gun deck the planks were damp with night dew and treacherous underfoot a seaman caught his elbow and grinned at him easy sir well not ave em sayin it was our gun which downed the commodore bolitho smiled as in every part of the ship the guns were fully manned and loaded all it needed to complete her preparedness was to open the ports and run out but if there was some watcher on the land there was no point in showing that osiriss upper line of gun ports was only black squares painted on canvas he said nor that i was too drunk to stand upright eh they laughed as he knew they would the air around the guns even in the cool wind was heavy with rum and he guessed that far more than a double tot had found its way to each man or that some had used their issue to pay old debts or to purchase something better most likely some had held back their rum to cover bets what had they bet on who would live or die how much prize money they would receive which officer would hold his nerve the longest he had no doubt that the bets would be many and varied he walked forward again to the rail and stared along the shadowed gun deck figures moved restlessly around each black barrel like slaves as they tested each piece of tackle and equipment for their trade the gun captains had done their part had made certain that the first balls to be fired were perfect in shape and weight that each charge was just right after the opening shots it was usually too desperate too deafening to pause for such niceties he looked up and saw the marine marksmen in the tops while right forward on the forecastle there were more of them standing loosely beside their long muskets or chatting with the carronade crews bolitho heard allday say ive brought the sword sir he slipped off the boat cloak he had been wearing since three hours before dawn and allowed allday to buckle on his sword allday said softly but with obvious disapproval you look more like a buccaneer than a commodore sir i dontknow what theyd say in falmouth bolitho smiled one of my ancestors was a pirate allday he tightened the belt buckle he had lost some weight during his fever when it was a respectable calling of course he turned as farquhar hurried past have you extra hands on pumps and buckets yes sir farquhar ran a finger around his neckcloth if they use heated shot on us im as ready as i can be he looked at the nets spread above the gun deck at the looser ones draped along the shrouds to prevent a sudden rush of boarders to the sentries at each hatch and companion and the boatswains party who waited to hack away fallen spars or clear corpses from an upended gun bolitho watched him seeing his mind examining each part of his command for a flaw or a weak point under their feet and beneath the crowded gun deck the lower batteries of thirtytwopounders would be ready and waiting and below them standing like ghouls in a circle of lanterns the surgeon and his assistants watching the empty table the glittering knives and saws bolitho recalled luce s pale face his pleading his one frantic scream he looked across at pascoe who stood on the lee side by the main shrouds talking with a petty officer and a midshipman was he thinking about luce he wondered aft on the poop the bulk of the marines waited by the nettings in three lines for if osiris was to engage from her larboard side they would have to fire rank by rank like soldiers in a square bolitho tried to pick out faces he knew but there were hardly any anonymous yet familiar typical but un known marines and seamen lieutenants and midshipmen he had seen them in a dozen ships in as many fleets a marine lieutenants silver shoulderplate gleamed suddenly as if heated from within as bolitho turned his head to starboard he saw the suns rim on the horizon the rays filtering down across the ruffled water towards him like molten metal allday remarked going to be a fine day lieutenant outhwaite was standing by the main companion way his eyes glowing like little stones as he stared towards the sunrise like his captain he was impeccably dressed his hat set exactly square on his head his long queue straight down his spine farquhar wore no hat but a midshipman stood near him carrying it and his sword as if for an actor waiting to begin his most difficult role in fact bolitho saw that farquhars mouth was moving speaking to himself or rehearsing a speech for his men he did not know his hair was very fair and he had it pulled back to the nape of his neck and tied with a neat black bow whatever happened in the next hours farquhar was dressed for it he seemed to sense bolithos scrutiny and turned towards him he gave a slow smile a new uniform sir but i recalled your own custom before a fight of consequence he gave a brief shake of the head and as your tailor is else where i thought i would set the example bolitho replied a kind thought he peered along the deck again seeing the landmass growing and looming towards the bowsprit as if they were touching the enemy will not fire until he has a sure target his gunners will have the sun in their eyes directly but once we are standing well up the eastern shore it will not help us much there is a dip behind the bay i have in mind a good site for longrange guns he strained his eyes beyond the bows as a voice yelled surf fine on the larboard bow the master said tightly thatll be the damned reef sir let her payoff a point mr bevan steer nor east by north farquhar looked at his first lieutenant dyou have a good leadsman in the chains aye sir the frogface watched him questioningly i have stressed the importance of his task this morning bolitho found he could smile in spite of the gnawing uncertainty of waiting farquhar and outhwaite were well matched so maybe farquhar was right in his methods of selection after all they said of west country ships that they were foreign to all but the cornish and devonians who manned them the ways of st jamess and mayfair were as hard to learn the light was spreading and filtering on to small beaches now and winkling out shadows from hillsides and coves the seas face too was clearer the tiny white catspaws moving away to starboard to merge in the colourful horizon and the sun maybe the real lysander has seen such a sea bolitho thought when the fleets of triremes and galliasses had smashed into each other and the sky had been dark with arrows and darts of fire from astern he heard the sudden squeak and rumble of guns being run out and knew that javal was getting ready farquhar snapped alter course three points steer north he craned over the nettings to watch a hump of sand or rock edging past the quarter some gulls rose squawking from their little islet very white against the lands backdrop they circled above the mastheads hoping for food noisy in their greed bolitho looked up at his pendant as one gull dipped near it screaming angrily it was flapping less persistently for the land was creeping past dampening down the wind he thought of probyn it was to be hoped he had worked his ship into position early to allow for adverse winds the treacherously narrow channel he pulled his watch from his breeches and examined it he could see it well now even the beautiful lettering on the face mudge and dutton of london he closed the guard with a snap and saw midshipman breen jump with alarm he said very well we are past the headland outhwaite swung round his speaking trumpet to his mouth mr guthrie pass the word run out as the port lids squeaked open there was a brief pause and down on the lower gun deck the seamen stripped and ready would be seeing the land for the first time a whistle shrilled and with a mounting tremble osiris ran out her artillery brail up the forecourse farquhar watched the great sail being subdued and brailed to its yard and snapped his fingers the midshipman gave him his sword and then his hat he adjusted his hat with care and after a moment walked forward to the weather gangway the forecourse had completed the illusion the stage was set the actors were prepared bolitho drew his sword and laid it flat on the rail feeling the steel cool under his palms run up the colours he heard the squeak of a block and saw the flags great shadow rippling across the gangway and above the gentle bow wave now standto lads and make each ball count he glanced quickly at the nearest gun crews they could have been placed in any part of history one seaman standing by a sixteenpounder immediately below the quarterdeck was leaning on a rammer his neckcloth tied around his ears to withstand the first deafening roar men like him had sailed with drake aboard his revenge and had cheered as the armada had been drummed up the channel but this time there were no cheers not even an isolated one the men looked grim watching the open gun ports or standing close to one another as if for support he saw farquhars fingers opening and closing repeatedly around his sword scabbard his head very erect as he stared towards the wavering coastline from where the enemy would open fire a light blinked from the nearest hilltop but did not reappear a broken bottle reflecting the first ray of sunrise the window of some concealed dwelling bolitho shivered or a ray of light catching the lens of a telescope he imagined the signal being carried over the hill to the waiting artillery the english are coming as expected and predicted he frowned no matter what happened they had to hold the enemys attention until probyn swept down on the anchored ships from the northern channel a few heavy broadsides amongst a crowded anchorage and the odds could change considerably he remembered suddenly what his father had once told him there is no such thing as a surprise attack surprise is only present when one captain or another has miscalculated what he has seen from the beginning he glanced at pascoe and smiled briefly he now knew exactly what his father had meant bolitho recrossed the quarterdeck and trained a glass on an outthrust shoulder of land a few tiny dwellings were visible at the foot of a steep slope nestling between some scrub and the nearest beach fishermens homes but their boats lay abandoned on the coarse shingle and only a dog stood its ground by the waters edge barking furiously at the slow moving ships he heard farquhar say sharply the next bay will be the one outhwaite turned and called be ready hold your fire till the order then shoot on the uproll allday muttered scornfully uproll until we get clear of this headland and find some sort of wind again therell be no uproll deck there the masthead lookouts voice seemed unusually loud ships at anchor around the point bolitho breathed out slowly signal the information to buzzard an acknowledgement broke from the frigates yards within seconds javal was like the rest of them on the last edge of tension he glanced at his watch nicator should be well through the other channel by now and setting more sail to begin her vital part even if french pickets had sighted her it would be too late to move artillery to the other end of their defences the bang when it came was like an abbreviated thunderclap bolitho saw neither smoke nor flash but watched the balls progress across the swirling current it must have been fired from a low level for he could see its path in a line of tiny wavelets like an unnatural wind or a shark charging to the attack the crash of the ball into the forepart of the hull brought a great chorus of shouts and yells and bolitho saw the second lieutenant hurrying from gun to gun as if to reassure the crews look there sir allday pointed with his cutlass soldiers bolitho watched the tiny bluecoated figures bursting from the trees and scurrying towards the point perhaps they believed that the second wave of attacking ships would attempt a landing and were getting ready to repulse them bolitho licked his lips if only there was a second wave he said bring her up a point captain give our upper battery a target farquhar protested eighteenpounders against infantry sir bolitho said quietly it will give them something to keep their minds occupied it may also shake the enemys confidence up ahead they are anticipating a squadron remember he winced as another bang echoed across the water and he heard the ball hiss viciously overhead stand by to larboard outhwaite pointed at the running soldiers on the uproll he raised his speaking trumpet fire the long line of guns hurled themselves inboard on their tackles the smoke rising and swirling above the packed hammock nettings bolitho held his glass on the land seeing the balls whipping through trees and scrub throwing up stones and clods of earth in haphazard confusion the soldiers had obviously held the same ideas as farquhar for many were caught out in the open and bolitho saw bodies and muskets whirling through the air with the other fragments it was little enough but it had given the gun crews some heart he heard a few cheers and yells of derision from the lower battery who had not been allowed to fire outhwaite had caught some of the excitement move roundly lads reload mr guthrie a guinea for the first to run out from a comer of his eye bolitho saw the headland drop ping back the first group of anchored ships glinting in frail sunlight their sails furled and their unmoving rigidity suggesting that each vessel was attached to the next and so on making them into an unbroken barrier he had expected the french to anchor in this manner it had been a favourite defence since long before a revolution had even been dreamed of then he saw a flash it came from a deep green saddle between two hills and he knew the gunners had fired earlier to obtain a ranging shot it hit osiris amidships deep down and close to the waterline the planks under bolithos feet rebounded as if the ball had struck a few paces away instead of three decks down he saw farquhars anxiety as he watched his boatswain dashing for a hatch with his seamen and the wisps of dark smoke which eddied above the nettings as evidence of the guns accuracy from astern he heard the controlled crash of cannon fire and knew that javal was following his example and raking the nearest hillside in the hope of finding a target deck there french ship o the line at anchor beyond the transports bolitho swung the glass across the rail seeing faces on osiriss forecastle looming like visions in the lens before he found and trained on the french seventyfour like the packed mass of transports she was anchored but her sails were only loosely brailed up and her cable shortened home in readiness for weighing and beyond her gliding very slowly downwind was a frigate setting her foresail and shining momentarily as sunlight passed along her hull the two smaller escorts corvettes plowman had said were hidden elsewhere it was not surprising for the assembled fleet of supply ships overlapped in what appeared to be a hopeless tangle of masts and yards he watched them grimly through the glass deepladen guns powder and shot tents weapons and supplies for an army he felt the deck stagger as another ball smashed close alongside the only way to avoid being destroyed slowly by the hidden guns was to set more sail to attack and close with the anchored vessels and make accuracy impossible he heard farquhar say fervently where is nicator in gods name she should be in sight by now french seventyfours weighed sir bolitho looked at farquhar but he had not heard the report he said thank you tell your starboard gun crews to prepare mr outhwaite bolitho watched the boatswain emerging from beneath the quarterdeck and waited for him to come aft oled in two places sir but no damage below the waterline yet shes sound enough if it gets no worse farquhar nodded abruptly yes bolitho said set the foresl captain make to buzzard i am about to pass through the enemys line farquhar stared at him we could get fouled in their moorings sir id advise they ducked as another ball passed low above their heads and bolitho felt the breath of it across his shoulders like the wind of a cutlass blade bolitho said nicator should be in sight at least from the masthead probyn must have met some opposition if neither of us can get to grips we are being destroyed for nothing he strode to the lee side and watched a thin waterspout rise far abeam the french were very good as were their new guns at this range they could hardly miss and yet they were biding their time saving their aim for the rest of the squadron or to decide on the english tactics no it was wrong no gunnery officer could be that confident he heard the wheel going over the sudden flap and boom of canvas as the foresail was reset and its yard trimmed by the men at the braces it made some difference he could see the way one of the quarterdeck ninepounders was tugging at its tackles as the deck tilted to leeward the sudden increase of sail might make the french gunners show their hand he walked as slowly as he could to the other side peering across the crowded gun deck towards the french twodecker under minimum canvas she was standing off about two miles distant even that was wrong her captain commanded the most powerful ship present his first duty was to defend the merchantmen and supply vessels no matter what half a mile to go and through his glass he could see the tiny figures of seamen running about the decks of the nearest transport they probably still believed osiris was a threedecker and that they would take the first overwhelming broadside bring her up a point captain aye sir nor by west bolitho looked at pascoe any sight of nicator none sir pascoe gestured towards the massed shipping shes missing a promising target but bolitho knew him well enough to see through his calm remark he saw midshipman breen who was helping pascoe stare at him as if to seek confirmation that all was well the nearest transports anchored at the head of two separate lines opened fire with their bow guns the balls whimpering overhead one forcing a neat hole in the main topsail the master called suddenly lee bow sir looks like shallows farquhar replied tersely theyre well clear man what do you want me to do fly bolitho heard nothing for the next few seconds like something from his feverish dreams he saw the larboard bulwark burst apart the deck planking tom diagonally in a gash of flying splinters while wreckage and the complete barrel of a ninepounder landed with a crash on the opposite side the primed gun exploded and its ball upended another gun on to some of its crew the screams and sobs lost in the explosion when bolitho stared aft he saw that the great ball probably doubleshotted had smashed the wheel to fragments two helmsmen lay dead or stunned and a third had been pulped to bloody gruel men and fragments of men lay scattered around the quarterdeck and others tried to drag themselves away bolitho saw that bevan the master had been all but cui in half by the exploding ninepounder and his blood was pouring across the splintered deck while one of his hands still clawed at his exposed entrails as if it alone still clung to life plowman dashed out of the drifting smoke ill take over sir he dragged a terrified seaman from behind some scattered hammocks up come aft and well rig a tackle to the tiller head another crash this time into the side of the poop several marines toppled down a ladder and bolitho heard the heavy balls smashing through the cabin and careering amongst the crowded gun deck he yelled shorten sail captain he raised his sword like a pointer the french artillery judged it well he felt neither fear nor bitterness just a sense of anger osiris her steering gone was falling heavily downwind bevan the dead sailing master had seen the danger without understanding what it meant now it was too late the pressure of wind into her sails and against her hull was enough to guide osiris into that one shoulder of hard sand the enemy had used their opening shots like goads on wayward cattle a prod here a tap there to send the helpless beast into a carefully ranged and sited trap both of the hidden guns renewed firing with sudden vigour the shots crashing into the hull or falling dangerously near the buzzard which alone still headed towards the anchored ships pascoe yelled the enemy frigate is making more sail sir and i see one of the corvettes breaking clear of the anchorage bolitho trained his glass through the drifting smoke the frigate first long and lean thirtyeight guns against javals thirtytwo provided he had managed to avoid the heavy artillery he would stand a good chance if he could hold off the corvette if if if it was like hearing a taunt in his brain something made a dark flaw in the side of the lens and he swung it further to hold the french seventyfour in view she was still under minimum canvas and was moving very slowly towards osiris on a converging tack her guns run out but in shadow he considered this fact in shadow so her captain had no intention of trying to hold the windgage even now she was steering across osiriss starboard bow her reefed topsails braced hard round her forecastle and even the beakhead alive with waving seamen and glittering weapons he could see her name quite clearly immortalite farquhar shouted hoarsely how is the helm mr outhwaite have they rigged emergency steering bolitho watched the water rippling above the concealed sandbar fifty yards less even if they anchored they would be unable to fight clear now let alone do any damage to the transports he watched the twodecker her tricolour very bright in the sunlight he stiffened as he saw another flag at her mainmast a dovetailed broad pendant pascoe looked at him a commodore sir he tried to grin it should have been a full admiral to do us honour a ball thundered through a lower port and bolitho heard the attendant chorus of screams and cries for the surgeons helpers he turned again to the french ship pascoe was wrong it should have been probyn pouring his broadsides into the anchored transports now completely undefended as the twodecker and her smaller consorts came down the coast to give battle nicator would have had nothing to oppose her he felt the anger welling up like a burning flood the deck shuddered slightly and with the sound of a pistol shot the fore topgallant mast plunged down and over the side dragging broken rigging in its wake like black serpents farquhar stared at him wildly aground he moved a few paces to the side his shoes slipping on blood gods teeth he shielded his face with one arm as a ball slammed through the bulwark again upending another gun and cutting down two men who were dragging a wounded comrade away from their port farquhar asked flatly what orders sir bolitho kept his eyes towards the transports they seemed to be moving now edging across the bows in one vast mass but it was only because osiris was swinging very slowly to the pressure of wind her stem and forepart of the hull firmly embedded on hard sand he said slowly it is my belief that we will soon be able to use the starboard guns he saw farquhar nod his face ashen as more explosions threw spray high above the nettings the painted strip of canvas which had been their only deception had long since gone tom away in the hot wind of those guns he gripped his arm tightly dragging his mind from the threat and damage all around see the frenchman captain now he is making more sail farquhars eyes widened in gods name slowly inexorably her bow pivoting on the bar osiris was swinging away from the land no wonder the french commodore had stayed his hand within half an hour when he passed to leeward of the sandbar and the trapped ship he would see only osiriss exposed stem no commander could hope for a better or a steadier target andone broadside would sweep through the ship from stem to bow farquhar said then were done for bolitho walked past him pass the word engage with every gun that bears well sink a round halfdozen of them with any luck he heard the order being passed the squeak of trucks as the gun captains brought their weapons round as far as they would move towards the supply ships they would see only the enemy and even if they had guessed at their predicament it was unlikely they understood its full meaning farquhar knew well enough fire the long battery of thirtytwopounders crashed out in a ragged broadside and at full elevation bolitho knew that many of the balls would find targets fire the eighteenpounders hurled themselves inboard their crews working like madmen to sponge out and ram home new charges bolitho darted a quick look at the captain it showed on his face with each savage crash of a broadside the recoil of so many guns was enough to edge osiris still firmer aground it told him that the ship was already finished and that bolitho was carrying on with the attack despite it allday said hoarsely the hillside seems to be afire sir bolitho wiped his eyes with his sleeve and stared across the larboard bow osiris had pivoted right round now and he could seethe dense wan of smoke darting tongues of flame too rolling towards the sea and adding to the scene of chaos and despair allday said it for him must be mr veitch set the hillside ablaze its probably like tinder he sighed a brave man one of those guns will be blinded by smoke theyll not thank mr veitch for that a violent explosion thundered across the water and through the thickening smoke bolitho saw a vivid red heart pascoe coughed in the smoke we have hit one of the transports sir must have been loaded with powder fragments splashed down lazily and bobbed around the embattled ship beyond the smoke bolitho could hear sharp er notes of gunfire and knew javal was there fighting probably two enemies at once the masthead yelled above the din some of the french are making sail bolitho said cutting their cables he did not blame them with one or more of their number ablaze or badly crippled by osiriss broadsides they had nothing to gain by remaining where they lay he felt the deck under his feet lifeless but for the guns savage vibration and nobody could stop them something fanned past him crashed against a ninepounder in a shrieking wave of splinters men fell kicking and gasping and bolitho felt blood splashed across his breeches like paint he turned and saw farquhar leaning back against the quarterdeck rail his gaze fixed on the lower yards while he clutched his chest with both hands bolitho ran to his side here let me help farquhars eyes swivelled down towards him he bared his teeth spacing out each word to hold back the pain no leave me must stay must he had bunched the front of his new uniform coat into a tight ball a ball which was already bright red allday said ill take him below the ship quivered again as the lower battery vented its anger on the anchorage several masts had fallen and the two leading ships were listing towards each other one almost awash the other a blackened wreck in the path of that terrible explosion farquhar tried to shake his head keep your damned hands off me he reeled against bolitho mr outhwaite but the first lieutenant was sitting against one of the abandoned guns his head lolling and the deck around him spreading in blood bolitho looked at allday get mr guthrie tell him i want all the wounded brought to the lower gun deck larboard side and be quick about it he saw the smoke from the hillside mingling with that from the guns at least veitchs courage had given the wounded a chance without the smokes screen any attempt to get boats alongside would have been prevented by the two siege guns as it was the french were still firing blindly across the water the great balls adding their strange notes to the screams of the dying and wounded men a small man darted through the smoke and bolitho saw it was the surgeon despite farquhars protests he ripped open the goldlaced coat his hair blowing in the wind from another shot directly above the deck and placed a heavy dressing above the bright stain farquhar gasped get below andrews see to our people the surgeon looked despairingly at bolitho im getting the wounded up sir he peered dazedly at the shattered bulwarks and sprawled corpses even after the gruesome work he had to perform deep on the orlop deck this must seem a worse horror will you strike sir farquhar heard him and gasped strike get below you bloody fool ill see you in hell before i strike my colors bolitho beckoned to pascoe attend the captain you stay here too allday he ignored their anxiety and ran to the rail straining his eyes through the smoke until he had found the boatswain he could not remember his name but shouted wildly until the man looked up at him his face as black as any negros from powdersmoke and charred wreckage get the quarter boats alongside to larboard a raft too if you can manage it he turned as pascoe called him and saw a pale square of canvas rising through the smoke the ship beneath still hidden his sword blade touched the deck as his arms dropped to his sides time had run out the frenchman was here crossing their stem with the precision of a hunter stalking a wounded beast he saw too the enemys broad pendant lifting and curling in the offshore wind and wondered vaguely if its owner had seen his above the ruin and carnage the smoke seemed to fan upwards to a freak gust but the ripple of red and orange tongues which spurted through it told bolitho that this wind was manmade deck by deck pair by pair the seventyfours armament poured its broadside into osiriss stern it seemed to go on and on forever the cringing reeling men around him lost shape and meaning their faces merely masks of pain and terror their gaping mouths like soundless holes as they ran blindly before the onslaught bolitho found that he was on his knees and as his hearing started to return he groped for his sword using it like a lever to prise himself from the deck hardly daring to breathe he staggered to the rail or what was left of it and saw that pascoe and allday stood as before with the captain propped between them allday had a bad cut on one arm and pascoe had a dark weal on his forehead where he had been hit by a flying piece of timber bolitho could not get his breath to speak but clung to them nodding to each in turn beyond the quarterdeck there was not a mast left standing and the whole of the upper gun deck forecastle and gangways were buried under a mountain of broken spars and rigging smoke billowed from everywhere while beneath the heaped wreckage he heard voices calling for help for each other or cursing like men driven mad allday gasped mizzenll come down any minute sir he sounded faint only the shrouds holding it id say faintly through the din of shouts and splintering woodwork bolitho heard cheering frenchmen cheering their victory farquhar thrust pascoe away and reeled towards the broken hammock nettings his uniform was torn and several wood splinters were embedded in his shoulders like darts blood ran unheeded down his chest and marked his passage towards the side and when bolitho caught him he had his eyes tightly shut he gasped did we strike sir bolitho held him firmly as pascoe ran to help the mast with his pendant the halliards which had held the ensign all had been blasted away in the enemys broadside no we did not farquhar opened his eyes very wide and looked at him that is good sir iim sorry about he closed his eyes against another searing pain but exclaimed fiercely i hope probyn rots in hell hes finished us this day bolitho supported him knowing that pascoe was watching his face as if for an answer to something farquhar said quietly let me stand sir i will be all right now get that fool outhwaite to some last understanding flashed across his eyes and then froze there the second lieutenant staggered through the funnelling smoke but stopped motionless as bolitho said take your captain mr guthrie he watched a few men emerging from beneath the poop sir charles farquhar is dead the captains report only the wounded into the boats bolitho was hoarse from shouting above the din of gunfire several transports were shooting through the smoke and he knew that some of the shots would be hitting their consorts as the packed anchorage changed from a prepared defenceline to a scene of indescribable panic three ships were blazing fiercely and with their cables either cut or burned through were already drifting amongst the others bolitho could not tell how many guns were firing at osiris for with only a few of her lower battery still manned it was impossible to distinguish between a thirtytwopounders recoil and an enemy ball crashing into the hull he peered over the gangway and saw the boats immediate ly below him filled with wounded while others clung to the gunwales or floated away unable to swim or without the strength to do so others were clambering down the rounded tumblehome marines and seamen coopers and sailmakers while here and there the blue and white of an officer tried to restore order pascoe ran to his side what will happen now sir bolitho did not reply immediately down there adam that is what defeat is like the way it looks how it smells he turned away pass the word cease firing this ship may take fire at any moment when one of those wrecks drifts against us more violent crashes and freed at last from its remaining shrouds the mizzen mast plunged down alongside bedding itself in the shallows like a great marker he walked a few paces across the deck his shoes catching in splinters and the great diagonal rent where the french gunners had smashed down the helm and all around it a few men ran past him not even giving him a glance to where and for what purpose they probably did not know smoke poured across the hull and eddied through holes in the deck it was like walking in hell dead men were on every hand weapons and small possessions where they had been dropped or had fallen in battle a marine lay staring at the sky his head and shoulders supported on the lap of a comrade a best friend perhaps but he too was dead killed by a metal splinter as he had watched his friend die there was no sign of farquhar and he imagined that they had carried him right aft to the wrecked cabin with its once beautiful furniture and fittings a small figure emerged below the poop and he realised it was midshipman breen go with mr pascoe he watched the boy peering at him without a spark of recognition and take care breen nodded and then burst into tears i ran away sir i ran away bolitho touched his shoulder a lot of men did that today mr breen theres nothing more they can do here pascoe came aft with the second lieutenant the latter looked exhausted whitefaced with shock the boats are full sir he cringed as a ball ripped past him and struck something solid in the smoke the smoke was so thick that the other ship was completely hidden very well bolitho looked slowly along the deserted decks there would still be some who were trapped under that great tangle of wreckage listening or calling for help he said pass the word abandon ship we will ferry the wounded ashore he looked at pascoe i am sorry for you adam twice a prisoner of war in so short a span pascoe shrugged at least were together this time uncle allday who had been nursing his injured arm levered himself from the rail and said listen they looked at him and bolitho put his arm round him fearing that because of his own despair he had failed to help allday breen wiped his eyes with his fists and stared at allday i hear it he reached out for alldays hand i do hear it bolitho walked over the broken planks listening to the swelling roar of cheers it faltered only to a ragged crash of gunfire which was followed instantly by an even louder more violent broadside then the cheering resumed stronger and fiercer like one great voice allday said huskily thats no french cheer huzza huzza and again the smoke surged towards the stranded osiris stirred and blown by another massive broadside pascoe said buzzard allday leaned against him and looked at bolitho bless him sir did you hear that yes bolitho sheathed his sword without knowing why he had done so no frigate carries that number of men the second lieutenant dropped his head and said brokenly that damned nicator here at last too late to save our ship and all our men sunlight probed through the smoke and bolitho saw leaping flames and heard the crackle of burning timber a mastless hulk abandoned and well ablaze was less than fifty yards away but as the smoke swirled high in the air he stared at a ship which even now was firing another broadside downwind at some other invisible target there was no mistaking her lysander was steering past the scattered transports firing into individual vessels or pouring a halfbroadside into one isolated or apparently untouched her other side was obviously firing at the french seventyfour which explained the first cheers and violent broadsides bolitho saw and understood all of these things but found they carried no meaning only one thing counted lysander thomas herrick had come for them by some fantastic piece of luck and little less than a miracle he had sailed down from the north channel and turned the anchorage into a shipbreakers yard pascoe said i think thats buzzard now sir he was wildeyed his chest and throat moving with emotion yes it is her her sails are so holed she is barely making way bolitho rubbed his eyes seeing a corvette following close under lysanders stern she was listing but had less damage to her sails than javals victorious frigate also above her flapping tricolour she was wearing a large union jack bolitho wrenched his eyes away theyve got boats in the water tell our people that help is coming he watched the drifting hulk and prayed she was not one of the ammunition ships another gust of wind moved across the water and he saw that many of the transports had sunk completely if they were loaded with those great guns it was not surprising boats pulled below the osiriss shadow and he heard voices shouting encouragement while the oarsmen stared grimfaced at the battered holed wreck which had once been farquhars command plowman limped past carrying the ships chronometer he saw bolitho and gave a tense grin pity to leave it in the wreck sir erll come in useful he hurried to the side adding glad youre safe sir bolitho realised there were many boats now some with armed marines and swivels mounted on their stems while the others got on with the work of rescue that too became clear as he leaned on the rail to watch some boats were painted dark red from nicator then so somewhere beyond the scattered transports and burning wrecks probyns ship was here to see the price of the battle a lieutenant crossed the deck and touched his hat to pascoe nobody else survived but you he looked very clean against the horror and death bolitho said i survived the lieutenant gaped at him and snapped beg pardon sir i did not recognise you in bolitho said wearily no matter it has become a custom the officer blinked i am from nicator sir we did not think anyone had survived he waved his hand despairingly around the deck all this guthrie the osiriss second lieutenant suddenly ran from the poop and seized the young officer by the coat you bloody coward you damned crawling toad look what you did as pascoe pulled him away from the astonished lieutenant guthrie broke down completely his body shaking violently to his sobs the lieutenant gasped nicator ran aground sir but when lysander appeared out of nowhere we were able to kedge off fairly well without captain herricks arrival i fear we would have been even later bolitho watched him gravely seeing his despair his shame at guthries attack of that i am quite sure he walked to the sagging gangway now we can clear the ship he paused above the nearest launch his eyes on the hulls bare outline without masts or sails and with only the dead and a few trapped and crazed men to crew her osiris was already a wreck he felt the hull shudder as if in protest against his thoughts and knew that the blazing hulk had drifted along the other side he heard the crackle of flames the jubilant roar as they spread along osiriss tarred rigging which lay in huge coils to receive them the french or others might salvage some of her seventyfour guns and perhaps her bell as a souvenir but the keel and ribs would lie in the sand long after the flames had been quenched and until time and the sea completed the victory cast off he sat on the gunwale surrounded by silent men some wounded some merely stunned by all they had witnessed and suffered give way all bolitho looked at the other boats every one crowded with survivors but of osiriss original company of six hundred souls there were about half that number he tightened his lips and felt his gaze smarting from strain a very heavy price it was to be hoped someone would appreciate their sacrifice he heard a voice calling and then allday croaked god look at that gig it was lieutenant veitch blackened from head to foot and almost naked but waving towards him and grinning from ear to ear plowman murmured said ed make it that what e said the mad bugger bolitho lost sense of time and distance and as the boats were followed and surrounded by drifting smoke it was almost a surprise when he saw lysanders black and buff hull rising like a cliff to greet him her gun ports crammed with cheering faces her gangway thronged with seamen and marines he gripped the nearest stair below the entry port and pulled himself from the boat he felt as if his arms would not hold him or tear from their sockets there were hands gripping his figures pushing around him helping staring herrick took his arm and guided hill aft he said softly thank god he turned and studied bolithos face for some seconds thank god bolitho swung round as a searing column of flame shot above the smoke osiriss pyre he said see to her people thomas they fought well better than i dared hope he shrugged heavily but for your arrival their efforts would have failed their losses too great when weighed against the gains he nodded as pascoe joined them adam too is unhurt herrick peered through the smoke and the captain bolitho watched the leaping flames he died in battle he turned to herrick bravely more cheering echoed through the din of gunfire and someone called wildly the frenchies struck sir bolitho looked at herrick questioningly the seventyfour aye we shot her steering away and raked her twice before she could fight clear i think her captain was so taken with osiriss defiance he did not see us at all he reached out awkwardly so youll have another ship to replace the one lost lieutenant kipling strode aft and touched his hat boarding party in command now sir mr gilchrist has hailed us to say that the french commodore and most of his senior officers are wounded herrick nodded very well tell mr gilchrist to arrange an exchange with the enemy their officers and seamen in return for any of osiriss people who managed to swim ashore and we keep their ship bolitho watched him what a change herrick had not even hesitated or asked his aid herrick faced him again id like to anchor sir i understand that the french will not pursue their bombardment for the present javal ran their frigate into the shallows and she is hard and fast he took a sprightly corvette as a prize and i think the surviving one fled south as fast as he could go bolitho replied yes i agree but it is your decision as flagcaptain herrick looked at him and then smiled sadly about captain farquhar sir it is over for him thomas he died because he put facts before ideas because he put too much value in his own future perhaps but when he did die it was with courage herrick sighed that i never doubted a figure hurried beneath the poop and said youre back safe and sound it was ozzard his sad features set in a rare smile please come aft sir bolitho shook his head later i want to watch he looked at the ships which were already anchoring their boats surging alongside with cargoes of rescued men buzzard pockmarked from the french guns with her neat prize close by the other french ship her broad pendant gone and british flags at every masthead immortalite the name had served her well he thought she had survived and with luck would make a valuable addition to his little squadron he heard a loud explosion and watched scattered fragments falling all round osiriss powder store or a magazine had ignited at last he saw her open gun ports glowing like lines of red eyes as the fire consumed her from within deck by deck yard by yard his mind ached and he wanted to go to find seclusion deep in the hull beyond a mans voice or a sight of the sea but he stood by the nettings watching lysanders preparations the hurrying figures of so many familiar faces old grubb nodding and saying something to him about honour major leroux striding to speak with him but turning away at the last moment after seeing his expression fitzclarence and kipling little midshipman saxby with his gaptoothed grin and mariot the old gun captain who had served with his father he heard herrick shout tell them to make haste mr steere the wind is better placed and id like to weigh before noon before noon had it taken so little time since dawn bolitho stared listlessly at the littered water the corpses and charred timbers just hours since dawn that was all it had been many had died more would die later he gripped the nettings and took several deep breaths and he most of all had expected to be killed that was the strangest part he had often been near to death in his life at sea sometimes so close he had almost felt its presence like another being this last time had been the worst yet herrick came back to him again i hate to leave you sir with most of the men at quarters and the rest all wild with their victory it is hard to seize a moment when you need it the most thank you thomas he looked at the blazing osiris for them and for me herrick said ruefully had i only known sir he looked away but i thought it useless to remain at anchor when you had done so much had wanted so much for the squadron bolitho watched him gravely so you just sailed away thomas with a scrap of paper from your actingcommodore which if it had protected him from higher authority would most certainly have damned you your future would have been in ruins he saw the lines on herricks homely face and guessed that he had thought him dead or captured by sailing alone from syracuse he had made his own gesture just as inch had described some boats pulled abeam being careful to keep well away from the burning twodecker in case there should be an even worse explosion herrick said there go the french sir they fought well but were vanquished without the loss of a man to us we took them in surprise to us as much as them i suppose bolitho craned over the side and watched the nearest boat he saw a thin officer one arm in a sling and his uniform streaked with blood staring up at him his face dull with pain their commodore he raised one hand above his head and saw the french officers companions return the salute i know how it feels to lose what he is thinking at this very moment herrick regarded him anxiously he has his freedom sir from his thoughts thomas i think not he turned abruptly inboard once we are clear of this place i want a full report from captain probyn herrick watched him sensing his bitterness and anger aye sir bolitho faced him again but i not let anything more spoil the pleasure of seeing you again my friend he smiled his exhaustion making him appear somehow defenceless i had a message for you anyway thomas from a delightful lady who even now is planning a welcome for you in kent herrick stammered hell sir i mean he grinned did you meet her then it is what iam saying thomas he took his arm i hope i am there at your wedding as you were at he stopped and looked away id be honoured sir if it ever comes to it veitch hurried across the quarterdeck grinning to the laughs and taunts which attended his wild entrance herrick smiled another lysander has got home sir he looked at bolitho and added but if youve no objection id like to make him my first lieutenant immediately mr fitz clarence can command the corvette and mr gilchrist the french seventyfour that is until other appointments can be arranged as i said thomas you are the flag captain your opinions are mine i suppose always have been without either of us knowing but have you asked captain javal about his officers herrick smiled i hailed him in the battle he escaped unscathed buthe looked bolitho in the eyes we have only one frigate she needs to be better than all she meets anyway javal will be content with his prize money he became serious again as fitzclarence hurried aft his face full of questions ill deal with him if i may pascoe came to the side and said quietly it feels strange to be back bolitho nodded for you especially adam for me the dark eyes were surprised with gilchrist and fitzclarence in temporary command of the prizes he saw pascoes face clear with understanding you will step up two places to lysanders fourth lieutenant and at eighteen that is fair gain he thought suddenly of guthrie osiriss second lieu tenant at least pascoe had not got his advancement by anothers death or a gap left by someone like guthrie his mind unhinged by the cruelty of battle and he thought too of probyn seeing him again as a lieutenant his excuses his constant drunkenness if all these men had died today because of him there was no influence or authority in the world to save him he saw pascoes expression and knew he must have shown his own anger as he thought of probyn he said youve earned it and far more beside he turned to watch the white flag of parley being pulled past on one of lysanders boats y our father would have been proud of you bolitho walked away to join herrick by the gangway he did not see pascoes face but knew in his heart he had just given him a far greater reward than promotion bolitho was writing in the cabin when herrick came aft to see him it was a full week since they had sailed from corfu with its bitter sights and memories and after steering south and east around the countless greek islands they had discovered a safe anchorage where further repairs could be carried out for the time of year the weather was surprisingly bad if he hoped to return to syracuse with his squadron intact bolitho knew he would have to make sure they could withstand the passage there buzzard had been badly mauled and had received several holes below her waterline once in a heavy gust of wind as they had fought to shorten sail he had thought that the frigate was about to founder but javal had kept buzzard alive working her and his men until the immediate danger had passed the captured twodecker immortalite had also endured several hazards in the gales with her company of spare hands taken from all the squadron and the bulk comprising osiriss survivors she had not found the time to settle into a single unit her jury steering had carried away twice before she had been brought under command and bolitho could do nothing but admire the determination of her temporary cap tain lieutenant gilchrist herrick had certainly been right in his choice in fact with their resources stretched and reduced by battle it was hard to know how they would have managed without him he looked up and smiled as herrick entered the cabin sit down thomas have some wine herrick sat and waited until ozzard had brought him a goblet bolitho said ive been making my report as soon as the weather eases i want fitzclarence to sail for syracuse and then on to gibraltar he added dyou think he can do that herrick grinned over his glass i think he will find his way sir he grimaced as a gust of wind brought spindrift splashing across the stem windows but it may be a while yet im grateful we found this little island major leroux had his pickets ashore but says it seems uninhabited it will give us shelter at least until javal and gilchrist have done some more repairs bolitho looked at his thick report mr gilchrist has shown up well thomas he glanced across the cabin seeing faces in his imagination ive recommended that he be made commander at the first opportunity and given a ship of his own a brig most likely it should teach him the more human side of command a small ship with a vast amount of work thank you sir im glad i know he got off badly with you and i blame myself for it but hes had a hard climb to get where he is and i admire his tenacity yes bolitho thought of the letters he had written for the despatch bag to farquhars widowed mother to others who would know before long that a husband or father would never come home herrick hesitated and then said mr grubb fears that the adverse winds will not blowout for days sir maybe weeks were snug enough here and i was wondering if youd wish the other business to be dealt with now they looked at each other bolitho replied you were right to remind me perhaps he had only been putting it off avoiding a confrontation ill have captain probyn aboard tomorrow unless theres a full gale again herrick seemed relieved i read his account sir straightforward grounding in a badly charted channel when i reached nicator i saw she was on a bar not badly but enough for us to need a kedgeanchor bolitho stood up and walked to the wine cabinet over and over again he had thought about herricks sudden and vital arrival at the scene of battle with the aid of lysanders log the masters lengthy explanation and what he had managed to drag from herrick himself he had built up a picture of the ships movements after leaving syracuse driven by that strange loyalty herrick had sailed not direct to corfu but much further south and to the coast of africa east and still further east the lookouts scanning every mile for a ship or better still a fleet when he recalled herricks early despair his apparent inability to contain the work of flag captain it was all the more incredible all those long empty miles until finally they had sighted the walls of alexandria and the bay of aboukir which guided them to the mouth of the great nile itself when he had praised herrick for his stubborn determination his inbuilt belief in bolithos conclusions herrick had said you convinced me sir and when i told the people that they seemed content to go where i wanted he had shown some embarrassment when leroux had said captain herrick made a speech to all hands which i think must have reached you sir wherever you were at the time with no sign of a french fleet herrick had decided to make for corfu confident that the supply ships would be there and imagining the squadron still at anchor in syracuse he had sailed into the attack from north to south he had explained was better for surprise and left the wider channel as an escape route but he had run down on nicator two ships meeting as if by plan timed to the hour of attack the same storm which had scattered bolithos depleted squadron had sent the faster lysander as far as the nile and back across the sea to corfu bolitho refilled their goblets and returned to the table unless there has been a great change thomas we can only believe that the french will soon move to attack the corvette which escaped from corfu may have returned there but far more likely she will have headed for france he glanced at the streaked windows and listened to the moan of wind through the shrouds and furled sails she may have a hard fight but we must accept that she will get to a port before anyone else herrick nodded slowly true so the french admiral may decide to come out at last if he knows that his heavy artillery is on the sea bed hell anticipate a running battle it makes good sense bolitho said we are badly placed here with these prevailing winds we need to be much further west again where we can be of use to our fleet when it comes if it comes herrick sighed but weve done what we can so far yes he thought of the seaburials which attended each day after the battle and theyll not find us wanting there was a tap at the door and midshipman saxby said anxiously mr glasson sends his respects sir and could you come on deck bolitho looked at herrick and gave a quick wink with two lieutenants short the vacancies had gone to the senior midshipmen glasson more sharpfaced and seemingly sourer than ever was making the most of it he rarely held a watch without calling herrick or veitch to attend one of his tantrums over duty or apparent incompetence of some seaman or other herrick stood up ill come up in a quieter tone he said ill put this little prig over my knee in view of the whole ships company if he tries my patience much more bolitho smiled gravely our wardroom gets younger every day thomas or we get older herrick shook his head these youngsters if id called down to my captain when i was commissioned lieutenant id have been tom into small pieces unless the ship had been actually falling apart faintly above the wind and ship noises bolitho heard the hail boat ahoy and the reply from somewhere near lysanders quarter nicator herrick looked at him questioningly mr glasson is not troubling me for a trivial cause this time he reached for his hat captain probyn is coming aboard without waiting for your summons so it seems he listened to the marines clattering towards the entry port bring him aft thomas and we shall see captain george probyn loomed into the cabin his coat and breeches blotchy with spray from the hard pull to the ship his face was even redder than before and as he stared belligerently around the cabin he said i trust you will see me sir i do see you bolitho gestured to a chair well probyn sank into the chair and glared at him ill not mince words sir ive been hearing things about my ship and what happened off corfu ill not stand by and have my good name slandered bandied about by rogues not fit to wear the kings coat he pointed at the papers on the table i made a full and proper report it will stand any scrutiny a damned court of enquiry if need be bolitho said quietly some claret for the captain ozzard he added or brandy perhaps probyn nodded brandy better for a man in these damned waters he almost snatched the goblet from ozzard and downed the drink in one huge swallow if i may sir he thrust the glass to ozzard for refilling despite the persistent wind which swept across the little bay and sent countless whitehorses amongst the anchored ships the air in the sealed cabin was warm and humid bolitho had put on his coat to receive probyn but was wishing that he was still in his shirt he watched the brandy moving into probyn s eyes and voice blurring and distorting as he repeated almost word for word how his sailing master and the officer of the watch ayoung booby if ever i saw one the leadsman in the chains i had him seized up and flogged double quick i can tell you and several others had made the grounding inevitable bolitho waited until there was a pause while ozzard filled the goblet again the servants eyes were lowered but he could not hide his interest his experience as a lawyers clerk was probably too much for his normal reserve then bolitho said calmly so you were not actually there when it happened there the redrimmed eyes fixed on him with obvious effort of course i was there ill trouble you to keep a civil tongue in your head captain bolitho kept his tone level even gentle but saw a warning show itself on probyns reddenedfeatures yes yes i apologise its been troubling me thinking you might blame me in some way for what well captain where were you in nicator when she struck let me see now he pouted heavily must be exact eh like we used to be in the old trojan when we were lieutenants together bolitho remained very still watching the emotions and blurred memories on probyns heavy features he said that was a long time ago probyn leaned forward his sleeve knocking over the empty goblet not so long surely its like a dog watch ago to me she was a fine old ship trojan bolitho nodded to ozzard who brought a full goblet for the captain she was hard and demanding as i remember a good school for those who wanted to learn but hell on earth for the laggard captain pears was never a one to tolerate fools probyn looked at him his eyes glazed of course i was that bit senior to you knew a bit more so to speak saw through their little game game probyn tapped the side of his nose ysee you didnt even suspect the first lieutenant was always on at me the captains lickspittle and that other lieutenant the one who got killed he was a crawler bolitho stood up and walked to the wine cabinet seeing kates face and hearing her infectious laugh when she had given it to him she would laugh at him now if she were here how she despised the ways of true authority he said sharply apart from the very junior lieutenants then that only left you and me he poured himself a glass of claret waving ozzard away as he continued i remember that ship in many ways but one of the things which i recall most clearly and which has come back to me during this last week was the way you drank he swung round seeing the sudden alarm on probyn s face several times that i knew of men were flogged because of things which you had done wrong do you remember the night watches which others had to perform because you were too much in your cups to get on deck that lickspittle you just mentioned saw to it that the captain knew nothing about it but by god probyn if id been your captain id have made certain you never did it twice probyn lurched to his feet his great shadow reaching towards bolitho like a curtain indeed you would like the time we took two prizes i was put in charge of the first a rotten worminfested hulk thats all she was i never stood a chance when the enemy ship came after me he was squinting with fierce concentration his face and throat wet with sweat it was deliberate to get rid of me you were senior to me the prize was yours by right what about a previous one a little schooner you were supposed to take her into new york but a masters mate went in your place he watched his words slamming home the fuddled way which probyn s eyes were swivelling around the cabin as if to discover answers bolitho said harshly you were drunk then admit it man probyn sat down very slowly his hands shaking as he supported himself on the arms of the chair ill admit nothing he looked up his reddened eyes filled with hate sir so youve nothing more to tell me about nicators grounding the question seemed to take him momentarily off guard then probyn said i have made a full and proper report he thrust his hands under the table and i have taken sworn statements from those of the watch who were involved he leaned forward his drinksodden face crafty as he added if there is a court of enquiry i will produce those statements one of which may incriminate the officer of the watch an admirals nephew by the way and it may be thought that you were not unbiased sir that you were levelling old scores by having my reputation tarnished he fell back startled as bolitho stood up his eyes blazing with contempt dont you bargain with me a week back we struck a blow against the enemy but the harm which was done to our people was more deeply felt but for lysanders arrival and buzzards support yours would be the only ship afloat today think on these things the next time you dare to talk of bias or honour he called for ozzard and added you may return to your ship now but remember what cannot be proved is nevertheless between us the squadron is undermanned and officered for the most part by inexperienced youngsters for that reason alone i am not holding an official court of enquiry herrick appeared in the door with ozzard but stayed very still as bolitho said but hear me captain probyn if i ever discover that your failure to give support was deliberate or that at any time in the future you act against the interests of this squadron i will see you hanged for it probyn snatched his hat from ozzard and lurched blindly from the cabin when herrick returned he found bolitho as before staring at probyn s empty chair with an expression of disgust he said that was an ugly side of me thomas but by god i meant every word of it storm clouds it was nearer to two weeks before bolitho could hoist his signal to up anchor and leave their sheltering islet even then the ships were plagued by fierce gusts of gale force and it soon became apparent that buzzards damage was worse than javal had realised his men worked through every watch on the pumps without a break and with the limited resources he had aboard he used all spare timber and canvas for the most severe hull damage after the savagery of battle the elation at seeing lysander thrusting her bows through smoke and falling spray this renewed effort by the weather to delay their every move was all the more disheartening as the ships became scattered and worked back and forth on varying tacks to gain headway into equally determined southwesterly winds bolitho was thankful they had not sighted an enemy squadron across their path his crews were worn out by constant work and with each ship left underhanded because of dead and wounded he knew that any sort of a victory would fall to the opposing side perle the captured french corvette had made off with his despatches and he knew that herrick was still worrying about lieutenant fitzclarence s ability to make the right landfall and pass his information to the admiral at gibraltar perhaps he should have directed perle to sail directly to gibraltar but if his news was to reach all available sources of communication he knew that fitzclarence must first call at syracuse he was pacing his cabin his chin on his chest his body angled to the ships tilt when he heard the cry deck there sail to the norwest for once he was unable to restrain himself and without waiting for a message from the quarterdeck he hurried from the cabin to join herrick and the other officers at the rail herrick touched his hat you heard then sir aye thomas bolitho ran his eyes quickly along the upper gun deck due to the weather and the necessary delays while repairs were carried out it was a month since they had watched the french supply vessels sinking and burning under their bombardment since farquhar had died with so many of his men and nicator had gone aground the men who were by the bulwarks and gangways or standing in the shrouds in the hopes of sighting the new comer looked tougher he thought herrick had done well it was not easy for common seamen to understand what was happening beyond their own ship some captains did not bother to tell them but herrick as always had tried to explain whenever he could the reasons and the rewards had farquhar remained in lysander he would have benefited from herricks example these men bolitho knew would have given that bit extra as the ship had drifted towards the sandbars her master dead and the helm shot away he looked up sharply as a lookout yelled tis the harebell sir herrick grinned his face shedding some of the strain as he said good old inch i was beginning to wonder what had happened to him they watched the sloops sails growing out of the horizon the steep angle of her masts as she crammed on more canvas to run down on the squadron bolitho saw the changing shadows on the sloops topsails and found himself pleading that the wind would not choose this moment to desert them the thought of being becalmed with inch and his news too far away to contact was almost unbearable and the wind had acted in that fashion several times since they had sailed from the greek islands strong to gale force and then breathing away to nothing the sodden decks and sails steaming in fierce sunlight the ships motion less like men beaten senseless in a brawl herrick asked softly what dyou think sir good or bad news bolitho bit his lip inch had been away a long while as his little squadron had sifted information and news of the enemys whereabouts and strength almost anything might have happened he replied my guess is that a blockade will not be built up around the french ports once de brueys knows his supply fleet and siege artillery are destroyed at corfu he may think differently about invasion our people have worked hard thomas i hope their efforts will have given the fleet time the air was heavy with greasy smoke from the galley before harebell had tacked close enough to lower a boat bolitho noticed that most of the offwatch seamen remained on deck instead of going for their midday meal to see inch come aboard to try and learn something of what was happening in the great cabin bolitho made inch take a glass of wine to give him a moment to regain his breath it was strange he thought that after all the battles and the pain it often fell to men like inch to carry really important news you would hardly notice him in a street gangling with his long horseface and excited manner he did not seem the stuff of heroes as their public liked to imagine but bolitho knew differently and would not have traded him for a dozen others inch explained i delivered the despatches and he shot herrick a quick glance and my passenger sir then i was caught up in tremendous activity he frowned to gather his thoughts rearadmiral sir horatio nelson in his flagship vanguard passed through gibraltarstrait at the beginning of may and headed for toulon herrick breathed out deeply thank the lord for that inch stared at him no sir i beg to differ there was a great storm and nelsons ships were scattered his own completely dismasted and almost run ashore he had to make for shelter to effect repairs to st peters at sardinia herrick groaned thats bad inch shook his head well in some ways sir bolitho said come man spit it out inch grinned apologetically nelsons repairs delayed his plans but allowed his other reinforcements to join him he now commands fourteen sail of the line but he saw herricks face and added hurriedly the truth is sir the same gale which dismasted vanguard allowed the french to slip past he looked from one to the other the french are out sir herrick said bitterly and they escaped much as our frenchmen did god damn the weather is that all commander inch bolitho kept his tone level but could feel the disappointment rising inside him inch shrugged the french have taken malta without a fight sir nelsons ships have been searching for de brueyss fleet without success he has followed their passage through the liguriansea and even looked into some ports where other french ships might have been sheltering until they were ready to move out you have done well inch bolitho gestured to ozzard for some more wine and you have brought despatches inch nodded i was ordered to naples by the admiral sir there i met with the fleet at last he grinned awkwardly and with nelson the devil you have herrick stared at him that i should like to have seen bolitho said quietly so you did not meet with perle he looked away as herrick started to explain about the battle and the new prizes but bolithos mind was elsewhere by the time fitzclarence had reached gibraltar it would be too late for him to return and find nelson he blamed himself for not thinking that a fleet would be sent so quickly to act upon his own sketchy information and the captured siege guns inch was asking excitedly so where are the french nelson has been off elba and civita vecchia and into naples without sighting a one and you have come westrd without meeting them i do not understand it bolitho faced them again did nelson receive you well indeed yes sir inch frowned he was not quite as i expected but i found him most compelling in spite of his anxieties bolitho tried to imagine what might lie behind those simple words was nelson blaming him for losing the french too for leading a british fleet which was sorely needed elsewhere to an empty trap inch added if and when i was able to find you sir i was to tell you to join the fleet with all speed off alexandria he saw bolithos surprise and said oh yes sir nelson has every faith in your conclusions he still believes that the french are heading for if not already in egypt he seemed to expect a show of excitement bolitho said captain herrick took it upon himself to visit alexandria but for a few decrepit turkish men o war and the usual coastal craft it was empty as it will be when nelson gets there he looked at herrick are you agreed thomas herrick nodded i fear so from what we discovered and heard at corfu it seemed as if those supply ships were expecting to leave for another destination before they joined their main fleet he looked at the chart on bolithos table his face grim so when nelson sails east he will miss de brueys by a hundred miles or more the french will rendezvous up here he tapped the chart with one finger most likely off crete he looked at bolitho while we sheltered amongst those islands the greatest force since the spanish armada probably steered just a few miles to the southrd of us and we knew nothing of it inch asked dubiously what will de brueys do sir bolitho stared at the chart in his shoes id gather up all the surviving transports then wait for any others which may have been scattered amongst smaller islands and bays then id sail southeast for egypt inch stared at him no sir i beg to differ there was a great storm and nelsons ships were scattered his own completely dismasted and almost run ashore he had to make for shelter to effect repairs to st peters at sardinia herrick groaned thats bad inch shook his head

the chart in his shoes id gather up all the surviving transports then wait for any others which may have been scattered amongst smaller islands and bays then id sail southeast for egypt alexandria sir herrick watched him searchingly yes but i think his fleet will remain outside the harbour somewhere where they can present their resistance to best advantage herrick nodded understanding the bay of aboukir there could be none better he grimaced for them bolitho walked to the stern windows his legs braced as the ship swayed dizzily across some deep troughs and nelson will return to the west he was speaking almost to himself he will imagine that de brueys has tricked him and has attacked some other place after all he had often heard of nelsons sudden depressions his self criticism when his bold ideas failed to show immediate results something flashed across the windows and he saw it was a gull darting down to seize an unsuspecting fish below the counter a few hundred miles and yet it meant the difference between success and nothing at all he knew where the french would gather their combined strength which with or without siege guns could soon occupy the walls and batteries of alexandria he knew it but could not tell the rear admiral in time if only he were like that gull and his news could be carried as swiftly as a birds flight the gull would be sleeping on some greek or italian shore tonight and his ships would have made little progress in any direction he said slowly i want all commanding officers aboard at once thomas if we are to be of any use we must use our independence inch bobbed not join nelson sir bolitho smiled at his anxiety eventually herrick jerked his head to inch come with me while i have the signal made he glanced at bolithos grave face he knew from experience when he needed to be alone with his thoughts two hours later they had all assembled in the cabin javal holloweyed from sleepless nights fighting the sea and wind with weakening resources probyn his heavy face wary and avoiding bolithos glance as he found a chair in a patch of shadow lieutenant gilchrist awkward amongst his superiors but more sure of himself than bolitho had ever seen before being in charge of a seventyfour could affect a man in several ways it appeared to have been good for him herrick and inch completed the gathering while moffitt the clerk sat at a small table with his pad and pen and ozzard stood curiously beside the polished wine cabinet bolitho faced them gentlemen i have to tell you that we must go and search for the french again de brueys is out and so far has avoided the fleet which was sent to contain him he saw javals tiredness slip away the exchange of glances between them we in this small force of ours must do all we can to delay the enemys plans youve done far more than any orders dictated he smiled or left unsaid herrick grinned ruefully and inch nodded in silent agreement he continued i will be honest with you if we are called to fight unaided the odds will be great perhaps too great he looked straight at javal and from you captain i must have complete honesty too javals narrow features were guarded sir your ship without a proper refit and within a short space of time what chance does she have the others looked at the deck or the chart on the table anywhere but at javals face javal half rose and then sat down heavily i can fight another storm if its no worse than those gone before sir he looked into bolithos eyes but that is not what you were really asking is it he shook his head i cant fight her sir she took a great hammering a few more balls into her and i fear shed founder he stared at some point above bolithos epaulette shes a fine ship sir and id not ask his voice trailed away bolitho watched his distress the agony his words had cost him he said quietly i was a frigate captain myself i know what you are feeling but i am grateful for your honesty more so because i know what buzzard means to you he continued in the same quiet tone buzzards main armament must be jettisoned at once it that does not suffice she will have to be abandoned he kept his eyes on javals lowered head i am giving you the french prize immortalite the bulk of your people can be spread amongst the squadron at your discretion we will need every man jack before long i understand that your first lieutenant was wounded in the fight captain he saw him nod and then turned to gilchrist you will take charge of buzzard and sail her to gibraltar with a skeleton company avoid trouble and you should make a safe passage i will give you your orders and also the recommendation that you be promoted to commander at the first opportunity gilchrist who had been listening to his decisions with obvious dismay jerked to his feet and exclaimed thank you sir im only sorry that he sat down again without finishing what he had started bolitho said we have three ships of the line they must be commanded by men of experience he glanced briefly at probyn but the man stared through him and courage herrick asked shall i order the squadrons badly wounded to be transferred to buzzard sir if captain javal is satisfied she is seaworthy after the guns have been jettisoned i think it should be done he raised his head to listen the wind has eased i think so let us be about it directly he gave inch a pat on the arm and you commander inch will be able to carry the news of our discovery to your new friend sir horatio nelson as they prepared to leave the cabin herrick said farquhar would have wished to be with us aye thomas he saw gilchrist waiting to say something see the others into the boats and then tell pascoe to signal the squadron on the matter of wounded he turned to gilchrist what is wrong i thought you were happy with your appointment temporary though it will be i am sir gilchrist looked wretchedly at the deck j am not a rich man but i have had great hopes in the kings service now you have given me the first real chance he sounded near breaking point and i cannot accept it bolitho watched him impassively why because of captain probyn the influence he has used on you to unsettle the flagships affairs he saw the astonishment on his face and continued i knew that something was wrong no man who wished to better his position in the navy and wanted to marry his captains sister would have acted so foolishly unless he was affeared of something yes sir it was from a long while back my father was sent to prison for debt he was a sick man and i knew he could not endure it he was weak in many ways and had no one to sustain him he spoke fiercely reliving his despair i borrowed money from the wardroom funds which we had built up to pay for extra wine and fresh food whenever possible i intended to return it when i could the first lieutenant found out about it made me write a confession which he threatened to use if i ever failed in my duty again he did wrong mr gilchrist as did you gilchrist did not seem to hear when i came to lysander and eventually became senior lieutenant i thought i was going to be safe i admired captain herrick and i found his sister crippled though she is a most gracious person then we joined the squadron under your flag sir and with it came the nicator and captain probyn your old first lieutenant from the past aye sir so that was it all the years since his capture by the enemy probyn had nursed his hatred for bolitho the one face in his memory which he could reach and hurt and when he had found gilchrist again he had been prepared to use threats to make him force a breach between himself and herrick the effect on herrick had been for the good but it had cost others dearly and had indirectly put farquhar to an early death gilchrist said desperately after your kindness sir id not allow myself to profit further at your expense he gave a short bitter laugh and my father died anyway for nothing bolitho watched the other ships through the saltcaked windows buzzard would be safe now he thought lighter without her guns strong in the knowledge that she could avoid any sort of fight or manoeuvre beyond survival she would survive he said quietly i am giving you osiriss surgeon they say he is a sound doctor take good care of our wounded they have suffered enough do not allow them to be left stranded at gibraltar he turned seeing the surprise and gratitude on gilchrists face i am counting on your vigilance on their behalf gilchrist nodded dazedly you have my word sir then get about your business bolitho could not bear to watch his emotion like a man released from a great weight of worry from the shadow of the gallows itself youve a lot to do gilchrist walked towards the screen door his long legs ungainly his steps without their usual bounce he turned aft his face in shadow ill tell them when i get home sir about what we did just tell them we tried mr gilchrist he heard him walking very slowly towards the quarter deck allday came out of the sleeping cabin his face grave let me pour you a glass of wine he glanced meaningly at the closed door you were too easy on that one sir if youl pardon the liberty he learned a hard lesson allday i think others will profit from it one day allday watched him sipping the wine what about capn probyn sir bolitho smiled sadly a good question but hell fight when he has to he looked at allday three captains it is all we have personal differences must wait their turn allday grinned we do have a commodore sir and with all respect hes not a bad one at that bolitho smiled at him go to hell allday aye sir i dontdoubt i will he made for the door if theres any deck space with so many flag officers in residence bolitho walked to the windows and leaned against the warm timbers all the weeks and delays the hopes raised and dashed and now he saw a point in it all he thought of gilchrist tell them we tried it sounded like an epitaph he stirred himself and put down the glass it would be dusk in five or six hours he needed to be under way by then the wind aiding instead of hampering and this time the objective would be far too big to miss in the following days while the three ships sailed east and south each watch passed much like the one before bolitho deployed his small force in line abreast with lysander to the north and the immortalite to the south the wind became sluggish and uncertain but maintained its southwesterly direction so that after losing station during each night bolitho worked through the longer hours of daylight to regain his extended line in the centre probyns nicator was a constant reminder of what gilchrist had admit ted the weak link but still the only man with experience enough to handle his twodecker in battle nearly three miles separated each ship and with carefully chosen lookouts he hoped the area covered would betray some sign or an out flung patrol of the enemys strength he had sent inch away ahead of the squadron to use his agility and speed to reach alexandria well ahead of his heavier consorts only after he had received inchs report could he release him to carry his final information to the fleet day by day with the sun getting hotter and the first sweeping wave of excitement giving way to a more realistic attitude of resignation gun drill was carried out whenever possible as much to keep the hands occupied as to incorporate the newlyjoined men into their team herrick had told him that the purser was opening some of the lower tiers of salt beef and pork and there was no fruit and barely enough water to drink let alone use for personal comfort in lysander herrick did his best to keep his men busy on watch and involved in their own entertainment once the sun had departed at the end of each long day hornpipes and wrestling a prize of a double rum ration for the most original piece of ropework in many ways it was harder to think of new ideas than to keep the hands at work and drills bolitho hoped that javal and probyn were acting with equal vigour to sustain their own companies for if they failed to find the enemy this time there would still be no relief just a long relentless haul back to syracuse or to some other mark on the chart which their commodore thought profitable several times bolitho received signals from javal that he had sighted the northernmost coast of africa but otherwise it seemed as if they had the sea to themselves arguments began to break out and a knife fight ended in a man being badly gashed and the other flogged senseless as a grim reminder of discipline then when bolitho was starting to worry for harebell s safety the masthead sighted the sloop beating up from the southeast it took another full day for inch to draw near and when he eventually arrived on board his news was like a slap in the face he had sighted the pharos and had sailed as near as he could to alexandria as before it was empty but for the elderly turkish menofwar perplexed as to what to do inch had gone about and almost by accident had fallen on a small genoese trading vessel her master had confirmed what bolitho had believed from the start after leaving naples nelson had sailed direct to alexandria but finding it empty had led his fleet back to the west again how far and to what purpose bolitho could only guess but he could imagine the little admiral searching out information from syracuse or naples and trying to determine what action to take the genoese trader also told inchs boarding party that he had heard of heavy french ships of war off the cretan coast that had beenmany days ago despite all the questions comparing of charts even threats the trader could not be more definite it was almost dark by the time inch had completed his report and herrick and grubb had noted his sparse facts on the chart for future reference tomorrow bolitho would send harebell to search for the fleet again in his shoes bolitho would have been glad to go to get away from the ponderous manoeuverings of the twodeckers but inch protested one more day cannot hurt sir the french are to the north of us somewhere it would be better to remain with you and gather something definite for nelson rather than finding the fleet once more with little but rumour to offer bolitho agreed with him in part but for the weather and long delays left in the wake of battle they might have had better luck when he had confided his anxiety with herrick the latter had protested as strongly as inch there is nothing more you could do sir even rear admiral nelson was dismasted in a storm and allowed the frogs to escape from toulon its like seeking a hare in a burrow with only one ferret the odds of success are hard against you bolitho looked at them and smiled if i ordered you to sail up the cliffs of dover i believe you would obey inch grinned id need it in writing sir they went on deck together and while inch waited for his boat to pull alongside bolitho watched the molten ball of sunset spreading like stained glass in a church tomorrow then he walked aft and peered at the compass and nodded to plowman the masters mate of the watch how is the wind steady nough sir he squinted at the broad pendant curling lazily in the sunset tomorrowll be another day like this one bolitho waited as herrick carne from the entry port and said signal the ships to remain in close contact tonight thomas he shivered and clasped his arms around his stomach herrick peered at him startled are you ill sir is that damned fever returning bolitho looked at him and smiled rest easy its just a feeling he turned towards the poop i have a letter to write it can go with inch and his despatches later in the great creaking cabin with the shadows swaying and looming around his table bolitho rested his head on his hand and stared at the letter he was writing to his sister in falmouth he could picture nancy without difficulty darkeyed and unusually cheerful she remained closer than his other sister felicity whom he had not seen for six or seven years she was in india with her soldier husband while nancy remained in falmouth the wife of lewis roxby landowner magistrate and as far as bolitho was concerned a pompous bore once they had all lived together below pendenniscastle walls with hugh and then years later nancys two children helen and james now hugh was dead and felicity across the world knowing nothing of the french army moving in a blue flood towards egypt and towards her nancys children were grown up and nearly as old as adam it was another world in falmouth the air would be heavy with blossom and the sounds of cattle horses and sheep the taverns would be full of laughter of relief that the farms and fishing grounds had once more been good to them he wrote and young adam is keeping well and does his duty with a dash which would have pleased father it is not yet certain dear nancy but i think thomas may have met his lady at long last indeed i hope so for there could be no better husband he looked up as voices and feet crossed above the sky light but they moved away and he tried to think of something more to tell his sister he could not write of the other side of things the faces of lysanders company whenever you caught them in an unguarded moment thinking of their own families as with each hour they fell further and further astern nor could he explain what they were doing or the great odds against any sort of success anyway she would guess some of it she was a captains daughter an admirals granddaughter she would know he continued you will remember francis inch he has trebled in size and confidence since meeting with sir horatio nelson he was much impressed although i suspect he thought our net would be a giant instead of a slight man with one arm and a temper to match that of any colliers master i send my love to you and the children as does adam who still thinks of you as a kind of angel he does hot know you as well as i he smiled seeing her pleasure as she read that part and remembered when he had been at sea and adam had walked unknown and unhelped out of nowhere it had been to nancy that he had gone until that moment in time nobody in the family not even hugh had realised adam had existed born illegitimate he had lived to his fourteenth year with his mother at penzance and when she had died he had set out on foot for the family to which he really belonged yes she would recall those days as she read his letter he finished think of us sometimes your loving brother dick allday entered the cabin and looked at him curiously moffitts finished copying your orders for harebell sir he watched as bolitho sealed the letter and addressed it falmouth sir yes he leaned back in the chair and looked at the spiralling lantern overhead ive told my sister that you are as difficult as ever allday turned as ozzard came through the door well ozzard flinched will the commodore be requiring anything more to eat or drink please bolitho stood up and walked uncertainly to the bulkhead and touched the sword layout my best uniform coat and hat tomorrow ozzard allday turned towards him very slowly then you think yes bolitho looked past him i feel it it will be tomorrow or not at all ill need a tot to make me sleep on that news sir but he grinned several most like bolitho roamed about the cabin for a full hour after mid night thinking of faces and things he had shared with them then he turned into his cot leaving orders with the watch on deck that he was to be called at dawn surprisingly he felt calmer than he had since the return of his fever and within minutes of closing his eyes he was fast asleep he was awakened by a hand on his shoulder and saw herrick studying him in the light of a dimmed lantern beyond him the cabin skylight showed a pink glow what is it thomas then he heard it very faint drifting across the sea like echoes on a beach cheering harebell hoisted a signal at first light sir herrick watched him grimly enemy in sight the din of war bolitho strode across the quarterdeck with herrick beside him figures mostly in shadow cleared a path for him and he heard grubb say steady at eastbynorth sir veitch who had the watch came to meet him and touched his hat harebell has just signalled again sir ships in sight to the norwest he glared at the signal party mr glasson was somewhat slack with his men and i fear we missed some of harebells flags bolitho nodded ive little doubt that the ships which inch saw were patrols ahead of a larger force otherwise theyd have come closer he peered up at his pendant it was shining cleanly in the new daylight but the lower yards and shrouds were still in deeper shadow he said very well make to the squadron prepare for battle he smiled at veitch have our people had breakfast aye sir veitch looked at herrick and stammered someone told me of the commodores feelings about today sir so i had all hands called an hour earlier bolitho rubbed his chin i will shave now and have some coffee if theres any left he heard the squeak of halliards as the signal dashed up the yards and broke to the wind i hope nicator is awake and repeats the signal to javal he turned to look for harebells lithe shape but she was stemon her braced topsails very pale against the sky he said we must deploy our ships to best advantage thomas alter course directly and steer due north on the larboard tack across the heaving water he heard the staccato beat of drums and pictured nicator s seamen and marines hurrying to quarters herrick nodded aye sir itll be more prudent ill have the signal bent on once nicator has acknowledged she has sir glassons normally sharp voice was hushed veitch snapped then say it mr glasson or your rank will never rise above acting bolitho did not even hear the exchange he was thinking imagining the breadth of an enemy fleet the control from one or several flagships he said send away the quarter boat captain herrick have the despatch bag sent over to harebell he hesitated and any letters there may be for england shouts echoed along the deck and the boats crew dashed aft yeo the boatswain urging them with his powerful voice bolitho looked once more at his pendant brighter yet again but there was not much of a wind his new course and tack would aid their speed a little but it would still feel like an age before they got to grips with the enemy pascoe hurried towards him the heavy bag under his arm boats ready sir off you go adam dont delay and tell commander inch to make all speed to rejoin the fleet herrick asked will we take the windgage dyou think j am not certain he felt his stomach contract hunger fear it was hard to tell but if it is the force i imagine it will be large enough to see veitch came aft again boats away sir pulling like the devil thank you he pulled out his watch you may clear for action in fifteen minutes mr veitch in the meantime make to the squadron steer north when that is completed make one other to form line of battle he walked away as the calls started to shrill and men ran to their stations for altering course he could leave all that and more to herrick now he ducked his head automatically beneath the poop as grubb yelled stand by at th braces there the wheel was going over the sails flapping and banging and spattering the men beneath with great droplets of moisture in the cabin it seemed very cool and he sat almost unmoving while allday gave him a speedy shave and ozzard plied him with black coffee ozzard said dolefully that was the last of it sir he heard allday mutter never mind well take some off a frenchie eh more stamping feet overhead and the shriek of blocks and rigging veitchs voice hollow in his trumpet make fast there belay that brace bosun with the lantern giving only a feeble light the cabin became extra dark and he imagined the ship heading due north the others following in a line astern soon now there was sudden stillness broken within seconds by the rattle of drums sharp and nerveracking so that he knew lerouxs little drummer boys were just above the skylight the hull trembled each deck giving its own sound and reaction as screens were tom down chests and unwanted gear stowed below and every gun captain bustled around his crew like a mother hen allday stood back and wiped the razor eight minutes sir mr veitch is learning your ways bolitho stood up and waited for ozzard to bring his best coat he said captain farquhar did the honours last time their eyes met i think that is all he smiled but for the sword ozzard watched the pair of them and then darted forward to adjust the bow around bolithos black queue bolitho recalled his feelings about farquhar like an actor he heard more yells from the upper deck a clatter of oars as the boat returned alongside he looked at allday wondering if he was thinking the same all together herrick and pascoe allday and himself bolitho said its time they walked through the screen door where instead of a dining table and polished chairs there was only open deck the dark shapes of the waiting guns and their crews stretching away beneath the poop and towards the strengthening day light he strode past the mizzen masts great trunk and tried not to recall the broadside which had ripped through osiriss stem like a bloody avalanche some of the gun crews turned to watch him their eyes glittering white in the gloom behind the sealed ports one man called yewm a fair zight today zur he was finding courage in the darkness and ignored the harsh threats of a petty officer bet theres no better lookin sailor in the ole fleet bolitho smiled he knew the accent well a cornishman like himself perhaps even a face he had seen as a youth now brought close for this encounter he walked past the double wheel and the imperturbable helmsmen the master and his mates the midshipman of the watch little saxby and further to the centre of the quarter deck he saw pascoe his head and shoulders soaked in spray speaking in a fierce whisper to glasson who had taken charge of the ships signals pascoe touched his hat to bolitho and said i will go below sir bolitho nodded knowing that some of the seamen nearby were watching them curiously pascoes new station was down on the lower gun deck with the great thirtytwo pounders he had lieutenant steere as his superior and a midshipman to fetch and carry messages youth indeed for lysanders main batteries god be with you adam and you he hesitated uncle he shot a smile towards herrick and then hurried down the companion deck there sails in sight on the larboard bow bolitho snapped aloft with you mr veitch id like a firm opinion this morning he stared at the sky now pale blue and devoid of cloud the red blobs of the marine marksmen and swivel gunners in the tops the great yards and black tarred rigging a living vital weapon of war the most complex and harshly demanding creation of man yet in the weak sunlight lysander had a true beauty which even her bulk and tonnage could not spoil he crossed to the larboard side and clung to the neatly stacked hammock nettings harebell was already fighting round in a steep tack her topsails flapping her topgallants and maincourse being set even as he watched astern he could see the black lines of nicators weather shrouds and tumblehome but her outline and immortalites too were hidden beyond the sloping poop major leroux ran lightly down a ladder and raised his drawn sword to his hat with a flourish i have arranged my men as you ordered sir the best marksmen where they will be unhampered by those less accurate he smiled his eyes faraway maybe the french will expect to meet with nelson herrick heard him and laughed our gallant admiral must take his turn veitch returned to the deck by way of a backstay with as much ease as a twelveyearold midshipman he wiped his hands on his coat and said it is the enemy fleet sir they seem to be steering southeast and the bulk of it lies well to windward he hesitated and then said there is a second squadron directly across our bows on a converging jack sir i had a good look at it and i am certain that one or more of the ships were at corfu one of em was painted in red and black i saw her just now as plain as day bolitho looked at herrick and drove one fist into his palm de brueys is holding his main squadron to the west of us thomas he must still expect a chance to meet with our fleet herrick nodded and said bitterly if he only knew that they had already gone from here bolitho seized his arm mr veitch is not mistaken he looked at both of them willing them to understand de brueys has kept his other supply ships to the eastrd protected by his lines of battle then ill warrant our appearance is causing some cackling herrick climbed into the weather shrouds with a telescope i can just make out some sails on the horizon but you may well be right mr veitch our frenchmen are protecting their charges from the wrong direction he said in a duller voice but the french have plenty of time to rearrange their defences bolitho toyed with the idea of going up to the topgallant yard to see for himself there are but three of us thomas the french will have sighted harebell and may assume she is about to relay our signals to the main fleet leroux said quietly then id not be in commander inchs boots some of the gun crews had left their weapons and stood on the gangways to watch the enemys slow approach like plumed cavalry topping a hard blue rise the masts and sails began to show themselves even to the men on the gun deck more and still more until the horizon seemed engulfed by their sails a fleet indeed thomas bolitho tilted his hat to keep the light from his eyes he could feel the sun on his right cheek the clinging weight of his coat it would be hotter than this soon in more ways than one hour ran into hour and as the sunlight grew stronger and harsher the enemy ships took on style and personality the measured lines of french seventyfours and the whole dominated by one great firstrate the largest ship bolitho had ever seen that would be de brueyss flagship he wondered what the french admiral was thinking how the small line of british ships would look to him and his officers he wondered too if bonaparte was there with him watching and despising their brave gesture bonaparte was their one real hope de brueys was a very experienced and courageous officer and of all those present he probably understood his enemys navy best his intelligence and cunning were well known and respected but would bonaparte be willing to listen to advice now with egypt almost in sight and nothing but three ships in his way he said tell your marines to strike up a tune of some kind major this waiting burrs the edge off a mans strength i know it does off mine moments later the drums and fifes led off with the old east indiaman the youthful marines marching up and down the quarterdeck stumbling only occasionally over a gun tackle or a seamans outthrust leg after some hesitation and the knowing grins from his mates grubb delved into his pocket and joined the fifes with his tin whistle the one which had become something of a legend deck there enemy frigate steerin due south sir shes after harebell sir bolitho gripped his hands behind him as with a growing pyramid of sails a powerful frigate tacked away from the unending line of ships and headed towards the sloop inch had the edge on her with this slow southwesterly it would be hard for the french captain to overreach him now and unless he crippled harebell with a long shot from a bow chaser he should be safely clear a gun echoed dully across the glittering water and a thin white fin spurted in the sunlight it was well short and brought a ripple of cheers from the watchers in the tops the deck tilted heavily and one of the marching drummer boys almost pitched headlong grubb thrust his whistle into his coat and growled winds gettin up sir to his helmsmen he added watch it my beauties bolitho looked at herrick you may load and run out when you are ready he felt the ship lifting and then dipping into a low swell the spray darting through the beakhead like broken glass herrick cupped his hands mr veitch pass the word load and run out leroux said to his lieutenant bless my soul peter i do believe that the french are keeping their formations nepean peered at him vacantly but that will surely take us right amongst the second group sir those supply ships seem to be heavily protected also he swallowed hard and blinked the sweat from his eyes pan my word sir i think youre right the major looked up at the poop sarnt gritton spread your sharpshooters to either side at this rate i think we will be into the enemys centre before he knows it bolitho heard all of it the busy clatter of rammers and handspikes the shrill of whistles as the guns were run out one side gleaming like teeth the other still in a purple shadow bolitho thought of pascoe and his great charges three decks beneath his feet he wanted him here with him and yet knew that the lower deck was probably safer run out sir bolitho took a glass from midshipman saxby and it almost dropped to the deck the boy was shaking badly and trying not to show it bolitho ran up a poop ladder and trained the glass astern he said sharply signal to nicator mr glasson make more sail he returned to the quarterdeck and said we want no great gap between us the remark reminded him of saxby and he said quietly take this glass my lad and go aft with the marines keep levelled on nicator for me until i say otherwise herrick dabbed his face with a handkerchief worried about young saxby sir no thomas he lowered his voice about probyn nicator s acknowledged sir glasson sounded very alert now bolitho nodded and climbed on to a ninepounder one hand resting on a seamans bare shoulder heading on a diagonal tack towards lysanders larboard bow he saw the french menofwar reforming to protect their scattered convoy of supply ships he counted them carefully four ships of the line odds against his own strength but not too much so beyond the overlapping straggle of supply vessels he saw the squared sails of a frigate snapping at the heels of those vital ships like a cornish sheepdog when a fox was after the lambs he looked past veitch without seeing him an hour more at the most the french admiral would know by then that there were no more british ships close by what then revenge and destruction of the little squadron or on to alexandria in case there was one more trick to play bolitho saw the gleam of red amongst the enemys formation and knew it was the supply ship from corfu veitch would remember hed had plenty of opportunity to watch her and her scattering consorts while he had set fire to the hillside to protect osiris from the guns and she would be carrying more of those great guns without the last of them de brueys would never dare to anchor inside alexandrias narrow entrance he would need their protection for his ships and the landing of so many soldiers and stores denied them he would do it as herrick had described in aboukirbay and with any kind of luck nelson would find them there after that it would be up to him he looked along lysanders decks his heart heavy and what of us we did our best he heard several bangs and saw smoke drifting downwind from the leading french twodecker some of the balls whipped across the low waves like flying fish but were well clear of lysander it was a show of anger a sign that the french were ready and eager for battle after so long preparing behind their booms and harbour batteries herrick said bow chaser mr veitch try a ranging ball or two the crash of the larboard bow chaser brought some cheers from those who were unable to see the enemys show of strength below the quarterdeck other men were already wrapping their neckerchiefs around their ears and placing their cutlasses and boarding axes in close reach bolitho heard glasson say half a cable short but nobody answered him the leading french ship was firm placed towards lysanders larboard bow sailing as close to the wind as she could every sail fully visible on her tightly braced yards bolitho watched narrowly gauging time and distance whether they would collide or break the enemys line they had to get amongst the supply ships a ripple of bright orange tongues from the leading ship and this time the controlled broadside was better directed he felt the hull jerk and heard the searing whine of iron passing over the poop up and down between the eighteenpounders and their motionless crews kipling the second lieutenant walked unhurriedly his drawn sword over his shoulder like a stick easy my lads he was speaking almost softly as if calming a horse standto and face your front bolitho saw the frenchmans forecourse stretched and hardbellied on its yard and it looked for all the world as if it was spread on lysanders bowsprit and jib boom bolitho snapped let her falloff two points he nodded to herrick as grubbs men put up their helm as you bear fire from forward to aft lysanders larboard guns fired reloaded and fired again smoke and fire belching from her ports the trucks squealing as the crews trundled them back again for another broadside bolitho gritted his teeth feeling the deck shaking violently to the guns recoil his eyes smarted as he trained his glass beyond the bow seeing the frenchmans sails jerking and tearing under the barrage some of lysanders guns would not bear on the french leader but he hoped that the heavier balls from the thirtytwopounders might be finding targets over and beyond her stem herrick shouted the french captains altered course sir he cursed as the enemy ship fired the broadside haphazard and illtimed but nevertheless deadly great thuds shook the hull and two large holes appeared in the main topsail bolitho watched the enemys yards moving narrowing the exposed sails as she turned slightly away to give her gun crews a better chance to fire and to take advantage of the wind which by being so closehauled had been denied her bolitho said sharply alter course to larboard again steer north by west he had not wasted his first broadsides it had unnerved the enemy captain enough to make him edge round to return fire it would take him far too long to work his ship back so close to the wind men hauled wildly at the braces the yards creaking and allowing the sun to spill more light into smokehazed decks fire the larboard guns came crashing inboard one by one the crews sponging out and yelling like madmen as they reloaded bolitho saw the second french ship rising above the rolling smoke and knew he had caught the leader unprepared the second one was already probing towards the larboard bow and ahead of her hidden in lysanders own gunsmoke was the gap between the ships the hole in the line set the forecourse bolitho heard balls whimpering over head and saw tall waterspouts bracketing the ship on either side the deck bucked sharply and several lengths of broken cordage fell unheeded on the spread nets hold her mr grubb major leroux yelled ready marines he had his sword above his head by sections fire the sharper cracks of the muskets the hollow bang of the maintop swivel must have made the men at the lower battery on the starboard side realise for the first time just how near the frenchman was and as lysander holding the wind in her increased canvas surged across the leaders stem the crews cheered blinking in the sunlight then reeling aside as lieutenant steere blew his whistle and the whole line of thirtytwopounders roared out at the enemy painted scrollwork glass and strips of timber flew above the smoke and bolitho pictured the terror amongst the supply ships as lysander s fierceeyed figurehead thrust through the line towards them fire the second frenchman another seventyfour was changing course rapidly swinging to larboard and firing as she followed lysander round balls ripped into the hull and hissed above the sweating gun crews while from the french leader came a less powerful challenge from a stem chaser and a few charges of canister several marines haddropped but sergeant gritton was holding them together the ramrods rising and falling the balls rammed home and then the scarlet line back up to the nettings to shoot once more bolitho ran to the lee side and peered through the smoke the french leader had lost her main topmast and was drifting heavily with either her steering gone or so badly hampered by dragging spars and canvas she was temporarily out of control again mr veitch full broadside gun captains yelled to restrain the dincrazed crews even used their fists as one by one the starboard guns were trundled to the ports and each captain held a blackened hand towards his officer veitch yelled fire starting with the lower battery up along the eighteenpounders and finally to the quarterdeck ninepounders every black muzzle added its havoc to the bombardment bolitho watched the smoke rolling away trying to see the enemy his eyes streaming his mouth like sand the sky had gone even the sun and the world was confined to a thundering nightmare of flame and earsplitting noise he felt the hull shiver heard muffled screams from far below as enemy iron came through a port and sliced amongst the crowded gun deck he tried not to think of pascoe lying hurt or crippled the horror that a great ball could do in such a confined place he saw a flag making a small patch of colour in the smoke and realised there was no other mast near it some of the gun crews started to cheer their voices strangely muffled after the din of a full broadside he watched grimly as the other ship showed herself through the fog her stem and quarter smashed and almost unrecognisable only her foremast remained and some brave soul was risking death to climb aloft and fix a new tricolour to the foretop herrick shouted incredulously nicators not following he fell back as a man was hurled from a gun his scream dying in his throat herrick lowered him to the deck his hands spattered with blood as he scrambled up again he said savagely probyns not going to help bolitho glanced at him and ran to the larboard side seeking the rest of the enemy line and saw that the remaining two were holding on the same course while the one which had swung round after lysander was still trying to overhaul her forward guns firing towards the quarter bolitho shouted direct your fire on that one he winced as men fell kicking from a pair of guns splinters and charred hammocks burst across the boat tier and he saw a ships boy smashed to the deck and almost decapitated by a jagged length of planking fire lieutenant kipling was still walking up and down but his hat had gone and his left arm hung useless at his side stop your vents sponge out load he stooped to drag a wounded man from the path of a gun run out thuds along the gangway and decks made some duck away and bolitho saw bright darting flames from the enemys tops as the sharpshooters tested their aim fire there was a ragged cheer as the enemys fore topgallant mast toppled steadied and then plunged into her own gunsmoke some of her marksmen would have gone with it but she was still firing and bolitho could feel the balls slamming into the side and poop the crash and whine of metal the dreadful screams a midshipman ran across the deck his eyes fixed on bolitho sir immorimmor he gave up captain javals ship is breaking through sir mr yeas respects and he saw her thrusting across the third frenchie s bowsprit bolitho gripped his shoulder feeling him jump with alarm as a ball crashed through the quarterdeck rail and killed two men at a ninepounder they fell in a bloody heap at the midshipmans feet and it was then that bolitho realised it was breen his ginger hair almost black with smoke thank you mr breen he held his shoulder tightly until he could feel some of the terror ebbing away my compliments to the boatswain as the midshipman started to run for the ladder he said take your time mr breen he saw his words holding him steadying him our people are looking to their young gentlemen today he saw the boy grin herrick called i can see nicator sir shes still disengaged bolitho looked at him probyn was well clear he could apply his strength to the rearmost french seventyfours which were now exchanging shots with immortalite or he could set more sail and come after lysander he said general signal close action he turned as herrick hurried away and stared across the nettings he saw nicators topsails her hoisted acknowledgement very bright against the smoke bolitho coughed and retched as more smoke funnelled through the ports mr glasson tell your men to keep that signal flying no matter what herrick shouted glassons dead sir he stepped aside as some marines lifted the actinglieutenant clear of the guns his face was screwed into a petulant frown his mouth open as if about to reprimand the marines who carried him ill attend to it sir bolitho turned and saw saxby staring up at him he had forgotten all about him thank you he tried to smile but his face felt stiff and unmoving i want the signal and our colours to be seen if you have to tie them to the bowsprit he heard a chorus of groans and then major leroux shouted from the poop captain javals having a hard fight sir his mizzen is gone and he seems to be trying to grapple bolitho nodded the french would have recognised javals ship as one of their own they would try to recapture her first it was a natural instinct he said more sail thomas set the tgallants i want to get amongst the supply ships a seaman fell from an upper yard and lay with an arm thrust through the net the dead reaching for the living but others were responding to the orders and under more sails lysander forged ahead of the french twodecker herrick wiped his grimy face with his sleeve and grinned always was a fast sailer sir he waved his hat the desperation of battle in his eyes huzza lads hit em lads another line of long flashes burst from lysander s hull and with full traverse on the lower battery lieutenant steeres gun captains got several more hits on the enemy the other ship had lost all her topgallant masts and her forecastle was a shambles of broken spars and cordage several of her ports were black and empty like blind eyes where guns had been overturned their crews killed or wounded but she was still following her jib boom overlapping lysanders larboard quarter like a tusk and less than eighty yards clear lerouxs marksmen were firing without pause their faces grim with concentration as their tall sergeant picked out what he considered the most important targets but the french were also busy and the air above the poop was alive with musket balls splinters flew from planking and gangways or thudded viciously into the packed hammock nettings here and there a man fell from a gun or the shrouds and the roar of gunfire was becoming unbearable for across lysanders path lay several supply ships two locked together after colliding in their haste to get away kipling was up in the midst of his forward guns yelling to the carronade crews and encouraging everyone around him the most forward guns on both decks were already adding their weight to the din and the entangled supply ships were raked and ablaze with the swiftness of a torch in dry grass veitch yelled wildly through his trumpet mr kipling point your guns to starboard he gestured with the trumpet as a seaman touched kiplings arm to catch his attention through the dense smoke displaying her distinctive red wales was the heavy supply ship from corfu yards hardbraced and her foresail filling strongly as she tacked to avoid her burning con sorts as you bear fire bolitho walked as if in a trance calling out and encouraging not knowing if they recognized him let alone heard his words all around men were working their guns firing and dying others lay moaning and holding their wounds some merely sat staring at nothing their minds shattered perhaps forever all daylight seemed to have gone although in his reeling mind bolitho knew it was no later than eight or nine in the forenoon it was painful to breathe and what air there was seemed to be spewed from the guns as if heated by each blistered muzzle before it reached his lungs a blast of canister scythed over the nettings and he saw veitch spin round seizing his arm at the elbow and grimacing in agony as blood poured down his wrist and on to his leg a seaman tried to help him to the ladder but veitch snarled bind it man ill not quit the deck for it lysanders guns were firing from both sides at once seeking out the blurred shapes which loomed and faded in the dense smoke and with the din of their broadsides bolitho could hear the crash of the shots hitting the targets and cutting down masts sails and men in a devastating onslaught herrick shouted there she goes he pointed abeam the redstriped supply ship was listing steeply her hull punctured by several heavy balls the weight of her cargo did the rest the great siege guns began to tear adrift in her holds and although there was no sound to rise above the thunder of cannon fire bolitho imagined he could hear the sea surging into her while her crew fought to reach the upper deck before she dived to the bottom hopelessly outgunned the french frigate which had been trying to herd the supply ships away from the fighting came out of the smoke her guns blazing her deck tilting to the thrust of her canvas she swept across lysanders bows her iron slamming through the beakhead and foresail knocking a carronade off its slide and killing lieutenant kipling where he stood as she forged across the starboard bow lysanders forward gun crews crouched at their ports eyes reddened and smarting bodies shining and streaked in sweat and powder smoke watching the frigates progress and awaiting kiplings whistle the boatswain harry yeo cupped his hands and bellowed fire then he too fell bleeding and dying and like kipling did not see the proud frigate changed into a dismasted shambles by the great guns a violent explosion stirred the sails like a hot wind the smoke rising momentarily above the embattled ships and allowing sunlight to probe down like a misty lantern the first french ship was still drifting downwind and the water around her was littered with flotsam and dead men the second one was dropping astern of lysander with only one bow chaser which would bear but bolitho saw immortalite and knew it must have been a magazine which had exploded javal had managed to grapple one of the frenchmen and while the other had tried to cross his stem and rake him from end to end a fire had started a lamp blown from its hook a man running in panic and igniting some powder by accident nobody would ever know of the captured prize there was little to be seen her masts had gone and she was a mass of flame which grew and spread with every second it had blown to the ship alongside and with her sails blasted away her rigging and gang way well alight she too was doomed bolitho wiped his eyes feeling the pain for javal and his men then as the smoke swirled down again he heard grubb yell rudder sir he crossed the deck ignoring the occasional thud of a ball by his feet as he stared at the helmsmen who were swinging the big wheel from side to side grubb added thickly that buggers chaser as shot the rudder lines away he pointed at the fore topsail beyond the quarterdeck rail shes payin off bolitho shouted get some men aft rig new lines he saw plowman call for seamen from the nearest guns fast as you can herrick stared despairingly at the flapping sails we must shorten at once aye thomas he tried not to think of their following frenchman one lucky shot had hit lysander s steering gear and now as the wind turned her gently downwind she was swinging her stern towards her enemy it would be osiris allover again he tried not to curse aloud except that this time there was no lysander coming to the rescue on every side he saw or heard the chaos caused amongst the supply ships de brueys might have soldiers and horse artillery in plerity with his main fleet but he would never have a single siege gun like the one which had sent osiris to her death then as now nicator had kept away hed off by a man so embittered so twisted by his hatred that he would see his own people die and do nothing to help more crashes came from below and there was a chorus of yells as lysanders main topgallant mast came splintering down through the smoke taking men and sail with it into the water alongside with a mighty splash as more seamen ran with axes to hack it away bolitho saw saxby hurrying jo the shrouds another broad pendant wrapped around his waist like a sash as he hauled at the halliards he shouted thought i might need an extra one y see sir he was laughing and weeping his fear gone in the horror which surrounded him later if he survived it would be harder to bear bolitho looked past him towards the frenchmans topsails and beakhead as they towered above the larboard quarter guns hammered back and forth between them and he felt the deck lurching heard some of his men still able to cheer as they saw their own shots slamming home but it was no use lysander was still swinging helplessly her tattered sails streaming through the smoke her guns barely able to keep firing for want of men to supply their need the smoke writhed and blossomed scarlet and bolitho reached out for support as the first of the enemys iron smashed through the poop marines and seamen fell dead and dying in its path lieutenant nepean dropped his sword and fell choking on blood and when leroux yelled for his sergeant he too was unable to reply but sat holding his stomach his eyes glazing as he tried to respond to his major as he had always done allday drew his cutlass and thrust his body behind bolitho like a shield through his teeth he said one more broadside an i reckon theyll try to board us he pushed a dying marine away and pointed his cutlass through the smoke just one man id rather kill than any frog today herrick walked past hands behind him his face very composed he said mr plowman says it will take all of ten minutes more sir it might as well be an hour bolitho thought herrick looked at allday and who is that capn bloody probyn thats who the french ship was barely feet away from the quarter although with so much smoke it could have been any distance what guns would bear were pouring shots into lysanders poop and lower hull and from the bowsprit and spritsail yard marksmen were shooting at lysanders quarterdeck as fast as they could aim bolitho shouted to herrick how are the supply ships herrick bared his teeth six done for and maybe the same number crippled bolitho turned to see a body dragged clear of the poop moffitt his clerk his thin grey hair marked with a bright touch of scarlet where a splinter had cut him down like gilchrists father he had known the misery of a debtors prison and now lay dead he had to force the words out i am ordering you to haul down our colours thomas herrick stared at him his mouth tight with strain strike sir bolitho walked past him feeling allday close at his back protecting him as always aye strike he looked at the upended guns the blood some of which had splashed as high as the tattered forecourse we did what we intended ill not see another man die to save my honour but sir herrick hesitated as veitch lurched over to join him his arm wet with blood his face like wax veitch gasped well fight em sir weve still got some good lads bolitho looked at them wearily i know youd fight he turned towards the enemy but then our men would die for nothing he looked for saxby and saw him crouching by the bulwark haul down the colours he shouted that is an order the guns fell silent and above the crackle of a blazing supply ship and the mingled cries of the wounded they heard the beginning of a french cheer theyre getting ready to board bolitho sheathed his sword and looked at those around him at least their lives would be spared the smoke lifted again to a tremendous roar of cannon fire and bolitho imagined for an instant that the french were making certain of a victory with one last murderous broadside at pointblank range he saw some of lysander s shrouds tearing away like weeds as balls shrieked above the deck and then turned as herrick shouted wildly its nicator shes firing into the frenchman from tother beam because of the smoke and the drifting supply ships some of which were adding their own pyres to the surrounding fog nobody had seen nicator s slow and careful approach every gun was firing on the frenchman which pivoting between the savage broadsides and lysanders starboard quarter could do nothing to escape bolitho said tell our people to stay off the gangways he heard some of nicators shots lashing through the rigging above him herrick pointed at saxby who was capering around the halliards which held bolithos broad pendant neither it nor the ensign had been hauled down it was soon over and as the cheering seamen and marines surged on to the french ships deck the tricolour vanished into the smoke one of nicators lieutenants arrived aboard some fifteen minutes later as grappled the three vessels drifted downwind the victors and vanquished working together to help the wounded the lieutenant looked around lysanders decks and removed his hat ii am deeply sorry sir we were late again he watched the wounded marines being carried down from the poop i have never seen a fight like yours sir herrick said harshly and captain probyn dead sir the lieutenant lifted his chin brought down by a marksman he died instantly a man cried out in terror as he was carried to the orlop and bolitho remembered luce and farquhar and javal and so many others he asked was that before or after you came to our aid the lieutenant looked wretched before sir but im certain that bolitho looked at herrick nicator had been too far off to be reached by any musket at an enquiry it would be hard to explain impossible to prove but someone driven by shame and anguish had shot probyn down as he had stood watching lysander and immortalite fighting unsupported he smiled gravely at the palefaced lieutenant well you came the young officer turned as pascoe appeared on the quarterdeck we had to sir as bolitho crossed the deck and clasped his nephew tightly the unknown lieutenant looked up at a clearing patch of blue sky and at bolithos signal which was still flying he said quietly we saw the signal close action that was enough bolitho looked at him to herrick he said cast off the french ship as soon as mr grubbs hands have repaired our steering she fought well and ive no use for another prize with de brueys and his fleet so near herrick walked to the rail and repeated his order to lieutenant steere who had emerged from the lower gun deck grubb shambled beneath the poop his ruined face smudged in smoke and grime shell answer the elm now sir ready to get under way herrick said quietly he wont hear you mr grubb he looked sadly towards bolitho hes looking at the signal and thinking of those who can tsee it and never will now i know him so well as the sailing master moved away to his helmsmen herrick said to pascoe go to him adam i can manage without you for a while he watched pascoes face and was moved to add try and tell him they didnt do it for any signal it was for him epilogue captain thomas herrick entered the cabin and waited for bolitho to look up from his table the masthead has just sighted the rock to the norwest sir with luck we should be anchored under gibraltar s battery before sunset thank you thomas i did hear the hail he sounded distant you had better prepare a gun salute for the admiral herrick watched him sadly and then youll be leaving lysander sir bolitho stood up and walked slowly to the windows there was nicator about half a mile astern her topsails and jib very pale in the sunlight beyond her he could see the untidy formation of captured supply ships and a french frigate which they had taken in tow until some of her damage could be put right leaving lysander that was the very crux of it all the weeks and months the disappointments and moments of elation or pride the heartbreaking work the horrors of battle now it was behind him until the next time he heard the bang of hammers and the crisp sound of an adze and pictured the work continuing about the ship as it hadfrom the moment that grubb had reported the helm answering once more and they had cast off the french twodecker it still seemed like some sort of miracle that the main french fleet had continued southeast towards egypt perhaps de brueys had still believed that bolithos little force had attacked his welldefended supply convoy as a further delaying tactic and that some other fleet was already gathering across his path to alexandria battered and holed her hull filled with water with each painful mile lysander had sailed with the wind doing makeshift repairs burying her dead and tending the wounded of whom there were many then with nicator in company they had sailed westward again dreading another series of squalls almost as much as an enemy attack but the french had other things on their minds and days later when lysander s lookouts had sighted a small pyramid of sails bolitho and the companies of both ships had watched with a mixture of awe and emotion as harebell had run down towards them in her wake black and buff in the bright sunshine had followed not a squadron but a fleet it had been a coincidence and yet it was hard to accept that miracles had played no part lieutenant gilchrist in the badly damaged frigate buzzard had not sailed directly to gibraltar as ordered instead and for no reason which had yet come to light he had broken his passage at syracuse and there resting and disillusioned after its fruitless sweep to alexandria was the fleet with nelsons flagship vanguard in its centre nelson had apparently needed no more than a hazy report to set him going once again to alexandria where he had discovered the remaining french transports sheltering in the harbour but to the northeast anchored with rigid and formidable precision much as herrick had predicted lay the french fleet with half of her company dead or wounded lysander had remained on the fringe of the fight the battle of the nile as everyone was calling it it began in the evening and raged all night and when dawn came up there were so many wrecks so many corpses that bolitho could only marvel at mans ferocity undeterred by the french line and the fact that many of the ships were held together with cables to prevent a breakthrough nelson sailed around the end of the french defences and attacked them from the shore side for there was no heavy siege guns on the land to prevent him and he was able to concentrate his skill and his energy against an equally determined enemy although the french fleet was the larger by dawn all but two of de brueyss ships had struck or been destroyed the remaining two had slipped away in the night after witnessing the most horrific sight of the whole battle l orient de brueyss great flagship of one hundred and twenty guns had exploded damaging several vessels nearby and having such an effect on both sides that momentarily the firing ceased de brueys went with her but the memory of his courage and endurance were as proudly remembered in the british ships as anywhere with both legs shot off the stumps bound with tourniquets de brueys had ordered that he be propped upright in a chair facing his old enemy and commanding his defences until the end bonapartes dream was ended he had lost his entire fleet and over five thousand men six times as many as the british and his army stood at the mouth of the nile undefended and marooned it had been a great victory and as he had watched the closing stages of the battle the angry red flashes across the sea and sky bolitho had felt justly proud of lysanders part in it later when he had sent his own report to the flagship bolitho had waited to discover the rearadmirals reactions with his usual vigour nelson was preparing to put his fleet to sea again but sent an officer by boat to lysander with a short but warm reply you are a man after my own heart bolitho the risk justifies the deed he had instructed bolitho to escort the handful of prizes to gibraltar and there take passage to england and report once more to the admiralty at no time did nelson mention captain probyns death which was just as well as herrick had pointed out he turned and looked at herrick it is a strange thing thomas but francis inch is still the only one among us to have met our nel herrick nodded but his influence is here nonetheless sir that letter from him and the fact that a broad pendant still flies above this ship is far better than any handshake bolitho said after all weve been through i shall miss lysander thomas aye his round face saddened once at anchor i will get the more serious work done although i fear she may never again stand in the line of battle when you arrive in england thomas he smiled but then i donthave to remind you do i i will always need a loyal friend never fear herrick turned to watch a yawl surging past the quarter windows its crew waving and cheering the battered seventyfour their voices lost beyond the thick glass if i can come ill come bolitho saw ozzard locking his two large sea chests in readiness to be taken to a boat he said ive made a lot of bad mistakes thomas too many but you found the answers sir thats all that matters is it he smiled i wonder ive certainly learned that its no easier to decide who lives or dies just because you fly your flag above the end result he glanced at the polished wine cabinet as two seamen started to wrap it around with sailcloth would he see her in london would there be anything more between them some hours later after the drawnout crash of the salutes the anchoring and the necessary business of signing documents bolitho went on deck for the last time in the sunset gibraltar looked like a vast slab of coral and the ships yards and furled sails had a similar tint he walked slowly along the line of assembled faces trying to stay impassive as he shook a hand here spoke a name there major leroux his arm in a sling old ben grubb as fierce as ever as he mumbled good luck to ye sir mewse the purser lieutenant steere the midshipmen no longer so nervous but tanned and somehow aged in the months at sea he paused by the entry port and glanced down allday was already in the barge very upright in his blue coat and nankeen breeches as he watched over the oarsmen they too looked different in neat checked shirts and tarred hats they were making a special effort for him also in the boat was ozzard a small bundle of belongings in his thin arms his eyes upturned to the ship when bolitho had asked him if he would like to be his permanent servant he had been unable to answer he had merely nodded unable to accept that his life of hiding in one ship after another was over he turned and looked at pascoe goodbye adam i hope to see you again soon he gave the youth a quick handshake and to herrick added take care of each other eh then he raised his hat to the side party and climbed down into the barge as it pulled strongly beneath lysanders great shadow he turned to look at her again allday watched him saw his expression as he listened to the cheering which burst from lysanders deck and shrouds bolitho said there were a lot of faces missing back there allday replied never you fret on it sir we showed em and thats no error as the barge wended its way around another anchored man of war herrick who had watched it until it was hidden from view walked slowly aft to the poop deck his shoes catching on the many splitter holes yet to be repaired he turned as pascoe came after him the stained and tom broad pendant draped over his shoulder pascoe smiled but the sadness remained in his dark eyes i thought you would want it sir herrick looked around his ship remembering ive got all this adam he took the pendant ill send it to captain farquhars mother she has nothing left now pascoe left him by the broken nettings and crossed to the other side but there was no sign of the barge and the rock was already in deep shadow
