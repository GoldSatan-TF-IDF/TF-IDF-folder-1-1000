maecenas it is well to turn the soil and wed vines to elms what tending the kine need what care the herd in breeding what skill the thrifty beeshence shall i beginmy song virgil georgics book chapter ooh sir wawtch out fr the wherever i go lately alan lewrie mused rather resignedly i seem to be arsedeep in shit oh well he waved off the towheaded young daisykicker at the olde ploughman public houses hitching rail who stood with silent offer to towel the offending matter from his glossy top boots no use lad lewrie said as he swung up into the saddle theres plenty more where im going oh aye sir so they bel the lad chirped letting go the reins he held lewrie dug hapence from his washleather purse and flipped it to the daisykicker who whooped with glee as if the coin were the first hed ever earned as if lewrie did not reward his chore each time he departed from the olde ploughman ta yer honour sir the boy called as lewrie turned his horse west on the high street night squire lewrie lewrie touched the wide brim of his hat with a riding crop in reply as he clucked his tongue and kneed his mount to a brisk walk squire alan sighed with a snort not exactly true was it squires were freeholders who rented land to others while he was only a tenant a rent payer himself now if i sublet he thought perhaps to a welloff hermit and was there such a creature as an eremite with the blunt he wondered who wished half an acre down by the creek where he could pile himself up a grotto and become lewries tenant performing perhaps the odd jeremiadthrice on market daystalking in tongues or dancing like a dervish or old st vitus would i then be a squire at last or even less welcome in the parish might be worth doing at thatitd drive carolines uncle phineas batty his horse paced through the village of anglesgreen heading west for the vale between the rolling hills hooves clopping on the icy earthen road as candles and lanterns were lit in the windows of the homes alongside and lights were extinguished as shopkeepers at last shut after long hours of sparse winter trade very few villagers were out now that the brief stint of cloudoccluded sun had all but gone and the winds blew foul and cold without the casual labourers of the sowing or harvesting seasons anglesgreen was an even more tedious and empty a place than ever he had experienced now christmas and epiphany were come and gone and cold as cold as parish poors rate charity and about as unattractive arsedeep in it he told himself again glum with rum and ennui up to my nose in acres of it and that so bloody boresome there were to alans lightsmuch like the descending levels of hell in dantes infernodistinct gradations to the shit existing in the world and the quality and quantity of it a body had to abide uncle phineas his lessor for instance his sternal sneering stultifying monologues his miserly few suppers or dos which formed the bulk of a bleak lewrie social lifenow there was shit from the lowest netherpit itself and totally unabidable in quality and amount in contrast the literal item such as the horse droppings led just stepped insome of those he didnt mind half so mich horses were noble beasts beautiful in form and notion their stalings were abidable for they bore convivial folk together astride or by coach eased a travellers burden jleased with their speed heart and endurance livened hunts airs social occasions or elated one with the order of their inish at a race no truth be told alan lewrie like all good english gentlemen rather enjoyed horse poop it had a redolence of lospitality of congeniality of freedom excitement and far lorizons the byproducts of the lesser beasts necessary to a farm hough even his inept clueless style of gentleman farming of vhich folks said he did little but raise his hatnow they weredious in the extreme he knew little after four years and was forced to depend upon the knowledge of governour chiswick his brotherinlaw or of the vile old phineas chiswick they both dropped their jaws and whinnied at his questions making him feel as out of place even after four years of applying himself as he had aboard ariadne back in on his first day as a callow midshipman or even more discouraging to have to talk things over with dearest caroline in private being coached on what orders to give that particular day to the few permanent farmhands or the hired day workers to be such a humble knownothing in his wifes eyes truth be told again alan lewrie thought the life of the rural gentleman farmer stank in more ways than one no matter it was the fondest wish of every successful man to make his pile get acres and aspire to the squirearchy it was shit of the most unabidable sort and fast as he strove to shovel it away here came more his sheep for instance he squirmed on the cold saddle as he contemplated them the farm the rented farm he reminded himself was awash in the smelly thingsmost of surrey was these daysunutterably stupid messy foolish and shitbedaubed even a goat could manage to keep a reasonably clean nether end though they did stink like badgers swinetheres chapter and verse for you too he thought and chickens lord what a foetid reek the henyard bore it was a wonder a selfrespecting fox would have to go at em thout holding his nose and cattle i ask you he grunted his neck burning with revulsion fat shambling lankyhipped floppy beasts capable of veritable broadsides of loose flat disordered ordure shot off by the barrico whenever and wherever they wished stinky his city of london might be brassy and corrupt a warship might become but it was never a tenth as bad as a working farm sweet as hay and clover were in the spring the gardens romantic aromas soon as one inhaled a restoring lungful of bucolic bliss here came some reek from things best hung in the curing house as meat revolting one or plopped all over ones best pair of top boots it was tempting to think that now his granny lewrie had passed to her great reward and had left him quite welloff in her will he and caroline could move to london and use the farm as a spring and summer retreat hire an estate agent to look aiter it for them it did in spite of his ignorance turn a pretty penny or two enough to qualify him as a voter then he could nod and smile on his rare visits chortle over the books when they showed profit and call out carry on to some experienced and knowledgeable underling leaving him leisure time for horses for amusements for a real life lewrie hitched his heavy wool cloak closer about his neck as he rode near the red swan inn late as it was as close to suppertime for the revelers inside whom he could espy through the cheery diamondpaned windows there was quite a merry crowd gathered there a fair number of horses were hitched outside blanketed against the cold under the now bare but towering oaks the richer patrons had theirs temporarily stabled in the warmer barn behind he thought he spotted governours tall gray gelding and beside it two hunters he knew as belonging to sir romney embleton bt and his wheyfaced son harry now theres shit for you lewrie thought with a rueful grin for a mad fleeting moment he thought of going in the red swan for a stirrup cup of hot gin punch or a mug of mulled wine to warm his journey home just on a lark to see the looks on their phizes for daring to show his own in the more refined highgentry squireish red swan for just a moment he envied his brotherinlaw governour too he was married to sir romneys daughter millicent long before lewrie had come to anglesgreen and wed caroline upsetting all the plans of seven years before governour and millicent could socialize when and where they might bad as blood was between lewries and embletons and because of them between chiswicks and embletons governour had welcome still at embleton hall and at all the parish and countys doings though it was sometimes a trifle thin his and carolines however was nonexistent and looked fair to being nonexistent far past the advent of the coming new century truth even further be told since theyd returned from the bahamas in when his last ship alacrity had paid off in portsmouth theyd been treated bad as leprous gypsies by those locals who walked in dread of embleton disapproval or fawned on embleton largesse considering embleton influence over the area it was a wonder the lewries even had benefit of clergy at mossy old st georges and with rural social life revolving round the local fox huntand that hunts master of hounds none other than sir romneythey might as well have been turbaned turk horse thieves for all their welcome well not by all alan qualified as he drew his horse to a halt at the turnin gate the hot rum punches hed downed through an afternoon of war talk and genteel arguing at the olde ploughman were working on him something hellish and the idea of riding in to front the bastards direct was rakehell dammeboy appealing no not all treat us shabby he snorted there were a few of the minor gentry the younger folk and most of the common sort who thought the lewrie saga romantic beyond words and sympathized with them in their banishment lovely and sweet caroline chiswick the poor loyalist emigree home after the revolution being buttockbrokered by her uncle phineas to wed rich so he could get even more acres by her her parents almost helpless in their penury to help her four suitors two very old widowers and a sheepertenantall vile beyond beliefand the hon harry embleton an mp and heir to untold wealth and power and nextdoor acres the most favoured then along came lieutenant alan lewrie rn and swept her away not only rescued her but came within a hair of dueling harry for her well it never came to that alan gloated warmed against the cold as he savoured that longago triumph harry learned wed posted banns and went lunatick at a fox hunt took a whip to my treed cat took his whip to mebout as public as it gets and i flattened his nose and made his bung sport claret make matters worse he goes and whines to caroline bout her choice goes off again calls her every vile thing he had in his little mind and damned if she dont whip him cross the field with her reins too bang on his busted nose in front of damn near everyone in surrey that matters lord ah well he shrugged that was a bloody good day just didnt think id end up paying for it the rest of my natural life going on now a full seven years and time hadnt mellowed any of the participants he had to give the embletons credit they could hold a snit as good as he could and there was no sense in stirring the pot up further or in being seen as he was at that moment sitting slumped and indecisive like a beggar too fearful to knock for pittance at the back entrance of a rich mans manor devil with em he sneered as he turned the reins and clucked his tongue once more urging the horse with his heels to an easy canter the gelding knew the way as well as he on past the red swan and a new bank of row houses onto the chiddingfold road west along the stream thence over the wooden bridge to chiswick lands his rented corner of them and home where theres a better sort of welcome waiting he grinned chapter ave at owf in a tick sir his groom told him as he alit in his stable yard bodkins took the reins and tied the horse then knelt with a rag so lewrie could prop his boot on a wooden bucket ere ye be sir goodz noo thankee bodkins lewrie replied free at last of rank goo be sure he gets a good warm rubdown tis a fearsome cold night at i will sir never ye fear the groom said ere thomas me lad untack e masters horse it was a fine new stone stable attached to the older thatchedroof house that now served as the carriage house for two coaches one light and open for good weather and an older boxy enclosed coach lewrie petted and fussed over the gelding before the stableboy led him away for his wellieserved oats and rubdown lewrie crossed the stable yard sure that his workers had shoveled before dark sure he wouldncounter no more messy surprises lying in wait on past the lulking older wattle and daub original barn where the prodicts of the farm were stored to tide him his kith and kin and lis beasts through the rest of the winter uncle phineas had leased them and that quite grudgingly acres a corner of his vast holdings at the foot of his lane like a gatehouse to the manor proper but it was close to the village and the chiddingfold road and quite handy a sheeper had been renting when they left in but it was vacant upon their return acreage enough to run a middling flock of sheep a few beef cattle and dairy animals swine goats turkeys and chickens with orchards and grape arbors enough for the homefarm to feed quite well there was enough cleared land for a decently profitable crop of wheat and hay in addition to the sheep with wood lots kitchen gardens access to three creeks and several sweet wells hops and barley gave them homebrew beer and they were awash in preserved fruits the new house though the old thatchedroof cottage had been a twostory smoky buginfested horror and since wages and construction materials had been quite low they had run up a presentable new stone and gray brick georgian house for about a quarter of what a london manse its size might have cost it gave alan pleasure to know that it was as fine as anything governour in his new wealth had built or as uncle phineas gloomy old redbrick pile the perverse old bastard would not part with land permanently but had been bludgeoned into a longterm lease which would expire long after he did so alan had no fear of losing his ј investment and it made phineas grind what few teeth he had left in his head so it was more than worth every penny they had a slate roof as tight as a wellcaulked and coppered ship of the line and enough fireplaces to keep it snug and cozy on all but the iciest nightswindows enough too to keep it breezy and well lit in the warmer seasons fashion had demanded and with granny lewries last bequest the lewries could afford a palladian facade for the center hall in imitation of inigo jones he stopped to admire it in the lantern light taking cheer at the sight of amberglowing windows and fuming chimneys confronting the frigid night even coming from the rear between the now bleak kitchen gardens and the ornamental flower gardens and shrubberies on the west side near him it was imposing big as a brig the central hall jutted towards him which held the kitchens the still rooms butlers pantry storerooms and laundry facilities just off the kitchens they had a private bathing room with a marble tub big enough for two nearest him too was an intimate dining room where they most often took breakfast or dined en famille overlooking the cheery ornamental garden that was carolines pride nearer still was the library and music room and his private study in the front of the house adjacent to a receiving parlour just off the foyer and its cloakroom the hall was tiled and paneled with a broad staircase which led up to a landing and another pairofstairs and beyond in the east wing was a dining hall and main parlour almost big enough to host a middlingsized guest list for a dance unfortunately that was little used so farone needed guests whod accept ones invitations so furnishings beyond bare bones were far from complete over his head in the west wing was the nursery the childrens small bedrooms and the governess quarters over the entry hall was their own spacious bedchamber and intimate study actually carolines sewing room so far there were three more bedchambers for guests in the east wingonce again vacant and unused hopefully once the last lewrie was out of nappies they planned to convert the nursery into a classroom for a private tutor with lodgings in the east wing im home he called out hopefully as he entered through the garden doors to his cozy study he sailed his widebrimmed farmers hat at a wall peg and shrugged off his cloak draping it over a wing chair near the cheery fireplace warmth was what he wished that instant the fires of hell if he could get em he raised the tails of his coat and backed so close to the hearth that his heels were almost between the firedogs didn ear ya come in sir will cony said entering from the central hall spected ya through th front i did ill take yer things ang em up f r ya sir aye eres at of cat pitt sir the grizzled old battler shambled into the room stalking slow and regal william pitt the ramcat was getting on in years spending most his days lazing in windows or patches of sunlight but he still ruled the farm with fang and claw and even the dogs slunk tailtucked in terror when he was out and rambling pitts haughty entrance was disturbed though by the arrival of his middle son hugh who darted between conys knees leaped the cat and dashed for him whooping like a red indian sewallis his firstborn entered behind him william pitt outraged and his dignity destroyed turned raked the air in sewallis general direction hissed and moaned before hopping up on his favorite wing chair to wash furiously and alan noted that sewallis shied away from the cat giving him a wide berth that was all he had time for before hugh tackled his leg howling a greeting alan laughed and reached down to pick him up to lift him over his head and give him a light toss making hugh shriek with joy theres my bold lad alan rejoiced theres my devlish man what mischief you been into today hey pwaying daddy hugh wriggled as he shouted his reply good christ youre in that much trouble again i surely hope not oh playing you mean ha ha and heres sewallis come here my boy how was your day been keeping your brother out of scrapes yes father sewallis replied with his usual reserve he cast a wary look over his shoulder in pitts direction to determine how safe movement might be then dashed with unwonted haste as lewrie held out his arms the boy came to him dutifully for a more sedate welcomehome hug and a kiss on the forehead good to be home alan told them both cold as the devil out tonight wa yoo bwing me daddy hugh coaxed in an almost unintelligible voice he was only three and still having trouble pronouncing his rs so much so that even a doting daddy who should have been familiar enough with baby talk had difficulty understanding him the boys eyes gleamed sly with expectation clinging to lewries knees his tiny fingers beginning to probe all the pockets he could reach thievery lewrie thought runs in the family dont it boy has a promising set of careers open to him long as he doesnt get caught few years practice though why i brought myself boy alan chaffered kneeling to eye level with them you dont get a pretty or a sweet every time i ride to town do you yess ah dool hugh hollered a bodyd think i had to bribe you lads for affection no puddy hugh gaped beginning to screw his face up for a heartfelt bawl of disappointment this was betrayal at its blackest dont be a baby hugh course he did sewallis chid him with a very adultsounding touch of vexation alan glanced at his eldest both the boys were breeched in adult clothing stockings shoes breeches and waistcoats shirts and stocks their baby hair grown long enough to be plaited or drawn into a mans queue but sewallis suddenly sounded so very mature for his tender five years always had lewrie realized even young as hugh the boy had always been aloof quiet and reserved call it what you really think damnittimidwith none of the neckornothing exuberance the silliness or the folly of a normal boy scared of the cat and for gods sake he hardly ever goes near the damned pony i got em a lewrie afraid of a horse an englishman shy of a horse of course i brought you something alan announced just as sewallis said little man can you keep a secret hugh agreed with a firm nod as alan peered into corners like a housebreaker unloading his illgotten gains in a slum alley an eye out for the previous owners rare treats he promised hugh was giggling now dancing in impatience and wonder sewallis well he was a little wideeyed but ever the little stoic i made an arrangement with a pirate and a smuggler lads fiercest meanest set of blackguards you ever did wish to see off they went far as the east indies down to malabar oh tis a mysterious fearsome placeelephants and snakes thick as my legs heathen princes and headhunters the pirate he took em and the smuggler he got em out one step ahead o the headhunters then six months at sea on a tall john company ship they came all the way from pagan hindoo india round the cape of good hope over to the argentine and the plate for a slant o wind mister lewrieoh excuse me mistress mcgowan the cheerless governess had entered the room she didnt approve of parents and children mixing except at teatime perhaps after supper for an awkward moment or two of stilted conversation certainly not of parents who really wished to spend time with their children firewood and water then off to st helena the crossroads of the atlantic mdears thence cross the westerlies daring all the french privateers to ushant up our good english channel into the pool o london up the thames from mysterious malabar a delight fit for the mighty moghuls themselves he reached into his tailcoat pocket as the boys fidgeted and here they becinnamon sticks he cried as he produced them to howls of rapture and leaping clutching little hands oh sir mistress mcgowan simpered youll spoil their supper la i do allow you cosset these lads something sinful come along sewallis hugh theres good boys wash up and dress sweets later if youre good waste no more of your fathers time mister lewrie sir mistress says to tell you that table is set and you may sup as soon as youve washed the road away come lads now no now hugh demanded petulantly but it was not to be he saw his treat tucked into mistress mcgowans apron pocket lewrie stood with none of the magic of the moment left but the stickiness of the cinnamon sticks on his fingers and feeling as ordered about as the boys did as they were chivvied off well damme he groused returning to the fireplace for a warmup aint this my own house aint they my own lads to cosset as i wish cosset em aye damned right i will and how dare that that hired bitch gainsay me hey cony only shrugged in reply got watern towels laid out sir bit of a wash afore supper i suppose so cony lewrie huffed damn my eyes but theres a hellish lot of domesticity about these days aye ill come up ill be a good boy aint we all learned to be such good ladsl ahum cony coughed into his fist to hide a rueful grin of sympathy aye sir alan paused in the central hallway though peering at the two portraits hung there side by side his and carolines his had been done in just after the revolution whenhedbeen a twentyoneyearold lieutenant carolines had been painted by a talented but annoying artist in the bahamas just after theyd arrived in when she was twentythree and a newlywed early morning tropical light with her lush flower garden and the impossibly emerald and aquamarine waters of east bay which had fronted their small home as a backdrop she in a widebrimmed straw hat and offshoulder morning gown her clear complexion and her hazel eyes bright and dewy as west indies dawn and her long light brown almost taffyblonde hair flowing carefree and loose teased by the everpressing flirtatious trades had caroline changed not in features so much as she was still lissome and slim no matter birthing three children she still rode almost every day walked the acres kept active as so many sparrows oh there were laugh lines now around her eyes and mouth more than before her graceful hands and fingers sparer of flesh where though had that caroline gone he wondered and for himself well like it or not not a fortnight before on epiphany he had gone over the edge he was thirty middleaged and caroline soon to follow by spring as if i dont have enough complaints god help us he thought he felt vaguely queasy and unsettled at the fetching of such a prominent seamark like espying the peaks of dominica which signified arrival onpassage to the caribbean yet knowing that whatever west indies port of call one was bound for no matter how joyous the passage was no more than a weeks sailing downwind and no beating against the inevitability of those insistent noreast trades had ever availed lieutenant alan lewrie rn peered out at him from the picture with a hopeful grin the hint of devilment in his eyes that were grey or blue by mood shiny midbrown hair sunbleached to light brown and curling slightly at the temples and forehead yet drawn back into a proper seamans plaited pigtail lay over the ears and tumbled over the uniform coats collar it was a youthful courtiers lean face he saw though tanned by blistering sun and sea glare beyond a courtiers fashionable paleness and the slight hint of the vertical scar upon one cheekthe result of a duel for another girls honour a girl now long gone in point of factthe artist had wished to suppress that but alan had been quite proud of his disfigurement at the time and insisted it be rendered exactly just as they had disputed the teethbaring grin too english gentlemen were supposed to be sober and dignified in life and limned so in portraits for posterity yes hed wash up he decided taking the first of the stairs and see if he at the advanced age of thirty even slightly resembled the young sprog he used to be thirty jesus he thought and he used to spurn women who had gotten a little long in tooth if only hed known then in his feckless days what he knew at present there he thought almost satisfied his reflection didnt vary much from the portrait downstairs after he had washed and toweled much he amended hed been eating well and even with rugged outdoorsy country pursuits he was not exactly the leancheeked courtier of his youth nor so pale as a titled lord but it was near enough cony finished brushing his coat and waistcoat and he redonned them hed slipped out of his top boots and exchanged them for a pair of indoor shoes little more than softleather pumps more like womens dancing slippers than anything else insubstantial though they felt they were all the go lately standing well back from carolines dressing mirror he perused his form as well he had been eating well after all though there was no snugness to the sewntobesnug buffcoloured suede breeches beyond what fashion demanded his bottlegreen coat and waistcoat sat well upon him he thoughtthough they were new run up before christmas so what comparison would they be well theres my uniforms he sighed almost relieved theyd changed the regulations for sea officers dress in whilst he was overseas and though hed gone on the halfpay list as soon as alacrity had paid off hed faced the expense of meeting the new dress regulations so he could call upon the councillor of the cheque each three months about the time of the quarterly assizes to prove that he was alive that he still possessed all his requisite parts that he was eligible for future sea duty and to collect what was laughably termed halfpay hed just come back from the admiralty in london just before his birthday and his uniform had fit him admirably well damme though he frowned lifting his coattails to study the heft and span of his buttocks hmmm supper is served sir mistress cony announced at last as the rum punches at the olde ploughman threatened to consume his stomach lining my dear alan beamed rising to greet caroline as she swept into the smaller second parlour where hed been kicking his heels sorry dearest but i simply had to stop by the nursery to look in on little charlotte caroline smiled in reply coming to his arms for a welcome hug and an affectionate wifely kiss alan took her up off her feet unwilling to let a pat and a peck on the lips suffice children be damned servants be damned he thought i want a proper welcome alan caroline chid him but not sternly at all as she gave him what he demanded he could hear hugh blowing indignant bubbles of revulsion as they kissed again nothin to sneer at hugh alan chortled softly as he let her go at last take my word for it there was a rare light in carolines eyes as she knelt to give her sons a peck too ah little hugh what youll flinch from my kiss and sewallis our little angel thats my little man you not wipe off your mothers affections and how is charlotte alan asked as he offered his arm to lead caroline into the informal dining room simply perfect of course caroline chuckled filled with a maternal warmth baby charlotte named for her maternal grandmother was barely twelve months old and still nursing soon to stop please god lewrie begged silently no matter they could afford wet nurses no matter how unfashionable for english ladies caroline had insisted upon it with every child months and bloody months of nursing months and months of baby talk billing and cooing between swaddled babe and doting mama and god help the man who interfered or tried to conduct an adult conversation alan espied a tiny darker damp spot on her demure woolen bodicea dottle of lovingly egested milk and noted the flush of pleasure she usually bore after a feeding hugh made another blubberlipped sound of disapproval as he was helped into a chair by the governess youll appreciate girls in your own time me lad lewrie cautioned him even a little sister he pulled out carolines chair to seat her at the foot of the table saw cony and mistress mcgowan get the boys placed and took his own seat at the head before he could unfold his napery out rushed a maid with a steaming tureen of soup and cony was uncorking a bottle of hock with a cheery thwocking sound hearty chicken soup with a dash of tarragon caroline announced urging them all to dig in takes the winter chill away out it goes then up as a ship goes out to sea so my spoon goes out from me and young gentlemen never lean over their bowls do they hugh hugh gulped what looked like a heaping shovelfull into his greedy maw hunched over his plate with the spoon held like a ladle in a clumsy little paw his cheeks puffed out like a squirrels as he tried to swallow and a line of creamy soup frothed between his lips followed a second later by the entire mouthful since it was so hot he began to fan buttockdance on his chair and bawl small sips thats the way hugh lord caroline sighed rising to rush to his side to sponge him down and comfort him see how sewallis does it there there hugh youre not hurt take a sip of water theres my little baby oh for gods sake lewrie thought eyeing them one son prim as a parson one looking like hed just spewed a dogs dinner and a dowdy wife a matronly wife definitely matronly well she is a matron aint she he qualified to himself a youngun thank the lord seven years wed bloom off the rose and all that still she wore a fiercely white starched mobcap with her hair up and almost hidden beneath it a heavy old woolen gown drab as a titmouse with wristlength sleeves and a highcut bodice totally unadorned by even a hint of lace a pale natural wool shawl over her shoulders which plumped and disguised even more of her youth and a bibfronted slightly stained dishclout of an apron useful during childrearing of an infant still incontinently in nappies but lord and that baby talkall the time he thought feeling guilty and disloyal comparing his mostly delightful wife to the fetchingly handsome girl she once had been ill take them maam mistress mcgowan volunteered from the kitchen doors summoned by the noises la theyre too excitable for a sitdown supper not utensil trained neither come boys well finish supper in the kitchen let mummy and daddy eat their meal in peace and you may see them later before bedtime perhaps thats best caroline surrendered though she did cock a chary eyebrow in the governess direction and furrowed her forehead in what alan had long ago learned was simmering vexation good soup alan commented a minute or two of weighty silence later meaty and the tarragon brings out the flavor wonderfully well as do all your spices dear im pleased youre pleased with it love caroline smiled in reply though with half her attention on the feeding noises from the closed kitchen doors about mistress mcgowan alan posed in a soft voice im not entirely happy to have our own lives ordered about so we are not her favorite sort of parents and i have noticed caroline sighed between dainty spoonfuls i will speak to her if she cannot alter her ways well you are mistress in your own house dear alan comforted her and a damned fine one i assure you i will not have your sensible ways upset nor you distressed by a mere servant thankee alan caroline beamed at him this time i promise i will speak to her damned good soup he commented again raising an eyebrow too bad little charlotte isnt ready for soup such as this think of what shes missing poor tyke why it may be a week or two more before shes even able to take mere gruels and paps dye think dear tell me i can have you back hey he pleaded with the merest sign of innocent inquisitiveness on his phiz once caroline put a child on a solid diet and left off nursing he could play once more with those twin peaks of his delight once that is she stopped producing milk hed rushed it the week before and still felt embarrassed by the almost perverse cloyingly sweet taste of mothers milk which had flooded his mouth in the throes of passionate foreplay oh i think more than a week or so alan caroline told him colouring herself at the memory perhaps another month she will take tiny spoonfuls of thin paps now but caroline shrugged in explanation which was no explanation at all save for the heavy way her breasts brushed and lifted beneath her prim bodice nursing was a very private pleasurealmost as good a pleasure as mel lewrie wondered it seemed so domesticity he groaned to himself keeping his face bland as he hid behind a sip of hock aint it grand thankee jesus and how was the village caroline inquired changing the subject deftly quiet as usual same old complaints same old faces he grimaced slightly and laid aside his spoon caroline rang a tiny china bell for the soup to be removed and the mutton chops to be fetched in talk of the french bags of it anything new she asked frowning fear mostly even the tenant farmers are getting worried all that levelling jacobin talk about equality will come here someday now theyve murdered their king and queen perhaps itll die out like nootka sound caroline prayed a great deal of commotion then its been ten years since america went the same way and nothings come of that she stated to reassure them both englishmen arent as crazed as the french thank god nor as emptyheaded as the rebels were theres nothing wrong with english society needs changing let the whole world turn upside down well be here season to season sane and orderly as usual we may dear alan countered gently but the germanies the rest of europe first the colonies went unhinged now france and as bloody as you could ask for didnt call it the terror for nought yknow there were no aristocrats to butcher in the colonies and a fair number of them were rebels to start with my pardons carolines brother george hadbeen butchered by chiswick relatives in the lower cape fear of north carolina and that pregnant woman murdered in her bed alan had discovered outside yorktown before the siege set in her unborn babe pinned to the log walls with a rusty bayonet first the colonies then france god knows where next not england o course he reiterated after a bite of succulent mutton chop heavy with hot mustard navy style but if this plague spreads how long before were alone in a sea of hostile republicans pray god it will blow over like a summer storm then caroline shuddered all but crossing herself cony fetched out a bottle of burgundy more suited to mutton to replace the lighter hock and if you are called back well it would not be for long nootka sound an incredibly petty spat between spain and england over fishing and furs halfway round the world on the grim and forbidding coast of america almost to the pole almost to northernmost asia the fleet had been called up to prepare for war ships laid up inordinary had been refitted and new construction begun alan had spent six weeks in active commission first officer into a th rate thirtysixgun frigate upriver at chatham before saner and cooler heads prevailed and the whole business had deflated like one of those frogs montgolfiers hotair balloons another nootka sound im certain dearest he promised her their bedchamber was snugly warm and alan lewrie was fighting the urge to yawn to succumb to sleephoping for better things to do in the shank of a cold winter evening theyd finished supper taken the boys into the small parlour and let them prate babble and play as wild as they wished for an hour before shooing them off to bed alan and caroline had played a duet a medley of reassuringly old country ballads she on her flute he on his cheap tin flageolet years of practice and he still sounded so terrible he would not play for any guest shed beaten him four games out of seven at backgammon and finished the bottle of claret with him flushed with victory liquor and so much happily domestic contentment that shed quite forgotten her previous worries the cook governess maidservant his man cony the scullery wenches and the rest of their burgeoning household were all now belowstairs or tucked away in their garrets caroline was seated before a mirror at her dressing table mobcap and dowdy woolen apparel gone replaced by a flimsy dressing gown her hair was down and loose long and shiny as she slowly and methodically brushed it lewrie was under the pile of coverlets and quilts with the steamy clothesiron heat of the recently removed warming pan under his buttocks and back the fireplace glowed cheery and hot across the chamber its amber dancing flames reflected into the room by a brass backplate throwing shadows on paneling and wallpapers beneath his fine linen nightshirt he was happily encouraging a cockstand he smiled in eager anticipation admiring her reflection in the mirror as she smiled a pleased and secretive smile to herself she posed her hair arms lifted exposing a graceful neck and slim arms slim back shifting beneath her silken gown she went back to stroking her hair underbrushing now with her head cocked over to one side in her mirror shadow breasts rustled against silk fuller and heavier so very much more promising than when she was girlish when theyd met in wilmington north carolina during the evacuation she could not have weighed eight stone sopping wet and that with half a dozen petticoats slim and coltish stillnot the usual appledumpling matron after all perhaps a half stone more alan wondered just the slightest bit fuller in hips and upper thighsbut it was such succulent acquiescent yielding and secret excess sweeter softer than ever before as soft as gosling down his fingers began to twitch with a life of their own as he contemplated the buttersoftness of the luscious bottom hed soon be stroking not much needs seeing to tomorrow i fear dear she said to him colouring a little as she saw his intent reflected gaze muck out feed the stock alan yawned jaws creaking in struggle against it have the beef cattle driven to the stockpens not a morsel of pasturage left for em and we dont wish to risk any spring calves if the weather turns off colder youre beginning to anticipate a farm after all she replied with a light chuckle but it was very matteroffact as if sensing that shed been too blunt and critical of his farming skills caroline crinkled her large hazel eyes at him via the mirror pursed her lips and blew him a distant kiss across the bedchamber after four years its about time dont you think he said shifting under the covers she was smiling that particular that secret heavylidded smileit promised to be an intimate evening indeed like the navy knots an rope he rambled on putting his hands beneath his head on the pillows thoroughly at ease now cept for the bosuns whod flog my bottom raw if i got things wrong thank god cant birth a lamb mister lewrie ton my word sir no way to bind a sheave mister lewrie bosun dozen o yr best at once sir bend over kiss the gunners daughter mister lewrie or is it the farmers daughter hmm caroline giggled then went back to stroking her hair humming a tune to herself almost crooning oh she paused were invited to a game supper at govemours and millicents friday night he bagged a stag and it should be well hung by roasting time and uncle phineas and his dull compatriots will be there alan frowned with displeasure dear as i love wellhung venison pity he didnt bag uncle phineas might be too tough an old boar to chew though were to bring a covered dish caroline went on resuming her stroke i thought a dessert would be best from us hmm a tart fruit jumble thatd go well with venison he suggested stifling another yawn something half wild like that redcurrant preserve you put up in the fall mmm yes that might do mainwell she put aside her brush and bound her hair at last into a long single tress she rose from her dressing table let the dressing gown fall open over her bedgown and crossed to the fireplace william pitt their ancient tawny ramcat lay stretched out on the narrow padded bench in front of the fire like a rather large orangecoloured plum duff he was whimpering and grunting in his sleep caroline touched his grizzled head and he woke enough to look up thrust the top of his head against her hand and turn over to lie facing lewrie all four heavy paws together as he stretched the one good eye regarded the bed the stubby tail curled lazily as he recalled how cozywarm it was to sleep with humans on cold winter nights not tonight you little bastard alan gloated at him caroline blew out the last remaining candle and came to the high bedstead slowly undoing the fastenings of her dressing gown shrugging it off her shoulders to puddle at her elbows her hips swayed in the flickering amber darkness he put out a hand to her and little charlotte took that exact and unfortunate instant to wake either wet hungry lonely bored or terrified perhaps a combination of all fiveand began to bawl her little head off even in the near dark alan could see carolines face go empty and vacant then vexed then subsumed with worry and after that she had no more thought for her husband than she might for the man in the moon with frantic matronly haste she did back up her robe and was out the door and down the hall for the nursery bloody alan lewrie groaned in a soft whimper head back on the pillows in sudden defeat though still up on his elbows in welcome bloody hell he moaned collapsing marrrh william pitt announced in a grumpy closedmouthed trill as he hopped up on the foot of the bed as if he had known how the evening would fall out he padded slowly up the covers tacking cautiously around the slowly sinking seamount of his masters fading tumescence and flopped himself sideways against lewries upper chest leaning his whole and not inconsiderable weight against him pitts good eye regarded lewrie with commiseration his one undamaged ear gave a tiny twitch and he yawned again as close to a grin as felines may essay baring his remaining teeth and mismatched fangs one heavy round paw big as an unhusked walnut reached out and patted at alans chin claws nicely sheathed to give comfort and to demand some for himself lewrie slid an arm down from inside the warm recently inviting covers to pet him and scratch the top of his head the shaggy ruff of fur around his thick neck you knew didnt you pitt lewrie whispered resignedly i wish to god i knew how you do these things murpphh william pitt harrumphed beginning to punloud and rattling like a bilgepump chain he closed his eyes in bliss at least somebody round heres blissful lewrie thought and most uncharitably too chapter breakfast was a rushed affair strong cup of tea leftover mutton chop and burned toast the household was a veritable babble of activity of sound and lewrie needed time away from it that and the reek of soiled nappies charlotte was being her usual incontinent serf hugh had suffered a tiny accident no matter he was supposedly breeched and past such thankfully it was the washday and once lewrie returned from his morning ride across the hills the aromas of steam boilwater soap and starch and hot irons would have conquered for a time at least the winterpent aromas of sour milk soiled swaddles and progeny poop he had one foot in the stirrup crouched for the leap when a voice interrupted him it was cony calling his name standing in the kitchen door waving something at him bloody alan sighed hopping on one foot to clear his boot toe from the stirrup now what he demanded of the frigid morning it had not been a good evening he had struggled to stay awake until caroline might return from the nursery but it had taken what seemed like hours until she had quieted little charlotte enough to allow the governess to finish the ministrations she had slipped back into bed with him her skin cool against his toasty warmth and had snuggled close kissed him a time or two with a weary acquiescent wifely absence of passion gently puffing her lips with her mouth ajar against his throat in utterly stupefied slumber not half a minute later and had risen to her great joys of domestic duties before cony had fetched him his first cup of tea letter f r ya sir cony told him as he tromped through the kitchen garden theys a messenger come with it down from london in th kitchen warmin is backside fr now sir lewrie turned the packet over and sucked in a cold breath of chill country air as he beheld the blue wax searing wafer with the fouled anchor beneath the crown admiralty war wi th french i wager sir cony declared as lewrie broke the seal his man was all but hopping from one foot to the other in rising excitement everone knowed hit wuz acomin thought the old fartd retired by now lewrie commented as he noted the inscription below the message a harried junior clerk had penned the bulk of it but for the prim signature of the first secretary philip stephens at the bottom hed been first secretary to the admiralty since the year lewrie had been born january admiralty whitehall to alan lewrie lt royal navy sir my lords commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral require your most immediate attendance upon their lordships you are charged and directed to well damme lewrie breathed again the chill settled lower into his stomach not just into his lungs bodkins put anson back in his stall ill not ride today do you fetch out the closed coach though its he drew out opened and peered at his damascened watch nigh on seven i wish to depart for london by ten yessir the groom nodded touching his forelock be it war sir cony inquired anxiously no mention of it cony yet something that smells nigh to it though ill see that messenger now do you look to my chest see whats wanting you know my needs well as any by now and lay out a uniform for me ill be up directly aye sir cony agreed touching his own forehead in a lankfingered salute of old habit uhm ya wish me tbe goin wi ya up tlondon that is sir yes cony at least to london lewrie smiled though a bit grimly once im assigned a ship well thats up to you i allow you may be very helpful to mistress lewrie about the farm farmings what you know best what you enjoy most uhm yessir cony shrugged estate agent overseer lewrie rambled on as they entered the warm kitchens where the maids and scullery wenches walked small about the elegant but threatening stranger down from london no need to take you off to sea and theres maude down at the ploughman is there not uhm yessir cony blushed grinning a little the publican of the olde ploughman was getting on in years and his pretty little spinster daughter maude was of marriageable age mister beakman was now a widower had no sons interested in inheriting the public house and both father and daughter were fond of cony almost everyone in anglesgreen was hed make a fine partner in the business and a knacky publican later whichever way he jumped hed land on his feet and do it on dry land if he has any sense lewrie thought im lewrie sir he announced himself to the stranger you will wish a quick reply to carry back that would be welcome sir the functionary nodded though ive several more officers to call upon about chiddingfold and petersfield before returning sir the paperwork you see sir quite lewrie grimaced at the necessity and made the messenger grin too in recognition of the volumes of correspondence government seemed to generate over trifles come to my study so i may scribble you something suitable bring your tea ive some brandy there a dollopd thaw your bones i wager oh aye sir as they left the kitchen for the central hall lewrie espied caroline and the boys she stood trembling with a wild cast to her expression with the petulant whiny children tucked into her skirts they couldnt know what was transpiring surely he thought but it was plain enough to them that something momentous was being played out alan dear she called after him clearing her throat but almost in a whisper he thought to pause to speak a few consoling words to her before joining the admiralty messenger in the study it was her furrow and her frown that stopped him almost accusatory it was the vexed look caroline might bestow upon an unruly boy as a warning that further such behaviour would call down chastisement ill be with you shortly dear he said instead is it war alan asked after he had closed the double doors upon the rest of the household not yet sir the messenger scowled busy at the wine cabinet but theyve been calling officers and warrants back for weeks now i heard tell the press has been warned just in case doesnt say much for me then lewrie forced a chuckle i was one of the first returned in our lords commissioners never released some of those called in over nootka sound sir the fleet stayed at least quarterstrength since once the terror began in paris uhm hah you see sir you are most certainly in the lower half of the lieutenants list so if we are at quarterstrength dye see lower third or lower actually lewrie scoffed sitting at his desk february of he laid out a fresh sheet of vellum a pot of ink black preferred and took a small penknife to the nib of the nearest goose quill he got through the date and his local address the address of authority and his salutation then sat quite nonplussed wondering exactly what the devil he would say to our lords commissioners milords bugger off perhaps the navy had not been his career of choice he could thank his father far off in bengal with the east india company army for pressganging him into service for he should have inherited the money from granny lewrie long before he had never been what one might call your truly glad sailor thirteen years of his life he had given the fleet not without much real choice truth to tell nine in active service midshipman to lieutenantand these last four beached on halfpay he thought the french had a particularly apt word for these four yearsthey usually did damn their troublesome rebellious eyes ennui boredom and isolation shunned and out of his depth and as anchored as ulysses in his dotage without a war and it was now certain one was coming in spite of his assurances to dear caroline what would his life hold for him more of anglesgreen still a leper to his neighbours until such time in a misty future when he had outlived sir romney and uncle phineas and the grudge had faded out harry would inherit become baronet marry some unfortunate mort and let it go at last lewrie might become a proper squire then with owned not rented acres have right to hunt and fish his own lands instead of waiting to be asked by others charity some stooped and graying rustic with a fund of tedious yarns and hair growing from out his ears with a nose that bowed in low conge to his departing teeth a wellrespected cackling bore no matter that he bored his audience at the red swan at last instead of the ploughman and whilst thered been war with the french as tall frigates prowled like tigers in the night brighteyed and hungry to claw at each other as lineofbattle ships formed to bellow to make or break history he would have been nothing but a spectator and one far back in the cheap seats too he would farm hey read the news down from london in the naval chronicle brandish his walking stick and huzzah each victory or write scathing letters to the times caroline needed him though would prefer this time he shuddered with revulsion at the image of his respectable civilian futurecaroline or no no like his father sir hugo st george willoughby of the th the kings own now of the th native infantry had said to him once after they were reconciled in the far east damme he realized shivering again recalling the details of a halfabandoned past they had been arguing in a seething tropic rainstorm hot as shaving water it was at bencoolen on the malacca straits ready to sail for the spratlys just my tiny ship and his regiment to fight more pirates than the new forest has nuts beat the bastards too oh didnt wejustl oh its all moonshine this death or glory chatter yet lieutenant colonel sir hugo had said might not have been a glad soldier boy but i became a goodun or something like that growl he may but go aye he believed he would there would not be a second asking if he turned the admiralty down his place on the list would be scratched out his commission thrown over alan lewrie might not have been a gladsome tar either but he knew in his heart that by god hed become a damned good sea officer and there would be no peace for his already restless soul if he didnt take the kings shilling and serve just one more time yr pardons sir lewrie said as if coming out of some trance tis been so long since i had to pen an official letter formalities quite escaped me youve found the brandy i trust rum sir the messenger replied quite happily baking before the morning fire his large mug of laced tea in his hand he had not taken the slightest notice that lewrie might have been delaying dithering or hesitant to accept the possibility of an active commission in fact what delay he might have at last noticed he would have liked so he could warm himself against another cold ride and make free with lewries fine sweet dark jamaican rum rum for me too it seems cleardecksandupspirits seven bells of each forenoon lewrie grunted with guilty pleasure as he put the finishing touches to his note of acceptance he shook sand over it and blew on the ink so it would not smudge he folded it carefully and applied candle wax to form a seal along the outer fold there you are sir i expect to be in london by nightfall and in the waiting room by tomorrow morning then i shall keep you no longer sir the messenger stated finishing his laced tea with a gulp and stuffed the precious note into a hard despatch case where fully two dozen more were already crammed then bowed a swift departure lewrie went to his wine cabinet and poured himself a glass of dark jamaican inventorying the study for items to take along would he get a ship of his own this timesomething small like alacrity wine cabinet foldleg desk caddy for tea coffee chocolate and sugar extra chest yonder pewter ianthorns down from the garret just in case ferguson rifle there the fusil musketoon too and no he thought taking a welcome and bracing sip ill go a lieutenant still most like dogs manger of a cabin in the wardroom not room for much beyond a seachest and little else he held the small glass of ram up to the firelight it was almost opaque and the alcohol fumes wafted the sweet lush adventurous scent of faroff west indies molasses about his head rife with promise of potency and overthehorizon beyondthesunset largerthanlife adventure excitements honour and glory be damned he took another sip savouring the rawness of the rums bouquet soon it would be passersissue rum cheap popskull the weary seamans anodyne with the rum he could almost begin to sniff a whiff of ocean the hemp and tar the steep tubs and the fat used for slush on running rigging the iodine tang of open rolling seas the freshfish aromas of storm wrack and the tidewater mildewed mustiness of harbourside of hot sand and kelp baking under a cruel sun on distant strands and the dankcave breath of a ship wafting up through limber holes and carpenters walks from belowunwashed men paint and wet wool old cooking greases of seasoned oak and sweating iron artillery caroline he thought at last what to say to her sorry dear but id crawl to whitehall on my knees to escape the boresome shit my lifes become dear as you are to me dear as life is with you and the boys it isnt youtis me he tossed off his rum impatiently steeling himself for the hurt words he was sure would come he set the glass on the mantel reached up and took down his swordnot a proper officers straight smallsword but a hanger a slightly curved singlebladed hunting sword much like a light elegant cutlass it had stayed hung there for years far out of reach of inquisitive little hands there was dust on the royalblue leather scabbard and it had not gotten the strenuous attention their tableware did from the maids he ran his fingers over the slightly tarnished silver lionshead pommel the dark blue hilt wrapped in silver wire the belt hook on the chase the front and side handguards formed like argent seashells he halfdrew it to test its edge against a thumbnail but it was a gills a fine blade and had lost none of its keenness no matter how long it had hung neglected and idle ii nee vero ipse metus cumsque resolvere ductor sed maria aspectans heu qui datus iste deorum sorte labor nobis now verily did the leader himself forget all fears and cares but gazing on the seas alas he cried how hard a task is here set us by heavens will valerius flaccus argonautica book iv chapter if great london also bore loathsome reeks of its own particular devising at least they were urbane and cosmopolitan and lewrie in his mounting excitement to be returning to the city of his birth and gateway to the wider world beyond took no notice of them farm lands and villages got closer together villages became towns until once they had passed guildford the conurbations crowded each other until they seemed one vast burgeoning of the capital brimming over with bustling enterprise like a boiling pot lodging was almost impossible to find all the coaching inns were full as were the private residences which would let rooms and the use of the parlours to guests sparsely furnished rooming houses were out of the question even those dubious rooms to letwhich usually signified hourly rates for the sporting crowdwere taken by officers of both army and navy being called back to their colours they finally alit upon a hideously expensive posting house just before dark after hours of rumbling through the streets it was near kings college and somerset house on catherine street just off the strand being a posting house though accustomed to travellers who came to town in their own coaches it could be expected to be clean and quiet enough to suit the most fastidious high gentry or titled visitor and set a decent table at twelve shillings sixpence a day it ought to lewrie carped to himself thats moren twice my activecommission lieutenants pay they caroline never failed to amaze him where he had expected the tears and recriminations of an abandoned wife accusations of running away from familial responsibilities damme she was packed herself and ready to travel near as fast as i was he thought admiringly babes bustled off to granny charlotte and off we jounced himself cony bodkins as coachee caroline and her maidservant all jumbling together as the closed coach clattered over winterhard roads so crossrutted they were fortunate to still have a collective tooth in their heads once settled lewrie wrote a letter to his solicitor matthew mountjoy to make arrangements for carolines and the farms allowance whilst he was at sea he also penned a note on his account with coutts co bankers for ready funds and future drafts to be sent overseas all of which cony would deliver on the morrow then a quick quiet supper and up to bed so he would be well rested for his appearance at the admiralty he donned his nightshirt and slipped into a warm bedstead wondering how often in future hed have the luxury of retiring completely undressed of enjoying a full nights sleep instead of two and threehour snatches between crises wondering what sort of ship hed be assigned to a frigate was his dearest wish how slow and cumbersome a rd rate ship of the line is by comparison how plodding and dull and hello caroline snuffed the candles beeswax a round halfdozen to the room and each charged for what three would cost in the country and slid in beside him her head found its usual resting place upon his shoulder her arms encircled him as he extended his right arm to nestle her warmly close the light citrony aroma of freshly dabbed hungary water enveloped him caroline slid one hand up his chest to his neck to the back of his head with sinewy strength she turned his face to hers and their lips met in the dark as she grappled him nearer as she slid upward as she cast a slim thigh across his lap seductively yet fiercely her kisses searing and intense as sobs i could not let you go away she whispered in a raspy breathlessness with last night your remembrance of me god knows how long youll be gone or how soon how little time we all said between long searching openmouthed kisses breath hot and cowclover musky her soft smooth flesh flushed and warming as alan slid her silk nightgown to her waist to fondle to possess that peachlike bottom that butterfly softness of her inner thighs that fount of all pleasures with almost frantic impatience caroline sat up on her knees and one arm and shucked her nightgown tossing it to the four winds reached down as though to rip his bedclothes high enough away to lean down over him take his hands and guide them to her breasts as she pressed her mouth to his once more her tongue almost scalding all night i swear it she almost wept all the time they give us god i love you caroline he muttered as he took hold of the upswelling of her hips to guide her down to meet him i love you oh alan dearest i love you she vowed love me now i beg you my remembrance ahhh yess spose theyll not see me that early he most happily thought god i can get a whole days sleep in the waiting room moren like even at half past six of the morning london s streets were thronged with mongers and their wares fresh from the market waggons and drays livestock weary prostitutes and pickpockets revellers on their way home to bed shopkeepers and clerks on their way to work the bulkhead shops were already open as were the greengrocers and butchers coalheavers were out houseservants or valets to fetch their masters or mistresses breakfasts from ordinaries or taverns it was quicker for lieutenant lewrie to saunter down catherine street cross the busy strand with a trained ear attuned to the rude cries of have care or by yr leave sir of coachees careening waggoners or sedanchair bully bucks to stand still dumb as a fart in a trance even on the footpaths was an invitation to getting trampled and take a boat to the admiralty at the foot of the bank where charing cross ended there were stairs to the riversideslimy mucked and erose and worn down by long usage as soon as he was spotted the cacophonous din set in reminding lewrie of a hunting pack whod cornered the fox oars oars cried the boatmen scullers scullers sir tuppence countered those with smaller dinghys featuring a sternsweep as propulsion oars he answered back scanning the flotilla and selecting a bullock of a fellow who sported the crossbelt brassard and coatofarms of the lord mayor whitehall steps sixpence sir the fellow nodded as he boarded the small craft tiden wind be fair is mornin sir hard not to tell lewrie commented as he settled himself on a forward thwart his coin out and ready aye aye sir the man crinkled a sunwrinkled

country but it doesnt upset you enough to volunteer i take it lewrie said with a knowing smirk the waterman tapped the brassard on his chest which protected him from the impress service and tipped lewrie another and equally knowing wink i aint thet stupid in me old age sir he paid off the waterman at the foot of whitehall steps amid a swarm of other boats of other officers reporting for duty a walk up richmond terrace to thronging whitehall a stroll of about one hundred or more yards north up whitehall and he was there before the curtain wall with its columns and blank stone facade between before the deep central portal which led to the inner courtyard beneath the pair of winged sea horses which topped the portal admiralty what a leviathan one single word implied ordnance board

empire which meant of course the civilized world and one single wordadmiraltyspanned it all just as the royal navy would soon span the globe the most efficiently armed supplied and equipped military organization known to man the enormity of the endeavour made even a cynic such as lewrie take pause until he got to the door of course lewrie the longterm tiler sighed with a weary frazzled anas he scanned his admittance list with one arthritic finger and applied the other index fingers horny nail to ferret between mossy teeth yr sure they wish tsee ya then sir however dya spell that doubyaarreyeeeh is it the tiler seemed offended that it wasnt some simpler name perhaps or perhaps he was disappointed he had no wisp of fatty bacon left to suck on whichever it was he made an open grimace of disgust aye yr listed he announced at last almost grumbling with outrage to find lewries name go long in sir take a pew wi th others god help ya you have no idea when lewrie began after heaving a tiny sigh of frustration anxious to know what hour or which day his appointment might be run outa ideas summer o sir when i took this position the tiler shot back impatiendy theres one lad midshipman he was was three full year warmin is backside in yonder willyanotgom sirthere sahordeo otherswaitinyounextyesyom sir lewrie stifled his retort knowing it would do him no good or even begin to penetrate the querulous tilers thick hide he entered left his cloak with an attendant who was even surlier than the tiler and took a pew in the infamous waiting room early as it was all the chairs benches and sofas were taken by commodores by postcaptains by commanders lowly scum such as he had perforce to stand and in the draughtiest corners at that as far from the fireplaces as rank and dignity would allow so much for a long nap he sighed to himself without children to cock an ear to he and caroline had spent a night so passionate it rivaled their first days together as man and wife and they had gone far past the point at which they might usually crash to sleep in utter exhaustion he no longer held that thirty was exactly the dotage hed feared truth to tell he was quite proud of himself and his prowess his endurance but he was now paying for it once still and hemmed in in the frowstywarm waiting room he was almost asleep on his feet held up by the press of other nodding mens shoulders except for the boisterous old boys day jocularity which the rest displayed the hummumm of an hundred men conversing punctuated by cockawhoop laughter calls of welcome the damn my eyes if it aint greetings of shipmates long separated whether theyd despised the person greeted or not after three years commission elbow to elbow and the clatter of scabbards as both clumsy and adroit slowly paced the room tangling and untangling taking or giving way he dryswabbed his face shook himself and made his way towards the steamy aroma of hot tea gladly willing to kill for a cup mister lewrie sir cried a cheerful voice damn my eyes lewrie called back if it aint hogue a commission officer now how dye keep hey mainwell sir lieutenant hogue blushed and you to thank for my promotion i learned his former midshipman was aglow with fondness damn right you should thank me lewrie thought smugly did it yourself sir he poohpoohed though your service did it when they gave us culverin and we fought the lanun rovers in the far east lewrie took care to say that loud enough for others the waiting rooms were no place to show lickspittle meek before ones peers now there was almost war with france their covert work could be revealed put paid to choundas and his pirates where are you bound do you know yet third rate sir hogue boasted only fourth officer but im off to chatham on the next diligence coach and you sir just arrived so ive no idea yet time for tea though my lad lewrie offered warm your ride in the rumbletumble hey but lieutenant hogue had no time and an hour later there was one more old acquaintance railsford of the old desperate a captain now damn my eyes if it isnt lewrie ha ha captain railsford cried pumping his hand vigorously heard about your last commission the very merriest time you mustve had in the bahamas all those pirates me hydra down to the nore finest frigate ever i laid my eyes upon damme wish id known you were available id have requested you but i already have a first lieutenant and you are getting seniorish oh well i understand completely sir lewrie grinned back though he was crestfallen another three years under railsford fine seaman welldisposed friend and mentor would have been a joy and captain treghues sir alan asked merely from curiosity inherited the title last year i believe married well too into the walpoles cadet branch but railsford enthused the walpoles were one of the great families who pretty much ran england through influence and marriedin minions got a seat in parliament out of it too captain lord tobias treghues baron sure to make rearadmiral soon with those connexions is he still lewrie simpered screwing a knuckle to the side of his forehead occasionally daft as bats hmm lets say now hes risen so a tad eccentric railsford chuckled softly and that only on odd humid days well my fondest wishes for your continued good fortune lewrie but i must dash write to me an hour another slow circumnavigation of the waiting rooms and two cups of tea later still with no seat he ran into another old shipmate of a sort sir george lewrie said hesitantly anxious though he was to see a familiar if hated face sir george sinclair was now a rearadmiral he turned a hostile aquiline glare on the interloper whod dare trifle with his valuable and selective attention alan lewrie sir george desperate antigua aye yes sir george replied frostily his eyes glazing over with subhme disinterest i remember you it sounded more like a threat still at it are we lewrie alan imagined he could hear talons being stretched hard chitin claws being honed uhm aye sir and you recall my nephew forrester do you not oh damme lewrie sighed defeated and eager to run the round postcaptain hovering over sir georges shoulder was that selfsame porcine glutton that bane of his midshipman days francis forrester he hadnt gotten any trimmer but he was a postcaptain despite his being dense as a kerbstone it helped lewries flagging confidence to recall that his fellow midshipmen had once painted forrester blue as a druid and pissed in his shoes at every opportunity forresters expression however told alan that his memory of his days in the cockpit berths was just as keen if not quite so fond much senior are you lewrie forrester grunted bottom half i would imagine sir that sir was wrung from him with the greatest chagrin last hed seen of francis hed been a paroled prisoner after yorktown exchanged on the bonetta sloop to new york his career in pieces god how hed risen though eminently employable then forrester beamed with sudden joy do you not think uncle we shall keep you in mind sir sir george vowed jesus kill me now and have done lewrie prayed anything but their clutches anything theres bligh someone breathed behind lewries left shoulder quickly followed by a stifled giggle of mirth poor old fellow someone else more charitable commented he was a little fellow nothing like the tragic hero hed been proclaimed when hed first reached england after the mutiny nothing like the ogre hed lately been portrayed either despite his recent and calamitous downfall in popular opinion he still drew his throng of admirers lewrie joined them it was a slow morning read your book sir lewrie toadied all but simpering god i wish id but known you might be here this very day sir id have fetched it along so you might have inscribed it kind of you to say so sir quite captain bligh replied a trifle dubiously a trifle shyly halfexpecting he was being made the butt of a jape bad timing i gathered sir lewrie went on having to wait so long at otaheiti for the breadfruit plants growing season well what crew wouldn t go stale on one i ask you delivered properly this time sir bligh declared firmer in his convictions now that he saw he still had some admirers in providence a proper ship an indiaman pity though lewrie shrugged captain edwards and pandora had their lordships ordered things the other way round you to go pursue your mutineers edwards to fetch the breadfruit captain edward edwards a taut hand if ever there was one who made blighs easygoing though unpredictable ways seem like a saint in comparison had apprehended several mutineers left behind when the bounty sailed off for parts unknown but edwards had piled pandora on the coral reefs of endeavour straits and had lost her i predicted dire consequences ya know bligh almost preened by then feeling more comfortable among sycophantic curiosity seekers told em edwards did not know the navigation of flinders passage in the reefs of endeavour straits excuse me sir but you are lewrie sir alan lewrie ah yes well thankee for your kind opinion sir thankee kindly bligh bobbed with a shy smile i suppose you must be going sir i will delay you no longer off to a new command i trust lewrie fawned good day sir bligh snapped suddenly turned on his heel and departed in a frosty insulted huff bloody hell alan muttered to himself in confusion i shouldnt worry over it much an unfamiliar lieutenant told him in a whisper the court martial only hanged three out often and let the rest off lenient as possible didnt they now read edward christians minutes of the court martial and the scales will balance fletcher christians brother dont ye know the man sniggered the first lord lord chatham im told hes issued word hed only award bligh with a ship should hell freeze over wont even give him the time of day is the rumor no berth to be had with him thank the good lord so ive lewrie sighed with a wry grin at his toadying right pissed down his back for nought the other chortled an occupational hazard of ours though is it not sir he posed with a sardonic lift of one brow to cover his chagrin over being so toadying and so obvious at it oh it is indeed sir the other officer agreed heartily equally taken by the drollery of it all hypocrisy in the service of ones career is no vice at all one must simply be aware of when and most importantly to whom one is the canting toad will you take tea with me sir by late afternoon the waiting room was just as crowded though at least a third of its denizens who hid their impatience or their dismay behind poses of bemused boredom stoic sternness or glum patience were new arrivals and lewries name still had not been called fearing hed miss his grand moment to ascend to the board room or at least receive his orders in writing from a harried clerk he had not even dared take time away to dine not even as far as the inner courtyard where one might buy dubious victuals off vendors carts beyond the curtain wall and portal his innards were growling by then much as they had when he was an underfed midshipman and the gallons of tea he had taken aboard when a secretary at last announced that the days business was at an end he forgot dignity and notions of rank to outrun half a dozen dozy postcaptains to the jakes where he passed water prodigiously as a cart horse for a rather long time tomorrow he told himself as he plodded swellfooted after standing since breakfast for whitehall steps and a boat back to his lodgings tomorrowll be my day chapter the admiraltys letter had been penned on the th and lewrie had received it on the nd arriving in person on the morning of the rd yet by the morning of february his tomorrow had yet to come to save money they had removed to willis rooms in new bond street down at the fashionable end closest to his old haunts around st james closer by road to whitehall too so alan could hire a onehorse hack to and from for less than his ferryman cost daily he was completely fagged out again of course caroline had delighted him with yet another night of honeymoon passion and that after a publicsubscription ball at ranelagh gardens a night of fine food music alternating between patriotic and lushly romantic and an almost palpable aura of frenetic enthusiasm young men in uniforms had suddenly sprang from everywhere and young ladies to match torn between tears of separation and lastopportunity wantonness caroline had come down to their common parlour in a new ball gown a caprice of the times like some grecian goddess sprung from the frieze of a precious ancient urn her gown was closer fitting almost a sheath with fewer petticoats and scandalously hemmed above the toes almost to her ankles with an artfully ragged turnback to reveal the lace of one petticoat her waistline was very high her bodice lowscooped to reveal decolletage sleeves short and gauzy all but baring arms and shoulders and about her neck she wore a redvelvet riband choker what fixed his intense openmouthed stare was her hairit had turned into a tangled nest of medusas tousled ratted snarled and dangled in crimped ringlets what the blazest hed gawped caroline had turned herself into a cross between a dago peasant and a covent garden whore whod had a rather hard night of it all the rage caroline had chuckled pirouetting for him it is a la victime dearest like the french aristocrats in the tumbrils going to the guillotine the riband for poor beheaded king louis and marie antoinette you you do not care for it she asked hesitantly losing her gay demeanour and her confidence my word he gasped its so he had been about to say that he did not in the least care for his wife to go out so scandalously attired sure she would be hooted and dunged by the mob yet seven years active service with her standing watchandwatch on their quarterdeck warned him hed crush her if he told her what he really thought hoping such clothes were indeed all the rage he decided to brazen it out and agree to deem it fashion and damme if she dont look fetchin like a whole new woman alan had thought fetchin enough to eat on the spotl wanton bold and brazen always been favourites o mine god help me no sobersided matron tonight aye i think i do like it after all brand new as smart as paint an triced up like a present to be unwrapped caroline hed said at last beaming forced but total approval its so different you look so so deuced handsome lovely surely im the luckiest man in england tonight gawd come ere you let me shew you how much i adore it so artfully uhm artless and to the titters and blushes of the house staff at willis her maids and conys smiles he had taken her in his arms and given her a long rewarding kiss right there in the public rooms and his fears had been groundless at the ball there had been ladies some with barely a jot of carolines sublime face and form in a la victime mode some carrying it so far as to look as bedraggled as irish peasants and flesh more flesh bared that night by younger ladies and highpriced courtesans than a man might see had he owned a knockingshop all of which inflamed lewries lustful humours theyd drunk frog champagne as if it were a patriotic duty to expunge the last trace from the british isles danced together round after round had circulated round the rotunda talking too loudly laughing too gaily greeting old acquaintances and had gone home after a midnight collation for that longedfor unwrapping its war the rumour began just about eleven in the morning the traffic in messengers through the lobby and foyer up the stairs to the board room and offices increased and those couriers sent out with despatch cases and bundles of papers were in more haste than was their usual wont elderly admiral howe made an appearance almost arm in arm with lord chatham the first lord on the way upstairs whispering and frowning grave dyspeptic stoicism its war with the frogs hopefuls began to gossip breathless with barely subdued excitement their eyes bright as famished hounds at the prospect of scraps heard the latest one boasted as if he had france marched into holland yesterday their ambassadors packing his traps well declare by midafternoon war at last employment at last no no twas austria decried a second officer refuting that round of news when it got to him prussia naples that last decree from paris bout supporting republican insurrections anywhere in europe theyre all coming in as a coalition cause of that did they march into the austrian netherlands yet itd be about time should you ask me theres their general coburg with a real army finest in europe opined several together sitting on their hands nigh on a whole year continued the speaker feared of a tagragandbobtail horde o frog peasantsled by former corporals so pray youstead o kickin their arses out o their territories a week after the invasion we should have declared when france took antwerp another anonymous strategist declared strongly why we might as well give up the continental and the baltic trade else whats next on the frogs menu amsterdam copenhaven hamburg finally a commodore fresh from the seat of power in the board room came down the stairs and was almost mobbed for information he held up a hand to silence their fervent queries the true facts which obtain sirs he announced solemnly very early this morning his majestys brig o war childers standing offandon without the harbour of brest was fired upon by french batteries word has reached us by the semaphore towers that she was struck several times by heavy roundshot childers will come in to display her damage and the french roundshot in her timbers and upon her decks but are we at war sir several officers demanded better you should ask of lord dundas or lord grenville for that sirs the commodore rejoined snippish at their lack of deference to a senior officer and their lack of decorum the secretaries of state and the foreign office our sovereign and parliament will best answer the commodore glared them to silence harumphed a last broadside of displeasure settled his waistcoat and stalked away to gather his things its come alan lewrie muttered to himself feeling a thrill run up his spine to be there on such a momentous occasion secretly pleased though to know there would be no more indecision no more delays soon he would be aboard a ship again the time for halfmeasures and tentative mobilisation was ended by god its come its war a lieutenant nearby cried exultantly lifting his arms in glee glorious war at last lewrie cocked his head to peer at him searchingly as he and his compatriots pummeled each other on the back and chortled happily of course he was very young the lieutenant he and all his fellows in badly tailored illfitting pinchbeck uniforms his sword was a cheap hamburg not even ivoried or gilded with a brass grip sure to betray him and turn in his grasp were his palms ever damp second or third sons the honourably penniless with no means of livelihood but the sea and warfare for these desperately eager young men peace had been a death sentence stranding them miserly and sour on halfpay and annual remittance perhaps of less than fifty pounds altogether but war now prizemoney full pay loot from captured ships and a chance to practice their seacraft to gain advancement to be noticed at last weaned as they were as lewrie had been on personal honour on bottom so bold theyd dare death itself to display gay courage risk life and limb for undying fame and glory ox fall gloriously at the very moment of a famous victory well now surely lewrie thought the fools must recall the dangers the fevers the rancid food foul living conditions storms and peril they werent ignorant midshipmen starryeyed and joining their first ship theyd gone months without a letter years of separation seen shipmates slaughtered scattered in pieces like an anatomy lesson at a teaching hospital hopelessly wounded men passed out the gunports alive to clear the fighting decks dead sewn up in shrouds or the permanently crippled amputees the blind the course theres moren a few thought me perverse for sneerin at deathorglory no one in his right mind goes out of his way to die a hero does he leastways i didnt not to say that fortune didnt have her way with me whether i wished or no i mean dead is dead for gods sake and whats the bloody point of lewrie a voice interrupted his fell musings would lieutenant lewrie be present alan lewrie anglesgreen surrey here lewrie shouted in a loud quarterdeck voice putting aside all his foul ungentlemanly unenglish sarcasms and forebodings at once tomorrow was here the deputy secretary mister jackson will see you upstairs lieutenant lewrie an old and inkstained senior writer informed him would you kindly step this way sir george jackson esquires offices were a smaller adjunct to the first secretarys on the same floor as the board room lewrie presented himself fingers twitching to seize the packet of orders which would be his passport his fortune your servant sir lewrie coaxed to gain the mans notice ah lewrie well jackson said barely looking up from the burgeoning mounds of documents on either side of his tall clerkingdesk behind which he slaved standing up he looked down immediately though to cluck his lips over an ineptly turned phrase perhaps some ink smudge or a clumsy or illegible example of penmanship i have your orders sir hmm these aye thank you sir lewrie beamed accepting the folded sheaf of vellum which one busy hand extended to him he opened them eagerly to see to which ship what sort of ship he would be assigned bloody hell escaped his lips as he beheld the concise words excuse me mister jackson sir there must be some mistake im for the impress service me sir mean tsay you wish to question the wisdom of our lords commissioners do you lewrie jackson countered quickly rewarding him with a tiny moue of disgust sir im not so old i dodderl lewrie rejoined with some heat my sight is excellent ive all my limbs im sound in wind and limb hale as a dray horse sir with all my teeth which is moren some may boast sir the impress service is for those who if were not at war with france this very instant young sir we shall be by nightfall jackson fussed giving lewrie only half of his distracted attention no no redo this section before this whole page in point of fact before it goes to mister stephens now lewrie should there have been an error which i most surely doubt you may correspond with us from your new posting to amend it prevail pon your patrons to write us but at this instant we need to man the fleet the bulk still lies inordinary and must be got to sea orders have come down for a hot press admiralty protections to be waived and that requires the most immediate reinforcement for the impress service else merchant seamen will escape our grasp and england s wooden walls will continue to languish for want of hands i do not originate orders lewrie i only inscribe them and pass them on bloom where youre planted for the nonce hey sir mister jackson i implore you lewrie continued in a softer more wheedling tone of voice striving to sound reasonable though what he wanted most at that moment was to leap across the desk and strangle the frazzled old fart there was a term of service in the far east a covert expedition through notice was put in my packet to the effect that i was unemployable to disguise my absence so i could pose as a halfpay officer with no prospects who took merchant service were you to but look sir perhaps that is still in there and influenced my assignment i am aware of that service sir and i was most scrupulous at the first secretarys behest to expunge your file of any false information and to include a true accounting of your deeds as soon as you paid off telesto rd rate eightygunner captain ayscough and i also vividly recall your most gracious reception in the board room by admirals lord hood and howe and sir philip sydney february of was it not sir the deputy secretary fussed proud of a memory as finely honed as his master philip stephens i recall too that you received an immediate further active commission to the bahamas your first true command did you not sir hardly a sign of official disapproval surely there dye see good god though sir lewrie shivered do you object strenuously enough to refuse an active commission lewrie jackson cautioned with a grim reassessing stare we shall needs select another officer i might imagine an hundred men would leap at the chance and you may continue to wait belowstairs you are not so senior or renowned i must advise you that a refusal now might ever lead to an active commission dearer to your heart it is customary to demote truculent officers to the bottom of the list or strike them off altogether it is your decision well sir no sir lewrie all but yelped quickly i shall not refuse its just its just needs of the sea service sir jackson concluded with a prim smugness which do not of necessity happen to coincide with yours and we note that you are a married officer sir surely your wife and children i note as well thats not a handicap like being lamed or surely more like an excess of limbs than the lack mister lewrie jackson took time to form a laborious jape you know the navy has a chary opinion of the zeal of a married officer now we are quite busy and you have taken more valuable time than i should have given you will there be anything more you wish of me sir uh no sir i suppose not lewrie sagged completely defeated and burning at the unfairness of it the peremptory treatment and the utter shame of it good day to you sir he bowed himself out staggered down the hall down the stairs to the waiting room to gather his boat cloak and reread what seemed a cynical boot up the arse mine arse on a bandbox he muttered bitterly he wasnt even to go near a real naval port hed expected the nore downriver near the mouth of the thames and the medway to chatham perhaps or south to portsmouth and spithead instead he was to report to the regulating captain of the deptford district just below london bridge and the pool of london deptford hard by cheapside greenwich hospital and infamous wapping he seriously doubted if a single whole seaman with any wits about him would be found there after the morrow not after word of a hot press made the rounds i mean if ones going to pressgang at least one could have a post worth the trouble he sighed from what he knew of the nefarious ways of deptford dockyard officials thered be five thousand men with protections by sundown with a pretty sum in those officials pockets too and the wapping landlords the crimps would sell a corpse to a merchant master before theyd ever aid an impress officer navy bribes could never rival civilian dear lord is it too late to catch up with sir george and porker forrester he wondered as he pocketed his hateful orders and went out into the inner courtyard they mightnt be too bad chapter ming arf on a lewrie cursed as he struggled to rise running a tongue over his teeth to see if they were still all there he tasted hot blood copperysalty could almost smell it like the damp winds off the thames get th baftuds he roared to his gang as he got to his feet again knocked down with a fortunately empty chamber pot swung at his head by a desperationcrazed sailor just off a west indies trader it had sounded like a mischievous lark when theyd set out on their raid earlier in the evening surround a ramshackle old lodging house converted to a sailors brothel confer on the sly with the old mother abbess who ran it so she could sell half a dozen or so of her worstpaying customers who had taken the place over as a refuge into the hands of the press creep up on them as they were well engaged with girls passed out drunk or asleep and take them in a welltimed rush eres yer hat sir cony offered phankee cony lewrie attempted to reply bu wheref me head he was only halfjesting as his vision swam split yer lip sir looks worsen hit tis whores were shrieking furniture banging the pairsofstairs thundered ominously making the thin lath and plaster partitions judder like the old pile was about to come down about their ears harsh male voices roared defiance on either side with the occasional cry of a man getting the worst of some encounter truncheons beat a meaty tattoo punctuated by the sound of a door being smashed down a shadow flitted past lewries notice from one of the rooms loomed up in front of him it was a sailor a teenaged topman by his build he gave a great gasp as he realized hed dashed the wrong way skidding to a halt with his mouth open to cry out in th kinf s name lewrie shouted first bringing his truncheon down to thud on the lads shoulder and neck the fellow dropped like a meal sack damme but that felt good lewrie exulted to himself oy min me furnishins yew the mother abbess commanded as she lumbered her bulk up the stairs gawd one o me very baist fackin cheers smashed ahh shut yir gob helena stewpid bitch a spectacularly developed young whore all poonts and angular curves was wailing her head off garbed only in a thin open mans shirt lewrie stopped to judge her performance for a stunned moment clumsy bastits take keer will ee now the bargeshaped mother abbess carped nought woz said bout trashin me place sir fifty poun damages ye done if its a fackin farthin you wished them out maam lewrie commented spitting in a corner to clear his mouth you should have liquored em better fore we came theyd have gone easier liquor em hah the old whoremongress cackled mirthlessly an thaim thout tuppence betwixt em free gin itd been an eyd a got suspaictin helena will ee stop at caterwaulin ye aint hurted hesh heshr ye will be the darkhaired girl hiccuped to sudden silence and leaned on the broken jamb of the door to her grubby little cubicle perhaps because of her mistress harsh glower and her pudgy shaken fist sign of a sound thrashing later perhaps because the sounds of melee diminished at last with only the odd thud now and again or a heartbreaking groan or two of pain ah there ye be sir lewries burly bosuns mate reported as he rumbled down the passageway dragging a squirming sailor under his arm in a headlock got em all we did sir eight hands tgither all prime seamen oh make at nine sir see ye got one too lemme go ya bastard the prime seaman in the headlock hissed i gotta prtection a john compny prtection now whats a west indian trader called the five sisters doing with an east india company protection hmm lewrie smirked and how recently did you buy it wasted your money on a forgery if you did theres no protection covers you face it man youre took fair sir f r gods sake the man wriggled to face him looking much like a beheaded victim under the burly bosuns henrytheeighthish armpit frigate stopped us downchannel soonz we wuz in soundins took twelve hands put eight navy aboard twork her in we anchor in the downs befogged an a nore tender takes nother eight an only lef us four tdo their work an how many volunteered hmm the bosun purred lifting the man almost off his feet forcing him to look up at him awkwardly well half o em th firs time an three th last the seaman confessed sheepishly then found some courage but thatz coz theyd been took no matter an least if ya volunteers ya gets the joinin bounty an yer pay gets squared on th spot see then why not emulate them and volunteer yourself not sneak about lewrie asked him dont you wish to serve your king king george ain off rin twennyfive guineas th man f r a roun voyage sir hoy yer right sir im a volunteer sir much too late f r that the bosun chuckled shaking his whole frame and jiggling the reluctant sailor with him matey he cooed bloody cony whispered under his breath twentyfive guineasl those were royal wages and the war not even barely begun of course it was suspect whether those merchant masters and shipshusbands who offered such royal wages would ever pay up for many were happy to see the navy press their hands before putting in and paying off in some cases they even connived at it with impress officers whod tip them the wink for a bribe and certify that all wages were accounted for up to date of impressment and navy hands had to be put aboard to assure that a ship had enough hands to reach harbour what amounted to free labour it was a wonderful bargain lewrie had a chary eye for the mother abbess of the brothel too twentyfive guineas these last fortunate sailors had pocketed yet now they were so poor they hadnt tuppence betwixt em quim and gin room and board with perhaps more paid the woman to shelter them before five sisters was laden and ready to sail with a midnight dash from whorehouse to the docks at the last minute a fee paid too perhaps for long clothing so they could do their dash without being recognised as sailors and the forged protections and lewrie realised shed just made an additional ninety shillings from his own pocket as the bribe price for revealing them they must have been too noisy demanding or upsetting or had spent too freely too quickly else shed have been glad to have merely stripped them of their last farthing before turning them out her door and waving her fond goodbyes else she might have simply sold them to merchantship crimps for more money there must be some small measure of revenge being exacted if shed stoop to a navy pressgang in wapping any commotion in the streets yet lewrie asked going to the door to helena s squalid little bedchamber and reaching past her for a fairly clean towel with which to dab his damaged lip nary a peep sir the bosun assured him id spect evryone aboutd admire tget a good whorehouse back in service yes it does seem to cater excellent wares lewrie chuckled still looking at helena the girl glanced down fetchingly shy then back up a bolder practiced comehither twinkle to her eyes ere lemme tend yer lip sir helena cooed taking the towel and dipping it in a water basin cant let a fine genlmn suchz yerself leave our house lookin bedraggled can we now get em in irons bosun and well be on our way before the situation and the neighbourhoods mood changes on us lewrie said ya gotta go s quick then sir helena pouted playfully i uhm lewrie sighed it had been six weeks since hed reported for duty at deptford six weeks since caroline had departed for home and the children torn in two by her affections and duties helena was a wonder compared to her drabber sisters in the knockingshop most of whom could only look delectable to men whod been six months onpassage and had no taste to begin with helena was young not over sixteen or so not so coarsened by the trade and and his man cony who had so inexplicably insisted on volunteering in spite of the obvious advantages and comforts anglesgreen afforded him was practically breathing over his shoulder anything cony might see would be sure to find its way to caroline sooner or later and there was the threat of the mob other sailors might see them and drankenly decide to brawl to liberate their fellow tars civilians full of anger or boredom whod raise the hue and cry and set upon them the brutish instruments of oppression by the national government against their local englishmen being enslaved by other englishmen it would be too much and the only voice those prickly pridefully independent locals had was the riot some other time perhaps lewrie promised vaguely tipping his hat to her she curtsied to him quite prettily spreading the bottom hems of her shirt her only garment like the heavy skirts of a ball gown which rewarded him with a disconcertingly pleasant view lets go bosun cony lewrie coughed regretfully come back do the girl whispered as the others preceded him to the stairs reaching out her room to cup his face in her hands and kiss him with a deep if lying passion ant been with a real genlmn not workin ere sir an la id admire ta she teased in a small and throaty tone christ on a crutch he could but moan doubt they spoiled yer beauty lewrie captain lilycrop told him after their surgeons mate had attended his hurt and taken a stitch or two in his upper lip an ye done good service this night dammef ye havent so take cheer the old man comforted offering him an ancient leather tankard full of light brown ale one of the few delights admittedly perhaps the only delight of the impress service was serving under his old captain from the shrike brig again lieutenant lilycrop now a lofty postcaptain had lost a foot and shin at turks island in just weeks before the peace and the end of the american revolution hed lost shrike to lewrie too when admiral hood had appointed him to take her over but hood had also promised to stand patron to the tarryhanded old lilycrop perhaps the oldest and most without patronage commission sea officer in the fleet until that time lilycrops hair was thinner just as cottony white but better dressed these days his pigtailed plaited seamans queue which had hung to his waist was now neatly braided perfectly ribboned a fitting and more fashionably short adjunct to the awesome dignity the old man exuded in his heavily goldlaced captains ironbound coat his breeches waistcoat and shirt front were snowy white not tarry tanned or smudged by shipboard penury he now sported silk stockings one at least an elegant shoe with a solidgold buckle and his old straight heavy dragoon sword had been replaced by an almost gaudy new blade and scabbard and his pegleg was a marvel of ebony wood inlaid with gold and ivory dolphins anchors crossed cannon and sennetlike braidings as intricate as ancient celtic brooches exquisitely tailored he might be but captain lilycrop was still the solid rolypoly pudding with a stomach as round as a fortytwo pounder iron shot and nothing could be done about that toby jug of a phiz all wrinkles and creases though his face was now wracked by good food and drink not sun and sea the same merry brown eyes lurked and gave spark deep within the recesses of snowy brows and apple cheeks the same old lilycrop thank the good lord near thing een so sir lewrie commented rotating his neck and shoulders god what a shitten business the mother abbess old bridey lilycrop snickered rubbing a thumb as thick as a musket barrel alongside his doorknob of a nose well what could she do they were skinteatin th ole mort outa housen homean rogerin like twas their private rooms bridey well lilycrop sighed sitting himself down near lewrie aye i know she looks thick as a bosun an fiercefacedz th master at arms but tis a fearsome trade knew her o old i did just made topman i had lord fourteenr so bout when noah was a quartermasters mate hee hee the old man recounted wistfully first mans pay in me pockets first seamans run ashore no more ships boy an i run inta bridey nother knockinshop no so far from where you an th lads were tnight a rare ole time i had with bridey couldnt o been a quimhair oldern fourteen herself back then oh she was a rare irish beauty all ruddy hair blue eyes and skinz pale an softz cream course lilycrop harumphed remorsefully i was a diff rent sort myself back then too we kept in touch bridey an i so tonight was more a sort of mutual favour sir lewrie inquired she needed prtection i need seamen lilycrop shrugged his assent an i drop by nown again visit her establishment just to keep your hand in sir lewrie snickered though it hurt a bit so tspeak young sir lilycrop wheezed bridey allus did treat her girls bettern most got th handsomest an treated her oldestn best customers tth finest her house has t offer did ye do her much damage some sir nothing too sore i suspect but got her ear tth ground bridey does mister lewrie the old man snorted coming up for air from his ale tankard like a seal blowing foam brideyu be back in business tmorro night but i spect shell come round here all blowin an huffin bout her damages shell demand th crown square it for her make you several attractive offers sir lewrie smirked the smirk was easier on his lip than the fullmouthed grin oh indeed lilycrop beamed like a beatific cherub and sucked air through his teeth in expectation like i say shes some damned handsome quim in her stable oh my yes an a poor ole cripple suchz myself cant do em that much harm th little darlins anyways i spect like i said that shell have more trade f r us ive expense money nough tcover half o her damages an she can make up th overage but shell whisper th name an th address o sevral more bawdy houses an hideaways where seamenre tbe found an put some o her new competitions noses outa joint inta th bargain oh tis a grand busness th impress service lewrie a toppin busness it was for lilycrop at any rate and as regulating captain for the deptford district he didnt have to risk life and limb out in the streets either he had his lieutenants to do the dirty and he was finally making himself in the twilight of his naval career a truly princely living lewrie hadnt dared to probe into another officers affairsa friends affairsbut he had seen lieutenant bracewaights ledgers a few days after reporting for duty theyd shared a brace of wine bottles at their rendezvous tavern where they both lodged and bracewaight he of the missing hand the eyepatch and the wooden dentures had left them open when he jaunted out back for the jakes still carried by the navy pay office as a halfpay officer with a disablement pension plus impress service allowances and subsistences the swarthy swine was making fourteen shillings sixpence per daymore than a senior postcaptain in command of a rd rateand with travel and lodging reimbursed on his own sayso plus the bonuses paidfive shillings for each raw landsman volunteer signed up to ten shillings for each ordinary or able seaman brought in by hook or by crook and lewrie rather doubted if captain lilycrop was maintained per diem in any less fashion or denied any bounties of recruitment so far up until that evening that is lewrie had been spared the sordid side of the press hed run the tender from deptford hard downriver to the nore full of hopeful innocents or gloomy experienced seamen hed set up shop to assist the other officers at rendezvous taverns up and down the river the horse groom at lambeth marsh the kings head at rotherhithe and the black boy trumpet at st katherines stairs theyd lay on music hornpipes beat the drum and go liberally with rum and ale his gang was half a dozen swaggering jolly jacks trueblue hearts of oak as gay and mehearty as any gullible young calfhead could wish for they were full of a fund of stories chanties japes and cajolery enough cajolery that many disappointed landsmen many a young lad had enlisted and real tarryhanded tarpaulin men experienced sailors had joined the navy during those recruiting parties like the men pressed at sea off the five sisters they at least had a chance to claim the joining bounty and go with a pack of their old shipmates instead of being shoved into just any old crew they might return to a warship theyd served in before with an officer they trusted navy work might not pay as high as merchant but the crews were much larger so the labour was shared out in smaller dollops the food was regulated in quantity and quality and in the navy at least they could complain within reasonable bounds if it wasnt and there was the liberal rum issue too and there was the excitement the danger and the glamour of it all for sailors and landlubbers alike for many it was a means of escaping their dreary existence boredom played a part as did failure at trade or domestic service as did poverty for many farm labourers enlisting in the navy meant freedom from the narrowness of rural life the mindless drudgery the uncertain nature of putting food in ones bellyand the uncertain nature of the food itself and more than a few volunteers were running away from shrewish wives demanding sweethearts they hoped to jilt too many children at their ankles or lasses turning up ankled and suing for marriage well perhaps the impress had more than a few sordid sides alan had to admit at those same jolly recruiting fairs hed seen masters connive to offer up their apprentices to ship them off to sea so they would be spared the expense of feeding and clothing them then register their indentures at the navy pay office so they could draw off the impressed apprentices pay hed seen rivals in love or those selfsame jilted young girls get their own back by whispering the location of a prime hand unhappy wives could find a way to pack off the brute who beat them once too often relations usually inlaws could rescue their familys good name and their daughter or niece from a marriage or engagement to someone unsuitable if he was sound enough to man the tops of a fighting ship or pulleyhauley in the waist and there were the lads bastards like himself whod proved to be an embarrassment putative fathers would bring them round tip the recruiting officer the wink and leave them gamely weeping as future cabin servants powdermonkeys or landsmen mothers who had too many mouths to feed as it was widows who might get their new man to marry if the brat was gone or wives who wished to dally without testimony from sons to unwitting or absent husbands and fathers and there were the raids on taverns brothels and lodgings like the one theyd pulled that night that took a different gang with no need for jolly jacks and mehearty trueblue hearts of oak cudgels of oak more like the brutal fact was that there were a myriad of landsmen but no surplus of seamen and it took at least a third to a half of a crew of a warship to be made up of seamen if she had a hope of getting to sea and surviving once shed made her offing englishmen would not tolerate conscription for any military service that smacked of brutal central government oppression the only way left was the press and only seamen were liable to be pressed supposedly though many innocent civilians caught in the wrong place at the wrong time were swept into the tenders yet the press was so opposed by local magistrates and the courts deluged with wrongfultaking suits the impress service so thinly manned that they could never sweep the streets as the publics popular image held it had to be done with craft and guile with stealth and speed in the dead of night so you expect another raid soon sir lewrie asked at last tmorro night id wager soonz bridey whispers a few words in me shelllike ear hee hee

vowed to smoke out bracewaight at the first opportunity and write yet another pleading weekly letter to the admiralty chapter old bridey the mother abbess must have had decades of hard begrudgements to work off or far costlier damage done to her establishment for the next few days and nights were filled with raids the impress service dealt with deserters both those who ran deliberately and stayed away and those who straggled there were some whod run intent upon lifelong escape from navy service and there were some who volunteered over and over again collecting the joining bounty then taking legbail to enlist under another alias their raids netted about a dozen of the worst offenders and put the fear of capture in many others then there were the stragglers these were seamen who had missed their ships departure gone on unsanctioned runs ashore on a whim gone adrift from working parties intent on a stupendous drunk a mindless rut with no thought for the morrow or longterm sailors with good records whod been granted shore leave but had been robbed or otherwise delayed who had a mind to rejoin and were anxious to go back aboard hands didnt exactly join the national war effort didnt sign up to fight for king and country they wanted to be aboard and gave their primary loyalty to specific ships and crews fellows from the same neighbourhood or village the same shire friends or people they felt comfortable with and the impress service was their clearinghouse men whod been put ashore sick or hurt into greenwich hospital but had recovered they were particularly vulnerable for they owned pay certificates or solid coin for once and there were many jobbers and sharks who preyed upon them to buy up their certificates for a pittance then turn them in at the pay office for full value and get the released hospitallers drank penniless and desperate desperate enough to fear returning to the fleet and sign aboard a merchantman or privateer so some of their raids were in the nature of rescue missions to reclaim those befuddled men before worse befell them the navy getting its own back tonight it was to be deserters the genuine articles this time not stragglers and the gang was the round dozen of the toughest of hands true deserters would face punishment and would fight like a pack of badgers to stay free their hideout was above an allnations a dramshop serving a little bit of everything at the back of a winding mews of dockyard warehouses it was a mean and narrow building dwarfed by the height of the warehouses hard up against a blank brick wall which separated it from one of the worst bermudas of wapping a slum so gruesome and crimeridden and its lanes and alleys so convoluted that their escape from any threat would be assured if they had warning one door art th back sir the crimp whispered in lewries ear his breath as foul as rotting kelp windersz bricked up cept fer thatun ye cn see winder tax he shrugged but id spect ey got em one jus boarded over bove th wall sir how lilycrop or bridey had talked the crimp into aiding them lewrie could not fathom crimps usually were in competition with the press the navy had to use their own gangs for locals stood a fair chance of being found beaten to a pulp or dead if they were spotted helping round up people for the navy the old mother abbess lewrie decided leaning away to escape the stench must know where he buried the body took his clothes too no doubt the crimps body odour was if anything even more loathsome than his breath he smelled like a corpses armpit down to the end of the mews bosun lewrie instructed after giving it a long look two hands atop the wall either side of their bolthole window youve placed two more at the back entrance aye sir snuck round ahind th warehouses one to stop the front door once we smash in no need f r at sir the crimp muttered producing a sack of tinny clanking objects from within his greasy coat you have a key lewrie goggled manner o speakin like the crimp chuckled softly thumbing through a set of picks and tiny prylevers selecting them by feel in the dark foggy gloom best locks on th shop side not th stairs door been in afore i has an nary a drapd i get th knacky ol whoreson lets go then lewrie murmured changing his grip on his truncheon they flattened themselves against the front of the warehouses vague darker shadows in the night in single file alan gave the dramshop another squint as they got closer there was one door to the alley offset to the left of the storefront and the window or bulkhead bay that formed the majority of the narrow buildings face was tightly sealed by large barred shutters i gets is lock topm sir the crimp informed him in a gay professional afterthought eys a door tth right ats th shop pairostairs onna lef thats yr pigeon sir up yell fly ill be waitin backit th corner ah thas me darlin he wheezed as rusty tumblers clicked a light thumb on the latch and it was open wait the crimp drew out a small flask of oil and atomized the hinges of the door with as much loving care as a woman might to apply her favourite most alluring scent on yr own now sir the crimp bowed and lightfooted his way to the far end of the alley farthest from observation well creep far as we may men lewrie ordered first sign of alarm though we go like blazes lanterns hooded til i give the word right they slunk into stygian blackness feeling softly with toes for the first step of the riser groping for a railing that was not there and measuring the height of the subsequent steps and their depth one cautious tread at a time nine men including lewrie his bosun and cony all trying to breathe to climb as silently as possible though to alans ears they made as much noise as a like number of grunting rasping hogs in that narrow airless passage lewrie held up one hand to warn his gang to pause for a moment so he could listen he thought he heard soft murmurings a snatch of throaty laughter from above unfortunately his men couldnt even see their hands in front of their own faces much less his so all he did was bunch them up to a chorus of grunts subdued yelps of surprise of awkward feet thunked on creaking boards and the thud of truncheons on the peeling plaster walls hoy wazzat came a cry from above go lewrie screamed almost on his hands and knees to grope upward quickly lanterns go there was a hint of light so he could espy a tiny landing and an array of doors at the top of the steep stairs one of them opened a crack spilling more light right ahead of him lewrie scrabbled to his feet and dove for the door crashing into it before the people behind it could close and lock it he stumbled through at waist level avoiding the slash of a jackknife above his head before the assailant could slash again he was brought down by a truncheon smashing on his arm the knife dropped from his numb fingers in the kings name lewrie howled lunging at the startled young sailor on the cot before him he used his truncheon like a pike to knock the breath from the lad and curl him up like a singed worm around his bruised stomach gasping for air there was more ruckus from the center room as its denizens discovered that their escape route through the boardedup window which let onto the stews was filled with pressgang hands jeezms the bosun exclaimed with disgust bloody got these sir cony told him christ lewrie turned about taking his eyes off the younger sailor for a moment his assailant was knelt on the floor against the wall near a wardrobe cony and two more hands were already binding him in irons oh he was a sailor no doubt about it tattooed and sunbaked a ring in his ear in sign hed survived a sinking sometime in his past and as grizzled and stocky as a longtime bosuns mate his clothes were sailors short clothing and pursers slopsthough the man was now barearsed nude still sporting the remains of a prodigious cockstand oh bloody lewrie muttered as he grasped the situation he turned back to the younger sailor and ripped the filthy linen sheet away from him he too was naked please sir the lad whimpered looking up with pleading in his large doelike eyes except for the usual ruddy sailors tan he was pretty pretty as some biddable young miss please sir he begged again almost fluttering his lashes in hopes he could stir pity warn wot ya think sir i swears it warn my fault sir a goddamned sodomite lewrie almost gagged don take me sir theyd flog me somethin awful theyd hang me sir im a good topman sir see aint never been flogged aint been no trouble board ship sir he reached out in supplication tears rolling unashamedly down his face and lewrie flinched back from his touch fended him off with the truncheon don never mess board ship sir the young seaman began to blubber an won never appen agin sir won do hit no more i swears it fell in wif bad compny sir run outa money an an i needed money sir drink an bad companions sir sir irons here lewrie barked snapping his fingers for his men oh please mates don do hit ill go back swears i will aint no trouble wif me messmates aint no mate of yern ya bugger one of the gang growled as he advanced with a set of fetters old still now rrdssyl lewrie stumped stifflegged from the chamber onto the landing peeking into the other rooms for confirmation he had not only stumbled onto a nest of deserters hed stepped right into a proper dungheap no wonder theyd run he thought sodomy was one of the few of the thirtysix articles of war besides murder and mutiny the navy really did hang people for gawd sir his bosun spat aint just deserters this here be a boyfuckers buttockshop center room sir musta been seven r eight o th things tgither when we busted in as evilzanythin not all of em seamen though mister lewrie dramshop owner ez one too caught im in th front room we did had im a lad in ere no biggern me youngest boy tommy th bastard two of emz ships boys an a coupla genlmenl lewrie took a look in the front room it was much larger than the other two chambers part bedchamber and parlour and quite well furnished compared to the rest a chubby old reprobate sat unmanacled on the edge of the high bedstead trying to cover part of his nudity by shrouding his groin with his hands wideeyed and highbrowed and striving to appear as sheepishly innocent as a dog might caught licking the sunday roast but cowering up by the pile of pillows weeping fit to bust was a cherub of a boy not over ten years old that suetarse was buggering that boyv lewrie demanded pears he wuz sir in bed with im nakedz adam anyways you misconstrue sir the harmlesslooking old bugger began to explain shaking his head as if it was a very tiny silly mistake i can assure you sir you see save it lewrie snapped tell it to the magistrate the man gasped paling with dread hauled before a court on a charge of sodomy hed face hanging for his peculiar tastes a public whipping then days festering in the stocks on display as his most hopeful prospect but subject to the taunts fruit stones and physical abuse of the mob and few survived that either didn cuff im yet sir bein a civiliann all the bosun commented the press had been sued before for even laying hands on civilians no matter how briefly and the bosun was a cautious and experienced impress man tother buggerz in ere sir alan stomped to the door of the center chamber there he saw what he could only construe as the aftermath of a backgammoners orgy cheap low beds lined the walls feather mattresses and blankets stood service for the carpet the room reeked of spilled rum gin brandy and ale several candles guttered in the corners so the participants might take pleasure in observing between bouts even by that guttery light lewrie could pick out several seamen and a pair of snotnosed shivering ships boys from the pastyskinned maggotpale civilians one of the civiliansagain unfetteredhad hurriedly dressed his clothes were elegant and expensivesilks and satins finecut figured velvet coat and breeches expensive shoes the accoutrements of a courtly salon slug and a courtiers smug airs i am a gentleman sir he began with a sneer at discovering an officer to whom he could complain i am a civilian i am not nor have i ever been a sailor sir therefore you have no authority over me and i insist you let me pass at once but you are a bugger aint you lewrie countered what if we just call for the charlies and hold you til a magistrate comes you would not dare sir the slim young courtier simpered no magistrate would sanction the press in his domain sir even were he aware of your presence which awareness i most sincerely doubt the man shot back sure of his ground show me your warrant sir or confess that your actions this evening have no sanction damme lewrie groaned a bloody sea lawyer and no we dont have a warrant to show thats why we were successful tonight word couldnt get out and the streets about werent warned to expect us i see the slim aristocrat purred in triumph so it will be impossible for you to detain me dye see nor summon any local authorities pon me nor hold me gainst my will you alone have authority to detain to lay hands upon me sir but your writ does not extend to your minions and your bullybucks have already laid hands upon me striven to prevent me from dressing or departing that constitutes of itself a wrongfultaking for which you and you alone are liable before a court of justice sir he was singsonging with glee damme hes well versed too damn his eyes and i feel it my obligation to caution you sir that i am from a most influential and powerful city family with a circle of friends far more powerful than are yours id expect with legal assistance far beyond your miserable purse you are in difficulties enough already detain me a moment longer and whatever befalls you will be a greater measure of chastisement than ever you might imagine now let me pass i say he has me by the short hairs lewrie gloomed to himself all he had said was true he could be bound up in court for months oh the admiralty would pay his legal expenses bail him out of debtors prison if he lost the judgment and if the fop demanded a huge settlement but hed be out thousands over the matter and he couldnt risk losing every farthing he had you speak for the others too i take it lewrie found spirit enough to sneer in return my dear sir i care little for any but myself the man confessed gaily these sailors are properly in your limited jurisdiction they and the rest well it was dull sport after all i will take my manservant yonder and depart should you have no objections get out lewrie grumbled at last get out and be damned to you you adieu the elegant young bugger smirked making a leg and sweeping his showy egretfeathered hat across his breast bonne nuit though not you will understand au revoir nestce pas sufferin lewrie sighed slamming his truncheon into his palm over and over as the courtier and his shivering man departed aye at stinks sir the bosun muttered sourly nothin ye could do else not with th likes o himl he left one of em behind at any rate lewrie observed as he walked deeper into the orgy chamber to gaze down upon an unconscious form huddled hard up against a cot well atuncutupabitrough e did mister lewrie hadta bash im a goodun gawd ese pore tykes just babes some of em wish we could go fore a magistrate local parish might take em in set em right fore they gets buggery in their blood this parish lewrie scoffed still squirming over his defeat what could they do already irish bogtrotter poor full of future victims cant have boy brothels in rich parishes like that sneerin shit just left prays the loudest in his family pew id wager and plays upright for all to see cant take his sort of pleasure in a good parish but thats what the east end is for aint it and i should know lewrie shrugged in wry selfawareness in my early days i was all over the east end whores drury lane to cheapside least they were girlsl and i paid well full value and more what say we let ese littlest beggars go mister lewrie the bosun almost begged coupla cabin boys eir sortd not be missed f r long no with smany volunteers we take em in sir all they get is caned then discharged anyways tother tykes well aye bosun turn em out lewrie decided unable to look the quivering fearful children in the eyes tonguelash before they go though put some fear o god in em but we take the rest with us aye aye sir lewrie went to the last unconscious civilian by the cot he rolled him over with his foot hoping for signs that he might yet be a seaman subject to impressment and his pitifully weak writ well damme he gasped as if butted in the solar plexus it had been years if it was a day that last bitterly cold morning when the naval captain and his brute of a coxswain had come for him in his fathers house in st james to drag him off as an unwilling midshipman there lying at his feet in enforced repose was the bane of his adolescent life even with a trickle of blood at the corner of his mouth a livid bruise on his cheek and blood matted in his lank sweaty blond hair the bastard appeared to be sneering in truncheoninduced sleep no there was no mistaking the railthin haughty thoroughly despicable face of his half brother gerald willoughby his backgammoning windwardpassagepreferring buttfucking sodomite molly of a half brother oh god thankee just alan whispered with sudden gleehow many nights hed swung in his hammock aboard ariadne his first ship with silent tears of rage coursing his cheeks wasting all that precious sleep with schemes of revenge on all who had connived to push him off a hopeless clueless victim to sea his father for alans inheritance hed hoped to steal their solicitor pilchard whod forged and swindled in the cause his icily beautiful half sister belinda whod lured him to her bed so he could be discovered raping her even the parish vicar whod been duped into being witness to his alleged crime most especially this taunting cruel sneering troublemaking backstabbing lying canting sneaking arrogant swine lewries ardour had at last cooled though he had relished news of them by off for the bahamas hed almost put them out of mind he did learn though that pilchard had been arrested long before for forgery theft and huge debt and if he hadnt done a newgate hornpipe on the gallows then he was a prime candidate for the first convoy to new south wales now england had once more a place for those doomed to be transported for life belinda their mutual fatherd robbed her and gerald of their dead mothers inheritance too run through every penny and hadnt got his hands on alans so theyd been turned out penniless hed heard she made her living on her back hed even seen her listed in the new gentlemans guide to covent garden whores a highpriced courtesan in the latest edition gerald well they didnt publish guides for what he did he had survived after a fashion toadying fawning conniving and scheming to ingratiate himself with every member of his peculiar tribe in london to sponge off others largesse so he could still make a grand show about town in the latest fashion in the best circles as long as he allowed other men of his stripe to ride him lewrie almost giggled as he took in how low gerald had fallen in the years since hed last heard of him a stupendous comedown if this establishment was the best he could afford to frequent or the meanest strait hed been reduced to as a market for his fading wares getting buggered for sixpence instead of guineas there was a carefully folded pile of civilian long clothing he took to be geralds lewrie knelt to examine them he still sported silk stockings yes but they were raveled above the knees and darned where theyd run his shirt boasted a puffy lace jabot but the rest which the waistcoat would hide was a faded muchmended horror from a ragpickers barrow the seat of his pale blue velvet breeches was worn shiny his onceelegant satin waistcoat had patches of bullion and silver embroidery missing and his hat gerald had been rather keen on fashionable hats geralds winecoloured beaver was greasy with too much past sweat table oils hair dressing and stained by overlong exposure to the elements alan poked about until he found geralds carefully hidden purse a wornbare figuredsilk poke it held a mere two shillings eleven pence prompted by past remembrance he dug into a cracked shoe delving into geralds favourite hideyhole and found a single crown and this was the toplofty bastard whod feared going out of an evening unless he could sport at least fifty pounds hed thought it ungentlemanly lewrie stood up suddenly as the lank bastard groaned and rolled his head exposing teeth grayed by the mercury cure for pox he spun on his heel and fled the room before gerald awoke bosun he called trying to keep his rising malevolent grin in check bosun tatnall sir that worthy grunted seems to me theres nought we may do to shut this horror down nothing official that is but alan began biting his cheek burn hit tth groun sir thatd suit tatnall scowled probably a dozen more like it in spitting distance but we could do some real good this night even so lewrie went on cant stay open without its owner or its star performer up yonder lewrie joshed almost elbowing the man in confidential camaraderie do you not think that old tripesandtrullibubs would make a fine volunteer bosun once you convince him that joinings a sight better than being hanged for a bugger oh aye sir tatnall agreed heartily an if th bugger tries is ways board ship theyll flay at maggoty flesh off n is bones cut a feller softz im like fresh cheese ey would sir pity about that shop door below too bosun when we left it it was locked but tis a rough location after all pity some criminals from the stew broke in and drank him dry oh aye sir tatnall concurred again a hellish pity ill speak to that crimp of ours he must have friends whod savour a bottle or two lewrie snickered take our deserters and the owner to the tender ill deal with our crimp and catch you up later ill see to em sir never ya fear and i wonder if that crimp knows where a good tattoo artist may be found this time o night lewrie wondered to himself hellish happy with the evenings outcome after all bound and gagged blindfolded both muffled and disguised by a filthy sheet gerald willoughby could but grunt squeal and attempt to curse as the tattooist plied his skills at brideys knockingshop the old drab had bales of castoff slopclothing to garb gerald in and the crimp delighted in his smart newly exchanged gentlemans togs the tattooist did complain though as he laboured over geralds pale hairless and shallow chest as the whores hooted encouragement to him at the poor state of his canvas at the bootblacking he had to use at the weak light and the watching crowd as he strove to complete his masterpiece it was rather good though considering how gerald behaved how violently he struggled against every quill prick the liberal tots they poured down his maw the rum won out towards the end his thrashings abated and he rambled gagged snatches of song before his lights at last went out and he began to snore and once he was thoroughly comatose lewrie the chuckling crimp and their unwitting accomplice will cony delivered gerald willoughby esquire into the gentle ministrations of the deptford district press tender there to sleep off his monumental drunkthere to be sweetly wafted downriver to the nore as an impressed sailorthere to awaken with a shriek of horror to a new me and trade lewrie was mortal certain gerald no longer had a single influential or fashionable patron who might spring to his aid so there could be no hope of rescue from without and from within gerald garbed in slopclothing and sporting an especially fine though new chest tattoo of a ropefouled anchor listed as taken by an impress officer by the name of bracewaight could protest until his face turned blue that he wasnt a sailor to no avail whatsoever no his only hope of escape would be to declare himself for what he was but once pressed he fell under the harsh strictures of the articles of war most especially article the twentyninth if any person in the fleet shall committ the unnatural and detestable sin of buggery or sodomy with man or beast he shall be punished with death by the sentence of a court martial oh it would be a fine and manly though austere life gerald would be entering lewrie thought smugly wind rain the perils of the sea foul food rancid reeks stern discipline days aloft on the yards dependent on fickle footholds the risks of battle flogging and the weeks and months spent cheektojowl with hundreds of fit healthy lithe young men cooped up on the gun decks swaying in a narrow hammock with not one whit of privacyliving as celibate an existence as so many damned monks or else of course ill heu miseros nostrum natosque pateresque hacine nos animae faciles rate nubila contra mittimur alas for those of us with fathers or sons alive is this the ship in which we thoughtless souls are sent forth in the face of a clouded sky valerius flaccus argonautica book chapter post nubilaphoebus cony lewrie informed his man my thought for the day after cloudssunshine iff n ya say so sir cony replied trying to shelter under a scrap of canvas in the bumboat as portsmouth harbour seethed at the lash of a sullen april rain shower bare days after his antic over his half brother gerald there had at last come a packet from the admiralty perhaps rearadmiral sir george sinclair had turned his toes up or sailed perhaps some rumour of garveys past dealings in the bahamas had come to light at last or more likely perhaps his and captain lilycrops almost weekly letters to far and near had become such a nuisance to some overworked clerk whatever lieutenant alan lewrie rn was ordered to make his way to portsmouth instanter and report aboard the cockerel frigate a gunned vessel of the th rate currently fitting out as her first officer even the gloom of a drizzly day could not dampen his appreciation of his new ship as they neared her nor could spume mist nor rain detract from cockerels aggressively angular and martial appearance her lower hull above the waterline was a glossy ebony as were her bulwarks her gunwales were however buffcoloured and gleamed with the sheen of prized ivory slickened by the rain the yards on her three towering masts were neatly squared away of a golden buff from linseed oil or fresh paint where the wooden spars were bared to the gloom courses topsls royals and t gallants all in perfect alignment with each other aspan the decks and lift lines tugged until each spar lay perfectly horizontal and not a brace parrel halliard or jear hung slack not a clew brail or lift line varied from purposeful straightline perfection there were touches of red and gilt about the transom and the taffrails the quartergalleries windows and ports and the lanterns aft there was lavish gilt about the entry port and what lewrie could espy of the figurehead an irate wingfanning rooster wearing a golden fillet crown and the beakhead rails was liberally coated with gilt paint as well shiny as a newminted guinea lewrie muttered to himself as he marveled how devilishhandsome she appeared as if she was fresh from the builders yardor she had a captain who possessed a dukes purse to bring her from inordinary idle seediness to a state worthy of a royal yacht her captain had been named in lewries orders as one howard braxton but with no the honourable sir howard or aristocratic title attached to his name and naval rank which indicated inherited wealth perhaps cockerel had been captained by one so rich and had been turned over to braxton entire he speculated cockerel was supposed to be fitting out yet to lewries eyes at last and grudgingly experienced with such matters the frigates bristol fashion orderliness bespoke a warship ready at that instant to set sail thankee god lewrie smirked to himself with relief you surely know what a lazy bastard i am less work for me my first weekr so ha ha shes better fitted out than any ever i did see boat ahoy there came a shout from the entry port aye aye cony bellowed back shucking his sailcloth cover and lewrie shrugged his boat cloak over his shoulders to expose his uniform cony held up fingers to clue the harbour watch to the requisite number of sideboys needful to the dignity of a first officers welcome aboard despite the rain lewrie undid the chain about his neck and folded the boat cloak for cony to tend to so he could go aboard unencumbered by anything that could trip him up or embarrass his first appearance before his new crew he tucked his hanger to the back of his left hip and halfrose off the thwart ariadne lewrie thought vexed by the memory of his very first boarding of being dunked chestdeep nigh drowned by the puzzles of slimy boarding battens algaeslick manropes and a ship rolling her guts out thankfully there was little breeze and cockerel lay still as a patient old hacking mare gentle enough for a lady to ride manropes threaded through the outer ends of the battens were redpainted twoinch manila taut as shrouds in the mainmast chains deadeyes and he noted with relief someone thoughtful had ordered fresh tar on the battens reinforced with gritty sand to make a secure foothold he scampered up lithely inclining a bit towards the entryport as the tumblehome of the ships side retreated inward to lessen the weight of tophamper and spar deck above her artillerys monstrous mass his hat drew level with the entryport lip as the bosuns pipes began to shrill marines slapped muskets and stamped their feet sideboys lifted their hats and a marine sergeant and a navy officer flourished halfpike or sword respectively as he arrived lewrie gained the starboard gangway stepping far enough inboard so a sudden roll wouldnt sling him back where hed come from and doffed his own hat alan lewrie come aboard to join sir he announced trying to quash his sudden joy welcome aboard sir the navy officer said in greeting as he swept his sword down spun it overhand with a practiced fillip and resheathed it allow me to name myself sir lieutenant lewrie i am barnaby scott third lieutenant if hed said his name was eric the red lewrie would have considered it more apt barnaby scott looked more like an ancient viking raider albeit a cleanshaven one his body was thick and square saved from brute commonness by his height which was about two inches more than lewries wideshouldered thickchested bluff and hearty as a professional boxer scotts hair was pale blond almost frizzy and only loosely drawn back into a seamans queue that more resembled a horsetail that badly needed teazeling his complexion was deeply tanned though sporting ruddier colour on nose cheeks and forehead and his eyes were a disconcertingly penetrating watery blue mister scott good morrow to you sir lewrie smiled taking his hand which more resembled a bear paw for a hearty shake there was no choice about that scott did the pumping and you come aboard sir as scott inquired cocking one suddenly wary blond eyebrow first officer mister scott thank bloody christ sir and very welcome aboard lieutenant scott beamed of a sudden and almost mangled lewries hand with fresh vigour our captain is aboard is he mister scott lewrie asked glad to get his hand back at last with all the requisite fingers aye sir captain braxton is aft in the greatcabins mister spendlove scott called over his shoulder without looking aye aye sir a tiny midshipman chirped as he popped up from nowhere escort mister lewrie our new first officer aft so he may announce himself to the captain aye aye sir the fourteenyearold piped almost bobbing in eagerness or relief lewrie wondered what made his arrival such a joyous occasion ill see to getting your chest aboard sir lieutenant scott offered just steer my man cony the right direction mister scott he turned to follow the boy to the quarterdeck ladders which led below from the sailtending gangways to the gun deck another hand then bloody good scott beamed cracking his palms together with satisfaction cockerel like all modern frigates was flushdecked her after fourth was a bare and functional quarterdeck with no accommodations in a poop cabin it was broken only by the after capstan heads the base of the mizzenmast a double wheel compass binnacle chart table and traverse board aft of that and guns there were signalflag lockers rightaft by the taffrail and a long coach top a skylight which fed sun and air below to that worthys greatcabins between after hatch and the wheel on either beam bowsed up to the low bulwarks were pieces of artillery two long sixpounders and two shorterbarreled twentyfourpounder carronades in both larboard and starboard batteries cockerels gun deck proper stretched feet from bow to stern with the bulk of it exposed to the sky in the waist between the focsle and the greatcabins there her main armament nestedtwentysix twelvepounder guns with some aft in the captains quarters unlike larger twodecked ships of the line her officers and men did not sleep idle or sup jammed between the artillery frigates had a second lower deck confusingly named gun deck below the gun deck proper for accommodations with hands forrud marines aft of them and the commission and warrant officers right aft under the captain in the wardroom a frigates captain was the only person to reside on the true gun deck in solitary splendour of the greatcabins which were as large as the entire wardroom tiny midshipman spendlove announced lewrie to the marine sentry on guard without the entry door underneath the overhang of the quarterdecks forward edge the marine hitched a deep breath and banged the butt of his brown bess musket on the oak planks then shouted out just what and whom dared interrupt their captains musings come a laconic voice was heard from within lewrie entered hat and orders under his left arm in past the chartroom to starboard and a roomy and inviting dining coach which lay to larboard rich with waxed and varnished table bulkheads and beams on a gleaming sideboard there were coinsilver lamps and teathings ornate highly polished brass accoutrements much like what he had seen in calcutta or canton the dish service was oriental too he took in the usual blackandwhite chequered sailcloth which covered the deck of the day cabin in lieu of formal tiles and several carpets laid atop it hed seen their like before as well there were intricately figured trellispatterned hindoo and bokhara all red and gold and black and a few pale green beige or pale yellow chinee carpets with their enigmatic glyphs in their centers to starboard was a seating area made up of fancyfiligreed chippendalechinese chairs and a real sofa with ecru silk fabric and side tables and bookcases of gleaming teak a large square glossy black construct he took for a wine cabinet lightly sketched over with pale gilt scenes for a moment he thought he was back in a traders hong in canton or his fathers luxurious grand moghul of a palacebungalow in calcutta yes his new captain prompted at last with some irritation sir lewrie harumphed drawing his wits back to the matter at hand ending his perusal and rapid valuation of his new lord and masters private digs lieutenant alan lewrie sir reporting aboard i see captain braxton sighed sounding a bit putupon and you are to be my new first aye sir i am captain braxton was seated to larboard behind a heavy teak work desk all scrollwork and leaving inlaid with ivory chips in a tree of life pattern round the top of the outwardfacing sides and around the edges of the top surface braxton rose careful not to smash his head on the overhead deck beams those beams every exposed wood surface in his cabins whether permanent structural members or temporary partitions were highly unseeded and waxed where paint did show it was a pleasing restful beige and the traditional blood red bulwarks below the wainscotting were done in a brighterthannavy fiery chinee red too against that the squat black iron twelvepounders seemed drab braxton was about lewries height in his middle forties he estimated his hair was so very curly short and iron grey that alan at first thought he wore a powdered tiewig his queue was very short no lower than the bottom of his collar for his age braxton appeared remarkably fit and only just the slightest tad stocky most captains in their senior years once they had gained purses to match their appetites thickened about the waist braxton seemed to have avoided that your orders sir he demanded creating two deep vertical ruts between his thick bushy brows take a pew do mister lewrie alan sat down in one of the comfortable armchairs before the desk turning to keep a wary eye on braxton as he paced the cabins and read to himself his face kept those vertical ruts making alan wonder if he always looked so dyspeptic and ill at ease the captain possessed a long square face with a thin though jutting chin his nose was a weather vane large and narrow his eyes were on the small side however and set rather close slightly downturned and his mouth was downturned too to the left side as he spoke at last served in the far east i see mister lewrie aye sir two years dont recall telesto braxton sniffed dismissively calcutta canton pon my word i dont held command of an east indiaman tween the wars spent years out there dye see i wondered sir lewrie smiled hoping to ingratiate himself when i saw your cabin furnishings well it rather took me back if you get my meaning sir only a china handd appreciate yes yes braxton cut him off john company captain were you lewrie thought gad tis no wonder cockerels so well appointed those buggers make ј for the round voyage and thats the legal sort little speculation in opium and such skys the bloody limit praps well get on together then braxton continued still frowning though navy board mustve taken my experience and yours into account for once damn fools as if they intended cockerel to serve in the far east sir lewrie stated striving to cover his sudden qualms oh bloody jesus is that why they off to all those damn plagues an shit again i doubt theyve that much sense braxton snorted with derision as he came back to his desk flung lewries orders atop it and took a seat indian ocean china seas full tthe brim with frogs and their proxies half the princes chink or hindi eager to revolt but considerin the admiraltys poor parcel of collective wit sir well i more expect were off to nova scotia beyond orders to outfit and man ive no word yet where were bound i see sir lewrie replied evenly though with a great deal of relief says youve had independent commands aye sir i trust you didnt develop any bad habits mister lewrie such as getting so used to doing things your own way you cant cope with an order braxton all but sneered not at all sir that was the last fellows problem why he didnt last under me i will not have my orders questioned ever ill tell you straightaway lewrie ive captained a kings ship captained indiamen before you were breeched i expect i will be obeyed hear me of course sir alan agreed by rote though mystified i run a taut ship sir braxton informed him officers and men no matter ill brook no dumb insolence no insubordination i give a command an order i expect em to be carried out to my satisfaction instantly cant abide being secondguessed no schoolboys debatin society no sir not for me not from you not from anyone as first lieutenant youre my voice my eyes my whip if it comes to it is that clear sir well absolutely sir lewrie said with half a grin those all go pretty much without saying in the fleet good braxton nodded relaxing a bit good then might i inquire how long cockerel has been in commission sir lewrie asked eager to get on more mundane matters six weeks braxton shot back sounding as if he was boasting yet scowling as if it were one of hercules twelve labours and no thanks to that incompetent fool mylett your predecessor dye see slack idle cunnythumbed as a raw landsman how he ever gained his commission i cannot fathom could have been done in four sir four weeks i tell you were it not for his dumb insolence his belabouring of evry matter his idiocy theres a war on but lieutenant mylettd not be stirred to energetic action and obstreperous with me to my evry instruction like it was peacetime hah i must say though shes another thing ill tell you straightaway mister lewrie the captain grumbled like far off broadsides it is my wish nay my abiding order that cockerel distinguish herself in evry instance sailhandling gunnery stationkeeping in action should it come our lot cockerel shall be the most efficient command in the fleet or ill crush those who fail her like cockroaches and the ones who fail me dye see sir aye aye sir lewrie all but gulped at braxtons almost fanatical devotion damme he thought dont think im going to enjoy this she will be the triggest vessel the cleanest the best her captain announced with righteous heat her crew the keenest officers the most unerring and watchful or ill know the reason why aye aye sir shes full of raw landsmen idlers and waisters pressed and turnedover hands her professionals ve spent too long inordinary too long swinging round the best bowerrode at peacetime slackness frankly mister lewrie therere people aboard commission and warrant who need hard stirring theyve set too long like treacle mister scott that burly popinjay frankly sir therere men aboard need afire lit under their fundaments too few upon whom i may completely rely i trust you will be one of those sir indeed i do braxton leaned over his desk intently im certain you may sir we shall see wont we braxton smiled of a sudden relaxing and turning cheery for the nonce get yourself settled in make the rounds get to know the senior people youll find my order book in your cabin unless mylett added theft to his long list of crimes you will find my ways demanding sir but they are my ways and they work as for our needs concerning hands and such i strongly adjure you to get on good terms with our second officer he stood in as acting first lieutenant the last week i d hoped well if cockerel is nearcomplete in her recommissioning you have his efforts to thank for it once we discovered what a total disaster mylett was youll find his insights more than useful i see sir lewrie temporised too damn right hed toe the line and walk small about his new captain but defer to a junior officer not bloody likely will that be all for now sir hmm aye i spose so then i will take my leave sir lewrie announced getting to his feet and almost cracking his unwary skull open on the deck beam directly over his chair bit out of practice alan shrugged turning crimsonly abashed civilian overheads hey sir hmmmm braxton gave him a second more searching appraisal and frowned as if he didnt much care for what he saw alan gained the quarterdeck relishing the cool brisk dampness of the winds upon his overheated face he knew that captains in the royal navy came in a myriad of forms and most of those eccentric but braxton was a new form in his experience and he was almost relieved to have escaped unscathed so far what a codsheads error he sighed to himselfconking myself addlepated on a deck beam like a raw whipjack midshipman which thoughts made him wonder just how rusty and treacly he really was after four years on halfpay and what had ever possessed him to thirst for a sea commission it was lewries curse to be burdened with a touch more selfawareness and introspection than the runofthemill sea officer he knew his faults they were legion predominant among them was a fear that he would be found wanting someday that his swaggering reputation far exceeded the competence upon which such a tarry odour should be based that he was a thinly disguised sham he glanced about the quarterdeck the wheel the guns and their tackles he gazed aloft up the mizzenmast naming things to himself recalling the pestiferously quirky terms real seamen used braces lifts jears clews harbour gaskets lubbers hole in the mizzen top ratlines strung on the sidestays and and what the bloody hell were those tensioning shrouds strung spidertaut from larboard to starboard stays below the mizzen top they were oh jesus uppers were called catharpins lowers swifters right swifters theres a backstay outrigger travellin backstay no breastbackstay outrigger there is the travellin backstay there the standing christ what a dunce you are you poxy clown itll come to me itll come soon as im pitched ini think it had better he determined that in the shank of his first evening aboard he would on the sly swot up on his tarry dogeared copy of falconers marine dictionary along with the peculiarities of captain braxtons idiosyncratic order book excuse me sir you are our new first another intruded upon alans glum musings of disaster aye he replied happy for any distraction at that moment allow me to name myself sir dimmock sir nathan dimmock the other fellow informed him doffing his hat in salute the sailing master your servant sir lewrie alan lewrie sir he responded with a like courtesy dimmock was a sturdy fellow bluff and square just a bit shorter than lewrie soberly dressed in a plain blue frock coat red waistcoat and blue breeches before he clapped his hat back on alan saw that he wore his hair quite short barely over his ears on the sides with a tiny queue in back well mister dimmock how do you find cockerel sir lewrie asked him an excellent ship sir dimmock replied a most excellently crafted vessel sir been aboard long have you five weeks sir my mates and i so your department is prepared for sea in all respects there are some charts i lack mister lewrie sir but other than those we are ready aye but not the entire ship i take it lewrie pressed mystified by the stresses dimmock put on his words dimmock all but grimaced inclined his head towards the open skylights in the coach top then began to mutter his answer lewrie got the hint he put his hands in the small of his back and paced slowly away forrud to the nettings overlooking the waist for more privacy if i may speak plain sir dimmock grimaced again as if he were fearful that his words would come back to haunt him even so as long as you do not speak insolence sir alan chid him in a grim tone as first lieutenant he must quash the first sign of any carping or backbiting against his captain no matter what he thought personally shes a queer ship sir dimmock fretted with a shake of his roundish head a jonah lewrie stiffened hed heard of hardluck vessels with souls perverse as harpies where no sailord ever prospered oh no sir no sign of thatl dimmock was quick to assure him i speak more of a certain tension more like listen sir pause a moment and give her ear lewrie peeked about cocking his head to heed any odd sounds halfexpecting some eldritch screech or moan beyond the normal creak of timbers irons and stays of masts working with the soft whispery groans of the damned but beyond the sough of the morning wind and the faroff piping mutters of taut rigging he heard nought dead silence sir dimmock hissed softly no shouting or chaffering were still indiscipline een so but a crew must make some sound sir but no theyre below silent as a pack of whipped curs and moren a few already wearin the bosuns chequer hands on watch hands below theyre ordered to maintain the still a deadsilent ships beyond my experience sir and a deadsilent ships devlish queer not a mutiny plot surely lewrie scoffed though he found cockerels silence almost bellychillin eerie himself six weeks in commission hardly mister dimmock ill not be the one dare to call it mutinous mister lewrie dimmock gloomed shrugging deeper into his coat collar though do we drive em taut as weve done so far tautern any ship ive ever been aboard well there is the possibility someday dye see sir captain braxton informed me hes a tauthand lewrie allowed oh aye sir dimmock sneered ahum lewrie granted in warning i think were stretching the bounds of proper discussion too far mister dimmock hate him or love him he is our captain and he must be obeyed chearly most of all by his commission officers and warrants and your impression of him sir mister dimmock what think dont signify now unless weve professional matters to discuss lewrie shot back sternly well then sir dimmock coloured huffing up as if stifling a belch you will excuse me theres to be a flogging at five bells o the forenoon so i must go youll wish to get settled in speak to our illustrious second lieutenant too im mortal certain youve been bid do so mister braxton captain braxton lewrie growled between clenched teeth he had never heard the like from a professional officer not even from himself and lewrie could backbite and carp with the best of em no sir lieutenant clement braxton i meant dimmock said grinning sardonically not captain howard braxton nephew lewrie frowned deeper his son sir dimmock said with all signs of great pleasure damme it really does become confusing weve a mister midshipman anthony braxton now i do believe he is a nephew and then theres midshipman dulwer hes cousin to them all somehow and the captains clerk mister boutwell oh its quite the grand family outing this frigate of ours mister lewrie sir bloody helll lewrie exclaimed cautiously dropping the stern demeanour required of first lieutenants any more under foot mister dimmock mean tsay how far may one carry nepotism how many of the hands turned over with him any of the warrants ah now thats the queerest bit sir dimmock sighed captain braxtons indiaman a war declared soon as he drops the hook guinea a man joining bounty and all and nary a hand nary a mate from his past ships followed him to the fleet sir christ lewrie all but groaned that was hellish queer that a captain could not entice a single tar to serve under him even the hardest captains had some loyal to em even the fools did forgive me for speaking plain for the nonce mister lewrie sir dimmock gloomed and thats the last youll hear from me by way of insubordination my word ont sir but i thought you had to know theres good men aboard afore the mast and in the wardroom theres many as could be good men given half a chance and a dose o firmbutfair whilst theyre learning but the captain is not the onliest aboard whos tauthanded runs in the family so to speak theyre a hard lot sir ask lieutenant mylett wish i could sir lewrie shivered though not with cold i was told no matter mister dimmock well met sir you understand i have to make my own way in this come to mine own conclusions not well not take the word of the first senior warrant i meet i mean no offence sir none taken sir dimmock muttered back glancing about to see if they had been witnessed talking together too long in too covert a confidence ill leave you to get squared away at supper though tonight ive a brace of french calvados apple brandy bettern any country applejack you ever swigged my treat to wet you into the mess i should be delighted mister dimmock thankee and sir aye we all tread wary and watch our tongues dimmock whispered though he performed a hatdoffing salute and slight bow with a smile on his phiz as if he were imparting nothing peculiar it isnt the hands alone who find the stih the safest way i will keep that in mind mister dimmock later sir lewrie nodded his head in dismissal clapped his hands in the small of his back and paced he looked below into the waist where a bosuns mate was braiding a catoninetails and a sailmakers assistant was sewing up a small redbaize bag they looked up at him as if trying to read his soul then looked away hurriedly when caught under his gaze the harbour and anchor watchstanders on deck stood their posts rigid as carved wooden soldiers stiffbacked and mute those men hi working parties swaying up tuns and kegs on the midships hull skids heaving away on stay tackles performed their labours with mere unisoned grunts instead of a pulleyhauley chanty or fiddle tune three midshipmen were scaling the rigging of the mainmast up by the crosstrees ready to go further aloft they looked down at him pausing in their vigorous exercise two fearful one with the air of a leery customer in a poor tradesmans shop whod seen better goods elsewhere lewrie matched gazes with him unblinking until the lads face suffused and he returned to his instructive play wull stop me alan thought what the devilve i got meself into this time he turned to the nearest gangway ladder to descend to the waist and make his way below through the nearest hatchway to the wardroom perversely he began to whistle a gay country air caroline had played an hundred times if shed played it once on her flute one he had taught her it was familiar to all hands making a few smile timidly the lyrics were hellish vulgar chapter whack the bosuns mate ran the braids of the catoninetails through his fingers to unravel them drew back took a deep breath and delivered his next stroke leven he grunted landsman preston shivered as with ague vibrating to the lash of the cat against the squarecut hatch grating to which he was tethered at wrists and ankles the skin of his back crawled of its own goosepimpling as if to writhe away from the pain there were redhot weals diagonaled on his bare back some broken open and beginning to seep a torrent of crimson tears which puddled in the small of his spine down by the band of his sloptrousersdown by the leathern apron worn by men receiving punishment to protect their kidneys landsman preston was gagged too with a leathern strop something to bite on preston flinched hunching his flayed shoulders as he heard thorne the burly bosuns mate suck in his breath as he prepared to stroke again in the awefull silence he could be heard to groan whack soggier wetter meatier this time twelve thorne barked turning away to face the captain above amidships of the quarterdeck nettings dozn dlivered sir and captain braxton nodded grim approval as he looked down into the waist with his officers a solid blue wall of agreement behind him and the marine contingent in their best red lobsterback coats with their muskets at the present at his feet facing the ships people forrud another bosun braxton snapped with a larboard leer to his lip bosuns mate porter came forward a younger slimmer man not as burly as thorne he took the catoninetails knuckled a salute to the captain and turned to lay on porter was a cackhanded man so the dozen hed administer would be crosswise to thomes porter shook the cat shook his wrist to flex out any kinks shook the cat so blood already drawn wouldnt bind the strands with sticky sera he took a deep breath poised on the balls of his feet then displeased with his placement he took a halfstep to his right and faced a little away from the grating to open his swinging room boony henn landsman preston could be heard to say impatiently through his leather gag gi on i eet seamen drawn up by watch divisions shuffled their feet swayed and tittered uneasily landsman preston was a game cock at least silence on deck braxton shouted silence the lot of you he turned a cold glare upon his first lieutenant who should have been the first to cry for order carry on porter shook his wrist once more drew back and swung one he called in a shuddery voice one dlivered sir then two then three in quick succession preston barely moved put yer back into it bosun braxton snarled dont dust him tis punishment he deserves and punishment he shall have aye aye sir sorry sir bosuns mate porter reddened whack much harder this time porter almost going arseovertit with the effort he put into it preston leapt like a touched deer four four dlivered sir ahhh landsman preston moaned leaning his head against the curved hatch grating which was bowsed upright to the larboard gangway perhaps he would not turn out game after all lewrie sneaked a glance at his braxtons father and son captain and second lieutenant braxton the younger had brought preston up on charges hed been owed gulpers from ordinary seaman golds daily rum ration and goldd thought his gulp was more than a tad healthy so they had snarled at each other some elbowing and shoving a word or two more spoken in anger over the mindnumbing rum which was the only escape from their misery their precious elixir now both were to be lashedfour dozen apiece had lewrie his druthers hed have given gold an extra dollop to make it up then deprived them both for a week with a harsh talking to four dozen he thought excessive too their first fight or trouble no knives drawn not even fists swung really and midshipman spendlove had been there catquick to bark them apart thrusting his skinny body of authority between them but lieutenant braxton had been certain theyd laid hands on him ignoring his orders no matter how accidentally and had demanded swift and condign punishment and as in every instance captain braxton had been more than quick to agree since cockerel had sailed in midapril as one of the escorting frigates with viceadmiral philip cosbys small squadron of two ninetyeightgun st rates three seventyfourgun rd rates and two other frigates thered been men at the gratings almost dailysometimes in twos and threesand the call for hands muster aft to witness punishment was now as routine to them as clear decks and up spirits lashes for fighting as a new crew shook down for drunken on watch asleep on watch insubordination dumb insolence which meant they didnt understand a command or hadnt sprung into action immediately with more than half the crew complete novices at sea well ignorance had become it seemed a punishable offence on the slow passage escorting the trade from england past french biscay ports where lurked privateers and swift frigates they had beaten cockerels crew into a shambling semblance of discipline had flogged or terrified raw lubbers into some sort of seamen sail drill boat drill gunnery drill lewrie had run every evolution of proper seamanship until they were a welltrained pack of sailors not a crew though he thought that took a confident shared spirit and misery and pain were the only commonalities cockerels people had to share amongst themselves so far oh they could perform any task in the book lately even to captain braxtons grudging satisfaction but there was something vital missing as if they were welldrilled puppets in a travelling punch and judy a pack of windup german clockwork toys but they werent a crew whack dozen bosun porter announced sounding relieved a dirty task was complete dozen dlivered sir very well cut im down jeezis preston all but wept as his lashings parted he almost sank to his knees wobbly as a sickbed patient but he waved off those who would assist him and hobbled away toward the surgeons mate and his waiting loblolly boys who would escort him below to salve his hurts with seawater and tar he hadnt wept though it was a closerun thing and he hadnt cried out he was still a man grown and his mates from the foremast of the larboard division could be heard whispering and muttering congratulation as he passed between their tightly ordered ranks eyes to your front lewrie was forced to bark feeling greasy as he did so silence on deck he cut another glance at the captain but that worthy was busy lieutenant braxton met his gaze however and lifted one eyebrow ordnary seaman gold the captain doomed the masteratarms and ships corporals led the next man to the gratings which were being sluiced down with buckets of seawater ordnary seaman gold youve been found guilty of violating the articles of war article the twentythirdof quarreling fighting or using reproachful speeches towards another person of the fleet and of article the twentysecondof striking or laying hands upon person or persons superior to you for each violation you will receive two dozen lashes braxton thundered bosun fairclough seize im up a new redbaize bag was brought forward a pristine new cat was let out of the bag each man got his own no matter how many were to be flogged thence to be tossed overboard supposedly with his sins once punishment was done cockerel ominously had had to send ashore in lisbon for a fresh supply of redbaize cloth once the merchant convoy had made port lewrie looked away from the shivering victim to mister midshipman spendlove golds alleged target of violence tears streamed the boys face as he stood before the hands of his watch division and the handsmore swaying shuffling of feet more discreet reproving coughs and mournful glances left and right at shipmates a shy homy hand came snaking from the press of men to touch spendlove on the shoulder for a moment to buck up his courage some older seamen reassuring the distraught lad so hed show game as gold and not shame him whack one bosun fairclough grunted in a rummy croaking basso one dlivered sir ships compny on hats and dismiss lewrie gladly ordered gold was made of softer stuff than preston he could not contain the pain and had whimpered towards the end sobbing aloud mister lewrie midshipmen braxton and dulwer called for him scampering aft to the starboard ladder to the quarterdeck mister lewrie sir aye he gloomed looking down at their eager intent glares of righteousness man for report sir midshipman anthony braxton all but chortled we saw it able seaman lisney foremast he laid hands on mister midshipman spendlove sir reached out and thumped him sir midshipman dulwer stuck in from behind he did sir i saw it too they were as alike god help us lewrie thought as two vicious little peas in a pod two snapping curs from the same illbred litter of pit bulls closeset eyes precociously heavy and thick eyebrows the same long narrow semistupid expressions the same pouty mouths as their elders the same little points in their middle top lips lewrie stumped down the ladder to them gathered them close to him by seizing hold of their coat collars and frogmarched them to the starboard side between twelvepounders now you listen to me you brutal little gets he hissed i saw what you refer to and it was nothing more than simple humanity and compassion and were we to ask mister spendlove of it hed tell us the same a game is it my beauties do you earn points on which of you sends more men to the gratings or do you keep score by the number of lashes daily is it weekly sums what now mister lewrie sir midshipman braxton dared to interrupt with a stab at worldly mantoman airs damn your blood sir lewrie whispered harshly right in the twentyyearold fools face how dare you take that tone with me ill have you kissing the gunners daughter fore youre a minute older and a full two dozen o mister faircloughs very best those it is not a game you simpletons ships people arent dumb animals you can abuse for your nosepicking

for any infraction of discipline that were never to allow the hands to get away with one single thing or theyll dulwer persisted filled with a dutiful but thickwitted indignation or as much as he dared oh stern duty lewrie sneered what a god that what cant theyre men damn your eyes theres infractions you must report and quash at once then theres ignorance mistakes cockawhoop antics hands have always pulled always will and youd flog for all and feel so smug and prim doing it wouldnt you use some discretion learn some leniency or god help you now or in future shit they fluttered their lashes

this ere barge chapter lewrie was required to visit the mens mess daily some days he made it breakfasttoday was dinner the hands dined eight to a mess on either side of a plank table which hung from the overhead by stout ropes seated on sea chests or short handcrafted stools with the artillery overhead instead of between mess tables they had more elbow room which was why most sailors preferred frigates more room to swing a hammock at night too even if headroom was a bare five feet it was not a happy mess though no matter that dinner was salt beef cheese biscuit and smallbeer not a meatless banyan day and lumpy dogs of pease pudding boiled in net bags in the steep tubs like duffs each with numbered brass tabs for the individual messes as soon as he set foot on the mess deck the grumbling and the joshing died away to a low murmur and men watched him warily cuttyeyed as he made his way aft hardtack being rapped was the predominant sound not so gristly today gracey lewrie inquired of one senior hand at a larboard table nay sbad sir gracey grinned for a moment wiping his fingertips on a scrap of raveled rope smallstuff in lieu of napery tis no moren a quarter gristler bone tthis joint mister lewrie suffolk dont choke you sadler lewrie japed with another damnall hard cheeses sir dryz gravel but he shrugged as he masticated thoughtfully on dry crumbly navyissue suffolk but enough to go round lewrie prompted the nipcheese issues fair portion it was a blessing that cockerels purser mister husie was somewhat honest in his ration issue begrudging but a decent feeder nonetheless if one kept a chary eye upon him fair nough sir sadler allowed just as begrudging no complaints then lewrie asked eyeing the nearest tables there was no familiar response no chaffering or ironic jeers such as a hearty crew might make to such a leading statement nuffin a young pressed man dared softly in a bland innocuous voice nuffin wif tpusser sir damme i asked for thatun didnt i lewrie thought glumly carry on then lads lewrie called with false cheer as he made his way farther aft between the swaying rolling tables beyond the marines mess area to the companionway hatch to the gun deck he paused once he reached bracing fresh air cocking an ear to what might be said or done after his departure the hummumm of low voices resumed grew slightly in volume but nowhere near normal level nor did he hear any disparaging comments about the ships officers or himself most particularly that old sweats might make that was some relief at least but the lack of humour of laughter put him off lewrie ascended to the quarterdeck and took a peek at the compass in the binnacle and stood with the quartermasters of the watch at the large double wheel as they gently fed spokes to larboard or to starboard as cockerel rolled heaved and wallowed to a following wind on her starboard quarter a slowveering westerly somewhere off to larboard and alee was cape st vincent one of the busiest corners of europe flung far beyond the plodding st and rd rate lineofbattle ships of their squadron cockerel should have seen something but the heaving glittering sea was a starkly empty folding porridge rudder tackle still working he asked mounson the senior to weather or are they taut nough allus works on a leadin win sir mounson grumbled turning to squit tobacco into his spitkid spoker two moren usu tlarbrd i reckon though ropes are stretching again new stuff lewrie decided ill send the bosun below to overhaul em anything i might do for you mister lewrie sir lieutenant clement braxton asked him wearing a quirky bemused only slightly anxious expression on his beadyeyed countenance as if he were just the slightest bit irked that anyone much less lewrie would find fault in his watchstanding abilities do we conform to your standards sir he all but simpered it was irksome to lewrie but he was competent quiet enough so far lewrie rejoined biting off the urge to slap him silly the merest child could do it i dont suppose though you have inquired about the slackness in the steering tackle sir uhm braxton junior stumbled casting a quick glare at his leading helmsman mounson didnt say anything to me sir i thats why one should ask sir lewrie replied i leave her in your capable hands uhm quite mister lewrie sir lieutenant braxton fumed my compliments to mister fairclough and he is to overhaul the tackle soon as the hands have finished dinner lewrie snapped going below once more to the companionway then aft to the wardroom for his midday meal inform the captain he tossed off over his shoulder the wardroom was not nearly as grand as the captains quarters there were small rectangular deadlights in the stern transom either side of the thick rudder post below those windows was a long narrow settee on either side were dogbox cabins temporary shelters framed in light deal with canvas walls with insubstantial narrow doors made of shutterlike louvers there were no locks commission and warrant officers were supposed to be gentlemenabove stealing or prying a space long enough for a bedcot wide enough for seachest and bed and room enough in which to dressthat was their individual portion that portion was about six feet long and five feet wide for the junior officers who berthed furthest forward around the mess table and mizzenmast trunk lieutenant braxton and lieutenant scott a marine captain named oneal and his lieutenant banbrook lieutenant banbrook was the merest child fair and slight a seventeenyearold whose parents had purchased him a commission upon the outbreak of war and lewrie thought had done so with the greatest sense of relief all theyd seen him do was rail at sergeant haislip and the corporals flick lint off his uniform and drink the marine captain oneal a saturnine belfaster despaired of the lad ever learning a single blessed thing and in private referred to banbrook as leftenant sponge or little leftenant dolittle farther aft slightly but only very slightly larger cabins were for first officer sailing master mister dimmock the ships surgeon mister pruden a rolypoly font of what little good cheer their mess possessed and the pusser mister husie and no purser was ever of good cheer come and cup a rum of take lieutenant barnaby scott offered lolling idle on the long narrow settee with lieutenant banbrook hey lewrie gawped wondering if hed heard right or is that a cup of rum sir scott amended with a befuddled squint no matter theres plenty he indicated a glistening pewter pitcher on the dining table fresh vigo lemons azores lump sugar in the bottom somewhere touch o madeira and rum o course have a cup sir im quite took aready bit early in the day for me mister scott for me too sir heep banbrook hiccoughed myopically pacing yourself are you i see sir lewrie scoffed heep banbrook nodded looking angelic saving his energies for the ladies he is sir lieutenant scott said with a wink every now and then when his faculties had been dulled by drink more so than usual the wardroom made banbrook the butt of their old jokes theyd sent him capering throughout the ship the first days at sea calling for marine private cheeks private cheeks i say now private cheeks front and center hed bawled never suspecting that it was a buggers term banbrook righteous but reeling had reported back that private cheeks had evidently either deserted or fallen overboard there wasnt a sign of him anywhere though sergeant haislip had recalled seeing him up forrud relieving himself on the beakhead rails pish banbrook snorted what ladies i ask you heepr well hardly ladies really bamaby scott confided turning to lewrie for help the first officer knows all about em about the whore transport i expect well fetch her under our lee oh bout the end of the second dog isnt that true sir perhaps not until first light tomorrow im sorry to say alan said with a somber shake of his head which awakened a chorus of groans and you know theyll have to service the liners first they might not put em straight to work when we sight her might give em a morning to rest first more disappointed groanseven one from banbrook who did not yet have the first inkling what they were talking about whores sir he asked heep cant allow a new crew ashore in wartime dont you know anything sir lewrie frowned sternly no shore leaves out right out but a ship will go out of discipline now and again if shes allowed time in harbour shell replenish firewood and water then hoist the easy pendant and out come the whores or the wives if shes in home waters ever hear the old saw bout sailors having a wife in every port thats where it comes from mister banbrook and youll note we didnt stay anchored long at lisbon sir scott rejoined weaving the web thicker top you up there lad a rum of cup sir believe i shall lewrie smiled what one in harm hey banbrook goggled trying to decypher the first officers last statement he looked down into his full mug wondering if he had not taken perhaps a tad too much aboard they were beginning to sound higgledypiggledy or something thank god the navys so thoughtful of its people sir mister pruden confided from his seat at the long mess table better this way theres many a jack been hung for buggery else months and months at sea without feminine companionship and if you hoist the easy in harbour why just any old drab may come aboard and then theres your crew poxed to their hairlines no sir this is the better way the british consul at lisbon will hire the prettiest doxies get em certified by a navy sick and hurt board physician cant expect one surgeon and a mate to do it yknow contract a ship and send her out to tag along with the squadron then when a vessels deservinglike or the handsve no fingers left from boxing the jesuit alan stuck in and cant pulleyhauley any longer over shell sail sir scott cajoled putting a comradely arm about the foxed marine tippytoein under our lee coy as any minx the hands take their pleasures below on their mess deck elbow to elbow shockin twatch sir captain oneal confided to his swozzled secondincommand we officers though now ah we get rowed over to the whore transport dye see lad oneal was almost cooing in a soft lilting more affected irish brogue whilst lewrie had to stuff his fist in his mouth to keep from laughing out loud handsomer run o quim for officers aye scott stuck in from the other side only the prettiestll do with the awesomest poonts and in private in cabins much grander than these dye know oneal went on what keep what bout th socket fee sir banbrook inquired eyes round as fried eggs with lustful wonderment by men why laddy thats the best part oneal beamed though he did bite the lining of his cheek to stifle a hellish case of the sniggers you get a guinea ride for ten shillings navy sports the rest just be sure you sign your mess bill and mister husie sorts it all out later heep lieutenant banbrook speculated hopefully fingering his crutch dinners on gentlemen sirs the senior wardroom steward sang out as he entered with a tureen of pea soup ships boys trailed him bearing bread barges of only very slightly weevily biscuit ah pea soup lieutenant scott enthused as he came to the table god therell be a foul wind from astern this night ill wager do we get long sir banbrook asked the purser as he took his seat ab heep aboard the whore transport husie sighed pulling at his large though puggish nose gazing at the expectant prompting faces of his messmates though husie deplored their high cockalorum dammeboy antics from the nether depths of his wellordered doubleentry soul he felt forced to abet them just the once and play up in similar spirit well dye see young sir much like marines and idlers arent required to stand evnin watches one gets what is pretty much how do you describe your nights off allnightin so tspeak sir oh i say banbrook all but swooned it was hard to tell it could have been the rum punch the others cheered husie for his effort thought i explained it before captain oneal chuckled stuffing his napkin firmly behind the rank gorget which hung high on his chest below his throat dammef i know just how it slipped me mind leftenant banbrook ahem mister boutwell the captains clerk interrupted at the entrance to the wardroom boutwell wore his usual wellfed nosehigh and toplofty superior sneer excuse me but mister lewrie sir the captain bids me convey his compliments to you and inform you that he wishes you to confer with him in his cabins this minute lewrie grumbled cocking an eyebrow the pea soup smelled hellish good and for once they had fresh roast pork to follow at once he said sir boutwell purred looking anything but sorry to deprive lewrie of a hot dinner very well mister boutwell alan sighed feeling much put upon and griping in his bowels with dread of another rant from captain braxton my utmost respects to captain braxton and i shall be up directly very good sir boutwell replied bowing his way out speaking of a foul wind gentlemen lieutenant scott whispered sotto voce once the man was gone prompting another knowing chorus of groans or dismal chuckling mister scott i despair of you lewrie snapped putting on his coat anew damme its hard enough he almost allowed his personal feelings to escape but checked them there will be no disparaging remarks in this wardroom whether im present or not ah but i was not disparaging the captain sir scott gaped in pretended innocence i referred to the captains clerk boutwell just stop it lewrie snarled in exasperation id admire you save me at least a slice of pork hot i spose is too much to ask might as well not dimmock the sailing master muttered once the first lieutenant was himself departed he never has an appetite after one of those sessions poor man christ love you mister dimmock but who does chapter you sent for me sir lewrie opened standing before captain braxtons dining table braxton was having fresh roast chicken from his personal stores which had come off from shore there was soft bread instead of biscuit what smelled like a very fruity portuguese varietal burgundy in his crystal glass the only common touch was a dollop of pease pudding on his plate waiting on the sideboard for later were fruit a fresh wheel of stilton and extrafine sweet biscuit with a blooddark bottle of port breathing for the nonce yes mister lewrie braxton scowled looking as if alans presence put him off his food he laid aside his cutlery to sip wine as he perused him the second officer informs me the steering tackle is slackening the steering tackle sir mounson told me of it sir i ordered mister braxton to command the bosun below to overhaul it soon as the hands have eat you will see to it at once sir captain braxton barked we wallow on this following wind and sea the ropes could part at a moments notice under the strain should she round up or broachto we could end up dismasted and i will not see my ship disabled because you were slack sir sir the tackle is slack not chafing or ready to part alan defended trying to maintain a calm reasonable demeanour a spoker two slack and should we have to rereeve tackle ropes then we have to fetchto under reduced sail until its done for that wed need all hands so i adjudged it could wait til after i decide sir you do not i am responsible for evrything aboard this ship i will not be kept in the dark about matters of her safety nor grave defects which make us unable to fulfill viceadmiral cosbys orders you did not see fit to tell me of this defect braxton seemed to calm and got back to mangling a morsel off his chicken breast you failed me sir i instructed mister braxton to inform you sir lewrie replied evenly stifling his anger not for the first time when facing such an irritable irascible and insecure man it appears that he did so i do not see how i could be perceived as failing you sir there was no discretion for watch officers or trust in their competency no freedom to think or learn for juniors captain braxton was to be summoned over the most trivial matters and then took charge from subordinates until he was satisfied excluding his relations no one was trusted an inch it had been a wearying six weeks do you not sir braxton drawled that of itself is a failure of a more personal nature ill attend to the steering tackle directly then sir will that be all sir alan inquired striving hellishhard for bland damn your blood sir braxton boiled over suddenly do not dare take that tone with me sir sir lewrie gawped in confusion what tone damme i didnt even half sound sulky i thought i covered that well he assured himself but then ive had bags of practice lately your dumb insolence sir your mute insubordination braxton accused pointing a table knife at him not for the first time either that puddin face of yours that blank stare curt and surly you are towards me sir and i tell you ill not have it i cannot imagine what you find disagreeable sir lewrie said flummoxed i replied i would deal with the tackle then asked to be excused to do so sir i dont know how else one might state ive given you and your insulting ways just about all the chance i care to mister lewrie braxton warned this time he confronted his first officer with a loaded fork your eternal sneering backtalking backstabbing sir as if you and the rest of those idle wastrels think you only know best how to command this vessel i warned first day i demand complete loyalty obedience and support given me chearly yet i cannot rely on any of you you most of all the jobs simple enough a fool could grasp it lewrie i tell you to do something you go and do it without carping without questioning end of story yet you continually confront me you presume to advise me there is one captain aboard not a damn committee sir i would be failing you if i did not relate problems and exercise my prerogative as secondincommand to you argue with me even now sir the rest of those fools in the wardroom take their lesson from you the mates and petty officers you poison against my authority sir theres not been a single instance you are all profane sir braxton cavilled on whacking at his chicken breast and delivering a bite to his mouth wastrels idlers disreputable totlly lacking in dedication common sense totlly without professional attention to duties disobedynt and truculent he even chews mean alan thought giddy with carefully secreted rage as he watched his captain smack and grind his lopsided little mouth grumbling in slacklipped petulance begrudging each crumb youre all soft lewrie braxton belaboured sourly you most of all comes of being a married junior officer i expect soft hands and soft head too long abed ashore whilst better men were out at sea getting calluses you undermine my authority attempt to contravene my orders sow discontent and insolence among the crew i should sack the entire lot you foremost among them sir i must protest that i do not any such thing this fellow lisney braxton said a propos of nothing suddenly cooling quicker than sane people had a right to as he took aboard more wine who is he sir lewrie was forced to gawp anew offbalance again lisney lisney who is he damme sir youre first officer dont you know or was he just dropped from heaven like gullshite sir able seaman lisney is foretop captain larboard watch three months in commission and you dont know lewrie fumed to himself or dont bloody care more like he shoved midshipman spendlove from behind im told yet you refused to credit the report suborned two midshipmen from doing their proper duty let this fellow lisney get away with laying hands upon a superior and kept it from me sir the captain scolded one more example of your shoddy slack and disputatious behaviour towards me and my strictures sir more of your softness lisney an old schoolmate of yours is he mister lewrie a particular favourite wo sir he is not but you know my strict instruction that no common seaman ever lays hands on a superior if its nought but a midshipmans jacket hanging on a mopstick ill have em crawl past showing proper def rence but no you know best dont you see fit to circumvent my orders behind my back and corrupt two promising young men into your sort of officer and by your inattention to duty allow the crew to flaunt me cock a snook at me sir sir it was not a shove lewrie countered giving his version of what had occurred and the why of lisneys gentle touch he even dared at last to suggest that midshipmen braxton and dulwer were doing it for dumb brutal fun they dont keep their eyes peeled from a sense of duty sir he concluded breathing high and shallow off the top of his lungs sure of the tirade to come by the pose of utter outrage on braxtons face he was relating a blasphemy as great as saying king george the third was a woman in disguise theyre playing a game scoring points with floggings and lashes they take pleasure from the mens pain sir how dare you sir captain braxton snarled next youll say take pleasure in flogging no sir no it is from a sense of duty nothing more a grim duty aye and i have drilled into them that sense of duty i want the man on report mister lewrie and i want midshipman spendlove on report as well for failure to tell me of this fellow lisney laying hands upon him sir it was compassionate the hands like spendlove and they do not like the others braxton drawled drumming his fingers on the dining table what a bloody pity those scum are there to do their duty obey orders and walk in fear of their betters whether they like em or not that goes without saying sir lewrie dared once more but they fear midshipmen braxton and dulwer sir the sort of fear that turns bowels to water and harms the proper disposal of their duties fear em braxton cawed almost gleeful i should certainly hope so sir exactly as i wish reason they tike spendlove he lets them have latitude cant bear down taut as he should soft soft as you and the others scott dimmock braxton waved dismissively even the bosuns gone calfeyed lately well three dozen lashes to this lisney and two dozen on spendloves bottomll take the insolent jacksauce out of em youd decide punishment before a hearing sir alan inquired feeling his spine crawl with dread that would really cause trouble i wish those people on report at once sir sir as first officer i must advise you alan implored the ships people know what lisneys touch was about they expect a captains court to represent evenhanded justice but if lisneys given three dozen which is excessive without a chance to i tell you mister lewrie braxton thundered i want those people on report i give you a direct order sir disobey me at your immedjt peril he looked like he was gloating sir there must be some discretion allowed me to sort out conduct which really is prejudicial to discipline and answer me you impertinent fool will you or will you not put them on report as i order i alan wavered christ think he told himself not answering is insubordination aye aye sir lewrie had to reply i will place them on charge thought as much braxton all but sneered over the rim of his glass and no more of your obstreperous interceding i mean to have a first officer who will stand behind me to the hilt mister lewrie whether that is you or not in future well he allowed with one more wave of his hand and a grumpy fussy dissatisfaction sir i cant stand mute if i think an injustice is being done and i am ordering you to do so in future mister lewrie what think ye of that braxton coloured quickly damme youll not play fletcher christian with me sir ill dismiss you at once i do nothing of the sort sir lewrie paled captain braxton had just all but accused him of mutinous behaviour i do say though sir that punishment in this instance may run counter to your intent that it might be prejudicial to good order the final decision is up to you sir but as your deputy i must be allowed to advise aye to intercede or at least ask for leniency sir i must do everything in my power to present you a welldrilled disciplined and seaworthy ship and crew sir and i think ive done that but when events happen that might upset that good order its my solemn duty to apprise you of such sir ill not play a chuckleheaded gullible bligh to you either mister lewrie oh no ill not you mark my words braxton warned sir alan began then clapped his trap shut knowing that one exchange more and thered be no going back ill shoot off somethin hot and thats the end of me he told himself sure as fate hed clap me in irons sir lewrie assayed again in a softer tone i assure you you have the complete loyalty and obedience of every officer aboard then why dont i see it lewrie braxton all but wailed with selfpity get yourself out of my sight sir attend to the steering tackle as you should have an hour ago and put lisney and spendlove up on charges aye aye sir he was forced to reply looking captain braxton firmly in the eyes and putting as much chirpy goodwill into his answer as he had left at that moment he felt he was all but piping his eyes racing off a chorus of rule britannia and breaking into some looselimbed hornpipe to please do i sneer he railed within himself standing far aft by the taffrails his hands squeezed the timbers so hard he felt he could rip up a section and shred it to kindling or strangle it am i insolent to him well perhaps and who wouldnt be i ask you but he knew how well he could toady and fawn how well he could as every english gentleman was expected to do bottle up his emotions and his private thoughts wrap them in sailcloth and dare anyone to say whether twas hidden claret or horse piss toady right im good at it dined out on it for years alan didnt understand what braxton feared to wish to cow the crew so completelynot only the crew but the petty officers the warrants and the commission officers too what might have happened in his miserable past he wondered that required treating everyone like rebellious riotous gutter sweepings it went whatever it was far past a dread that an english crew might be infected with the fever of republicanism and thomas paine it was brutal thoughtless of the consequences hes right about one thing he doesnt get joy of it i doubt hes ever had joy of anything do i sneer at him behind his back alan asked himself no i know better ive been in the navy long enough to know how to put the eagerbutearnest phiz on i stamp down any who dare to sneer too has anybody caught me at it even in private no certainly not to his face ive been careful to sound dutiful dull and flat maybe but then ive never served under his like and i very much doubt many others have either lewrie felt that he had earnestly tried to please to obey and carry out his duties even within the confining strictures the captain placed upon him they did have a welldrilled welltrained ship and crew by now able to respond smartly to any command perform any drill or face action he had been as much as he was allowed a buffer between captain and crew presenting as best he was able a going concern ready for their masters use all for nought it seemed its not me lewrie assured himself in a bitter guarded whisper his stomach churning with gall over his most recent scathing he just wants dear clement for first lieutenant and im in the way raise scott to second promote little anthony braxton to actinglieutenant god i sound so bloody patheticl wonder if lieutenant mylett felt the same way right before he chucked it he gloomed in silence watching their wake fan out behind them he could not askfor fear of sounding as if he was criticising the rest could not volunteer informationhe was dutybound to quash such talk as disrespectful so he knew little more about the mystery than he had the day hed come aboard to join he imagined though that from what little he had learned of mylett in casual reminiscences hed been an honourable decent mantoo decent too used to a more benign less brutal order where officers did not despise the ships people as a regular policy and did not feel the need for a regime of nearterror what was terrorising though was his realisation that a third of the crew and perhaps half the marines were experienced men who had served kindlier captains before even if they were strict nothing though as strict as cockerel and if it continued defiance of ordained authority was the spirit of the age the colonies now france and all that republicanism thom paine talk blighs latest mutiny it could make even an officer like lewrie queasy to think that word much less pronounce it youll not have me lewrie vowed grimly promising to force himself to sound and act even chirpier and more agreeable as secondincommand even that would not please captain braxton he knew but it might defuse any schemes to dismiss him for lack of evidence at a possible court martial but ill not knuckle under and become his sort of officer alan also vowed ill not be his whipped dog his dumb lackey and i will not be hounded out or ousted hmm though he pondered wheres the middle ground stay and bedamned sooner or latergo and bedamned a failure to the fleetstay and counter him somehow save the stupid bastard from himself really oh thats rich that is christ this is hopeless he all but wept in frustration chapter theres going to be trouble lieutenant scott intoned they were inspecting the standing rigging along the larboard gangway cockerel had come about just after dawn and was now standing noreast toward portugal to their souwest far up to windward the topsls of the lineofbattle ships could barely be seen if one were high aloft yes and youre not helping lewrie bitterly accused cony has ears your man too i expect tongues too but but cant mollify em they speak too much of obedience it smacks of toadying cant sir and then they lose their ears among the people i did try though sir same as you scott rejoined sounding sulky and heavy im sorry mister scott it was unfair to you what i just said i know but alan muttered pausing in their slow pacing to fix his eyes upon scotts as emphasis of his sincerity captain braxton had held his court solicitously nodding with grim disapproval as the two midshipmen had presented their evidence lisney and spendlove were in scotts watch so he had spoken for them as had lewrie as had lisney and spendlove themselves so new at sea spendlove looked to lisney a man in his late thirties whod spent his own boyhood in the fleet as a seadaddy who knew all the knots all the cautions lisney was a leader looked up to by everyone seaman or landsman alike on the foremast oh aye thered be trouble but captain braxton was intent upon punishment and could that bitter man have awarded lashes for backtalking sea officers lewrie and scott would have been due at the gratings themselves three dozen hed foreordained and three dozen it would be this forenoon spendlove already had been caned with a stiffened rope starter bent over a quarterdeck sixpounder beating boys on the bottom was done much less formally than the gloomy stylised ritual of a mans flogging there was only so much the officers could do obedience and loyalty in the royal navy were a captains due and the rigid articles of war spelled out the consequences for those who didnt toe the line even if they didnt agree even if they felt a captain was a raving bedlam bugeaterthey had to support him totally once he decided what was best there was no recourse open to them that didnt smack of failure to support captain braxton no one to whom they might complain to inform a senior officer behind his back was disloyalty and an officers mutiny against him making matters worse they could not even mention that dread word mutiny by way of warning yet braxton would become even harsher perhaps spurring into occurrence the very thing his punishments were intended to prevent and their careers would be ruined in either case for failure to support and to inform him of their fears until the situation had so festered that it was moments from eruptionor for failure to nip it in the bud in the first place it might even appear at a court martial that they had encouraged it or at least sympathised and hidden a plots existence like rannin before a hurricane barepoled sir scott grunted sounding almost amused one hears of it bein done but damme if one wants to try it firsthand damned if we do damned if we that made lewrie grin for an instant even so lieutenant barnaby scott was normally a loud blustery jackanapes exuberant and blisteringly profane the sort who went through life windmilling his arms fit to wake the dead with an improbable curse a sidesplitting jest and the sort of booming laugh that made one wish to place a bet or order one more bottle even if one knew better he was also exceedingly competent more so perhaps lewrie suspected than he himself was no leaders yet though lewrie asked softly as they gained the focsle ladders no real sign of trouble not that organised yet sir scott scoffed looking at that moment anything but exuberant leaders well none who stand out for obvious reasons too too new a crew too many landsmen aboard whove never known a fair he choked off his comments as a working party under bosuns mate porter neared it was dangerous to be heard criticising the captain by the hands or be recalled later as one who mentioned mutiny that would be his ruin yes lewrie agreed with a bleak nod after today though id expect that to change dont you black as their mood is count on it sir and then well be in the unenviable position of being bound to tell him of our suspicions else alan shrugged heavily more suppression even more floggings scott agreed gloomily lifting his hat to swipe his unruly hair make it happen dutybound to uphold himl lewrie fretted cause when it does occur therell be a court and well end up tainted black as sail ho came a wild cry from the mainmast crosstrees they froze in their tracks sharing astonished looks where away lieutenant braxton on the quarterdeck demanded two points off tstarbrd bow sir came the singsong reply like the wail of a passing soul tgallantsl three fourl four sir four sets o tgaants a french squadron out for prizes ill wager lewrie yelped with sudden joy convoy prhaps sir scott countered whopping fit to bust with his own excitement rice ships from new orleans east indiamen loaded gunndown prizemoney sir lashings of it action at last maybe salvation at last alan hooted clapping scott on the shoulder cockerel had gone to quarters with a purpose for once drums rattled fifes peeped the ship rang to the slamming of doors as the temporary partitions were struck below to the orlop the cabin furnishings were removed to a place of safety and to lessen the danger of splinters the gun deck and the mess deck became two long roadways bare of any fittings or comforts sand was slung to give gunners and gun carriages a grip on the whitesanded planking fire buckets were topped up slow match was lit and coiled in case the flintlock strikers of the artillery failed to work in case they had to board a foe the weapons chests were flung open and pistols muskets and cutlasses were distributed piled round the bases of the masts below the wicked pikes in their beckets twelve minutes it took to convert cockerel into a vessel ready for battle a little slower than the previous days drill alan noted but still a respectable time perhaps the hands were clumsier and more nervous than before since it was a real foe theyd be spying out give us three points free quartermaster steer east noreast captain braxton commanded sounding grumpy and outofsorts mister braxton signal to windsor castle enemyinsight aye aye sir the midshipman snapped turning aft to the taffrails a moment later the proper signal flag soared aloft on a light halliard with a jerk of the line when it was twoblocked as high as it would go the bunting bale burst open deck there the lookout howled topsls now topsls bove t orizon sir five chase now sir five chase were overhauling em damn fast lewrie exulted he looked aloft the signal flag was streaming at an odd angle which made him frown the westerlies which prevailed round cape st vincent were at this latitude usually tending northerly down where ships turned for the caribbean today though they were perversely backing blowing from westnorwest and it wasnt exactly the clearest day hed ever seen either mister braxton any reply from the flag he inquired uhm nossir the midshipman replied a digit up his nose you cant tell from the deck sir lewrie rasped go aloft they may not have seen it yet captain sir what is it mister lewrie braxton grumbled impatiently signal flags streaming larboard quarter to starboard bows sir might be unreadable yonder captain braxton rocked back on his heels craning his neck to peer upwards over his shoulder has the flagship replied he bade of the midshipman now in the mizzentop no return signal sir theyre barely in sight damn braxton growled scratching his unshaven chin cockerel was almost tgallantsdown over the horizon from the squadron with the wind fluttering her alert towards the unidentified ships mister lewrie well put about lay her closehauled on this larboard tack well close the flagship then spy out our visitors aye aye sir bosun he roared through his brass speaking trumpet hands to the braces man for fullandby lewrie had little charity for the captain even so he thought it professionally slovenly not to have alerted the squadron first off before going to quarters and turning eastward even further downwind out of visual and signalling range cockerel came trundling about bows chopping on the lively sea shrouds and lines beginning to moan to the apparent wind abeam the wind as shed been sailing it had not seemed so boisterous but now spray dashed high as the bulwarks and she heeled hobbyhorsing over longset wavetops loping into the wind something champion it took a quarterhour on that exhilarating beat before they fetched high enough above the hazy horizon before windsor castle rose topsl high and finally caught her urgent signal bunting soared up the flagships masts and sails foreshortened as the squadron of tineofbattle ships altered course eastward to get in on whatever it was which the scouting frigate had found now by god braxton snapped put about quartermaster make her course due east haul our wind mister lewrie back they flew towards the unidentified ships which were now well below the horizon without the tiniest scrap of masthead trucks visible guessing at where they might reappear buggered off to loord once they spotted us lewrie opined with mister dimmock if they had a lick o sense o course bound for toulon or marseilles perhaps sir the sailing master agreed but be they french east indiamen theyd hope to get inshore finish at that lorient of theirs on the bay of biscay and silence both of you braxton barked speculate off duty not on weve work to do or hadnt you noticed sirs of course sir they almost chorused sail ho the lookout shrieked four points off tstarboard bows five sail samez afore there running braxton shouted back cant tell sir allow me to go aloft sir lewrie bade wriggling with curiosity and to get away from braxton for a few precious moments uhm very well the captain grudgingly allowed giving him a grumpy onceover lewrie snatched his personal telescope from the binnaclecabinet rack and dashed for the mizzen chains up the ratlines on the windward side where the ships angle of heel made the ascent less steep laying out on the futtock shrouds then up and over the mizzentop deadeyes onto the upper shrouds for the crosstrees with cockerel shrinking to a toothpick below him a heaving wallowing toothpick and the mastheads swaying like treetops in a stiff wind they were almost hullup to him those unknown ships running downwind almost at cockerels pointofsail with the wind large on their larboard quarters big dark bulky threemasters as impressive as st rates there were winks of cloudy sunshine on their wide sterns on transom windows gilt galleries and an acre of glass but they were not warships they looked like compagnie des indies ships stiff with priceless asian cargoes and loaded so heavily they wallowed in the sea like cattle on a boggy moor cockerel had fetched them hullup almost in the time it had taken lewrie to scale the mast they could not outrun her slow and logy as the squadrons lineofbattle ships were to the west even they would overhaul them within the hour seen their like before gittons he asked the mizzen lookout lending him the heavy shotgunlong telescope at full extension lor sir indiamen surez fate too fancy tbe st rates een frog st rates he cackled be some prizemoney comin our way by god theyll be mister lewrie whaww though where away lewrie asked knowing from gittons cautious tone there was trouble in gaining that fortune in prizemoney almos dead on th bows sir at fifth sail abeam th wind almos cocked up fullanby fifth rate i say sir big frigate lewrie retrieved his telescope and swung it to the left there was a large ship there at right angles to their course one of the big fortyfourgunned th rates the french were building with eighteen or twentyfourpounders the sort of frigate they might use to command a small overseas squadron and she was already flying her national colours the vertical stripes of bluewhitered of republican france warship lewrie bawled deck there frigate on our lee bow he took hold of the standing backstay slung the telescope on his shoulder and halfslid halfmonkeyed his way back down his legs clasped about the stay a th rate sir braxton demanded before bis feet hit the deck a warship sir what about the others indiamen sir with one warship for escort theyre running almost free on a landsmans breeze lewrie explained panting with his exertion and his excitement shes bearing almost north closehauled to interpose shell cross our bows in a few minutes sir braxton tucked his hands behind his back and paced the windward side of the quarterdeck a naval captains inviolate sanctuary when he was on deck lewrie noted that braxtons blunt fingers were twining and fretting and the squadron mister lewrie he grimaced turning to look inboard to his officers uhm coming up astern sir i didnt he flushed petulance twisted braxtons mouth it looked like he had mutteredoo aloft there what of the squadron courses bove thorizon sir the lookout shouted back be lineabreast starboard quarter off twind sir god one could espy their topsis from the deck lewrie thought there they were stretched out bowson to cockerel arrayed like beads on a string a little souwest of her stern were there to be a fight they could bear off or bear up to windward and form lineofbattle or dash on if viceadmiral cosby ordered general chase and run those frog merchantmen to ground one at a time mister lewrie captain braxton decided snapping his fingers to summon him to the windward side well harden up closehauled same course as yon fortyfour sir lewrie nodded in understanding trading shots with her though sir eighteenpounders are you a coward as well as a fool sir braxton blustered sir i am not lewrie shot back im as ready as you when it comes to fighting this ship i wished to ask if you wanted to overhaul in her best gun range sir or lask down to her on a bowandquarterline allow me to suggest we lask sir then haul our wind cross her stern and rake her sir call me any kind of fool or sham he thought but you never call me a coward you bastard now you go too bloody far as if sensing that he had gone too far braxton stifled a belchlike flood of outrage which rose in his chest and turned away closehauled aye aye sir lewrie parroted going amidships bosun hands to the braces hardsheets lay her fullandby he could see the french frigate from the deck by then long and sleek like a cutdown lineofbattle ship a touch of poop a bit of forecastle with her courses well up over the horizon she swung from dead on their bows to the starboard side just forward of abeam as cockerel turned noreast they would slowly overhaul and headreach her on this course though a couple of miles out of gunnery range or their own alan expected her to haul her wind any moment surely the french lookouts could see the squadrons threatening topsls by then what a bloody wasted effort lewrie thought his senses acute and calculating he felt they should be hauling their wind going for the frog th rate like a terrier then nipping past her stern at close range give her a welltimed broadside then dash on past to get at the merchantmen every ship in sight would share in the prizemoney if one or all of them were taken but cockerel was the only frigate presentthe rest were too far to the south or far to the north of the squadron their misfortune he smirked out of sight out of the running and that was what frigates were for cockerel barreled on surging and slashing at the uncooperative sea slowly headreaching until the french warship was just a bit aft of abeam they could turn now go tearing down on her and still pass within half a cable of her stern if she held her course and did not shorten sail lewrie began to pat his foot in anxiety excuse me sir he asked going back to windward to join his captain should we not allow her fourpointsfree so we may fall to loord onto her sir it is my decision sir now be still braxton hissed wheeling on him the squadron sir will daunt them shell haul wind she cant trade fire with the liners attend to your duties sir sir should she haul her wind theres still the indiamen i gave you an order mister lewrie aye aye sir there dye see hah braxton hooted with scorn suddenly shes falling off at last turning to run now mister lewrie now you may haul our wind gybe and steer soueast aye aye sir he replied evenly damme another puzzle he carped should be due east by god go right for em thisu put us the same distance from the indiamen or the frigate whats braxton playing at bosun prepare to wear to the starboard tack wear sir bosun fairclough gaped from the waist below him aye wear mister fairclough lewrie repeated testily stations for wearing ship main clew garnets buntlines there he called through the speaking trumpet spanker brails weather main and lee braces manned hands darted to the pin rails and fife rails to undo belays on the running rigging to tail on and prepare to take a strain once the lines were free of all but the last overunder hitch on belaying pins come on lads smartly now he urged them manned damnyer eyes smartly i said drive em bosun smartly braxton interrupted lay on yer starters the hands were readying for a wear but it was damn slow workhandsome workchurch work petty officers and midshipmen lathered the slow and the clumsy and there were more than a few on the gangways who were suddenly struck clumsy lewrie noted with rope starters the hands flinched like flicked steers as the starters cracked on their coats but that didnt make them very much faster oh christ lewrie whispered seeing the game for what it was at once come on lads theres a fortune in prizemoney downwind so lets be at it all manned haul taut ready about up mainsl and spanker clear away after bowlines brace in the after yards lewrie turned to the senior quartermaster and in a softer voice cautioned handsomely does it new heading soueast right uphelm quartermaster aye aye sir overhaul weather lifts man the weather braces rise foretack and sheet cockerel fell off the wind heeling harder to starboard laying her shoulder to the sea sloughing and snuffling foam as she lost way and the sea gripped her more firmly with the wind swinging rapidly onto her larboard quarter growing finer and finer lewrie looked to the commissioning pendant aloft then aft judging the best moment to anticipate a stern wind there clear away head bowlines lay the headyards square shift over jib foresheets come on smartly now move he fumed at the crew whose efforts had turned so oxslow so henheaded awkward jaysis bloody the senior helmsman yelped suddenly and lewrie turned his head to see the huge double wheels spokes spinning like a st catherines wheel at a fair the steeringtackle ropes bound round the wheel drum were sizzling and smoking as they unwound themselves no helm sir no helm avast there he called trying to head off disaster back the foresheets flat em in lee braces bosun main and too late cockerel was across the eye of the wind with her after and main yardarms angled to take a stern wind the main and forecourses smothered so far but not for long she carried a lot of weatherhelm and was going to round up for a moment her yards would luff ineffectually then as she swung her bows windward theyll fill againpressing against the masts and spars snapping her upper masts like carrots if they werent quick about it this ought to be damned intrestin lewrie thought with what felt like a stupefied calmness were going to broach this barge lee braces damn you smartly let go weather braces with a tremendous whooshing sound much like a gargantuan bird the spanker filled and flew across the quarterdeck overhead dragging the men of the starboard afterguard tailing on what was now a weather sheet in a tug of war they could never win they let go tumbling in a heap they let go the spanker was a slightly older design a loosefooted trapezoidal sail suspended from a light wooden gaff with the aftermost lowermost corner the clew the attachment point for the sheets with a sharp crack the gaff yard met the much heavier mizzenmast crojack yard which directed the set of the mizzen topsl and spread its foot the spanker gaff shattered of course dangling half the upper length of the spanker like a duck with a broken wing which let it swing further outboard to tangle in the larboard mizzen stays taken by surprise the larboard sheetmen of the afterguard stood slackjawed and slackfingered and let the larboard sheet snake over the side along with the weather sheet both sheets lewrie goggled both the bloody sheets heavyhaul on the braces fore main and crojack he howled as cockerel wallowed now heeling to larboard they could save their masts if the bows could be got down they could steer downwind without the rudder for a time if the hands were quick but the deck was already inclined over twenty degrees of heel and the men were laid back almost parallel to the gangways it wasnt clumsy semimutinous theatrics now they began to slip and fall to go sprawling on their backs to slide to leeward into the bulwarks as their bare feet lost purchase or were dragged towards the pin rails as they tried to hold on to the braces by the enormous pressure of wind on the sails which exerted tons of pull on the lines cockerel groaned in outraged protest as she swung up aweather the wind rapidly clocking forward of abeam laid over so far that water surged high as the gunports on the lee side and the breeching ropes of the starboard battery sang a taut torment masts spars rigging hull her wail was a chorus of danger and the sea surged hungrily at least thout the spanker lewrie thought bitterly we wont have weatherhelm for long or masts either he concluded hanging lightfooted from the starboard mizzen stays by a deathgrip the flattedin jibs and fore staysls saved her pushing down her bows keeping cockerel from broaching though she lay hard over on her larboard side for what seemed like forever her rudder quite ineffective even if it had been attached to something alan whined with a brief terror as he looked down at the hungry ocean at the image of coursesail yards dragging wakes in the sea the ship creaked and moaned with ominous sloshes and thuds echoing from below on the orlop deck roundshot tumbled from their nests along the hatch rims or the rope shotgarlands to bowl down alee and thonkl into bulwarks then cockerel rolled back upright rebounding so quickly that she was flung hard up against the mizzen stays even as she began to pay off the wind at last but she didnt come quite level after that she was still alist to larboard cargo and ballast shifted sure alan thought as his feet at last found a place to stand as he darted for the nettings overlooking the waist bosun he bawled get below and set relieving tackle to the tiller head all hands secure from quarters mister scott take the focsle and foremast set the spritsl foretopsl and forecourse for a run mainmast mizzenmast there topmen aloft trice up and lay out brail up all sail clew up now mister porter mister thorne clew up the mizzen tgallant main course main topsl and tgallant spanishreef em for now afterguard mizzen topsl braces theyd have to have the foresails for drive and a lifting effect making the stern heavier for a repaired helm the mizzen topsl could serve for steering of a rough and clumsy sort the rest of her square sail would be drawn up by the clew lines towards the yards which hung them baggy and batwinged towards the tips of the yardarms close and snug inward towards the masts spanishreefed he dared allow himself at last a deep shaky breath and a look aloft well that didnt help his nerves much he thought blaring his eyes in wonderthere were tgallant and topmast shrouds flying free as the commissioning pendant up yonder and the light upper masts were swaying a lot more than normal as cockerel wallowed from side to side her untended lift lines allowing the yards to droop acockbill what in the name o god dye think yer playing at sir the captain fumed as he made his way amidships of the quarterdeck get the bloody hell outa my way you brainless cunnythumbed captain braxton screamed to all and sundry shaking his fists as if he wished to bloody his knuckles on the quarterdeck gunners and afterguard theyre firing at us midshipman braxton shouted from aloft the french are firing at us sir the th rate had rounded up abeam the wind about four or five miles alee of cockerel the roar of her upperdeck guns could not be heard of course but they could see the puffs of greytan gunpowder erupt from her sides as the fortyfourgunned vessel delivered a slow timed salutea most mocking and derisory salute to their seamanshipbefore hauling her wind once more and loping away eastward to guard her convoy which had used their entertaining diversion to sail away from harm towards the straits of gibraltar cackling their fool heads off alan thought miserably fowkner he called to a senior hand of the afterguard get aloft get a line on the spanker gaffwhats left of it and haul it clear of the shrouds boat hooks you men get the spanker sheets inboard and ready to lower away mister spendlove inform one of the bosuns mates to fetch out one of the stunsl booms and fish it to the broken spanker gaff aye aye sir you sir braxton snarled hatless his fists balled for a fight still as he came to his first lieutenant of all the stupid inept steering tackle parted sir lewrie tried to explain there wasnt much we could that you should have rerove completely before you captain sir lewrie replied you were there when we overhauled it you said yourself you were satisfied you disputatious dog sir braxton shot back think i cant see your game think im blind do you how convenient the hands of a sudden were struck captain sir mister dimmock interrupted from the other side i think a little calm is in order sir least said soonest mended and all that the hands ye know wont do in their hearing sir ill kindly thankee to keep out of this sir braxton sneered i want your advice ill ask for it now be silent no sir dimmock quailed though determined to have his say at last not this time youre saying mister lewrie put the people up to it is that your meaning sir and i say that is wrong sir were it not for his quick wits wed have rolled the sticks right out of her sir frankly captain braxton cockerels damn lucky somebody kept their wits about em when perfectly sound steeringtackle ropes snapped at the worst possible moment tackle you did inspect sir braxton seethed turned red as turkey wattles but realised he was in the wrong place to shout the dread word mutiny how dare you sir deign to interfere he hissed in a much more private though much more threatening voice there may be trouble mongst our people sir dimmock told him in a mutter but i may swear to you on a stack o bibles tis none of mister lewries doing dimmock had such a way of canting his accents of laying stress on innocuous words that his meaning was quite clear at that moment and quite accusatory too though were his statements recalled at any court martial verbatim they could sound quite innocent hed as much as implied that the source of the crews unrest lay solely with captain braxton hed further implied that when cockerel had come nigh broaching her captain had uttered no orders for her salvation you as well sir braxton sniffed raring back with outrage sir you cant believe that were all as boom from windward windsor castle had fired a forecastle chase gun to get cockerels attention she and the rest of the squadron were completely hullup to them and had been flying do you require assistance for some minutes until at last their admiral had become so exasperated at their lack of notice hed ordered a gun touched off the lineabreast warships were going to pass cockerel closeaboard soon as she staggered soueast with the wind right up her stern and they continued eastnoreast in chase of the french convoy some of them might have to alter course to avoid her slowing that pursuit even more from the flag sir midshipman braxton screeched aloft do you require assistance it reads sir we can see that from the deck damn you lewrie hailed upward god help your slack arse mister midshipman braxton he vowed hed have the lad bent over a gun should the devil himself dare to cross him what reply do you wish to send sir he asked the captain in a more civil tone no braxton thundered we require no assistance very well sir mister spendlove youre free aft hoist a negative aye aye sir might ease the starboard mizzen topsl braces mister lewrie dimmock advised in his proper role of sailing master haul taut on the larboard and we may be able to pressure her round more eastrd thankee mister dimmock should i attend to that sir alan asked the captain braxtons mouth worked in anger to fly up as lubberly as some firsttime lake sailor in a dinghy to completely ignore a signal of their flagship his abiding wish that cockerel distinguish herself as the best frigate in the fleet was in shambles i have the deck sir braxton snarled at last do you attend the purser below were alist sir ballast has shifted stores i vow youve done quite enough for one day sir aye aye sir lewrie replied as chearly as he might whoo neckornothin there for a moment hey sir banbrook the marine crowed fanning himself with his hat as he and oneal came up from the waist on your way see whats taking mister fairclough so long to repair the steering tackle braxton continued i shall sir lewrie vowed doffing his hat in salute i say mister lewrie sir banbrook nattered on nearing their small gathering completely unaware of any problems now that the ship no longer appeared to be in danger of sinking might i suggest captain sir that the masteratarms take a muster lewrie dared to suggest hard as we were slung about itd be a miracle were no topmen dashed over the side sir umph the captain grunted calling for his son to attend to it then i shall go below sir lewrie said in parting uhm mister lewrie sir bout the whoretransport lieutenant banbrook inquired breezily all these repairs and wotnot does this mean we miss our turn with her sir good god lewrie thought appalled not now you blitherin captain oneal took banbrooks arm to jerk him out of earshot coughing fit to diemuch too late of course the what captain braxton roared wheeling to look at banbrook with a mixture of utter loathing and complete incomprehension on his phiz the bloody what sir the whoretransport sir lieutenant banbrook began gaily the one the wardroom told me about a very tardy realisation struck the young marine officer at last the one with the uhm he stammered blushing beet red as he discovered himself the goat of their cruel jape well the whores aboard who come alongside and get off my deck get off my quarterdeck you useless damn fool the captain screamed again in full cry and with a suitable target for his pentup wrath i want this tailors dummy under close arrest captain oneal under close arrest sir time to bolt lewrie thought he made his way down a quarterdeck ladder down the midships companionway hatch safely out of screeching range as the full fury of the captains storm broke the first people he met as he attained the orlop deck were the ships carpenter mister dallimore and his carpenters crew all of whom were hugging carline posts and each other sniggering and chortling horeship megawd one of them wheezed taint funny damn yer eyes lewrie snapped look at this bloody mess mister dallimore huge water butts saltrations barrels beer kegs piled ships stores half the wellordered stowage on the orlop was now lumbered loose to larboard theyd be half the watch shifting it the waisters and idlers such as dallimores people and probably require marines to pitch in too to shift ballast in the bilges aye sir sorry sir dallimore tried to reply though it was more like a strangling sneezing sound get to work there turn a hand and stop that snivling aye aye sir lewrie stomped stifflegged aft to the tiller head in the midshipmens cockpit the bosun and a few senior able seamen were finishing up the first vital part of the repairs stringing a blockandtackle series to the tiller head so cockerel could be steered from the cockpit with helm orders relayed down from the quarterdeck reroving new rope and longsplicing old would take longer before the wheel would serve whipstaff an windlass mister lewrie sir fairclough told him but twill do f r now weve our rudder back herdson go on deck and inform the captain lewrie ordered aye aye sir buggered sir fairclough grunted shifting his quid when how lewrie demanded lookee ere sir fairclough whispered drawing his attention to a squarish hole in an overhead deck beam hard by where one of the turning blocks for the tiller ropes would pass looks tme sir if a rattrail raspz drove in ere itd chafe th steerin tackle sore mister lewrie evertime a spoker two was put over theres frayin on the lines aye but ye can see where someun couldnt wait an cut it sometime after we went to quarters i suppose lewrie sighed aye sir else the younkersda seed it bein done and fairclough shrugged heavily lifting thick brows in studied perplexity and i didnt think theyd found leaders yet lewrie muttered softly looks like they have though aye sir fairclough agreed sounding shifty and truculent damme alan recalled suddenlydallimore and his crewthey had a tool box with em rasps punches hammers saws and drawknives and id wager it wasnt just banbrooks lunatick gaff set em to laughing the newcomers the lubbers the waisters theyd never think of such a stunt it was the experienced crewmen whod know how to disable the ship whod know how to make the landsmen slip fall or look clumsy whod know just how far they could go without really disabling cockerel or endangering her or themselves a word to the wise mister fairclough lewrie said sternly finding another conspirator in the way the bosun could not seem to meet his intent gaze and i believe you might just have a very good idea of who those wise are hey there will be no more once was the limit and there will be no morel because if there is another occurrence if things go farther than it wont be floggings for the ones involved itll be courtsmartial and that means the noose for em and if im forced to search out the man or men who hobbled our ship i swear to god ill have their nutmegs off with a dull knife do you understand me plain mister fairclough aye sir fairclough nodded sadly signal sent read and understood i believe then alan said the crews and mine aye aye sir and a further word of warning bosun theyd best be the finest crew a captain could ask for from now onelse even hell take notice and flay em to bloody rags first and scrag em second aye aye sir fairclough huffed looking as if he wished to be anyplace but there at the moment getting flayed himself best behaviour sir lewrie went back amidships to find the purser his jack in the breadroom a working party of gangway idlers the sailmaker carpenter and their crews with marine help heaving nigh to ruptures to set the shambles right he slithered and scaled the piles forward to the cable tiers for a better view there somewhat separated from the hands and in delayed but shuddery relief that cockerel hadnt been dismasted hadnt broached or rolled completely keelup and killed him he began to snicker to himself he put a hand to his mouth looking as if he was about to cast his accounts to jonah as an uncontrollable lunatick fit of mirth quite took him lewrie was forced to duck deep into the cable tiers amid the stinking mile of thighthick hawsers for privacy whoretransport he whispered to the darkness and then he began to laugh himself sick until his sides hurt chapter thats a newun captain sir thomas byard captain of windsor castle and flagcaptain of their squadron remarked with a quirky look as he tugged his nose i must pass it on to our senior midshipmen to try out on the younkers much droller than sending them on deck to hear the dogfish bark and your leftenant banbrook is still confined to cabins uhm no sir thomas lewrie replied now that he had his wits back his close arrest ended after the second dogwatch hmm good sir thomas approved then looked around the quarterdeck at cockerels frazzled professionals so he demanded in a semijoshing tone why could you not have done this well yesterday to that though lewrie could have no answer nor could any of the officers or warrants a little after breakfast in the morning watch hms cockerel had been ordered to close windsor castle and take station under the flags lee quickly followed by the dread summons captain repair on board off braxton had gone in his gig with a thick canvas packet of ledgers and documents under his arm but most surprisingly over had stroked captain byards gig and once he had been received aboard with proper honours and had been genteelly introduced he had begun issuing most disconcerting orders strike topmasts mister lewrie he had snapped sir strike topmasts i said for the rest of the morning watch and through the entire forenoon cockerel had been exercised they had stripped her down to the fighting tops and gantlines in a credible halfhour then hoisted the topmasts spars sails and shrouds aloft once more they had beattoquarters heaved empty kegs over the side and made passes at them with the greatguns booming theyd gone through cutlass and musketry drill officers and hands alike then it had been signalling practice towing the ship with the boats lowering the larboard bower into a cutter and pretending to anchor to it theyd passed towing cables to the flagship then cast them free and winched them back aboard with the capstans an hour had been spent making and reducing sail reefing down for heavy weather or setting all to the royals with stunsls on the fore and main course yards then theyd practiced fetchingto wearing tacking and weaving through the line of slowplodding lineofbattle ships like a waterwalker skittering round leaves in a fish pond there had been fire drills manoverboard drills more going to quarters and shooting at crates thrown over the side very good mister lewrie you may set your regular watchbill aye aye sir mister scott you have the watch bosun pipe the change of watch larboard division on deck starboard division to be relieved aye aye sir bosun fairclough shouted back from the waist he hauled out his silver bosuns pipe and began a shrill on the spithead nightingale well done mister fairclough sir thomas called down to him after his pipe was done and hed bellowed his orders in a voice that could carry to windward in a full gale still have it i see aye sir thomas an grand it be tsee ya once again sir you were shipmates sir thomas lewrie asked trying to find a polite way of mopping his streaming face with a handkerchief after a long trying morning of funk sweat robust when terrible toby had his first warrant and i was fourth officer sir sir thomas chuckled i went shares to purchase his pipe damn good man is terrible toby and still is sir thomas lewrie assured him i am gratified to hear it sir what time do you make it uhm halfpast noon sir lewrie replied after producing his watch from a fob pocket in his breeches my apologies for delaying the hands dinner then and clear decks and up spirits is your captain braxton one to splice the mainbrace mister lewrie no sir thomas he is not so far this passage at least alan imparted that with a straight face biting his cheek pity i should not wish to call for anything your captain may not allow but they did well i thought did they not sir very well captain byard lewrie agreed then it is my wish that you this once at least indulge me aye aye sir mister fairclough mister husie captain sir thomas byard commands we splice the mainbrace that raised perhaps the first cheer ever heard aboard cockerel the daily rum issue would be full measure with no deductions for men on punitive deprivement no sippers or gulpers owed amongst them three cheer fr th flagcapum lads fairclough demanded of them and it was lustily answered hip hip hooray toady lewrie thought cynically still maybe he thinks sir thomasll pluck him out of this damn ship hmm might suit toby you smile mister lewrie sorry sir alan sobered at once its just hard to feature mister fairclough having a diminutive of his christian name called him terrible cause he was a holy terror eyes in the back of his head bad as a masteratarms was toby taut hand firm but fair though once hed seasoned sir thomas reminisced with joy i seem to recall one of our frigate captains told me of you sir i believe you have the good fortune to own an acquaintance with keith ashburn of tempest keith sir lewrie grinned completely his first of the day aye sir thomas i do pray sir do you meet with him in future i would be much obliged should you be able to give to him my warmest and most heartfelt regards and my congratulations hes made post and his to you sir had it not slipped my mind until this instant sir thomas nodded i believe further that he told me you had a sobriquet of your own sir ramcat lewrie youre known as how come you by that sir uhm my choice of pet aboard ship sir alan fumbled feeling that was the safest explanation ah i see lady byards fond of em god knows why eat the dormice heartbreak in the nursery then give me a good hound any day sir thomas grumped odd mister lewrie other man fresh meat on the hoof forrud in the manger i cant recall any animals aboard you do not this commission bring a pet with you captain braxton does not allow pets captain byard devil you say sir thomas snapped windsor castle s loaded with em ive a pup of my own from the last litter just the one o course but pets do wonders to improve the morale of the hands i quite agree sir thomas alan answered quickly i also note the flagcaptain said pulling at his nose once more your crew labours in dead silence een now yonder now theyre queued up for their grog theyre quiet as mice why captains orders sir he prefers it that way good practice perhaps no bawling aloft and back a twitch of a halliard is good as a bellow specially in a rawblowing gale a tug on a brace is as good as a wink yet any skylarking allowed sir make and mend ropeyarn sundays hornpipes in the dogs uhm the captain is not completely satisfied with them yet sir thomas lewrie squirmed trying to find a safe answer yet a way to impart some clueand wishing not for the first time that a junior officer could just blurt out raw truth to a senior one may not presume to speak for ones commanding officer sir towards his motives but were a new crew with most of them landsmen and lubbers and it may be that captain braxton is more used to a welldrilled john company crew they have not yet met his standards captain byard raw men that obtains in every ship in the fleet mister lewrie sir thomas scoffed i cannot guess your captains standards either but were i a younger man entrusted with such a smart frigate id be over the moon that my crew had shaken down so nicely in such brief practice that did not require an answer until sir thomas pressed him to give an opinion all alan could do was nod enthusiastically well hard as i pressed i can find no fault in cockerel sir shes weathered my scrutiny smart as paint all of you did thankee kindly for your good opinion sir thomas keep it up though byard warned in a softer more intimate voice i dont need tell you my admirals wroth with you me sir oh damme with cockerel i should have said byard expanded a convoy a deuced rich frog convoy and all that prizemoney lost and a french national ship allowed a laugh at the royal navys expense more to the point sir at admiral cosbys expense dye see i should imagine so sir thomas alan nodded somberly deaf dumb and blind swarming about like a fart in a trance and cunnythumbed seamanship dear lord sir sir thomas winced as if recalling his viceadmirals tirade of the day before it cheered lewrie to imagine that tirade though surely captain braxton had spent the past six hours in a living hell and had gotten at least the afterglow of all that rancour heaped upon his head soon as hed gained cosbys greatcabins had this ship not performed so well this morning well then heads would have rolled sir indeed they would have good god i saved the bastard from dismissal alan wondered or did i save myself no heads to roll no brutal shaking up then what a bleak idea more of the bloody same with official sanction order your officer of the watch to close windsor castle mister lewrie sir thomas instructed put us under her lee once more and i shall take my leave of you aye aye sir mister scott stations for wearing ship close the flagship in her lee very good sir scott rejoined then began bawling orders that will give me a few minutes to speak with terrible toby before i do though sir thomas concluded with a searching glance aye sir thomas is there anything pertinent i might be remiss in asking sir any matter youd care to impart concerning cockerel oh christ lewrie sagged in bewilderment i cant one simply cant its not on thats insubordination disloyalty he seems as if he sees whats going on but its not a direct order to tell him its only a request god make it order i there is nothing which strikes me at present sir thomas he was forced to intone though keeping his eyes level and unblinking as he locked gazes with the flagcaptain and hoping the misery and the lack of enthusiasm in his voice might make the first shoe drop i see byard harumphed softly neither disappointed nor disapproving but with no hint of approbation for loyalty either leaving lieutenant lewrie to wonder just exactly what the hell i see really meant iv quae classe dehinc effusa procorum bella ah what wars shalt thou see when the suitors pour forth from the fleet valerius flaccus argonautica book chapter it was surprisingly cool in the mediterranean so cool that charcoal braziers and a goodly supply of fuel had to be taken aboard once cockerel had victualled at gibraltar though the fires had to be extinguished at pm each evening along with all glims or lanthorns their meek efforts did transform the wardroom to a fair measure of comfort after a fourhour watch in a raw chill wind fluky too the mediterranean was compared to other oceans lewrie had experienced first of all there were no tides to reckon with which could be a blessing otherwise though he thought it a perverse bitch of a sea there were perils enough in the irregular and unpredictable changes of currents that could put them miles out of any reliable fix of their position and the winds were wickedly fickle backing or veering as confusingly as the bahamas in high summer the frigate might beamreach east with the wind steady to larboard in the forenoon watch yet be taken aback by a capricious shift and end the day beating closehauled on starboard tack to make the same easting the beaches they saw when close inshore on patrol were pebbly rock strewn with only a thin rime of sand beach and many anchorages were treacherous rockybottom holding groundsor the worst sort of semiliquid mud that swallowed anchors but gave no secure purchase to the flukes and there were the dread levantersbrisk easterlies arising off turkey that could roar down in a twinkling with no highpiled bit of stormcloud warning at least the siroccos out of moorish africa down south which could arise just as quickly were prefaced by bluffs of hazy sandcoloured cloud fronts which appeared as substantial as an arid landfalls mountains positively frigid not cool was the most apt word for the ships mood though following the crews brief moment of rebellion and captain braxtons return from the flagship with his face suffused as a strangled bullock floggings had abated though not ended some men still had to go to the gratings for real not imagined offences when they did go their allotted number of lashes still remained high but lieutenant braxton walked smaller and morosely bitter about the other commission and warrant officers no longer the raging pit bull neither did the younger braxton midshipmen tear through the ship cackling with glee in their hunt for victims though victims they still discovered among the foolhardy and the stupid what was most surprising to all was the sea change in captain braxton he was rarely seen on deck and kept to his greatcabins for the most part most mystifyingly those abundant occasions which had summoned him forth in the past fretful to supervise the least evolution looming ominously over junior officers and hands alike until they were done to his satisfactionthose he now waved off and left to his subordinates unless it truly was serious enough to endanger the ship when lewrie reported to him now captain braxton seemed careworn and spent as if command of a kings ship was something with which he could no longer be bothered their relationship never of the best had degenerated to a stiff icily formal and punctilious politeness a rigid nicety between two men of the merest acquaintance both with the manners of lords an observer unfamiliar with the situation might have concluded yet lewrie could sometimes espy the quickdarting resentment of old in his glare hear the tiniest rasp of abhorrence in the mans toneas if captain braxton were biding his time waiting for some unguarded moment when he could drop his sham of formal politeness and get his own back and the hands well they were as efficient as ever they had been on their best days that is they still performed their labours in silence yet in the second dogs before sunset on the mess deck some now dared to jape and raise their voices to a somewhat normal level lewrie was pleasantly surprised now and then to hear the scrape of a fiddle the peeping of a flageolet a chorus of rough male voices harmonising over an old song or a single shaky tenor lilting rhapsodic below decks never on the weatherdeckcockerel sometimes softly trembled to the stamp of bare horny feet as old hands taught new hands the way to do a true tars hornpipe each sunday after divisions inspections and a perfunctory divine service there was nowif only because the flagship decreed ita make and mend in the day watches weather and duties permitting and once a month in the dreary three months which had followed there had been ordained a ropeyarn sunday a whole day in which the crew caulked or yarned slept or chatted repaired clothing and hammocks carved snuff boxes and brooches out of dried chunks of salt meat which took a high gloss and lasted long as most woods made ship models or intricately woven twine articlescoin purses belts and bracelets brooches rings and knife lanyards with such untilthenunknown ease they should have seemed a happier lot now they were treated like an experienced and trusted ships company but they were not their grudge against the navy and the captain was by then too deep the damage done could not be undone in three months and their resentment would continue to fester they would serve the ship yes but nothing could make them glad about it as first lieutenant alan was alarmed by their continuing bad mood almost as much as he had been by their earlier bitter silence a crew could be cowed into trembling obedience for only so long before an explosion occurred they had proved that yet a crew allowed too much indiscipline by a slack captain was just as bad and would result in much the same sort of explosion if they thought they could get away with anything that entered their heads look at bligh after his long idle months at anchor at otaheiti lewrie thought whatever had transpired aboard windsor castle whatever reason for captain braxtons indifference and the sudden abatement of his tooharsh tauthandedness this particular stewpot lidded too long had been relieved much too quickly it had not boiled over thanks be to god but it still could for braxtons recent aloofness from the ships company and the seeming disdain he now had for how his juniors ran cockerel was sign to the crew that they had won some sort of victory over him let them think they had the upper hand even for a moment and they would lose respect for all authority even a junior such as lewrie knew that a man could not command a kings ship inconsistently blowing cool one day and hot the next being harsh and tyrannical one moment and gentle and considerate as a mother with her babe another day it sowed confusion and disrespect at the moment though cockerels captain pretended to command and the crew pretended to obey him leaving lewrie and the rest in a worse predicament as the only enforcers of authority the ones who were forced to use the lash and restrictions to prevent the men from believing that their lot could be changed sadly alan concluded that the tiny tooclever mutinyette should have been the entire raucous show complete with brass bands and fireworks a real cutlasswaving rebellion or it should never have happened at all at least the first instance would have been put down from without braxton courtmartialed and found responsible and no matter the blight on ones career it would have been over and done with and he would be in another ship the hands parcelled outthose not hung in tar and chains from gibraltar gibbets until their bones fell apartto other ships as well where they would find new captains who werent brutes and would finally discover what pleasure it could be to serve under someone firm but fair in the second instance though there had been no way to avoid it happening not with oh the devil with it lewrie muttered sadly taking stock of the world far aft by the taffrails once again thankee jesus we need a little help here cause just when i think it cant get any darker here we are in the darkest chapter penny postman captain braxton sneered in disgust once he had clambered back aboard he bore more packets than those hed taken with him when hed departed to die summons of captain repair on board from hms victory here mister lewrie these im told will come in handy for cooperation with our new allies see the officers of the watch and the midshipmen have em learned quickly our new allies sir lewrie inquired signal books braxton harumphed sourly so we may talk with the goddamned dons were allies with spain i see sir lewrie replied levelly though it was hellish hard to fathom how that had come about after so many years of war mistrust condemning each other as either heretics to catholicism or brisketbeating papist devils for all we hate em since drake and raleighs days the armada and all lewrie thought englishmen burned at the stake tortured by the inquisition hung as pirates well some of em were pirates o course is the ship ready in all respects for sea mister lewrie aye sir he was relieved to be able to announce then we shall weigh at once braxton ordained were bound to naples despatches for the british ambassador crack on all sail once round europa point commensurate with the weather inform mister dimmock he is to plot us the most direct course twixt corsica and sardinia aye aye sir bosun pipe all hands stations for weighing anchor and getting underway and he thought sadly so much for even finding if weve any mail from home or getting a chance to explore fabled gibraltar it was a rough passage days of the mediterranean s usual fluky winds glowering skies wind and rain at least once or twice a day between tantalising glimmers of sunlight butting into levanters with green seas breaking over their frigates beakhead and forecastle and seething in foaming offwhite sheets of water on the gangways and gun deck soaking through the planking joins soaking through the gaps in pounded oakum insulation and tarred seams to drizzle clammy and cold on swaying hammocked offwatch sleepers or the mess tables when men fed even the wardroom was not spared everyone was chilled and miserable with no chance to dry out bedding or a change of clothing from one watch to the next and this was only late june occasionally though the winds veered more abeam the skies cleared somewhat and the dank belowdecks and upper works steamed in sunshine and cockerel laid so thick a mist about her from drying timbers that she fumed as if on fire then she could crack on eastward her shoulder to the sea and lope like the lean ocean greyhound that she was across what the classic poets called a winedark sea power and wind humming in the rigging her quickwork hissing and drumming as she ploughed impatiently over wavecrests furrowing ocean to a wide frothing swath on either beam that was the kind of sailing that sometimes made it all worthwhile that furious bustling that paean to neptune singing aloft and the dun sails stretched taut as drumheads perfectly angledfor a time only a time on any wind and seaa ship making the best of her way on her best point of sail quickstirring and alive welcoming warmer well to be frank downright hottish was the bay of naples where they dropped anchor a week later in the lee so to speak of that fuming ogre of ill repute vesuvius a stonetoss away from the ruins of ancient roman pompeii as something of a classical scholar in his prenavy days at a myriad of schools and were one exceeding charitable about those scholastic attainments mind lewrie was entranced whod have thought he asked himself that he would ever have a chance to actually see the places mentioned in his dul bonedry latin recitations that roman imperial translations would ever be anything more than garbled verbs incorrect genders and tenses and canings on his bottom yet here he was here it was before his eyes a city so roman he halfexpected it to be a phantasm sort of like having an ancient statue in the entry hall become animate and begin carping about the temperature it didnt seem real all he had to do was wake or blink even before the best bower had been let go and the kedge rowed out even as they sailed into the bay of naples on a topsl breeze he thought the place magical innately more inspiriting than any of the other places hed seen so far in the mediterranean anchored a bare quartermile offshore of the main harbour and the quays naples seemed to teem with an open exuberantly cheerful elbowing and dodging zest fishing smacks oddly rigged and exotic looking as if they had not changed one iota since their like had been carved in grecoroman basreliefs ghosted about cockerel at the quays fantastic arabiclooking merchantmen and coastal traders lay sternto to the piers almost ashore on the harbourfront roadways sporting short masts and long lateener booms garishly painted with eyes below their bows to guide them home music hubblebubble the screaks and clangs of wheeled commerce and soft liquid foreign jabber drifted offshore from the many openair wine bars and cook shops from chandlers stores and warehouses so too did enticingly alien aromas of cooking of unknown but beguiling savoury spices and dishes hed never tasted he felt his saliva froth after six months of plaincommons ships fare he could almost hear eggs sizzling as they first struck a hot pan the succulent juices dripping from fresh meat onto coals the cheery gurgle of wine aromatic and purply red as it was poured fresh wines that hadnt been jogged about on the orlop deck and were neapolitan wines cheap well they probably were still fresher and more appetizing than the wardrooms cheap clarets and bumboat ports from lisbon or the pursers thin and sour bythekeg issue wines theyd been forced to buyblack strap a bilious tannerytasting red and miss taylor a hocklike white that could stun barnacles and they would be clearer than ships wine all cloudy with wavestirred lees food fresh hot food an entire new cuisine that had nothing to do with bland english ordinaries something beyond the regimen of overboiled or overroasted salt meat rank from a brine cask or the desiccated reconstituted portable navy soup boat sir mister fairclough asked breaking his gastronomic fantasies row bout an square th yards sir aye bosun and keep the bumboats off us captains gig unner th starboard mainmast chains sir ready tgo very well carry on the local bumboats aswarm already hovering to either beam the jobbers and pimps were shouting their wares waving strawcovered jugs or long thin stone bottles bragging on their doxies waiting for the easy pendant to be hoisted and what fetchin doxies too lewrie thought after a peek at his watch and a frown at what might be keeping captain braxton below bountiful sloeeyed raventressed young girls in almost every boat not an artificial blonde in sight smooth dusky olive shoulders bared by lowcut peasant blouses shapely mostly lower legs in view below the hems of brightsatinshiny and elaborately embroidered skirts clad in white cotton or silk hose some were tricked out with parasols garish hats tarted up in castoff sack gowns but in hues never seen in staid old england they waved too giggling and cooing at cockerels lovestarved hands hawking their own delights with all the open and amorous airs such as lewrie imagined the ancient romans might at one of their pagan fertility festivals christ lewrie moaned softly in a halfstrangled and heartfelt cheep of lust and shuddering with how intense that sudden bout of lust felt six long months at sea six long months apart from home and hearth from bedding and no i dasnt he cautioned himself i cannot seven years im wed and damn well too father of three for gods sake times are diff rent now besides im first officer theres an example to set for im an example to to just bloody whom his passions countered querulously no im past thirty im past all that the othersd talk and itd get back to well maybe it wouldnt ah but the captain damn is eyes hates me worse than cold boiled mutton i doubt hed give me leave to set a singleoof ashore this commission just to be bastardly about it well damme where is the old turd after all captain braxton had been on deck all during their foul weather as spooky as st elmos ghost in his white tarpaulins a grim brooding spectre far aft of the helm fair weather times though and most happily the last day or two hed all but abandoned the quarterdeck to his juniors which had made their brisk passage even more joyous pop his head up over the coaming of his private after companionway ladder now and again between daysleeps to snore off his silent foulweather vigils perhaps like his son hugh coyly playing peepeye yet the ship was anchored bow and stern her sails furled and the quarterdeck awnings were strung for cooling shade and his boat was waiting with still no sign of him the glazed panels of the skylight coachtop aft of the wheel were still closed snug it would be stuffy in the greatcabins lewrie knew for certain stuffy as sunday dinner with the inlaws what could be keeping him i wish to see the captain corporal scarrett aye sir the marine sentry nodded slamming his musket butt on the deck and barking out fuhst awf cer sah no reply from within the gundeck entry lewrie and corporal scarrett exchanged puzzled frowns captain sir lewrie called again still no answer lewrie opened the doorway and stepped into the shuttered gloom of the narrow passage between the chartroom and the dining coach mister lewrie really sir mister boutwell the captains clerk snapped fussily as he came bustling forrud to confront him mister boutwell the ship is moored and the captains gig is in the water ready to carry him ashore lewrie waved off impatiently hes despatches for the british ambassador letters to ahem boutwell coughed into a plump fist sir how captain braxton is not well thankee jesus alan delighted to himself youve summoned mister pruden the surgeon he asked though with seeming and becoming sudden concern is it serious well sir tis hardly a matter for a ships surgeon mister lewrie boutwell countered blocking his way as alan tried to get past him laying a civiliansoft writers fist on his chest unhand me sir lewrie hissed damn your blood what ails him thats not serious enough for the surgeon but keeps him from his duty i have to see for myself to ascertain how bad it is and how long he may be incapacitated really mister lewrie boutwell whined all but wringing his hands as lewrie shouldered him aside he in desperation seized lewries arm to impede him i warned you to keep your hands off me sir lewrie snapped though stopped for another moment im an english gentleman and a sea officer peopleve been flogged for less specially aboard this ship now what ails him sir uh boutwell deflated withering in stature without the partition to the day cabin sir captain braxton served many years in the far east there i fear he once contracted malaria it comes upon him now and again as an everrecurring fever once took you know of course you do mister lewrie you were in the east too youve seen how it takes a man i have to see him mister boutwell lewrie insisted fever or no very well boutwell surrendered opening the partition door a foetid sickbed odour struck his senses at once there lay captain braxton swaddled in every blanket he possessed tucked in as snug as a babys swaddles in the thick coverlet with his dark blue watchcloak and foulweather tarpaulin atop shivering like a drowning victim fresh plucked from an icy shipwreck his steward was setting out a fresh cedar bucket by the side of the hanging cot and grimacing manfully as he lifted the used one at arms length to dump its gruesome contents out the transom sash window the only one that was left open and that only for the length of his duty a seacoal fire was fuming in a brazier nearby making the greatcabins bed space a breath from hell itself m more coals braxton managed to say between chattering teeth bloody jesus im so cold sir w what devil you want s sir ge get out this instant braxton growled from wobbly jaws mister boutwell i must insist the surgeon see him lewrie sighed though not without a measure of secret glee if braxton got sick enough and if official notice of his condition was taken among higher authorities surely hed be relieved of his command another promising officer a commander say or one of hoods admirals flagcaptains would suddenly be on his own bottom in a fine frigate hes had the headaches the sweats yet mister boutwell lieutenant lewrie inquired last evening sir the clerk informed him and you did not think to inform me then sir lewrie chid him sternly damme were talking about a kings ship sir had we been brought to action by a french vessel run into another gale and us unknowing you carry personal family loyalty too far sir you are not an officer who may make such a decision lieutenant the second officer bade me and he has no right to conceal anything from me either sir an offence worthy of a court martial im bound mister lewrie this mustnt i mean surely you cannot think of boutwell pleaded though on very shaky ground now that tables had turned on him you have your diff rences but for gods sake t toddy braxton whinnied from deep within his covers oblivious to their spat hot his steward ran to fetch a toddy stirring in powdered quinine jesuits bark the rob of lemons hot water and a goodly dollop of brandy eager as captain braxton wished to seize it and drain it his hands shivered so badly his steward had to prop him up and almost spoon it down him ounce at a time lewrie noted that there were several empty bottles loose atop the wine cabinet in the day cabin the doors stood open revealing a suspicious scantity the captain had depleted his personal stores in private thinking to ward off or burn out any onset of fever barrel fever more like it lewrie thought disgustedly hearty as he liked his spirits good as any english gentleman the sight of a fellow who should know better gunnls awash was repulsive hell not cure himself with spirits mister boutwell lewrie told the cringing clerk you take that right away from him now and you will admit the surgeon at once thank god were in port and if anybody knows malaria its dons and dagoes we may have to send for a physician from shore if he gets bad enough and well you know it either that or he dies if mister prudens physick fails us quinine and hot water only sugar it to make it palatable if you must but no more brandy nor any other drink get out those despatches they have to go ashore and theyre late enough already you will not boutwell asked hopefully let him get back on his feet first sir if he will lewrie sighed but we must deal with your conniving and lieutenant braxtons lack of sense later now fetch me those despatches yes sir boutwell cringed thats aye aye sir mister boutwell even the marines say it youve been aboard ship long enough to learn our ways surely aye aye sir boutwell parroted meekly worriedly chapter sir william will see you now lieutenant lewrie the majordomo informed him with the lofty nosehigh air common to all clerks to important men lewrie rose from his comfortable chair shot his cuffs settled sword and waistcoat and followed the mincing twit into the presence of his betters sir william your excellency allow me to announce lieutenant lewrie royal navy of the cockerel frigate sirs lieutenant lewrie the flunky said smoothly with a grandiloquent gesture towards the two elegantly garbed gentlemen chummily seated to either side of a massive marbletopped desk sir william hamilton his britannic majesty king george the thirds ambassadorplenipotentiary to the court of the kingdom of naples and the two sicilies further allow me to present you to his excellency sir john acton baronet prime minister of the kingdom of naples and the two sicilies and to his majesty king ferdinand the fourth sir william milord acton your excellencies lewrie began making a deep bow and leg to them hat over his heart it is my honour to convey to you sir william most immediate despatches from admiral lord hood and thank god for malaria he thought smug over this opportunity to make the acquaintance of important people thankful for a chance to sport showy and doubting if braxton could have pulled it off with as much innate grace he stepped forward and laid his canvaswrapped tape and ribandbound sealed packet on the vast expanse of pale grey marble he was glad to be shot of them frankly they were weighted with grapeshot and were the very devil to carry for long ahum hah sir william began drawing the bundle to him and cutting the tapes with a desk knife after assuring himself that seals had not been tampered with and where is our illustrious admiral hood at present leftenant lewrie we departed gibraltar a week ago sir william the fleet was at that instant putting to sea twentytwo sail of the line our orders were that we might rejoin off cape cicie or cape sepet somewhere off marseilles or toulon he had had time to glean that much from the separate set of orders also weighted and marked for captain hms cockerels eyes only under the circumstances hed had to look at them you are rather junior to command a frigate i am thinking sir john acton commented as ambassador hamilton read his despatches humming to himself his ancient patrician face creased with flickerings of concern or satisfaction by stages i am merely first officer your excellency i regret to say that my captain captain howard braxton was uhm detained aboard by ships business else he should have really sir john drawled lifting one expressive brow such would have been unthinkable when i was at sea a captain entrusted with matters of such import and he fails to present himself sends a junior in lieu of himself pardon but i have never heard the like sir john acton sounded english sort of he was fluent but his voice had a more mediterranean lilt to it a subtle shading a lack of true english syntax and usage perhaps from long custom among dagoes lewrie thought you served in the royal navy did you milord lewrie asked to finesse the subject ah no i never had that honour sir acton sighed wistfully i speak of my time as an officer in the french navy bloody hell lewrie gawped and this frogwell hes an english baronethalfafrog is sittin in spying hearing all at the side of an english ambassador what sort o business they do in naples uhm hah lewrie flummoxed i alarm you sir acton all but simpered i was born of english parentage but in france naval matters diplomatic duties i am regretful to say i have never been in england i served also with the tuscan and the neapolitan navies as well before rising to the office of prime minister here in naples tell me lieutenant lewrie did your gallant lord hood also entrust youyour captain pardonwith any messages to his majesty king ferdinand the fourth uhni no sir your excellency none im aware of unless a letter is in that package to be relayed to you through sir william lewrie felt a sudden urge to fan himself with his hat and tug at his tootight neckstock so much for sportin showy he sighed ah surely though sir john sighed in concert all but biting his thumbnail and turning a hopeful eye on sir william as events develop but no how distressing sir john old fellow admiral lord hood would certainly not be guilty of presuming to speak beyond his brief sir william assured the younger man lewrie thought acton was in his late thirties or early forties sir william hamilton in a spry sort of sixties events are as you say developing quite nicely in point of fact our ambassador to his most catholic majesty in madrid lord st helens encloses his latest success the spanish are in at last aha sir john smiled gaining enthusiasm we were given signal books so we might speak any spanish ship we met sir william lewrie offered and did you meet any leftenant lewrie sir william smiled aye sir a whole fleet of them seventeen sail of the line with frigates on our passage here on the second of july already at sea aha sir john exclaimed uhm on their way back to cartagena your excellency their hoist said they had scurvy aboard and were running short of rations theyd been at sea a little less than two months aha sir william sighed much less cheered by that news in point of fact quite deflated lewrie shrugged his comment what could one expect of dons a damn finelooking fleet of ships but the men the officers and such scurvy after less than two months at sea puhmease yet admiral lord hood is by now surely off toulon and marseilles sir william continued to blockade the ports bottle up the french mediterranean fleet in toulon or bring it to battle should they come out he has succeeded in joining his scattered squadrons and uniting them as one twentytwo sail of the line and sir john we both know as does leftenant lewrie that when the royal navy gets to sea there they stay i am most confident the spanish fleet will after replenishing stores at cartagena be able to join him off cape cicie creating an irresistible force or carry ashore as hmm une flotte respectable sir william mon cher the prime minister blathered on for a moment as we tentatively agreed oops ah shit lewrie cringed time for me to scamper they want to talk something secret and i shouldnt be privy to it aye look at the scowl on hamilton s phiz your excellencies i think id best take my leave now our ship will of course remain at naples until you may have despatches for us to carry to lord hood sir william may one of your aides introduce me to your embassys shore agent i would like to arrange for wood and water and for our purser to replenish stores leave for your crew here in naples as well leftenant well uhm there came a knock on the door and the flunky reappeared most hideously humble bowing and scraping excuse me your excellencies but this note just came for the naval person quite urgent i think the naval person indeed lewrie fumed as he opened the note christ he whispered wiping his brow mister pruden had looked in on captain braxton and his prognosis was grim the captain needed a physician instanter else trouble aboard your ship sir sir william asked the captain sir william lewrie had to confess damnit all he would be the very last to miss braxton should he pass over do a little hornpipe of grief perhaps but he couldnt ignore this thatd be as much as if hed murdered the man by neglect he is ill sir william our surgeon urgently requests a physician someone experienced with malaria an old fever come back aha so that is why you present yourself in his stead acton exclaimed with sudden understanding clapping his hands foreignlike you wished to save his honour not knowing how sick he was hoping he is better on the morrow hein you must be tres very loyal to him i am thinking how admirable does he not appear so sir william and to inspire such loyalty what a remarkable man his captain must be bloody hell are you dense as marble lewrie gawped to himself such loyalty towards ones superior is a given which goes in our royal navy without notice sir john ambassador hamilton boasted gruffly though with a soft twinkle in his eyes i do allow though that such a touching and fiercely protective loyalty as the leftenant manifests towards his captain may only be construed as the merest indication of leftenant lewries true qualities which i find sir are as commendable and admirable as ever i did see in an english gentleman but i merely shut up fool he warned himself aye give a dog a good name they want to think well o me then who am i to complain i merely you are too kind sir william he said instead all but scuffing a toe in modesty as he strove to evince a seemly and humble blush the irony of the situation and that tootight neckstock helped as he ducked his head like a stableboy i insist sir william that you allow me to suggest the offices of signor dottore spadolini to see to your captain acton offered your court physician sir william posed dubiously surely with her majesty so near her time ahem still racked with grief over the death of her dear sister perhaps it might be better were my own physician dottore granuzzo to attend him else we might lose an heir to the throne we could have him moved here to palazzo sessa perhaps it might be best sir william to have your physician come out to the ship first lewrie countered fighting a smile over the thought of braxton being physically removed from his ship of coming to his senses ashore and wondering if cockerel had mutinied once more and sailed off and left him he may be too ill for a time to be moved i will see to it at once leftenant sir william announced picking up a tiny china bell to ring for a servant hi either case your ship will remain in port anent your captains health and how certain pending matters of state uhm develop and what despatches i may have regarding those selfsame developments for lord hood i and cockerel are at your disposal sir william alan said and for your generosity of spirit lieutenant lewrie sir john rejoined naples is yours to command what service may our kingdom do the royal navy there was talk of shore leave before we were interrupted well milord theres firewood and water the usual plaint alan replied with a small grin our purser mister husie would always wish to go ashore to replenish stores purchase livestock for fresh meat and such i had hoped once wed provisioned to allow our crew out of discipline for a day or two not shore leave though send your purser to our shipyard sir sir john offered with a grand expansive spread of his arms your ship purchases nothing we will gladly offer you the bounty of naples fresh meat and bread vino god bless you your excellency i am overcome by your generosity lewrie declared happily sure too that mister husie would also be turning st catherines wheels over free victuals and for yourself sir sir john went on tapping himself on the side of his nose cagily i know what sailors most desire having once served in deprivation aha you see to sample the cuisine of naples your excellency to try some new dishes eat my way back aboard ship i should think lewrie said beaming now happy as a pig in the corncrib ive simple needs then you shall do so as our honoured visitor acton promised with another cagier look perhaps you should sample some fried fish hein sir william ah perhaps that may uhm advance matters the ambassador agreed almost tipping the prime minister a conspiratorial wink yes i daresay it might after a certain period of uhm briefing a briefing on how to eat fried fish right and both of em as cozy as a pair of housebreakers lewrie wondered at least it sounds like theres a free meal in it but dear as he wished it that very instant your excellencies will excuse me i trust but i must return to our ship there are matters to arrange and duties in my captains stead which i must see to first you have a competent wardroom sir acton inquired aye sir well damn his eyes lieutenant braxton was good at his job cant be faulted professionally just personally scott to keep an eye on him and dimmock bosun fairclough an hour or so i quite understand lieutenant lewrie acton nodded and gave him a shrug of nautical camaraderie we both know and appreciate how so akin are the demands of a beautiful ship such as your frigate and the demands of a beautiful woman nestce pas quite your excellency lewrie smiled in return uhm sir william frowned peering at a distant clock of impressive dimensions and baroque gilding it is now halfpast nine or so do you return to palazzo sessa by halfpast eleven will that be time enough sir good you are turned out reasonably well your current uniform and toilette will suffice i do not believe there is need for anything more formal not today at any rate from here we may all coach together do you concur your excellency absolutely sir william acton agreed my physician will be along presently you may coach together to the quays hamilton decided getting to his feet creaking in the effort for all his urbane grace and patrician leanness he was an old man he put his hands in the small of his back and leaned backward aye sir william and thankee again i cannot express how much i am indebted to you one thing before i go however uhm exactly where will we be coaching to why to introduce you to neapolitan cuisine lieutenant sir john acton smirked sharing another of those maddening conspiratorial grins with the ambassador you may try some fried fish and be presented to his majesty king ferdinand the fourth the king of naples chapter now hell not stand on much ceremony or formality beyond a natural courtesy dye see sir sir william hamilton tutored on the short carriage ride from palazzo sessa the king of naples is uh youve never been presented at court back home sir no sir william lewrie had to admit he does carry himself well though hamilton does he not and you told me not half an hour ago that his deportment towards you and sir john lacked for nothing lady emma hamilton teased informal or not lewrie had scrubbed himself as clean as could be expected aboard a ship donned his best uniform and was now perched on tenterhooks on a plushvelvet coach bench facing rearward towards sir william and his wife his very much younger and hellishfetching wife at the moment he felt diplomacy bedamned uhm sir william allowed true true my dear neapolitans call him re lazzarone sir lady hamilton went on that means king of the commoners hes adored by the common folk by all but by all but the very rich and most pretentious those with titles who were bom expecting more respect for their dignity she snorted like a shortchanged shopkeepers wife you have no italian sir sir william inquired hopefully none i fear sir william lewrie had to say some doggerel don a smattering of french o course that would hardly be the language to use around old nosey sir lady hamilton laughed again a deeperinthegut fullvoiced guffaw her merry light blue eyes sparkling with mirth old nosey lady hamilton lewrie flummoxed trying hard to retain all hed so quickly been tutored on in the short time allowed vecchio nasone his subjects also call him try it ii vecchio nasone eel vekeeoh nahsohnee give me half a day hamilton and well have him so fluent in italian hell be waving his hands and slapping his forehead she boasted i should not dare speak french to him no matter its called la langue diplomatique since his queen maria carolina was sister to marie antoinette i see quite right sir sir william gloomed though he had bestowed upon his wife the beamish smile of a typical lovestricken old colts tooth and as for don well one cannot hope i suppose that a sea officer may be master of the art of diplomacy or by the very uhm detached nature of his calling have much use for it in truth but his majesty king ferdinand is of royal spanish bourbon blood he has been king of naples and the two sicilies since his boyhood yet he is at bottom spanish it would be oh hamilton you know how suspicious old nosey is about his relations lady hamilton interrupted all the years hes spent here monarch in his own right no matter how indebted he originally was he has no love for spain for his family perhaps but not for spain or their ambitions any more than he felt for french bourbons and their ambitions hes fiercely protective of his kingdom leftenant lewrie handsome or not she talks too bloody much and mans business too lewrie thought politics so please you must have the old dolt wrapped round her least finger to get away with such boldness its desexing thats what it is immoderate promising poonts though even so my dear it would be a mistake for the leftenant to become in the excitement of the moment perhaps too informal and i would most strenuously conjure you leftenant lewrie to attempt to eschew such animadversions or colloquialisms hamilton dearest lady hamilton interrupted again touching her husband on his knee with her fan not possessing a word of italian and dependent upon a translator im sure he will not shame us indeed not lady hamilton alan nodded to her with gratitude he was sure that hed have had a considerable strip torn off his hide had it not been for her presence which hampered sir william from delivering a harsher reproof hell be good she added giving him a taunting smile behind her husbands view as she leaned back in the coach seat they shared cross my heart and hope to die lady hamilton lewrie smiled emma do she insisted suddenly taking her husbands veined old hand for a squeeze may leftenant lewrie be familiar with us my dear after all he will be doing us an immense service already has hasnt he coming from admiral hood with his news and showing ferdinand what real british sailors are like why this may be the very act which firms neapolitan resolve to join the coalition uhm emma sir william dithered in warning oh pish lady hamilton snorted once again this time in vexation what is needed by lords dundas and grenville in london is the help of the sardinians and the neapolitans austria is in prussia is in but theyre off to the north and east all royalist europe must be in surely hamilton he must be told enough so that he will not make a mistake out of ignorance leftenant lewrie his majestys government desires and shall pay handsomely for any military or naval assistance against republican france matters are in hand sir william said cautiously sardinia for example will be recompensed upwards of ј to raise an army of men and subordinate her fleet to lord hoods orders i have been discussing a similar arrangement for a fiscal subsidy with sir john acton anent naples pending certain steps which his majestys forces would take in the mediterranean what sir john referred to as une flotte respectable alan said with quick understanding and a sly look the presence of our fleet is the precondition towards naples joining the coalition and what would their contribution be sir william and how good are they we uhm sir william stalled loathe to reveal all his cards to a stranger grown used to a life of secrecy in his kings service a force of to troops three or four ships of the line and the requisite numbers of transports perhaps six or eight lesser ships it is no secret that king ferdinand has always been suspicious of france s territorial ambitions now so more than ever no matter the government in power in paris their appetites are constant and with french gaining corsica rather recently he fears their further expansion overseas if they can threaten and gain corsica what else might they take from the weaker italian states by force alan surmised once they consolidate their political power eliminate their last internal foes and get their army and navy sorted out capital lady hamilton hooted in triumph oh hamilton did i not tell you hed be good yet corsica s not quite in the bag i understand lewrie went on leaning forward over his sword hilt which rested between his knees theres italian resistance to their occupation so i would assume we will be invading corsica once weve dealt with the french fleet that is why admiral hood is blockading toulon their main level base it made eminent sense lewrie thought smugly secretly glad he was showing so astute and enjoying the alarmed expression on william hamiltons face but any fool could read a map any fool could follow events in the papers what all these foreign office privy council or diplomatic types never seemed to realise was that an hour in a coffeehouse or an idle afternoon in a workingmans tavern would reveal that what they treated as utterly covert was general gossip too it made eminent sense that england would provide the navy to allow the lesser italian kingdoms to invade corsica marshal armies on frances eastern frontier near genoa and leghorn backed by austria and her magnificent troops best in europe prussian pride notwithstanding liberation from revolutionary tyranny a cheque to french dreams of expansion cant do it without a fleet and provide the first measure in cooperation and a victory so the combined armies of the coalition would be inspirited when they marched into france herself we rather our superiors in london dream a tad bit larger than merely occupying corsica leftenant lewrie sir william grudgingly admitted leaning forward himself to whisper more confidentially i grant you all you say is true yet there is also resistance to paris and the revolutionaries in france as well the midi var provence along the biscay coast in vendee there are many adherents to the royal family regions openly in rebellion versus the republicans what you are told now is to be held in the strictest confidence sir but admiral hood may be able to exploit royalist sentiment in southern france he is charged by henry dundas to attack marseilles if at all possible blockade southern france bottle up or destroy the french fleet and in the last instance exploiting royalist sentiments lay siege to thence capture the naval port and fortifications of toulon so you see leftenant lewrie corsica would be a poor second a sideshow that is the aim of the coalition in the mediterranean and that is why i have courted the kingdom of naples and the two sicilies so ardently good god lewrie exclaimed in a covert mutter leaning back in amazement yes i see sir william so your hopedfor treaty is just about completed hamilton has it leftenant lewrie emma hamilton boasted giving her old stick of a husband a supportive grin its a pat hand already really naples isnt powerful enough to resist france alone in the long run so they must side with us he is too modest about his accomplishments im not to know that i presume nor anything about the treaty alan spelled out aloud partly for his own use but asked my opinion i should express the belief that france should be crushed quickly and that the royal navy is more than able to defeat or blockade the french i just have to avoid saying or doing anything stupid heavenly aptly put lady hamilton cheered rewarding him with another encouraging smile one might allude to toulon and marseilles as hotbeds of royalist sentiment though sir without belabouring the subject good god lewrie thought a bit shocked who exactly is the ambassador to naples shes the nutmegs of a grenadier guardand when excited as she was at that moment could lapse into most unladylike speech a trifle too loud too she was a forward piece no error alan thought emma hamilton was not the typical batterpudding most men of the age preferred the sort who could snuggle under a fellows chin on her tiptoes nor was she fubsy either though she was more of a pillowy kind than he usually liked a dimpled chin nicely dimpled cheeks when she smiled bright pale blue eyes huge uns a good brow and her eyebrows and hair were almost raven dagodark a somewhat coarse complexion though free of smallpox scars her teeth as she displayed them in a pleased grin were a little irregular but then what person didnt have a few missing by her age or erose teeth to begin with he realised how old was she he wondered there was an intriguing cast a tiny brown mote in her left eye he noted as she continued to lecture in a very vivacious hurried way damn charmin he thought suddenly no not a bit fubsy just the tad bit stout or would be later in life like a country girl and when excited she sounded a bit country too midlands alan decided nottinghamshire staffordshire or cheshire by her accent which surfaced in spite of obvious coaching in a more genteel london style in her thirties he asked himself no late twenties at best and with this old colts tooth how long hmmm ii re lazzarone she was saying lifting her hands to talk dagofashion to stress her syllables twiddling short commonish fingers on hands a tad too rough for a woman born to the idle aristocracy do try it sir lotsahroanay she giggled eel ray lotsahroanay alan parroted warming to her infectious vivacity and uhm eel vekeeoh nahsohnay oh very good sir she laughed buon giorgno thats good morning buona notte is goodnight scusi thats excuse me and one cant go wrong with grazie thank you grazie signore grazie signorina or signora if shes married dye see you are a tenente so if you hear someone say tenente you may be sure its you theyre speaking to king ferdinand would adore a few choice italian phrases he speaks italian better than ever he did his native spanish though they are similar youll only confuse him emma or arm him too tightly just enough to encourage him sir william grumped though gently dotingly your first name sir she demanded suddenly isnt it so very stiff calling you leftenant lewrie and me lady hamilton i am emma were sir william to allow me thank you sir william i am honoured by your condescension lady emma then he experimented with a smile uhm you say his majesty is not too formal the most unassumin monarch ever you did see alan she cried boldly goes about the town afoot on his own half the time chatting up just anyone of his subjects he comes across for a spanish bourbon what you call a stiffnecked don emma really sir william interjected merely pretending to be scandalised his people love him and he truly loves theml she prattled on all but squirming on her coach seat he gives them festa form et farina oh see how much italian youre learning alan festa forza et farina festivals force and flour for bread and pasta there are some think it boorish but he realises theres more commoners than rich and if the commoners the lazzarone support him then his crown is safe and of course what he calls the other three pillars of his reign church crown and mob heavens so much to relay and so little time hamilton she said almost breathless in her haste quite another reason king ferdinand and queen maria carolina are dead set against the revolutionaries theyre catholic monarchs in a catholic country and not only did the republicans supplant royalty when the king and queen marie antoinette were beheaded the french are preaching atheism all sorts of vague humanist prattle deist at best all the churches turned into temples of man priests thrown out called to the armies to get them out of the way churches closed and rich properties seized for the state it is a pity hamilton that alan cannot be presented to maria carolina i believe she is in the last weeks of her confinement lady emma and in grief over her royal sisters murder exactly god you should see her big as a housel emma hooted with earthy good humour but were you to meet her and get to see her resolve her mind alan youd meet one of the most formidable women in europe shes so ah were here sir william announced as their coach jangled to a halt and with the slightest sound of relief from his wifes enthusiasm in his voice i will of course alight first sir would you be so good once you have done likewise as to hand lady hamilton down like the navy sir william seniors last in first out alan snickered it will be my pleasure to assist lady hamilton dear god i hope so he thought giving her what he also hoped was the sort of significant grin that had worked in his past coarse and too damn forward she might be but she was by that very nature damned intriguing and exotically exciting like naples itself he slid near the door waiting for the tall sir william to set foot on the iron coach step to plant his shoes on the ground and move far enough away to give him room to alight he was taking his own old sweet arthritic time about it lewrie glanced meaningfully to her once more as she gathered her skirts she lowered her gaze slowly in what looked to be a most covert nod of agreement slowly she glanced out the windows of the coach to sir william who was huffing grimacing and accepting the arm of a liveried postillion boy she looked back to lewrie just as slowly smiling a bashful smile over her husbands infirmities as if to say what may one do then inclined her head to one side ever so slightly presenting a strong yet graceful neck her gaze became less bashful turned forward and bold she appraised him cocked hat to wellblacked shoes and gave him another browlifted nod of acceptance thankee jesus were aboard lewrie thought triumphantly he alit at last once there was space enough and reached in to hand her down safely in front of what appeared to be a most plebeian friedfish shop her silkhosed ankles winked for a dizzying moment as she emerged she took his offered hand and as she departed their coach with only moderate grace she gave his fingers a firm and intimate squeeze and both their grasps lingered far longer than his gentlemanly task demanded old noseys a caution alan she whispered leaning close to his head in final warning using that final warning as an excuse for a public intimacy a bit on the loud side a touch vulgar for what most deem acceptable behaviour for royalty more exuberant than british visitors are wont id tell you more but time does not admit it perhaps later lady emma alan suggested almost leering now im asea with need of tutoring and you the most capable and the most handsome i expect you have very little need of tutoring alan she said with a light laugh which quickly became a fullthroated guffaw come be presented and she brushed past him to join her husband leaving him wondering if shed been teasing after all and had just laughed all his lustful pretensions to scorn chapter king ferdinand the fourth was a touch more than crude ii re lazzarone was as vulgar as a horsecoper for a moment lewrie was not sure which of the low figures in the cook shop he was until a tall beaky fellow came from behind the counter dressed in a flamboyantly figured blackandsilver waistcoat silk shirt and laced stock in fawn breeches and gleaming top boots he wore a white publicans apron which he cast aside as he approached sir john acton presented him then stood in as translator a moment later after the latest news had been digested lewrie ended up in a bear hug being bussed on both cheeks over and over lifted off his feet and danced round the cook shop as a pack of wastrels and idlers cheered lustily his majesty cannot express his joy upon learning sir john condensed for him hes doin mainwell considrin sir john lewrie muttered as he tried to maintain an innocent unabashed fools face as the ruddyfeatured monarch jounced him around this vow made by his britannic majesty now fulfilled the prowess of british arms uhm speakin of arms your excellency king ferdinand the fourth set him down at last clapped him hard on both shoulders and rattled off a positive flood of italian he offers to feed you now acton concluded and then in a runofthemill cook shop not much grander than a coffeehouse chophouse or tavern back home he was sat at a redandwhite chequered table with a prime minister an ambassador and his lady had a glass of wine shoved into his hands and was presently presented with soft breadsticks and an assorted plate of sliced cheeses and meats by the very hands of a king a remarkably florid and ugly king he thought but a king nonetheless the experience was nearly as heady as the wine a rough but fullbodied local vintage fruity yet dry it went devilishwell with the strips of ham and sausage rounds and the cheeses the place was festooned with hunting trophies boars heads and stags shaggy horned mountain goats bears lynx stuffed geese or ducks his majesty adores the hunt do you see sir acton explained ah si king ferdinand agreed followed by another linguistic avalanche to which lewrie could but nod and smile a breadstick near his middle chest wondering if one could partake as long as a king was talking and the smell of frying fish broiling fish the tang of oil and garlic onion and god knew what else the smoke from the grill like a thin mist overhead the very rafters redolent with rapturous mangia his majesty says do not stand on ceremony eat acton encouraged marvelous big hunts his majesty stages sir whole villages for beaters with the gun with the lance with the sword he takes his prey acton relayed cocking his head towards his monarch to catch it all thousands of beasts thousands of birds has he taken signore tenente his majesty believes the bigger the slaughter bigger the bag the better ha ha ah like the maharajah do in india your excellency alan said appalled wasnt his idea o huntin ah india acton said with much the same delight as his king had his majesty bids me tell you he would give anything to be invited by his majesty king georges east india company of course to go to india and hunt in the grand moghul style his majesty would like to kill many elephants and tigers convey to his majesty king ferdinand that ive been to india lewrie smiled with a crafty look my father is a colonel in the east india company army he hunts bengal from the back of an elephant he wrote me last year hes a little busy now though hunting frenchmen id imagine though sir william hamilton winced king ferdinand laughed so hard he shook the table then pounded it with a fist his majesty inquires if you also hunted game in the east indies tenente lewrie acton translated though his own polite smile was forced and his laugh sounded edgy i was too busy myself your excellency lewrie replied we chased french pirates in the great south seas they were not only giving arms and encouragement to the most bloodthirsty native pirates to raid the china trade they were taking ships themselves selling good christians in malay or mindanao slave markets or leaving no witnesses breaking their treaty agreements after the last war getting ready for the next sponsored unofficially of course by their ministry of marine french warships in disguise and his majesty inquires acton posed nervously after a sober palaver in italian which shut every mouth cocked every ear in the shopand left lady emma hamilton gapejawed and flushedwhat did you do with them tenente we brought them to battle soueast of macao at spratly island and hunted em down to the island of balabac lewrie said proudly rolling the unfamiliar names off like an ancient and honoured regiments list of glorious victories and when we were done they were utterly defeated and destroyed thenleader in chains royal navy fashion magnifico king ferdinand bellowed gruffly his face even redder pounding on the table again magnifico ecco la regio marina de la brittania he rose to his feet swinging his arms and giving every customerand lewrie realised that some of those customers were courtiers and advisers or privy councila long rant his majesty says tenente sir john acton muttered with a very catatethecanary look at last that with such an ally what is there to fear from the french uhm a bit sacrilegious i fear but with almighty god on our side buttressed by the fabled wooden walls of the evercourageous and implacable british royal navy who can be against us bellissimo signore tenente bellissimo that is to say beautiful handsomely done thankee your excellency but i no more than spoke the truth a gnarled old hand touched his lightly for an instant from his right sir william hamilton drawing his attention from the cheering to nod his approval and give him a warm smile marvelous lewrie thought i just started a war damme whats next i can get myself into the king calmed at last sat back down and shouted instructions to the kitchen out came aproned flunkies beamish young boys with olive complexions and dark hair excited and trembling would they be at some regimental recruiting office by next sunrise alan wondered they seemed bloody cheerful about the prospect out came a thatchcovered bottle a red wine fruity and dusky so dry it made him pucker lacrima christi he was told it was the tears of christ which he thought fitting there was a heaping platter of a stringy glop pasta he was also told spaghetti al dente shimmering with olive oil flecked with oregano sundried tomato bits and garlic with a thin sera of tomato sauce also arriving was a selection of hot fish fried shrimpgamberettidone to a tawny crispness but pink and succulent inside more shrimp filleted and skewered and grilled eat eat tenente sir john insisted once the uproar had at last died down something momentous seemed to have been settled but lewrie wasnt sure exactly what since it wasnt formal yet and no one was going out of their way to explain such diplomatic intricacies to a lowly such as he his majesty operates the cook shop himself and he is delighted to see a man with a hearty appetite he catches many of these fish himself off fusaro and posillipo he bids me tell you he is a great fisherman as well as hunter he sails his own boat too as far as the isle of capri ive heard how beautiful how bellissimo lewrie said between heavenly mouthfuls that set the king off on another paroxysm of rapture over capri s magnificent coves and beaches its vistas its ancient structures i would delight to see it do we stay long enough in naples alan said to the prime minister just as i adore tasting new foods i delight in seeing new and exciting places you like common neapolitan foods his majesty wonders ambrosia of heaven your excellency i may never lay knife to english foods again lewrie declared not anywhere near toadying his majesty demands you stay ashore this evening dine with us at the reggia the royal palace all common neapolitan menu he promises he will stuff you his majesty assures me and give you a good night of rest in a real bed not a seamans cot for once should i sir william he asked what if i slip up or we shall be with you leftenant never fear please your excellency convey to his majesty my undying and heartfelt gratitude for his most generous invitation one to which i look forward with unbounded gustatory anticipation he looked at emma hamilton who was fanning herself still rapt upon him after his brusque description of his east indies service and thats not all im looking forward to he thought giving her a grin and a brief nod chapter had a hole in me i think hollow leg or something but lord it was all so bloody good so grand minestrone the plebeian vegetable and pasta soupeven that was head and shoulders above navy fare meatstuffed pastas layered with a tomato sauce dripping with melted cheeses veal marinara game fowl jugged in a wine sauce domestic chicken breasts done in a cream sauce with wide egg noodles more fried fish more grilled goodies god knew how theyd done it but thered been ices with the fruit for a last course tart and sweet sorbets and creamywhatd they call emsgelatil and for the levee preceding the actual promised stuffingantipasti lovely cheeses thinshaved prosciutto and of course the sybaritic pleasures of freshbaked bread piping hot crusty and white milled flour with dollops of churned butter wines too sweet marsalas and sweetish sparkling spumantes then buttersmooth aged reds that rivalled the best cabernets france could boast thank god for the food he thought ive taken a barrel aboard feels like im well and truly foxed a minor kingdom in the greater scheme of things naples might be but king ferdinands palazzo was a bejeweled begilt faeryland of high ornate baroque ceilings wellfigured marble walls awash with statuary and gigantic tapestries overscale paintings dead relations mostlyor hunting scenes shiny with chinese wallpapers glittering with crystal sconces chandeliers glowing amber with a shipload worth of real beeswax candles festooned with silver and gold niello or cloisonne strewn with furniture too precious to sit upon it was so grand so showy after half a year of those wooden walls of his so different from his bleak daily vistas of rolling sea and the music a chamber orchestra still sawed away in an upper gallery just as they had through the levee and the supper light airy delightful stuffsonatas by giovanni gabrieli giovanni battista fontana and marco buccolina or so hed been informed if naples was not indeed heaven it was very close to it alan determined with a traitorous snifter of french armagnac in his hand he let go a more than gentle burp of contentment the supper was over the ecarte and music was winding down and it was too late for the last guests to stay and dance sir william and the prime minister were gone somewhere king ferdinand had spoken some brief last words to him and had plodded off too have their three heads together over the treaty i expect alan thought thankee my boy but well take it from here oh well scusi signore tenente lor l liri a whitewigged footman announced by his side he was holding a sixarmed candelabra lewrie he muttered barely glancing at him searching for emma hamilton who had also scampered off somewhere si signore tenente liri the servitor persisted you pleseah toa follah me signore tenente i lighta you up toa bed signore well shit he sighed to himself right then i should have known better his chambers were magnificent the night was warm and fragrant the two pairs of doors which led to a wide fretstoned balcony were open the suite was as large as an admirals greatcabins there were side tables bearing cloisonne gilt and silver gewgaws a writing desk of tortoiseshell mottled wood heavily inlaid with ivory urns filled with freshcut flowers everywhere he looked an expansive wine cabinet big as a dukes sideboard an intricately carved armoire big enough to hold a corporals guard and a bedstead as wide as a quarterdeck with silk sheets and satin coverlet already turned down the two pair of pillows plumped up invitingly willa they bea anythin elsea youa wan signore tenente the footman intoned sounding both hesitant and grim lewrie glanced at him and noted his lips moving after his statement probably in rote rehearsal of his little english over the most probable statement he might next make anything else lewrie grinned si signore tenente liri the man answered then repeated with effort willatheybeaanythinelseayouawan signore dancing girls lewrie bade tongue in cheek just to see how the poor fellow might handle the unexpected a string quartet some courtesans and magic i insist on magic uh scusi signore tenente sweat popped on his upper lip as he flummoxed willatheybeaanythinelsea signore tenente he reiterated sounding a bit desperate no nothing else lewrie relented thank you goodnight or how you say uhm no grazie buona notte ah si tenente the man bobbed with relief bowing himself out quickly si grazie buona notte signore buona notte call me at first light lewrie insisted sunrise giorgno first sparrow fart bloody he pointed at an ormolu clock struck his hands in his armpits and crowed like a rooster the footman came back pointed to the roman numeral v and shrugged quizzically alan pointed to the vi mimed shaving and washing ah si signore awakea you ota watr buona notte damme another bloody foreign language i have to learn he groused softly as he stripped off his own coat and waistcoat ripped his laced stock from his throat and unbuttoned his shirt collar a peek into the various chambers of the suite revealed that his kit was already stored in the armoire he hung his things up found the necessary closet and much eased padded in bare feet to the wine cabinet it may have been french but there was armagnac sweeter and mellower than any brandy or cognac with his snifter topped up he went out onto the balcony not feeling treasonous at all to drink it heaven naples might seem but it reeked as did any city with a large population night soil dumped out chamber windows animal ordure rotting garbage and too many people who bathed too infrequently crammed into too small an area but the palaces flower gardens atoned for all there was something else too as if antiquity had a scent dusty and sere as if a thousand years of living breathing history and aeons of mediterranean sunshine could have a mellow dryoldwine aroma alan could identify woodsmoke sour waterstaunched charcoal cooking fires wine and laundry tanneries and hot iron the aftertaste of succulent spices the wind off the sea naples lay spread at his feet beyond the palace grounds and the protective walls vesuvius was over his left shoulder gently fuming a thin indistinct pipesmokers pall dark slopes tumbled to the fields where pompeii and herculaneum once stood and from torre del greco all ephemeral with dusky blue moonlight umber walls and terracotta roof tiles shone icy with moonlight rendered snowy blue white or black now tiny amber sparks on the hills on the flatlands far away in the town marked country crofts villages or latenight taverns to the west the bay of naples shimmered on the moonglade in silver and black and ships lay still as discarded playthings on a nursery room floor below him barepoled and silent with only faint glims by belfries and taffrails hms cockerel lay off to his right silhouetted ebony on flickering argent waters which reflected pale yellow catspaws on a quicksilver moon trough brushed by the light night breeze squinting he almost thought he could espy a pattern to it a chimera about to rise like an everpirouetting dancer to the souwest there was a darker hump on the seas horizon the steady measured flick of a lighthouse capri tucked like an apostrophe near the tip of a finger of distancegreyed land at his angle of view punta campanella lewrie murmured with pleasure in the novel and alien savouring the taste of its strange wonder on his tongue as he recalled the peninsulas name along with the heady fumes and bite of the armagnac and that tiny smear of light that sleeping village on the peninsulas north shore which faced his balcony damme i had a squint at the chart so whats the bloody place called sam ser s something sorrento a soft voice said behind him he started with alarm spun about to spy out who his tutor was sorrento lady emma hamilton whispered as she emerged from the darkness of the far end of his balcony came near enough to take the snifter from his nerveless fingers and drink deep a lovely town is sorrento there are some who like the bay of salerno beyond the punta campanella but i much prefer the bay of naples dont you immensely he assured her getting his poise back when goethe was here not long ago he told me you met goethe lewrie marveled but of course alan she laughed low in her throat everyone comes to naples sooner or later goethe said naples is a paradise everyone lives after his manner intoxicated in selfforgetfulness languid romantic beyond words tolerant and accepting ive been here for years i cannot imagine living anywhere else in selfforgetfulness he prompted and smiled she lifted the snifter drained it to heeltaps and set it on a marbletopped wroughtiron wine table beside her then slipped into his embrace boldly she turned her face up to his pressing her lips first warm and inviting then fierce turning her head and groaning as their mouths parted as eager breaths mingled how did you manage he murmured against her throat as he lifted her dark curling hair to kiss her below her ear to devour her neck and soft bared shoulder palazzi she chuckled with more than amusement writhing against him passages vacant adjoining suites unseeing servants hurry he frogmarched her backwards into the suite across the room and onto the edge of the high bedstead all the while fumbling with the buttons and hooks of her sack gown with her strong capable hands on his breeches flap and belt in a fury they tumbled onto the piles of goosedown mattresses his feet still just touching the floor up went his hands searching and hungry lifting skirts and petticoats sliding needful and possessive along her silken knee hose up along the outside of her thighs bare and soft so milky white and malleable caution she insisted lifting his head from his delightful work whimpering and panting with want of her own taking his face in both hands and raining widemouthed writhing dewywet kisses on him caution a moment have you bloody hell what if i dont he groaned silently kissing her one last time he shucked his breeches and strode in his shirttails to the armoire digging into his shore kit god thankee cony you still know how to pack for me shaking out one of mother jones very best guinea the dozen lambskin cundums from the old green lantern in half moon street he went back to her shed snuffed candles all but the last on the nightstand and shed her gown and petticoats and chemise almost demure tucked into bed beneath the silk sheets her mass of ebon curls spilling stark on the shining pillows he slid into bed with her sinking into the mattresses sliding together as the center gave and the edges rose to enfold them in sleek luxury she raised a thigh hugged him fierce again and let him roll atop between enfolding him with her own soft yielding flesh he went back to her shoulders her breasts sliding down to render total worship but she almost dragged him to a stop reached down dandled his manhood and chuckled deep in her throat as her hands surveyed his size and strength helped him with their caution then guided him guided him ah god she muttered huskily straining with him lifting her legs high about him pressing her ankles and heels into his buttocks rocking her hips to exact his last full measure to the very depths of her lord yes i emma he panted against her mouth cupping his hands over her shoulders sinking into her losing himself in her gawd she cooed bemused by her own responses as she clasped him snug and rocked him thrusting upwards to meet him ill never in my life know what it is bout me and sailors he felt insatiable lucky for him emma hamilton was a perfect match though she did tend to babble more than he liked between bouts he learned whether he cared to or not that shed been born a village girl one emma hart daughter of a smith in neston cheshire close enough to liverpool so her first lover had been a sea officer when she was in her midteens then had come london and the stage or at least something close to theatrical lewrie smirked in fond remembrance of the actresses who plied their wares about his old haunts of covent garden and drury lane blithering away chirpy as a magpie she boldly confessed shed taken upunder the protection she put itwith the wealthy sir harry fetherstonehaugh and had lived at his fabulous estate up park in sussex for a time grooming her stage presentations whatever that signified but then something cross had occurred between them and he shipped her back to neston yet soon after shed lived under the protection again of charles greville through him shed met sir william hamilton when hed come home from naples for a visit had come away with him had lived in his palazzo as his paramour for five years and had then become his wife for the last two separate bedchambers i take it lewrie murmured rolling to embrace her and nuzzle suggestively out of her rags he found her to be a touch more fubsy than hed thought but it was such a welcoming and biddable fubsiness an old man with his infirmities hamilton was a soldier a sportsman hes climbed vesuvius lord i dont know twenty times since hes been here poor dear isnt as infirm as you think alan no she frowned sloughing off his attentions to stretch for the armagnac and plump up the pillows to sit against the headboard its more you come to our palazzo youll see hamilton is a collector roman etruscan greek antiquities books and maps rare old things palazzo sessas more museum than house all on loving display she sneered into her snifter so are you on display too i take it he pressed sliding up to join her and take a sip from her glass yes in a way i am she chuckled a bit moodily everyone tells him what a delightful and wondrous adornment i am to his house like his vases and kraters as if i should be in a niche somewhere in one of the galleries where the lights best one man even dared to sayin my hearin mindthat i was a credit to the station to which id been raised yet youre not on display you put a foot forward bold as i ever did see he cooed to her blowing her a kiss which she turned and intercepted leaning over him to bestow the real thing an ear for languages on familial terms with royalty god sometimes i wish to god i was a man she huffed and he tried to jolly her out of her pet in his own inimitable fashion but she was having none of it at that moment how far may a woman go in this world aye ive sense moren most an ear for languages music books and learning not just the frightful novels what you described this morning about fighting the pirates and all id love to be able to do something meaningful be a voice people heeded wield as much influence as you did hamilton well he is happy with me he tolerates my enthusiasms yet and you know which side your toast is buttered lewrie thought his passion though i think he saves his passion for diplomacy for antiquities studying volcanoes were comfortable together as old shoes because i ornament him so well like his marbles she sighed and took a deep sip of brandy he bought me you know same as his ancient urns she confessed with a shrug and poutlip sigh he bloody what charlie greville is sir williams nephew alan she told him snuggling close confidentially her head on his shoulder i lived quite happily with him but he wanted to improve his estate hed more than enough i thought though his condition was not of the very best it was more than comfortable he had a chance to make a rich marriage and id have been quite content to stay with him but for that anyway hamilton came home on leave to palaver with the foreign office or something and blink of an eye i sailed away here to naples the cads both of em lewrie groused slipping a protective arm about her shoulders oh no never say that about em alan she dissented sitting up and away charlie greville was wonderful to me hes still a dear friend before charlie i hadnt two letters in my head and as for my cyphers he saw i was tutored speech singing music and cultural attainments he brought my mother down from neston to be

sorts of womanly matters frank and firstname as a sister think of it alan thats why i love naples so its so accepting here i can be who i was truly born to be not like sneering london cold and hateful stay in your place well when hamilton and i go back to england authors of a treaty that won the war and put every royal house in europe in against france and france is done to a turn you will do france to a turn for me wont you alan do just think how people will have to take to me no matter what emma boasted brazen yet wistful for whatwastobe heavens is that the timet she sprang from the bed bouncing prettily though without much grace and bent for her discarded chemise hamilton and acton said theyd be up late gave me a chamber in case i wished to stay and coach home with him later two down not to worry do me up dear man she ordered stepping into her petticoats hoops and pads lewrie went to the armoire and retrieved a silk chinee dressing gown for himself before obeying it was fiery red lambent with moire dragons in green and blue with ivory eyes and teeth hamilton wont take much notice but sir john might and lord mother she has eyes in the back of her head i swear your mothers still with you lewrie asked ready to hand her her gown as she carefully aligned her underdresses and hair in a tall ovalframed gilt mirror companion adviser cook she chuckled throatily she goes by mistress cadogan now though youre not to know that when you come great god what a horror she stopped primping suddenly on espying his dressing robe in the mirror wherever did you get thatv canton china if you must know alan said a trifle sulkily nobody seemed to care for it it seemed it had been relegated to his seachestout of sight out of mindlest he embarrass others back home i rather like it he continued selfmocking yet defensive though my wife uhm oh damme your wife she replied evenly cocking a brow after a moment she grinned ironically yes well were i your wife alan i would object to it too let me hazard a guess youve been wed at least seven years uh as a matter of fact just barely seven and a bit alan blushed dear lord seven years the two of us she sighed surprising him by stepping to him and hugging him close each to our own fashion mind dear alan it does seem such a milepost in me dont it amen he sighed with an afterglow of pleasure kindled by her scent and the warmth of her flesh they kissed again soft lingeringalmost a faretheewell instead of a goodnight come to palazzo sessa she ordered taking her gown from him it would help if you express a keen interest in antiquities hamilton will be delighted to tour you round in the afternoon he has his grampuspuff his nap silly goose a most sensible neapolitan custom is siesta especially for a gentleman his age do me up whilst i preen will you then the view from my chambers is just as good and there are so many galleries full of art full of nude statuary quite inspiring some of em she taunted leaning her bottom back to his groin as he coped with getting the right hook or button in the correct slot or eye sounds delightful he murmured against her neck as she lifted her hair and began to pin it properly perhaps we may even dine you in she went on matteroffactly a pin in her mouth and after supper i will pose for you i will do my attitudes hamilton loves them i was known for them when i was still in the theatre he helps me with the lights the drapes a menage a something lewrie gawped mean he takes part not like that silly man she laughed turning to view his work in the mirror i do poses tableaux dressed mind emma said with a fetching moue classical figures famous people the ancient gods with a tambourine and shawl very few props ecco she stepped to the sideboard picked up a silver salver struck a pose with her profile to him for you britannia mistress of the seas quickly she changed moving to another announcing what allegory she represented a poor girl of the streets an amazonian warrior queen pallas athena dye see oh pish ive spoiled it for you youll know mem and they wont be a surprise i swear ill show all gapejawed wonder emma he promised i must go but were not done yet alan we cannot be she sighed bitter at their parting clinging to him and kissing him dewy and full of promise of delights to come dear as my lifes become i sometimes have to dare to feel alive again swear youll dare all as well god save me but i cannot thrive on esteem and companionship i must have passion rare as it is in this world rare as its been in my life but when the right man appears and i feel so halfseasover like a girl again then hang the risk uhmhmm alan commented sort of nodding against her hair and wondering just what halfcocked idiocy hed gotten himself into this time and what sort of swoony lunatick he was dealing with she broke free of his embrace at last strode to the balcony doors and turned to pose one hand high on the door sill for all the time you remain in naples dear alan all the time we have be my bold captain fortune favours the bold buona node caro mio until tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and then she swept away dramatically making a grand exit back for her secret passage to her borrowed chamber back to an air of respectability whew he exclaimed at her departure speaking softly to himself in case she had lingered to count the house buona notte me dear grazie o course damn grazie lord though wonder what italian is for daft as bats chapter aye sir their mountebank was here mister pruden told lewrie on the quarterdeck he didnt sound impressed by a highflown italian physician same nostrums as i had aboard jesuits bark and such in a tea he went from cold to hot bout the end of the second dog last evening sweated it out i should think mercury and laudanum that raises a sweat i have to see him lewrie commanded his toplights are still out sir dead to the world still mister pruden as first officer very well sir captain braxton was still unconscious and the fever hadnt done his appearance much good he lolled on the pillows face slack as some dead man his mean little mouth canted to leeward his skin as sickly a buff yellow as old parchment his shortish hair tousled and glued to his scalp by perspiration mister pruden lifted the captains wrist to feel for a pulse thumpin away like a band still mister lewrie pruden smiled no more shivering ague no more hot flushes and sweats feels cooler too i think this bouts over how much longer will he be unable to command sir lewrie asked mmm lord no tellin mister lewrie sir pruden shrugged in puzzlement man his age fit as he is well as he appeared before the fever took him it may be several days before he regains strength enough to hobble about then again it may be a week or better should he be sent ashore to convalesce sir lewrie hoped aloud no need for that sir not since the fever burned itself out a spell of bed rest of a certainty depending on how the fever debilitated him pruden countered a bit sadly god has a wicked sense of humour mister lewrie here he strikes our tyrant down raising our hopes and then restores him to health just when we believe were liberated well at least were spared his rod long as hes horizontal alan sighed shaking his head had he informed you of his infirmity before sir any cause for wariness over his health none sir though i did make it my duty to inquire to assemble a roster of past injuries and illnesses among the crew you recall i asked of the wardroom as well so should some condition my ignorance of which might do harm you asked the captain directly sir lewrie pressed getting a germ of an idea which restored his hopes i did sir in the pursuit of my bounden duties as ships surgeon pruden nodded somberly as sober as if testifying at a court and his reply sir to uhm bugger off sir and not to meddle pruden smirked so you think he intended to hide the possibility of a recurrence from you sir in your opinion as a qualified and warranted surgeon i thought he was being his usual tetchy self mister lewrie but aye theres a possibility of course it may be that malaria had not recurred on him in several years he may have put it out of sight out of mind sir like a bad tooth which really should come out but a manu ignore til it festers his gums mister lewrie very well lewrie sighed putting his hands in the small of his back and pacing ducking the overhead beams his eyes fell on the thick logbook on the desk in the day cabin there was still a way mister pruden you keep a journal of treatment do you not aye sir i will require a notice from you in the ships log that captain braxton fell ill of fever and that in his stead i had to assume command temporarily to explain why i was forced to lewrie demanded i would be most happy to comply sir pruden beamed getting his drift and should anyone care to take notice i will write up an entry in my own journal including what nostrums i prescribed and their cost of course how fortunate we were to be in port at the time alan hinted and to obtain the services of our ambassadors physician for free certainly sir pruden agreed jiggling with wry good humour ill go and do it now whilst my memorys fresh shall i sir i would be deeply obliged if you would mister pruden lewrie said with a grateful bow after the surgeon had departed he sat down behind the captains desk opened the logbook and thumbed through to the last entry in braxtons own hand there had been no entry for the day before their arrival in port lewrie noted most happily captain braxton was more than likely already ailing and unable to write sentry lewrie bawled sure that a thunderclap under his cot could not rouse the captain in the sleeping cabin sah the marine bawled back stamping into his presence send down to the wardroom private cargill i need my lieutenants journal my compliments to them and ill want the sailing masters and lieutenant braxtons as well all commission sea officers were required to keep a daily journal practice for log entries later in their careers from their observations and inscriptions battles were sometimes reconstructed careers made or broken discipline meted out afterthefact at courtsmartial or meritorious deeds recalled and rewarded sea conditions agreed upon somewhere in the leaky waterlogged basements of admiralty on high chairs when the thames backed up on them a host of molelike writers gleaned those journals for any new information any pattern to be deduced in wind and sea conditions for given areas of the world for a change in headlands a new seamark erected since the last time a royal navy ship had chanced there depths especially dangers new entries in sailing instructions or coastal pilots to those myopic scribblers nothing was inconsequential and once stored nothing was ever tossed from his lieutenants journal and from braxtons lewrie reconstructed the observations proper to a ships log stating that the log had not been kept up and most importantly why july by alan lewrie first officer hm frigate cockerel log entries for the preceding day july our captain indisposed on and july and unable dawn july winds ssw s and blowing a quartergale sea state mildly disturbed cats paws and horses visibility clear miles straits of bonifacio astem leagues isle of caprera stbd quarter by sextant distance sea miles course ese s spd knots exercised the it took an hour to transcribe everything to recreate the voyage from the straits to fetching naples at first light on the th anchoring discovering the captains illness meeting the ambassador and delivering the secret papers being presented to the king and being forced to dine and sleep out of the ship prudens note came to him and he transcribed that then took the fateful step of declaring in writing that he had assumed temporary command until such time as the surgeon deemed captain braxton hale enough to resume his duties then alan entered the damning statement that the second lieutenant had not informed him of the captains condition though he noted in his journal that hed been dinedin on the th and th and had made no mention of the captain being sick after being at table with that worthy sentry he called again after hed sanded his last words sah send for the second officer mister braxton present to him my compliments and i require mister braxton to kindly attend me in captain braxtons quarters lewrie related with an expectant smile you sent for me sir clement braxton asked a little fearful whether he dreaded what was coming now that lewrie was temporary lord and master or whether he more feared dire news of his fathers condition it would be hard to decide lieutenant braxton glanced hangdog towards the door to his fathers sleeping coach and at the novel sight of lewrie at ease behind his fathers desk with equal trepidation mister braxton youve been a very bad boy lewrie sneered sir i your father it seems our captain is going to recover so mister pruden and the civilian doctor were kind enough to inform me sir aye clement gulped bobbing with that good news he assayed a sheepish grinmore a rictus than anything else alan was having none of it however you almost killed him you damn fool lewrie barked suddenly crashing a fist on the ornate desk you and boutwell knew he was sick as a dog since we cleared the straits of bonifacio you knew he needed the surgeon but you hid that kept him from medication dear god sir i braxton swayed like to faint lewrie shot to his feet temper aboil thank god for all my lessons he thought ive been browbeat or tonguelashed by the best all those officers whod shouted at me superlative howling sessions and now its my turn by god sir you saw fit to hide his illness from me not only endangering your father but the ship mister braxton lewrie shouted you take filial loyalty too far sir too far by half you are either a sea officer charged upon your sacred honour to put the needs of the ship first last and always or youre a bloody fraud derelict in your duties whod put personal family concerns above duty clement braxton blanched reeled backwards half a step as he saw how deep was the pit he was about to be shoved into damme im good at this lewrie exulted inward though all his talk of honour and duty did make him cringe a little at his own hypocrisy it sounded like the worst sort of cant coming from his sort sir there was no intent to be derelict braxton babbled sir i tell you that you were by omission your journal two nights you dined with the captain alone seeing how ill hed become yet there is no mention of it you did not tell mister pruden about a recurrence of malaria you did not tell me to prepare me should i have to take over the ships log sir no entries past dawn of the th lewrie pointed out hefting the bedraggled saltstained journal like gods book of the saved at heavens gates good god are you so witless you couldnt have cobbled something together from your daily journal or were you so afraid of him being dismissed from the sea service that you thought to hide the truth from there as well mister braxton lewrie thundered false log entries no log entries is an offence against the admiralty sir under article the thirtythird sir fraudulent behaviour i could not sir not in the log i braxton moaned twisting slowly in the wind he urged me but i could not he ordered me direct sir but that would have been lying sir i could not ordered you direct to hide the truth from me sir lewrie said derisively ordered you to falsify the log which both sir braxton sighed redfaced he hasnt suffered any fever since sir thought back in cooler climes he wouldnt a tropical thing left behind we prayed and you thought he could hide out until hed dealt with it and gotten better did you lewrie snapped the last few times sir more like a bad cold sir nothing worse fa the captain hasnt had a really bad spell since so we thought he thought that is lieutenant braxton snuffled well it wasnt he almost died of it and hes going to be flat on his back for some time that leaves me in charge it makes you first officer but i tell you sir i will dismiss you from all duties if you even think of deceiving me or hiding something from me again i give you my solemn oath sir i will not braxton cringed come here mister braxton lewrie commanded do you look at the log note ive made it current from our journals look it over and determine if theres anything omitted or amiss lewrie paced the day cabin hands behind his back again you will also note sir that i have made a formal statement of your fathers illness and my taking temporary command whilst our ship operates independent of the fleet i see it sir braxton flinched after a quick peek as if sight of the log was like espying medusa and her head full of snakes which would turn him to stone at the very sight is there anything untrue in my account sir any matter which you dispute including your failure to inform me lewrie growled uhm no sir braxton sighed rubbing his brow then please be so good as to affix your signature to it sir as witness leave room on the page for mister scott mister dimmock and our surgeons names ill have them in in a moment aye sir braxton sighed again sounding like he was deflating he slumped deeper slacker into his chair like a sack of laundry in blackandwhite he had been found remiss he reached across the desk for a quill pen dipped it in the inkwell and scratched his name know what youre thinkin lewrie told himself smugly daddyll get better hell fix it for you soon as hes back on his pins ill be back under his thumb but you damned fool its in the log now for all back in london to read they all get read sooner or later then a note goes to jackson or stephens and questions get asked and that goes in your permanent records maybe not this commission with daddy to protect you both he cant rip those pages out theyll ask what action daddy took or didnt take might even convene a court braxtons mayve ruined this ship but youll never ruin another will that be all sir braxton asked dumbfounded in his doom no sir it will not be as captain protem i can go a step further i can enter a formal reprimand against you and mister boutwell our ship then engaged upon the urgent delivery of secret despatches of the highest import standing through enemycontrolled waters well you know the tune sir i can order you to sign that too or be relieved of duties immediately sir braxton gasped that was much worse than simple dereliction of duty it was a careerender a reason for a court martial sir i know father the captain and you have differed believe me when i say that i agree with you but hes my father more than any captain i owe him support dear god i wish to the almighty that id never set foot aboard this bloody ship well that makes two of us dont it lewrie sneered to himself i didnt wish to serve under him sir but he plucked strings braxton muttered were a navy family sir thats our problem my grandfather was a postcaptain his before him go aboard a gentleman volunteer when youre eight to your fathers ship your uncles ship you know how it works sir surely grandfather makes rearadmiral halfpay that ashore braxton was nigh to snuffling in his grief but ive made my own way in the fleet sir after the legup rose on my own merits no one can grease those wheels for you once youre a commission officer away from direct family i didnt want to take this commission i wanted to wait for something else but mother she made me swear just before i came away fatherd arranged it all told me about it and expected me to be glad about it she knew hed need all the help he could get his recurring malaria lewrie asked more gently that sir and braxton heaved a deep sigh like a drowning man will suck precious air the first time he surfaces hes changed sir off in the far east home for a month or so between the round voyage mothers health is too frail for the east indies she removed to lyme regis years ago rest of us off at sea never quite connecting never quite connecting when we were together either sir no it was his temper his moodiness she knew how much command of a warship meant to him after all christ damme dont do this to me braxton alan squirmed his rarely used conscience plaguing him here i hate you more than cold boiled mutton and now im beginning to feel sorry for you fathers had only a moderately successful career midshipman to commission in seven years even with family patronage sir lieutenant braxton explained nothing distinguished two commands both during the american war but they were in the far east none since god he wrote and wrote damned near got down on his knees to any old friend or patron with hapence influence he had command his indiamen lewrie coolly pointed out just for the money sir braxton shrugged we may be an old navy family but never wealthy and times were tight aye sir he had a ship but twasnt navy dye see command respect and the pay was hellish good braxton waved an inclusive hand about the cabins at the luxuries john company service had earned yet with a flip of dismissal away from home so far a year from a favourable reply from the admiralty sir if there were an offer of a commission lieutenant braxton sniffed pining away year after year with never an offer going up in seniority on the living captains list but no matter how high he climbed never an offer and seeing old shipmates junior to him being made post captains below him on the list making admiral then at last we have a war and they have to call him up sir he finally gets the chance to serve again to shine mister lewrie he was so elated and determined perhaps a touch too determined sir lewrie suggested wryly we could not know well mother did she knew how desperate hed been how sad and how important this was to him i expect she also knew his limitations best she was afraid for him sir not just his health braxton confessed she told me hed need the finest sort of loyalty and support i couldnt refuse him i couldnt turn my back on him apart so long sir i hardly knew him or what he had become and when i saw it was too late weeding out lieutenant mylett not family sir braxton smiled shyly a stranger father hounded him out like he tried with you made life a living hell for the man i should have seen the signs i dont know what happened tween the wars sir something in the far east i think so thats why theres no mention of our little nearmutiny in the log either lewrie surmised though he was informed of our suspicions oh he knew sir but its his last chance sir dye see he has to succeed there cannot be a single flaw this time well there is lewrie summed up for now mister braxton there will be no formal reprimand thankee sir braxton perked up i wont let family matters hurt my performance again sir my word ont your career ont lewrie gloomed our good repute too i expect my tenure wont last moren a week or two mister braxton and then your father be well enough to restore him to his due authority we cant change his ways too much lest the crew ran riot and i tell you true sir his ways arent my ways and i despise him for making me do things his way you can make a difference though take those relations of yours and rattle em til their teeth fly if thats what it takes but we cannot have any more terror below decks they might listen to you aye sir consider it done braxton vowed do you have any influence over him lewrie asked flicking a hand towards the sleeping coach not much there sir sorry believe me i have tried to warn him before braxton shook his head sorrowfully ive tried as son ive tried as a commission sea officer a fellow professional there are some things he simply cannot abide to hear then god help us when hes back in charge mister braxton do what you can there well have the other officers in now and once weve made formal declaration of the change in command well hoist the easy from noon today til end of the second dog tomorrow say i think our crews earned it dont you they have indeed sir braxton almost smiled lewrie swiveled the log book about so he could read it he took up the pen and dipped it there is i believe mister braxton space enough for me to amend my statement about you after all sir braxton frowned warily to note the fact that you were most unfairly placed in an impossible position between direct orders from a captain and from a father and were forced to choose whether to obey disobey or to take no action at all i think that may best explain your actions and soften our lords commissioners back home thankee sir braxton shuddered with gratitude thankee assuming of course you perform as first lieutenant to my satisfaction lewrie both tempted and put on notice i do believe that when ive relinquished authority to our rightful captain i can insert something more praiseworthy in the log i will give you no cause for dissatisfaction sir none there was a rap at the door the bang of a musket butt on the desk outside sah mister midshipman spendlove sah enter lewrie replied coolly with the tone of a captain sir this note came off shore for you just now the grinning imp reported hat under his arm and glancing about to see if rumours were true it smells very nice mister lewrie sir wonder how naples looks from the masthead mister spendlove lewrie pretended to frown at him horrid place to spend a whole day even for a japing monkey such as your wee self hmm he asked as he opened the scented note paper sealed with a florid daub of wax and addressed in an ornate highflown hand sorry sir spendlove swore ducking his head properly though he looked anything but contrite as lewrie quickly perused his note i will be going ashore for dinner mister braxton lewrie told him stuffing the note in a pocket quickly some ah further palaver with the local authorities he lied you will wish the captains gig sir braxton asked not mine to borrow really lewrie decided the jollyboat suit i should return hmm sundown i should think he didnt really expect to get another allnightin with emma hamilton nor was he sure he could stand another whole night of prattle no an afternoond suffice watch her do her attitudes of course and then beg off pleading too much ships business and lord knows he sighed theres moren enough o that chapter their idyll in naples ended soon afterwards a formal treaty with the kingdom of naples and the two sicilies was signed with lewrie proudly witnessing the ceremony but then on july he was hustled off to sea with more urgent despatches captain braxton was making a miraculously speedy recovery so there was no need to send him ashore nor would a sea voyage threaten that recovery the italian physicians assured him after a final call on their patient and that voyage back to the fleet went quickly in good weather and brisk invigorating winds cockerel scudded along like a migrating goose winds on her larboard quarter sails set all to the royals slicing the seas with the elegance of a rapier how dare you captain braxton spat at him how dare you put such nonsense in the log mister lewrie i wrote no more than the truth sir he replied resignedly truth braxton hooted the truth is not in you youre out to destroy me sir my entire family all our careers its all mendacious tripe for tuppence id he made as if to seize the offending pages and rip them out but stopped there was no expunging the brutal facts none that would not represent a greater crime in the admiraltys eyes captain braxton had no recourse furiously he realised that lewrie knew that now that you are well again sir lewrie offered as a sop i doubt the matter will come up oh not this commission damn you the bitter old man snarled signal from the flag sir lieutenant scott shouted down the skylight from the quarterdeck they acknowledge our have despatches and send us captain repair on board very well mister scott braxton bellowed in exasperation sir are you that hale lewrie asked to scale a st rates sides its only been a day since you resumed your consideration for me is touching braxton snorted by god sir admiral lord hood demands cockerels captain not you and her true captain he shall have braxton lifted the weighted packet and reached for his hat would you at least let me brief you on what you did ashore sir lewrie offered trying to make some amends at least were he to question you about the despatches i met our ambassador delivered despatches and got more from him then sailed instanter braxton sneered bustling for the doors naples is in what more is there to say now we have two weak allies stead of one thank you but no mister lewrie i require no more assistance from you youve my gig ready good get out of my way very good sir lewrie replied crisply least i tried damn yer eyes and if admiral hood catches you in a lie god alone help you its no skin off my backside but captain braxton evidently did not put a foot wrong he was aboard victory for about fifteen minutes then came sculling back with even more bundles he didnt drop like a leaf from her side and drown himself didnt dodder by sheer willpower he scaled cockerels side and took his salute though he looked whitefaced and pinched once he attained the gangway swaying more than did the deck mister lewrie theres mail for us distribute it he said weakening fast ill be in my cabins and he staggered away aye aye sir lewrie cried all but pouncing on the discarded mail sack mailword from home how rare it was to get it ships went down in storms taken by privateers and precious letters with them months a year behind they were even under the best of circumstances all too often they arrived at the wrong place chasing the erratic and unknown movements of a squadron or might reach the squadron but moulder in the mail sacks for months held for independent ships and that capriciousness worked both ways for both senders lewrie had letters from india from his father and from burgess chiswick his brotherinlaw a captain in his fathers regiment they were over a year in transit round good hope to the admiralty then to anglesgreen then there was information from his bank his solicitor from creditors those he set aside for later and a bundle from caroline and the children in the privacy of his narrow cabin he opened the earliest dated letter hoping the salt rain tar smudges and mildew hadnt ruined what she had written my dearest husband we are all so immensely proud of you far off in our kings service your spring letters came at last delighting us yet how immensely hard is my continuing burden of loneliness how oft bloody hell he groaned tearing up a little as she described her own tears he gazed at a miniature portrait a rather good copy of the one hanging in their entry hall god help me im such a bastard he thought a hound rakehelling about back to my old ways putting the leg over just any new piece that crosses my hawse no matter my well she was a rather good bit o batter wasnt she that emma oh im such a low hound though to i feel so guilty i mean i should feel guilty hold on though hmmmm he recalled the free black woman the widow hed met in clarence town in the bahamas after six months of exile in the out islands a single afternoon of rutting because hed been so very lonely too long separated from caroline didnt recall her name but she had been so bloody good at lovemaking and at restoring his spirits mean tsay shouldnt i feel abject or something he felt the urge to measure his pulse to see if he was human oh well the children missed him sorely he read on sewallis has a new tutor and is learning his letters there was scrawled proof of that in the marginsbut it was early days as to what they spelled hugh left a thumbprint and an even shakier x his mark charlotte was now on solid foods toddling about taking her first steps and out of her swaddles at last mistress mcgowan caroline had dismissed shed simply gotten too dictatorial about running the entire household there was a scandal about maggie fletcher the vicars daughters maidservant maudie beakman jilted by the same man whod the planting season had gone well and the weather bid fair for a bountiful harvest and old william pitt had passed over oh damme lewrie sighed bitterly do not know how to tell you this beloved but pitt is gone once you went to sea the poor old dear began to fade lord how sad he also seemed prowling the house and grounds as if in search of you evernapping in your chair alone upon items of your clothing were they left out and crying piteous ly for attention demanding explanation of your absence he climbed into my lap his last afternoon as i sat and knitted bythe garden he played with some wool then curled up and went to sleep and i sensed somehow that i should not disturb him no matter the distraction he woke looked up put one paw to my breast and then he lay back down uttering one last trill oh pitt lewrie cried dropping the letter to his lap tears in his eyes for certain now poor old beast poor old puss least your last years were peaceful chickens to chase catnip and cream good scraps god you inhuman bastard he scathed himself no remorse for cheatin on your wife yet you cry over the death of a stupid cat maybe its all of a piece he muttered throatily covering his face with a dirtstiffened towel so no one else would hear as he wept very possibly for all v ne tibi tune horrenda rapax ad litora puppem ventus agat ludo volitans cum turma superbo pulvereis exultat equis ulu lataque tellus intremit etpugnas mota pater incitat hasta let not then the driving blast carry your ship to those dreadful shores what time the troop in arrogant sport fly here and there exultant on dusty steeds and the ground trembles to their halloing and their sire incites them to battle with the brandished spear valerius flaccus argonautica book iv chapter all secure midshipman anthony braxton read off the bunting hoisted on victory fleet will enter harbour in columns of divisions theyre just giving us the place then lieutenant scott marveled so it would appear sir captain braxton grunted lowering his telescope lips snug with aspersionperhaps at french timidity captain elphinstones landing at the fort yonder has cowed em at last theyre streaming out of their forts inland norwest for those farther hills well it beats fighting our way in all hollow sir the marine captain oneal opined darkly as he beheld the towering heights rough headlands and the many forts and batteries of toulon granted sir braxton grumbled sounding disappointed though weve what barely marines with the entire fleet oneal said in a softer voice to lewrie standing nearer the wheel had this fleet tried to force a landing against opposition wed have lost half on the first fortifications alone with the city for us though sir lewrie scoffed gently i doubt theyd have put up much resistance even if it had come to that the republican diehards were in the minority thank god and they were not to know how much we had at our disposal twentyone sail with us and god knows what over the horizon after rejoining hoods fleet it had looked to be the very worst sort of naval serviceblockade duty slowly plodding in neat ordered lines of battle from marseilles round cape cicie to toulon and back parading the might of the royal navy jogging offandon that forbidding coast in hopes that the french might sally forth for battle rumours and a spying out under cover of a truce mission by lieutenant edward cooke of victory had determined that the french had at least twentyone sail of the line in port seventeen of them more or less ready for sea and frigates and sloops of war twoapenny but for a few fast frigates ordered to trail their coats into the bay of toulon between cape sepet and cape de la garonne to tempt a response hood hadnt tried to enter in force and the french had remained strangely somnolent those royalists in toulon though the ones sir william hamilton had spoken of theyd sent a twoman committee to victory under a flag of truce on august lieutenant edward cooke had gone ashore on the th then one more time to carry hoods reply cooke had been shot at by a frigate with republican sentiments hailed as a hero and damn near chaired in triumph to a meeting of a royalist committee intent on surrender arrested by republicans on the way back then freed by a royalist mob again on the th he went ashore returning with a french navy officer captain dlmbert of the seventyfourgun apollon and the agreement was ratified toulon was theirs so now cockerel was inside the bay of toulon slowly heaving her way under a topsl breeze from the south beamreaching towards the inner roads just north of the peninsula which formed cape sepet the southern guard of the great port where before they would not have dared it helped that the revolutionary government in paris had just proscribed var and provence warning that troops and guillotines were coming if they did not immediately submit to the republic the situation was what some might call interesting to say the least while a fair majority of toulon was royalist declared for some prince now called louis xvii there was a moderately sized minority of republicans mostly the poor or the bitter dead set against the aristocracy the large landowners and the merchant class with opportunists on either hand it went without saying yet the french mediterranean fleet held only a minority of royalists and a majority of republicans rearadmiral st mien secondincommand had seized forts facing the inner little road of toulon with the crews of seven lineofbattle ships about men disobeying orders of the staunchly royalist rear admiral comte de trogoff who actually commanded the port early on the th a force of men the greatest portion of two regiments embarked with hoods fleet reinforced by about marines and seamen under the overall command of captain george keith elphinstone of hms robust had landed at fort la malgue on the right side of the spit of land that divided the little and the great roads high enough to overlook and dominate st juliens muchlowerset forts elphinstone had sent a demand for st mien to surrender and had warned that any vessel which did not enter toulon s inner basin land its powder and send its crew ashore would be taken under fire that was enough for st mien his honour had been satisfied by token resistance so he had decamped and now admiral hood could sail in without a shot being fired without a single casualty they were in total possession of a french city an entire french fleet and a naval base with all its arsenals powder mills and stocks foundries for cannon and anchors and immense quantities of naval stores hard to think of us taking all this even were we fifty sail mister dimmock spoke up nodding to the marine captain first weather cape sepet as weve done and its simply stiff with guns there young sirs he pointed out to the midshipmen with a ferrule in his hand as they gathered about for a lessonnear the end of the peninsula on the highest hill of cape sepet thats what mister spendlove c croix des signaux sir aye the signals cross thats fairly new semaphore tower dimmock beamed his approval the old one the great tower is further inside the harbour near fort la malgue now below croix des signaux theres batterie la croix north shore of the peninsula then west of that theres batterie des freres the brothers go farther west and you come in range of fort mandrier which commands the south side of the great road next to the infirmarie sort o like our greenwich naval hospital back home cross an inlet from fort mandrier just at the thinnest shank of the peninsula facin the golfe de la veche mister dulwer would you anchor in the bay of toulon sir uhm perhaps not sir not all the time dont sound too definite will ye now mister dulwer the sailing master sighed no yed not too deep for the proper scope on cables een do you weight em with gun barrels and a rocky bottom levanter comes up it throws a heavy sea from the eastrd crost all that open water from plage de la garonne plage means beach right lads right now between batteries croix and freres its no moren one sea mile to cape bran on the north shore of the mainland batteries there too with fortytwopounders north tip o cape sepet and cape brun squeeze in to mark the entrance to the great road you have a little more shelter in the great road its still foul holding ground but shallowern the bay west of cape bran therere batteries on a high cliff on this spit of land here he said indicating the chart cant rightly see it from the quarterdeck all our fleet in the way ha ha the midshipmen made sure to sound appreciative of dimmocks jape then to the west of those batteries is fort la malgue which we took this morning on another steep headland little waterfort guards the foot of it fort st louis west o la malgue theres this peninsula long narrow and steep almost vertical cliffs great tower on its tip where it juts southerly and pinches off the great road from the little road guns aplenty there too mind this narrow pass not half a sea mile from the great road to the little le goulet frogs call it thats the gullet in real language across the gullet is where the frogs tried to make a stand this morning northern side of the golfe de la veche on hauteur de grasse big round hilly thing just on our bows if ye care to look two little spurs on its tip southern has fort de balaguer the northern fort leguillette lower than la malgue so we couldve shot howitzers or mortars into them so thats why the frogs took french leave ha ha another wave of laughter swept the quarterdeck more sincere this time over mister dimmocks pun including the officers and seamen the little road would you anchor there mister dulwer aye sir dulwer shot back quickly aye ye would dimmock agreed very sheltered fairly shallow on the small side though get out of the shallows along the shore and you dont have much room to swing maybe three or four ships may lie in the little road souwest end thats la seyne civilian harbour so they take most of the available space more batteries unfortunately coverin la seyne is fort crayon a very low shore battery in an inlet north of there is dubrun then another on the north side of the little road thats le millaud powder mills there too i recall atop them all west of town above these marshes is fort malbousquet then fort missicy at the foot of this other hill below malbousquet so where do they really keep their ships mister dimmock spendlove asked squirming with either boredom or confusion do you get past all this into the little road sir you come about hard tstarbd and sail north through the pass in the channel booms log and chain stout as anything and theres the basin of toulon they can cram up to thirty sail of the line in there tgether bows or sternto the quays as most do in the mediterranean fenders betwixt so they wont chafe their gunnls off walk all day in shade along the quay below their bowsprits not a stones throw from warehouses and such but dimmock warned with a theatrical pause to get into the basin theres one damnall tough nut still to crack young sirs theres the jetties the breakwaters that make the basin theyre built so low to the water itd be like hitting a piece of driftwood laid out in a fleur deau the very worst sort of coastal fort theyre hollow and bombproof and stiff with guns entrance channel isnt a musketshot wide with fortytwopounders to either beam and the towns like an old kings castle city walls are like a fort with moats and drawbridges and gates part of it they call fort de france and above it all look up yonder behind the town sirs eighteen hundred feet high that chain of hills are a ravine on the norwest gorge st antoine and another narrow valley north steep crumbly stuff theres forts all over up yonder with ovens for heating shot high nough for accurate plungin fire what an effort they put into this place lieutenant clement braxton commented with a whispery whistle of awe marshes seepy springs ive read everywhere one looks and no low tides to give them time to dig or lay foundations its an engineering masterpiece aye mister braxton yer correct sir dimmock agreed heartily cant wait to get ashore an look it over myself east side of the basin they keep the lesser ships o war frigates and such shipyard and launchways graving docks and theres a drydock thatd rock you back on your heels too brute of a thing think of how they managed to build that sir seal it and pump out with convict labour i think aye sir toulon maynt be the worlds best harbour tlie in but its the worlds most fortified and most impressive built well end of yer geography lesson lads back to your stations were sure to come to anchor before the hours out from the sea and the land lewrie commented coming to join them as the midshipmen scattered hellish fortified better for us when it comes to holding it sir captain oneal agreed nine fathm nine fathm tthis line a leadsman called from the larboard foremast chains cockerel drew three fathoms when deep laden steady as she goes quartermaster aye aye sir steadyz she goes a weak sun shone that day for a wonder as if in celebration of their bloodless victory quite unlike the weather of their short blockade which had shipped green seas and galeforce winds at times scattering the squadrons and straining their masts nigh to snapping watery wan sunlight reflected from the charcoal blue sea of the great road wavemotes of light dancing on the sides of the massive warships and dun sails and dull colours were stagelit to an artists whiteness or sheening brilliance as if posed for a commemorative oil during those rare moments of clear weather southern france had appeared rather attractive lewried thought much like naples though in rockiness and semisere harshness whenever theyd gone close inshore hed espied hamlets and fishing villages that seemed cheerful enough and on the slopes of southern france there was a softer and lusher palette of greens than naples could ever boast more verdantly bright less dusty and muted from high summer thatchy tan to springshoot green the grasslands vineyards and forests olive groves and pastures seemed to roll and tumble as they were brushed by some bright scudding clouds shadows apart from toulon where sunlight dappled and sparkled and the clouds scudded the headlands and hills appeared to glow gold and umber the tiled terracotta roofs were lit flamine red and the very least cottages of var and provence were exotically lambent but not toulon around toulon there seemed a pall an ominous trick of lighting as if the capes the headlands the bays and massive hillsmountains really lewrie decidedwere shrouded by a funereal gloom as if some storm clouds must hang perpetual as if for some malevolent reason her harsh greyness of stark granite forts was forever deprived of any warmth or hope of mediterranean sunshine pent from the lushness of her hinterland by grimly looming bare and lifeless mountain masses and begirt with the sinews and engines of warfare with the ship well in hand in a deepwater fairway lewrie took time to peer at the chart mister dimmock had left tacked to the traverse board looking past his usual sailors concerns of depths bearings and seamarks to the hills beyond toulon was girded by a host of lofty fortresses and redoubts st antoine st catherine artigues pharon la garde and la vallette and a myriad of lesser forts redans batteries and strongpoints which guarded the forbidding mountains the narrow valleys between and the passes and gorges the terrain was fairly open to the east sprinkled with villages and chateaux gently rolling and benign along the plaine de la garde divided by a narrow ridge that ran westtonoreast above the road to hieres before the mountains shouldered into the coast above forts st catherine and la malgue on the western approaches from the pass at ollioules through which the marseilles road debouched was a harsher coastal plain this one puckered pimpled and stippled with many mountain spurs crablike hills and rugged prominences and the roads wound snakelike to conform to them fifteen miles he marched off with a pair of brass dividers on the chart fifteen miles of perimeter and approaches which had to be garrisoned and guarded manned with troops and guns if the coalition was to hold toulon say naples sends their promised like the treaty said he speculatedthough what little hed seen of neapolitan troops and that with an untrained sailors eye hadnt impressed him that much and were their military commissariat anything like what mister husie had reported after visiting their naval supply establishment then it was perhaps a cut above a barking shambles but not by much sardinia theyre down for mensay we get a tenth of that army were paying good golden guineas for spain of course why of course he snickered to himself still amazed that they were now firm allies correctionjust allies just this morning the spanish fleet had come up over the horizon at last like a jackinthebox rushing in untidy order to enter harbour at the same time as the royal navy troops aboard he wondered sure to be have to be spain had a huge army but a narrow rugged border with france along the daunting pyrenees poor and downtrodden as their peasants were as arrogant and stiffneckedas benightedas their toplofty aristocracy was it was in spains best interests to send a big contingent quickly to stamp the french revolutionaries into the floor like cockroaches before any of that rights of man egalitarian bumf caught on in spain itself he thought men would be a safe wager and english regiments that went without saying there were men at gibraltar and with spain allied thered be no reason to keep them there no worry about a siege such as the one his fatherd gone through when hed won his knighthood in the last war but one troops out from home too if lords dundas and grenville had been scheming this one up as long as sir william hamilton had alluded bags of em austria well maybe too busy on frances eastern borders alan decided they and the prussians would mass to walk into france along the traditional routes but part of the austrian empire was in northern italy so surely another or so cutting west from genoa or leghorn or get us to escort transports from there and bring em direct and quick he decided itll have to be quick or soon as they get word from us that brightened his prospects for a moment despatches would go home to all the allies to naples for certain cockerel might sail on the next morning he could go ashore again visit emma hamilton one more time emulate some of those erotic etruscan fragments theyd seen in their gallery of choice the ones with the cavorting well maybe thats not a good idea he sighed leaving the chart wondering again where his conscience was hiding or if he in truth had one once was enough took the edge off every six monthsr so his brief enthusiasm left him and he shivered inexplicably to a brisk african wind on his left shoulder that gave no warmth hellish gloomy damn place he concluded abandon all hope ye who enter here he muttered sir the senior helmsman inquired shifting his quid to another cheek nothing lewrie granted steady as she goes chapter perhaps it was just as well that captain horatio nelsons sixtyfourgunned agamemnon bore the word to naples lewrie thought with the french mediterranean fleet captured in one fell swoop all her proud large lineofbattle ships in the bag the more impressive british liners were freed to make the diplomatic calls about the regionthose ships captained by men of greater stature and diplomatic experience cockerel idled about in the golfe du lion for a few days to keep an eye on marseilles round cape cicie to the west before that pointless task was undertaken by a small squadron of british s and she returned to toulon there was nothing much to guard against since only a scattered handful of french frigates and corvettes were still free to operate and those few were alone uncoordinated and fearful you really can walk in their shade lieutenant barnaby scott commented as they toured the basin a few days later everywhere there was bustle proud french ships were being stripped of their guns and powder rowing boats worked like a plague of waterbeetles to carry captured supplies out to the spanish and british ships and a horde of curiosity seekers such as lewrie and scott had come ashore to gawp over all theyd won so easily and crow with elation and from the moment their cutter had touched a quay theyd been gawped at in turn cheered by royalist toulonese gushed over by women and men with white bourbon cockades on their coats or their hats any restaurant would kick frogs out to seat them and fete them any desire they had was fulfilled mostly and they couldnt seem to buy a drink in the town it was given with bubbly expressions of gratitude damn friendly lot barnaby scott opined for frogs there was martial music clattering hooves on cobblestones and the heavy drumming of fieldartillery carriages and caissons as a spanish halfregiment paraded by above the basin on the main water street spose we should be about our shopping lewrie shrugged still uneasy with the concept of friendly frenchmen besides ambling about by themselves surrounded by convict labourers in their filthy slops and irons surrounded by milling packs of truculent and beetlebrowed french sailors who were most pointedly not wearing royalist cockades and who hawked and spat behind their backs or muttered sneering words behind their hands as they passed well they might be disarmed and supposedly harmless but lewrie didnt want to take the chance of risking the drunkest or the surliest of them no matter how near help in the form of royal navy working parties or marine sentries might be on the northern shore of the basins quays it all spread out before them as they stopped and stood gazing down upon the pool of water between the jetties and the warehouses dry dock and arsenals a host of docked warships frigates corvettes gunboats floating batteries that looked more like ancient oared war galleys s and s of the line and two monstrous gun ships of the st rate so huge they dwarfed all others even british st rates comfortin to know well have use of all these lewrie said on frogs build damn good ships finer entries leaner quickwork sail faster than ours and thats a fact always have ah tisnt the ship makes the difference sir scott scoffed a trifle bleary from all the gratitude hed taken aboard tis men who decide a battle frogsve never had the stomach for fighting not at musket or pistolshot broadsides to broadsides lay off so please you and fire at your rigging pack o spineless snaileatin mollies they are frogeatin buttfuckers all they know how to do is mince a little less of it mister scott lewrie cautioned those near us arent mincing exactly why dont you smile and nod shit on em sir scott sneered shit on em i was raised thate a frenchman worsen old scratch himself hate em worse than dons when you get right down to it damme if ill pander to any frog no matter hes licking mine arse to save his let em bring on their guillotines i say cut the odds down for us first and well sort out the survivors later and spare the world any more of em i truly do despair of you mister scott lewrie replied sternly not for the first time bluff humorous and mehearty as scott could be he had a surly side when hed been tippling which he did about as often as the unfortunate little leftenant dolittle banbrook in the past month or so lewrie had begun to notice as that other unfortunate lieutenant clement braxton had tried anew to ingratiate himself with his own messmates after his fathers illness it had been scott whod still have no truck with him which made it harder for the others to relent to realise that the son was nothing like the sire and accept his shy and clumsy offerings i despair of the whole shitten mess sir scott gloomed taken by a bluedevil mood of a sudden braxtons and braxtons then even more braxtons generation unto generation pestiferous as frogs in shut up lewrie snapped sir scott looked at him owlishly like falstaff called down by a drinking partner but he did shut up at least if you cannot control yourself sir go back aboard youd deny me a few hours of peace of freedom from our tyrants sir scott wheedled sounding genuinely hurt send me back to more shut up mister scott lewrie snarled i mean it aboard or ashore therell be no more of that talk sets yourself a bad habit carp all you like two years from now when the commissions over but manage yourself now sir mister lewrie you hate em as much as i do as much as we both hate frogs and dons i know it so sir will you obey me lewrie demanded suddenly fed up with it with scott with his impossible task and begrudging his own few hours of freedom interrupted by a maundering halfdrunken pest scott was hed imaginedtil now at leasta kindred spirit cynical sarcastic wryly funny to talk to a rakehell and a rogue but no scott had a deeper darker streak that he didnt much care for very well sir scott replied stiffly drawing himself up to a full height doffing his hat in salute ill say no more i trust you may excuse me then sir since you find my company distasteful i will spare you any further i will take my leave sir very well mister scott lewrie sighed wondering if he had not lost the mans respect and his authority over him as well as what had passed for a tentative beginning to a careerlong friendship he suspected that he had lieutenant barnaby scott was the sort whod hold a grudge over a trifle such as this drunk or sober keep yourself out of any trouble mister scott your opinions anent frogs that d spare you no end of grief and be back aboard by sundown sir scott said stiffly almost clicking his shoe heels like a prussian grenadier and departing a trifle unsteadily parting a path through french citizens subjects and sailors by his brusque mood and his daunting dammeboy bulk and height shit i give up lewrie sighed in a bitter whisper hed just lost an ally in the wardroom perhaps made a sullen enemy it was as if scott felt betrayed that lewrie who should have been on his side had aided clement braxtons tentative essays at camaraderie much as a jilted lover might turn on the suitor whod scorned her what next i ask you alan queried turning his face up to the sky pardon msieur votre ami e eez beaucoup trink hein what lewrie snapped turning to find his accuser wait a bit he brightened trying to remember where and how hed met a french naval officer damme i know you dont i st kitts votre fregate mon fregate ve

toulonnaise le vin magnifique it was wine i was after lewrie explained waffling i came to do some shopping for the wardroom and the others had entrusted him and lieutenant scott with a cache of coin

some truly outrageous knockdown bargains ve do zat maintenant i aid you viz ze storekeepers hein an zen you dine viz us as our onoured guest i insist well in that case id be delighted lewrie replied never one to turn down a free meal lead me im yours chapter they were the de crillarts a rather nice family for frogs after an hour of shopping and with charles help the discovery of a wellstocked chandlery and a chandler who wasnt trying to pay off the national debt theyd sent the cutter back to cockerel gunndeep with everything theyd hoped for lieutenant charles auguste de crillart and his relations lodged in what they termed an appartement very west indies in character with wroughtiron balconies and tall windows overlooking the basin high up on the sloping towns heights the late afternoon vista was pleasant and fairly cool the apartment airy and well lit but a bit on the tattered side shabbily respectable but certainly not one of the better neighbourhoods not what lewrie would have thought suitable for aristocracy even genteelly straitened aristocracy as if charles was forced to live on his naval payand that given the times uncertain in amount and regularity of payment maman was one of those long horsefaced stoutjawed ladies of the old school who clung to pale face powders and whitefloured wigs hortense de crillart was in her middle fifties and might have been a handsome woman in her day she had not been as enthralled as charles had said to have another maw at her table though lewrie had mollified her misgivings with a basket of victuals and wine from the chandlery as a house gift louis the younger brotherchevalier louis de crillart he went bywas a sulky pimply sort darkhaired and darkeyed initially stiff with grave hauteur though hed thawed a little as the evening progressed he was twenty and had been a junior officer in a famous cavalry regiment much like a british coronet in a unit which could boast the kings own in its designation the regiment had been disbanded its aristocratic officers dismissed or beheaded and it was now run by corporals and sergeants to chevalier louis great and voluble disgust lewrie sensed that there was some rancour among the brothers louis and charles as if the dead father and charlesthe current baronhad made a devils bargain in relinquishing their titles in selling off their estates and fleeing instead of fighting though they tried to be affable and gracious to their guest alan caught a few flurries of rapid french tossed between them like grenades now and then not meant for his ears poor his french might be but he did catch enough of their gist to realise that charles declaration for the republic which had saved their lives from the guillotine and his first enthusiastic support of the assembly was a black betrayal to louis the intensest sort of royalist firebrand looking at him as he spoke his eyes glaring darting under his dark brows the quick impatient way he tossed his loosegathered hair away from his face lewrie could imagine him the same sort of fanatic as the ones whod launched the terrora fanatic equally dedicated to his bright shining causeon the opposing side charles without his uniform coat and hat at ease at the table with a glass of wine in his hand and a fund of stories about shipboard life in the french navy seemed much the same charming fellow he had in the caribbean after lewries ship desperate had taken caprkieuse and theyd dined together so often on the sail back to antigua with lewrie rated midshipman and masters mate in charge of the prize and charles on his parole not like a baron at all then or now lewrie thought charles appeared more like a member of the petitbourgeoisie a chap more comfortable in furry slippers after a long day at a clerking desk he was distinguishedlooking about lewries age nothing to write home about though regular features average height and all the usual forgettable bumf the intriguing member of the family was the younger female cousin sophie de maubeuge her story was more tragic whilst charles presence in the estatesgeneral had saved his family her father and all her relations had been too welltodo too resistant to changetoo well known and powerful shed fled her convent school to hide in normandy with the de crillarts whilst the tumbrils and the mobs had claimed most of her kin including her immediate family she was now the sole survivor the last vicomtesse de maubeuge it was a heady title for such a sylphlike shy softspoken girl sophie was only fifteen slim and petite the sort who softly whispered when she spoke and that rarely though graced with the innate bredinthebone polish of aristocracy the tutoring in social arts and such she was as meek as a scullery maid and smiled or laughed seldom though lewrie considered her recent horrible history a damned good reason for her gravity that and a proper convent sergeantmajor nun upbringing she was of middling height a bit less than five and a half feet tall between seven and eight stone in weight sophies features were bewitchingly gamine high cheekbones a pertly tapering face full and wide lips and crowned by overly large slightly almondshaped eyes of a startling green hue brilliant as cats eyes and set like glittering gems in a flawless peachesancream complexion her hair which she still wore long and simple in girlish fashion was a fascinating reddish auburn hue more russet or red chestnut than anything else alan could think to compare it to and the very idea that some bloodyeyed peasants gutter sweepings and mobocracy could even begin to think of chopping the head off such an entrancing and harmless young thing set his blood boiling quite apart from being covertly besotted he found his heart going out to her in sympathy there was trouble there too hed noted when he tried to be his most charming and amusing self to cosset her into a better mood with songs or japes chevalier louis had left off berating republicans to glare at him for being amusing for monopolising her attention and lewrie also noted when tender young sophie de maubeuge had sheeps eyes or laughed at last she directed her gaze and encouragement towards charles her saviour as if to share with him it had been his family fortune what little of it was left after selling their estates and mostprized possessions to gimleteyed agents or hateful neighbours that had supported her had brought her down to toulon and safety and alan learned it had taken more than charles declaration of support and allegiance to the republicit had taken hefty bribes to keep her off the local committees lists of those who deserved their necks stretched below the blade of a guillotine supper with the familya hearty and creamy soup laced with onions and a few dubious shreds of chicken scads of crusty bread and butter a runny omelet served with wellseasoned sliced and fried potatoes and a small veal cutlet nestled at the side of his plate aswim in a thin wine gravy with an abundance of mushrooms disguising what a tiny cutlet it was ladled atop and a marvelous st emilion bordeaux several bottles in fact to wash it all down enough wine to at last mellow even the sulkiest to a semblance of good cheer and put a dimple in sophies cheek i must be going charles lewrie said at last after mangling a tune on a borrowed recorder and returning it to sophies care back to your ship crillart shrugged i walk viz you to ze quays alain permettezmoi maman sophie said quickly sounding more like a regular girl eager to go out at last as she fetched lewries hat like the daughter of a middungcommon family might instead of waiting for some servant to do it oui maman allowed grudgingly with a stern expression her lips flattened over her long teeth and gums making her look even more horsefaced and lewrie caught another subtle undertone as madame de crillart darted her glances to both sophie and charles then at louis alan made his most courtly goodbye bowed low in conge expressed how much hed enjoyed himself and promised to repay their generous hospitality maman replied in kind though she sounded doubtful it was a lovely time for a stroll close to sundown with cool breezes ruffling the waters of the basin and the farther little road the street lamps being lit and the apartments and shops aglow with a candle or lantern in every window the sun was quite low and it was a gold and orange sunset dusky rosereddish grey to the south and east louis thankfully did not accompany them so charles and alan strode to either side of the shorter sophie

seamen still thronged their decks for lack of a better place to house them strangely silent ships too with none of the usual dogwatch music or humumm to be heard their yards still properly squared and crossed and rigging taut spidermazed black against the sunset few lights showed even through lowerdeck gunports opened for ventilation glims at the belfries and wheels from wardroom or greatcabin

beloved frigate squeezed in so snug between others on the eastern quay that she looked as forlorn as some barge abandoned in a weeded shipbreakers yard peutstre soon charles lewrie assured him with enough loyal seamen surely its in the coalitions interests to raise a royalist squadron to show the world and encourage the other maritime provinces suchz the vendee corsica perhaps peutetre hey theyd promote a loyal lieutenant to how do you say capitaine de fregate capitaine charles mused with a slight smile zat soun tres bon oui peutetre mon ami capitaine de fregate charles auguste baron de

but then make sure i dance at yer weddin why not admiral mademoiselle sophie lewrie teased slyly to see what her response might be once the revolutionariesve been beat and france is herself again well

royale de la biftecs oh pardon she cried using an insulting for the french anyway colloquialism blushing to the roots of her hair under her stylish little hat she struggled with her most important point votre royal navy yet zey do not oui mademoiselle je suis marie lewrie replied with a wink to her though it cut a bit rough to declare such to a girl as desirable as she no matter her age damme but that makes me feel ancient he cringed with three children he went on feeling even more ancient i wed in and caroline sailed with me to the bahamas where we had our eldest son cruel it might be but he delighted in encouraging her fantasies and perhaps in opening charles eyes and the royal navy doesnt think any the less of me he lied and that most arrantly too merci msieur she mouthed at him in silence with her back to her intended whether he knew it or not yet almost bouncing in her glee well i must leave you now charles mademoiselle pardon vicomtesse de maubeuge baron de crillart my undying thanks for they bowed their last departure and lewrie watched them with a wry eye as they began another long stroll home cousin or notand he still wasnt sure how close their consanguinity wasshed be a fine catch no error hed be a fine catch too lewrie whistled for a passing boat and the coxswain lifted his arm and put his tiller over in reply it struck lewrie that hed thoroughly enjoyed his brief stint of domesticity of being even for a few precious hours more intent upon civilian familial concerns instead of cockerels sea of troubles hed quite enjoyed being avuncular with the young girl even if he had turned out to be a mischievous meddlesome sort of uncle better charles than louis thats for certain alan muttered to himself as his boat approached the landing steps and he was sure maman hortense would agree with him louis there was a lad needed shunning fast he might be closer to sophies age might be halfseasover about her whilst charles was blind as a bat but there was too much anger to him too much sulkiness too much of the fanatical young fireeater about him alan didnt think that portended a long life for the young chevalier not in these times with another of his sudden chills alan recalled another time in another revolution when hed encountered such dedicated hatred and such fanaticism for a cause just after theyd escaped yorktown and the surrender down on guinea neck with governour and burgess chiswick and their remaining handful of north carolina loyalist riflemen that meaningless last skirmish before their escape cross the chesapeake thatd slain so many people and that despicable young lad whod led the french to them the one governourd gutshot after and left to die in writhing agony and after yorktown whered i go he asked himself to wilmington to help evacuate the cape fear loyalists where i first met caroline and the rest of the chiswicks loyalists and the de crillarts royalists same bloody thing he growled nice people caught up in the worst of circumstances and everyone out for their blood same as damme he shivered at the appalling coincidences and hoped that this time things might turn out different chapter ships compny off hats and salute lewrie ordained as captain braxton scaled cockerels side to appear in the entry port to take his due honours and doff his own hat briefly lewrie hoped that he was in a good mood for a change theyd swung idle to a best bower and kedge anchor for a whole dispiriting week with nothing to do and the crews behaviour never of the best had gotten surlier no matter how much makework theyd laid on mister lewrie braxton appeared to smile for an instant sir lewrie replied with a hopeful nod and thinking that his captain must have gotten a glass or two of something welcoming ashore during his interview with rearadmiral charles goodall the appointed military governor of toulon he seemed positively mellowed for once dismiss the hands mister lewrie braxton drawled then bestowed upon his first lieutenant another mystifying smile aye aye sir two in a week thats damn near frightninl alan thought then join me in my cabins sir braxton prosed on and then smiled one more time before descending to the gun deck three lewrie noted three dear lord whats he know that i dont alan shuddered just had a long chat with goodall braxton began to explain he left lewrie standing before his desk without offer of a seat as he took his own ease in his chair he did not offer alan a drink though he was sipping a coolish glass of rhenish quite a conundrum we have here mister lewrie sir alan said warily half our lineofbattle ships off at sea doin god knows what lord hood wishes em to do braxton speculated as he undid his stock weve stripped the larger vessels of hands and marines to flesh out the garrison and man the artillery before our reinforcements arrive and still have need of men ashore beginning to get my drift are you mister lewrie i believe so sir alan said with a sick nod hirin maltese seamen would you believe it braxton cackled somewhere between real mirth and sour surprise the grand master of malta will sell us the services of of the bastards for a hefty fee id wager then we have to pay em able seamens wages to boot theyll starve to death on that lewrie thought that way mister lewrie more experienced british tars and their officers may be spared for land service aha sir quite the protege of lord hood arent you now sir braxton all but simpered yorktown and all that im told some work ashore in the far east before with troops and guns oh admiral goodall was all ears perky as anything when i told him your sterlin qualities have to have a stout fellow like him he told me lewrie and so he will i volunteered you told him you were eager as anything to get at the frogs i dont misrepresent you do i sir you wouldnt get cold feet would you now no that wouldnt look good in your record nor to lord hood either bein called a coward whod i will pack my seachest sir lewrie sighed thought you might braxton relished will cockerel be giving up any hands to assist me sir ill give you mister scott and mister midshipman spendlove your man cony off the foremast and twenty more hands only half of em able seamen mind cant spare much beyond them idlers and waisters off the gangways any of the marine complement sir cant spare a one mister lewrie braxton sighed almost making himself sound sad with maltese newcomes aboard ill have need of marines moren ever thats where cockerels bound dont ye know sir malta braxton rose from his chair to shuffle round his desk where ill get myself a crew at last with all dross weeded out with willing dago riffraff to take their place men wholl work chearly for me and toe my line to the very inch mister lewrie to the very inch it would seem so sir alan sulked and youll get your son as first your nephew as acting lieutenant and then you can do as you damned well please or so you think and im shot of you at last mister lewrie braxton muttered believe me when i tell you once youre gone from us i can find an hundred ways to make sure you never return i dont care if you make post overnight i dont care if you earn yourself a bloody knighthood ashore im shot of you and ill sing your praises to heaven itself if thatll keep you gone enjoy your duties ashore mister lewrie take joy of em whilst im at sea beyond the reach of your obstructions you are free to leave now mister lewrie dismiss aye aye sir lewrie huffed though secretly happy to be free no matter how outmaneuvered he felt at that moment how stupid hed been to have not seen the chance of this coming uhm sir about the men what about em you will pick the uhm our volunteers sir picked em already sir braxton grinned malevolently weeks ago months ago i made my list evry bad apple we have is yours what captain braxton termed bad apples turned out to be a fair pack of men bosuns mate porter for the senior hand though braxton thought him too young and softhanded able seamen lisney and gracey landsman preston able seaman sadler ordinary seamen gittons and gold his leastfavourite men those whod scowled too darkly after their floggings or had shown too much independence of spirit his leastfavourite midshipman spendlove most importantly not family a gunners mate who hadnt licked his boots a quartergunner and four gun captains along with enough landsmen to pulleyhauley serve as rammers and loaders for captured french guns and a few of the truly criminal and bootless a few of the weaker spindlier types whod never had any business going aboard a ship of war a few of the tomnoddies with which every military or naval establishment was cursedthose too dense to come in from out of a driving rain but whose backs and sinews were stout don know whether tlaughr cry sir cony muttered as a cutter bore them shoreward he was well turned out in a dark blue round shell jacket blueandwhite chequered gingham shirt reasonably clean white sloptrousers and a stout pair of shoes well blacked as was his wide and flatbrimmed tarred sennet hat a small seachest and a loose kit bag rested by his toes amen to that cony lewrie sighed looking back at cockerel as she receded in the distance of the outer road weep thats certain lieutenant barnaby scott gloomed beside him near the tillerman christ least she was a shipl ellship she were someone up forward whispered and lewrie turned but could not discover whether it had been one of his cockerels whod spoken out or one of the anonymous oarsmen as much as his own feelings on the matter of his expulsion were still unsettled he could see the same mirrored on the faces of the men relief a jeering taunting joy now they were free of their oppressors or a darkly glum glower hellship or not shed been home anchor to the familiar and now these sailors were cast adrift cut off from fellow sufferers with whom theyd come to enjoy sharing their suffering feel ive just been sent down from harrow lewrie smirked trying to buoy his emotions turning again to study his ship hmmph from lieutenant scott hulking over him hmmph to good public schools to class and advantage perhaps or to being sent down with lewrie through no fault of his own and brooding on the injustice done him scott abhorred cockerel and his braxtons one and all yet now he was just as adrift as one of the snuffling powdermonkeys torn from the comforts of the wardroom the certainty of a limited world and his rightful station in it his duties and his honour which were simple and understandable ashore god knew what hed be asked to do how far out of his proper depth hed be tossed and from his black glower and his hmmph lewrie knew he highly resented his loss and the poor sort of company with which hed been marooned lewrie got his party ashore at the north quay of the basin drew their attention back to him from their rubbernecking and gawping about at the massive ships the immensity of all theyd captured there was a postcaptain to receive them with a harried midshipman who bore a sheaf of pages and there was nothing more dangerous in the entire royal navy than a midshipman with temporary authority and a sheaf of orders he thought he understood mister lewrie mister scott sirs the teen said crisply ive orders your party will berth in yon guardhouse sirs hard by the gate to the dockyard just cross there sirs temporary i believe but if you would be so good as to follow me sirs off they went with lewrie scott and the bosuns mate whippingin the stragglers like exasperated sheepdogs bloody ell ye cant go adrift in a furlong can ye newton porter snapped keep yer mind on it an whos the fool wot lef is sea bag bhind bloody the guardhouse had been a barracks for the dockyard sentries and the hands oohed and ahhed as they quickly explored it hooting with pleasure as they discovered its luxuries s got the real beds it as sadler boomed from the back no more ammocks bloody hell theys good mattresses too lads lookit theys a well inna back an and wash stands pumpwater an coal grates us kin make ot a younger voice piped in wonder there are officers quarters above sirs the midshipman said in a softer voice rather nice im told conveniently placed so you may keep an eye on them after dark these he indicated a locked rack of muskets sj etienne arsenal cal a case of bayonets a wall hung with powder horns and cartridge boxes crossbelts and infantry hangers im afraid your men will have to use these for lack of british arms sirs he told them with a faint moue of disgust anything else you need sirs simply go cross to the warehouses on the west side and indent for the frogs have mountains of supplies temporary you said any idea what were to do now were here lewrie asked not the faintest sir sorry once youve settled your people you may inquire at the governors offices uphill yonder sir in that house with the flagpole cant miss it kings colours and a spanish flag flying military commandant is a don rearadmiral gravina will that be all for now sir aye i suppose lewrie sighed he did a quick inspection of their quarters the guardhouse was fairly dirty uttered with discarded trash castoff uniforms and such the blankets piled in a stinking heap and half the cooking equipment missing there was dust lint some roachlike scuttling right lads muster in the guardroom he shouted hauling his charges from their delighted play some of the younger hands were dotted with feathers from overly exuberant pillow fighting first off were going to clean this pigsty from truck to keel he announced to a faint chorus of groans working parties mops and buckets brooms and all get the french stink out of this place its to be our mess deck and you know proper british seamenu never abide filth a total scrubdown fore and aft up the walls and down hose it out if thats what it takes those blankets reek chuck em over i expect our hosts pissed on em fore they left just to be froggish youve your own and we may draw an extra blanket for each man from the warehouses lisney you know your way around a galley aye sir some lisney confessed wincing at what he feared to hear at what onerous duties he might be ordered to perform take two hands and set the galley right see whats needful for cooking ill want to eat off the deck i want it that clean any pots and such we may draw from the warehouses later and well decide who does the cooking later too cony therere officers quarters above see to setting them right take two hands to help you bosun porter a sentry at the door now draw equipment from these racks count em first then keep em under lock and key and appoint two men mastersatarms to help you you men in the duck feathers just cause things dont belong to you is no reason to destroy them thought that was what wars were all about lieutenant scott muttered just loud enough to be heard and to elicit a laugh silence lewrie snapped his neck burning with anger listen to me carefully just because were ashore doesnt mean youre any less out of the navys eye were not here to gambol were not here for a ropeyarn sunday i or any officer will read the articles of war the same as if we were on cockerels decks he said turning to glare a warning to scott we may guard the harbour and basin or we might end up in those bloody great hills behind us manning guns eye to eye with french soldiers living rough as any redcoat and the man who forgets that the man who acts like this is a lark the one who doesnt believe im a taut hand well god help his soul and his back he made an effort to lock eyes with every hand even those back in the rear of the guardroom who were shying sheepish and hangdog at his sternness right he concluded lets be about it mister scott a word with you sir aye sir scott nodded clenching his massive jaws outside sir lewrie ordered walking out on him he paced a good ten yards well out of earshot before rounding on him damn you sir dont you ever make mock of me in front of the hands dont you ever dare make light of why weve come ashore heard of yorktown have you mister scott aye sir and i know you made a name damn you that is not what i mean sir lewrie thundered take a good look about mister scott fifteen bloody miles of border and we mean to hold it with less than four thousand men with three armies on the way to crush us aye theyre frog armies peasants in rags to you not worth the powder to blow their tagragandbobtail arses away hey and were here you and i with charge of twenty hands and if one of them dies because you didnt take this bloody serious damn it they are our men sir we own the grave responsibility to care for them to feed em tuck em in fight em and maybe die with em if it comes to that i see sir scott sobered a little of his rancour receding nothing like a lark is it mister scott alan demanded though more softly you may resent me to the gates of hell if you wish feel sorry for yourself gettin slung ashore all you want i mean to keep as many of these men alive as i can sir do we win or lose but i cant do that with you sulking behind my back and giving them the impression were off to fiddlers green theyre as much your responsibility as a sea officer as they are mine you know i will have your support and your loyalty sir no matter your grudges or else as my fatherd say shut up and soldier aye aye sir scott grunted nodding vigorously his face red whether with more resentment or shame lewrie didnt much care at that moment just as long as scott did his job chapter the first use of their services though was nothing even close to bellicose toulon was still plagued by the presence of nearly truculent french sailors most of whom either openly or secretly supported the revolution with a fair minority who might not have adored the republic exactly but were mortal certain they could not abide british or spanish troops on the sacred soil of la belle france the town rang to their disobedience their drunkenness daily and seeing how many they were even disarmed and how few coalition troops were present it would only be a matter of time before they arose weaponless or not or began to engage in sabotage lewries party with others readied five ships from the basin to take them away five of the least serviceablean eighteengunned brig of war named pluvier the rd rate s orion entreprenant patriote and trajanwere taken out of ordinary stripped of all their guns but two eightpounders stripped of all their powder but for twenty light saluting or signalling charges and stocked with food and water then they were warped or towed to the great road and the french seamen and those officers who wished to depart were put aboard under flags of truce they departed for bordeaux for rochefort lorient and brest on the biscay coast on september and that lewrie told himself over a glass of wine that evening at lieutenant de crillarts favourite openair bistro will make toulon a much quieter place all round fumm umumm crackwhish what the devil alan cried leaping from his bed he flung the shutters to his room open to peer out to look down at the seaman sentry at the door of the guardhouse below him in the small courtyard fumm fumm and echoes followed by two more crackwhishes someuns firm cannons i reckon sir the sentry called up to him in reply to the perplexity on his face soun like hits ah comin fum yonner sir the sentry pointed vaguely souwest clad in only his shirttails lewrie fetched his telescope and leaned out the window bang went the shutters on a neighbouring room and scott peered out blearily rubbing sleep from his face with rough hands hed made a rare night of it in the city a proper caterwauling high ramble a moment later a pert female face capped with a mass of dark brown curls appeared next to his she was clad only in a sheet wideeyed and excited she seemed equally curious as to the source of the noise and what her neighbour looked like morning mister scott lewrie took time to smile argh scott muttered wiggling his tongue and grimacing with the taste of cognac still in his mouth morning mister lewrie sir he managed thickheaded what the devils goin on bonjour msieur luray the girl called cheerfully bonjour mademoiselle lewrie replied with an approximate bow phoebe scott supplied gruffly dryswabbing his face some more and knuckling his eyes childlike i think she said scrawny little chit but he shrugged and gave her a pinch making her yelp but damned fetching lewrie took more time to note sounds like its coming from beyond fort malbousquet alan said returning to professional matters maybe that general carteau finally marched from marseilles got his guns up during the night i there was a slowly rising tumulus of powder beyond malbousquet and the hills to the souwest sourlooking greyish tan fummjummjumm this time in rapid succession and another belch of smoke rose into the sky a twining twisting ball to join the rest umummum they echoed on the hills yet there were no strikes on fort malbousquet the most important redoubt which guarded the western approaches lewrie swung his telescope right and left to see what they were shooting for there crackcrackcrack explosive shells burst when their fuses burned down but burst in the little road around the anchored prizefrigate aurore and two floating batteries two went off very close to the water roiling the road waters with spreading trout splashes of ripples the third burst too high due to a shorter fuse scattering iron slivers that created a miniature hail storm across the waters beneath an unfolding rose of powder smoke fwnmfumm came a double report from a second set of guns this time a little farther off to the south these were improperly fused too they fell into the roadstead erecting tall twin candlesticks of spray as they struck and sank followed a moment later as the fuses reached their powder charges by dirty humps of smoke grey foam which hoisted aloft in gigantic featherlike plumes as tall as mast trucks masked batteries lewrie said to one and all heavy guns by god siege guns scott opined awake now twentyfourpounders firing masked though lewrie countered shaking his head fummfummfumm he began counting the seconds to himself now that he was listening for it alan could hear the faint shrieking moan of shells lofted through the early morning air three new pillars rose in the little road hopelessly wide of the ships so far mile and a half i think mister scott he called out dont think theyre siege guns firin masked theyd have to elevate high and anything over what eight degrees or sodburst the barrels howitzers scott guessed whats an army lug about lewrie shouted back getting excited there might be some action at last six eight or twelvepounder howitzers little too far even for them i think they must be mortars hed experienced mortars all those weeks under the drumfire of a french artillery train at yorktown aiding the rebels twelve or thirteeninch theyd been some as big as sixteeninch massive shells theyd fired solid shot bursting shell their fuses glowing in the night like fiery bansheesand carcases flaming wads soaked in anything thatd burn and keep on burning once they buried themselves in a house or a ship les republicains little phoebe asked fearfully pulling her sheet up higher about her mon dieu well they aint the royal horse artillery scott sneered oui mademoiselle ils sont les republicains lewrie told her mister scott get the hands mustered ill dress and run up to headquarters to see whats what ve ave breafas barnaby phoebe asked le petit dejeuner run along squirrel theres work to do scott said that shelling had started on september next day more batteries had opened fire upon the tightly packed ships in the little roadbatteries masked by the sheltering heights of la petite garenne and another middling hill a little souwest of the first twentyfourpounder siege guns joined in too firing direct though at maximum elevation on their trunnions from high ground near la seyne the civilian harbour this forced some of the shipping to move out through the gullet to new anchorages in the great road to the east or closer in towards the jetties of the basin a brace of gunboats floating batteries were got out of the yards manned and sent to the norwest arm of the little road near fort millaud and the poudriere the powdermagazine and they were reinforced by a full crew of gunners on the aurore and the presence of rearadmiral john gells flagship the mighty ninetyeightgunned threedecker st george the french had the advantage though of being masked their exact position unknown and were able to fire with more or less scientific accuracy from stable fixed positions with observers to correct the fallofshot sooner or later trigonometry ballistics and the right guesstimate on powder measure to be ignited and the right length of fuse to be fitted would score a hit and that a devastating one the british gunners could only roughly guess where behind the masking hills the batteries were firing from ships which even at anchor shifted and recoiled with each massive discharge they had to probe with their shells much like a blind man must feel for the kerb with his cane hoping for the best french fire was so gallingly accurate towards the afternoon of the th that the gunboats had to slip their cables and retire they returned to the duel on the morning of september and by midday one of the floating batteries was hit and damaged and the second was sunk outright this they watched from a post on the basins western jetty engaged in trundling powder and shot out to the thirtytwoand fortytwopounders just in case between trips during a dinner break or a rest stop with mugs of appallingly pisspoor french beer lewrie and his men had ringside seats right up to the ropes as it were where they could best see the opponents toe up and square off hmm i wonder lieutenant scott grimaced turning to peer towards the west beyond fort malbousquet then to the heights to the north wonder what mister scott your pet did that crillart fellow say how many men they have yonder in carteaus army scott inquired two divisions maybe six thousand or so if theyre up to the old establishments yet i think i heard and weve barely five thousand so far guarding guarding bloody everything lewrie snorted lapoype from the east might be about the same size he sat uneasily trying to at least appear calm for his men on a massive granite block of the jettys breastworks swinging his heels over the waterside least this buggers not done much else but shell so far no infantry probes to speak of maybe carteaus leadin us by the nose waiting for all the men coining down from lyons keep our attention fixed here whilst oh there you are mister lewrie sir the teenaged mid hms cockerel shipman cried the same little pest theyd met their first day ashore been searching all over creation for you he panted rearadmiral goodalls finest compliments to you lieutenant lewrie and he begs me to direct you to his presence as soon as is practicable sir something useful for us to do at last lewrie wondered aloud one may not presume to uhm presume sir but the midshipman shrugged mister scott take charge of the hands keep em busy whilst i toddle off lewrie said swinging his legs back over the bulwark aye sir scott replied and whatever business they wish of us sir aye mister scott well damme were sailors keep us out of those hills could you at least scott implored ill do my best sir lewrie smiled chapter lewrie had kept them out of those forbidding hills though he wasnt exactly sure hed done them any favours rearadmiral goodall had only the briefest sketch of lewries career and had been intent upon a large map of the area in the middle of a conference with his opposite number rearadmiral gravina of the spanish navy and a host of subordinates all of whom had a loud opinion of what should be done and at that very instant before commanded two bomb ketches i see sir goodall had commented yes sir but battry at yorktown by god land service yes sir although that folderol in the far east shellin pirates an such well in fact theyd been converted bombs reduced to tiny but stoutly built ketchrigged gunships his twogun batteries at yorktown hadnt fired a single shot much less had a target the folderol in the far east was not exactly mortar work now was it but cheesylookin raft lewrie muttered aint it theyd given him a floating battery theyd also given him an allnations to sort out lieutenant de crillart showed up full of ginger and good cheer eager to be doing something at last out on the water once more he brought with him about forty menall royalists thank godformer members of the royal corps of marine gunners once a body of the most expert and perfectly trained naval artillery known with cunning the latest scientific artifice lavish support from the greatest minds and mathematicians the most modern gun foundries they had developed a complete lajeune ecole a new school for gunnery the revolutionaries though had broken them up parcelled them out in tiny leavenings to land units unable to abide any elite superior to the common man nor any organisation left over from royal days there was a further complication an equal draft of artillerists more experienced with mortars for which lewrie might have backhandedly thanked god unfortunately they were spanish bombardiers under a lean haughty coachwhip of an officer one comandante major don luis emiliano de esquevarre y saltado y perez to make matters even worse he was not a naval officer but a military artillerist and had about as much english as lewrie had spanish which wasnt saying much beyond dos vinos and sucar tusputas el comandante would be in charge of the pair of massive thirteeninch brass mortars sunk in the middle of the waist where the mainmast used to be whilst lieutenant de crillart and his grizzled veterans would service the six heavy thirtytwopounders three to either beam zele the battery had been named once a proud twodecker of about feet on the range of her gun deck and over forty feet in beam now she was a rase a ship shaved down gone were her tall focsle and poop deck gone indeed was her quarterdeck as well along with an upper gun deck and the original sailtending gangways shed been reduced to a hulking squat water beetle wide and low to the water with the only shelter for her crew the foremost wedge of the bows on the remaining gun deck and what went unused on that deck aft under what was left of the upper gun deck her mainmast had been drawn out like a rotten tooth and her fore and mizzen had been reduced to the fightingtopsto a gantline they would say in the royal navy there was still a forecourse yard on which a sail was set an inner and an outer jib forward set on stays which ran to a shortened jib boom without a sprit yard doubled atop it aft the mizzen could set a course on the usually bare crojack yard and an ancient lateen spanker awaited lewrie didnt think hed be winning any regattas with her though her sails were tattered and mildewed mere afterthoughts had she halfagale abeam he reckoned she might log a quimhair above two knots no to get this beamish overbuilt and deepdraughted beast about the bay it would be necessary to use the long thick sweep oars which lay piled atop the centerline of the gun deck and extend them out the many ports where artillery no longer nested sure enough he could see tholepins the size of pier bollards at several empty gunports christ what a bloody he began to carp ow goddamn an blast it hed stubbed his toe on a knot the ship was so old so pared down by holystoning during her half century of service that hard pine knots had arisen from the softer planking material and now stood as high as flattopped islands all over the gun deck making an archipelago of dark burls against the pale grey of her weathered decking so what do we do sir scott asked looking about as dubious as lewrie did about their prospects were the coachees mister scott lewrie told him rubbing his foot through his shoe the frogs and the dons shall make the loudish banging noises whilst we steer them round wherever they wish to go hackwork scott opined well need more men a power more just to row her or he pointed at the size of the capstans fore and aft theyd have to row her then anchor with both bowers the stream and the kedge put springs on the cables and use the secondary capstans which were about as massive as cockerels to nudge her bearing so the guns and mortars could aim about forty more hands i should think lewrie scowled landsmen mostly be wonderful were we to get em but were not this is it all the fleet or the garrison may spare right now charles oui mon capitaine well need your men to share the sweepwork when its needful la oars les capstans alan flustered trying for the life of him to recall what the french called things until were in position and ready to open fire of course ah ze rames et ze cabestan je comprend daccord i unerstan oui i agree alain de crillart beamed most agreeably still therere the spanish we could use their help too alan said if we really have quick need of em uhm perhaps you should be the one to broach the subject with don whatsit charles you have so much more spanish than i moi de crillart sighed taking a long look at the nosehigh and immensely bored expression of their bombardier merde chapter falconers marine dictionary had quite a lot to say on mortars and range and the precautions the prudent officer might undertake to keep from being blown to flinders so too did de crillarts tattered copy of le blonds elements of war and lewries copy of the standard mullers treatise on the artillery zele should have had munitionstenders astern where the shells were filled with powder and rowing boats to fetch shot as needed and where during transit the fuses were inserted the fused shells being termed fixed then hoisted aboard and stored in a hide or hairclothcovered rack on the safest space of the deckcalled kiting well they didnt have tenders and too few men to spare to row shells about so they extemporised the rudimentary captains cabin aft under the thick remains of the upper gun deck was to be the filling room its doors and windows covered with tanned hides equipped with water tubs and the passages to it constantly watered with a washdeck pump the filled shells to be carried most carefully to the waist where two senior bombardiers would fix them with fuses as needed for each shot and no shell was to be fixed and kited then left untended no matter how secure a storage area they had there were more tubs of water round the depression in the waist where the mortars sat two more bombardiers or gunners mates on duty to oversee portfires and slow matches the mortarmen would apply to the fuse and the mortars touch holes propellant gunpowder charges were loaded below in the old orlop hangingmagazine also well watered and guarded with the door shut except to pass out premeasured cartridges through a secondary felt screen inside the actual door slitted to let the charges be passed out in fireproof leather cylinders the fuses would come from a laboratory chest in the captains cabin too these were conical tubes made of beech or willow wood and filled with a composition of sulphur saltpetre and mealed powder a mixture of tallow pitch and beeswax sealed both ends the tapering end of the cone would go inside the shell stripped of its protective coating but the great end must keep its tallow until just before firing and they all agreed that whilst the mortars were in service it would be impossible to employ the thirtytwopounder greatguns simultaneously for they would require other lit portfires and slow matches and that was a risk too great to contemplate it helped immensely lewrie learned from observation that their mortars were mounted on central pintles which passed completely through the bed of the mortar carriages through the supporting timbers and deck beams of the mortar wells through the overhead beams on the orlop and terminated in large baulks of timber which held the whole affair up so the mortars could be laid or pointed left and right all they had to do was anchor with the bestbower and single kedge with springs of course on their cables roughly abeam of the target or the coast and the bombardiers could heave their massive charges about for aiming thirteeninch mortar weight eightyone hundredweight two quarters one pound according to falconer powder charge when the chamber at its base was full thirty pounds weight of a fixed shell pounds and filled with seven pounds of the very best powder the shells were castiron balls hollow with their greatest thickness on the bottom the better to resist the awful force of discharge from the bore and to keep that heaviest part away from the fuse flying first through the air and landing on that thick portion with the thinner and lighter filling and fusing end uppermost there were two carrying handles cast or hammerwelded to either side of the fuse hole perhaps to avoid confusion for slower minds beyond that lewries theory got a little vague hed never had the greatest head for numbers falconers under range listed a table of practice for sea mortars giving the specific weights of propelling charges and the proper fuses to use for instance he could discover that at fortyfive degrees of elevation a thirteeninch mortar took an eighteenpound charge to hurl the shot which resulted in a flight of twentysix seconds and range of roughly yards and for the fuse to explode at the right moment burning at the rate of four seconds and fortyeight parts to the inch would require a premade fuse of the exact length of five inches seventytwo parts to be selected from the laboratory chest then of course there was the niggling matter of the gunners who would light the fuse and the mortars touch hole with slow match doing both at the same instant but alan assumed that the spanish bombardiers and the insufferably laconic don luis might know what they were doing and if they made a hash of it then it was their own damned fault lavishly reequipped from those mountains of french supplies in the basins arsenals and warehouses they sailed zele her new sails almost virginwhite from the docks through the opening between the bombproof jetties and out to join st george and aurore just after first light on the th springs on the cables sir lieutenant scott informed him washdeck pumps going filling room and magazine passageway aye sir lets be at it then lewrie grimaced his stomach chilly with trepidation at the unknown nature of their work and over the danger which was very known of any clumsiness or inattentiveness might as well be sir scott dared to assay a tiny wry grin it appears the frogs already are they walked amidships to peer down into the mortar wells then tip their hats to de crillart and esquevarre who stood close together by the rearward lip evidently engaged in some heated discussion non non comandante le blond charles de crillart objected gently alain mon capitaine i attemp to tell zis monsieur le blond say ze sirty pound charge eez beaucoup mais zis ze comandante insist don luis de esquevarre rattled off an expostulation in rapid spanish out of which lewrie caught perhaps the odd word in ten most of those mildly insulting senor he said whipping out his copy of falconer allow me to quote and do you translate lieutenant de crillart aha here it is mr mutter in his treatife of artillery very juftly obferves that the breech of our inch

lewrie laughed out loud prompting a tiny upturn of one corner of don luis mouth in return senor comandante i have implicit trust in your experience lewrie cajoled phrase by phrase as de crillart transposed for him but this is a ship not a firm battlement or wellprepared battery do you see here under range practice table weights of charge ah si capitan don luis brightened pulling from a voluminous pocket of his ornate uniform coat a muchtattered oftrolled and thumbed table of practice expostulating eagerly fummfumm umumm scrreeeblam blam all this time republican shot had been falling

a powder charge sacked by the calledfor weight spanish bombardiers used paper cartridges from the filling room came a shell two burly spaniards grunting with effort to carry it by its small slippery handles don luis and his aspirante or ensignintraining and a hirsute cursing bear of a man a sergeantgunner diego huelva directed the work of heaving the aftermortar the left hand of the pair as they faced the coast into line then began to elevate it to fortyfive degrees they fussed and hopped peered and tinkered at screws until satisfied then waved for the shell to be brought forward down it went into the well as the powder charge was rammed deep into the chamber and the priming iron was thrust into the touch hole to both clear the vent and puncture the bag slowly the fixed shell was lowered into the stubby bore handles and fuse hole up don luis took a deep breath almost made to cross himself as he waved the excess hands away and ordered the tallow seal on the fuse to be opened fosforo preparado he cried fuego the smouldering portfires touched both fuse and touch hole and there was a split second of sizzle then a tremendous blast down went the deck as if shoved by the hand of god and zeles timbers groaned not so much a sudden detonation as it was a physical force alan felt his lungs rattle his groin shrink and his heart flutter when the mortar touched off felt an invisible wave of pressure shove him back rattle his coattails and hat and fill his ears with a sound beyond a sound almost too loud to register except to set them ringing spent powder smoke spurted aloft in a sickly yellowwhite column reeking with sulphur and rotten eggs smelling singed as lit kindling bloody hell that was he coughed fanning the air for some fresh as the gush of gunsmoke dissipated that was magnificent hed loved the greatguns best of all the things hed learned in the navy the power the stink of them their recoil and shudderings from little twopounder boatguns and swivels to longtwelves from farfiring twentyfourpounders to the stubby shipbreaking smashers the carronades lewrie delighted in things that went boomand exulted in seeing the damage they caused aboard a foe it was irrational brutish and savage this joy he found in gunnery so viscerally beneath a reasonable mans ken so insensible a passion yet damme lewrie called feeling a boyish glee rise in him don luis volver a hacer lets do that againl that afternoon st george retired from the artillery duel due to depart for genoa and her place was taken in the little road by the princess royal another rearadmiral goodalls flagship in lieu of his presence her captain john childs purvis commanded a spanish joined the bombardment french burstingshell drummed around zele all day fortunately never discovering the right solution in propellant charge and length of fuse though it did get interesting at times when a shell would splash somewhat nearby raise a feather of spray by its impact then explode underwater a second or so later to produce an even more prodigious spout of brine which would fall like a cascade on the decks and gangways don luis esquevarre concentrated their fire upon the lesser battery to the souwest the one with two guns patiently firing perhaps a round every two minutes he probed the hills first with the left mortar then with the right hand a dram less powder in the charge cartridge three drams more the next shot a tiny tinkering with elevation half a turn on the great screw by the bracing block heaving to turn about a single degree on the pintle fosforo preparado he called coatless and hatless by then his voice hoarse from inhaling spent gunpowder and shouting for half a day fuego another monumental clashing roar and the floating battery shuddering to her very bones timbers crying in torment lewrie stood aft away from the noise on what passed for a quarterdeck a telescope to his eye rested steady on the larboard mizzenstay ratlines nineteen twenty twentyone midshipman spendlove tolled off counting on his fingers for his watch only had a minute hand bruml umumm came from the hills struck sir twentytwo seconds he announced and looked up to see a darker gout of smoke rise almost mingling with the forestfire pall that hovered continually over the republican mortar battery oh well closer i think though sir he sighed disappointedly suddenly there was a massive eruption of smoke yonder rising as silent as a squall cloud might on the seas horizon as if the french had reinforced the masked battery and had just let fly half a dozen shells brummmbrummmmbummm spoke the masking hill later than the gunpowder pall and the pall swelled upward outward turned darker shot through with dark flecks with black writhing licorice sticks of smoketinged at the bottom just atop the hill with dying embers with a ruddy orange loomlike flickering like a lighthouses loom just over the horizons knife edge hola don luis shouted raspily enthused and his bombardiers began to cheer and dance to caper round the deck and in the wells in triumph we did it lewrie cried ready to dance himself we hit em blew em to hell by jesus bummbummbrubrumbumm more secondary explosions thundered and the hills quaked to the destruction and they could feel it in their bones and on their faces a tremendous distant blast that rattled the earth the shoals and transmitted itself through the waters theyd holed out not on the mortars themselves but in their magazine where fixed and kited shells had been stored too many of them fixed ready to fire kited too close together and even being sunk into the earth protected by wet hides and haircloth hadnt saved them lewrie dashed down to the gun deck where spanish french and english sailors cavorted and clapped tossing their caps or hats into the air and huzzahing marvelous lewrie told esquevarre when he reached him magnifico marveloso genius esquevarre was thumping de crillart on the back de crillart was bestowing gallic kisses on those lean aristocratic cheeks and don luis tweaked charles nose playfully as he stepped back to clasp lewrie to him and dance him around the deck in a stumbling bear hug must be something in the water lewrie thought not exactly that pleased to be bussed and hugged by a man bloody foreigners charles tell him well celebrate lewrie called over comandante esquevarres shoulder as they tripped past him in a shuffling circle vino plus vin my treat well splice the mainbrace uh spliceo las mainbraceo si amigo si don luis bueno by sundown they heaved to short stays on the kedge and broke it free of the rocky bottom heaved then to short stays forrud on the bower and sailed back to the fortified jetties the larger threegun maskedbatterys fire had sputtered out by then daunted perhaps by the sudden destruction of its fellow and the little road became peaceful sweeps had to be used as the wind faded to puzzling little zephyrs across the lakesmooth waters once tied up instead of boiling salt rations in steep tubs appropriated charcoal braziers were lit atop the jetty and fresh meat was roasted wine and beer were doled out the rum ration was issued and fresh bread and butter appeared from the town for all hands de crillart scott esquevarre and lewrie left the ship repaired to a restaurant and celebratedrather heavily in point of fact in all respectswine cuisine musicand ended up being run out after they called for dancing girls esquevarre couldnt quite understand a restaurant that didnt have people who could play the guitar or do the flamenconor do the appreciative patrons who flung coins to them france de crillart translated haltingly on their way back aboard e say mon ami ve are la nation du tightarses comment the next morning with a monumental head lewrie arose to the softfiimphing of thunder he flung off his blanket and staggered to a water butt his mouth as sour and dry as desiccated ordure there was a knock on the door to his tiny cabin what he croaked sir midshipman spendlove sir enter spendlove came inside dry as a bone lewrie expected rain with that faroff thunder he was too bleary to puzzle it out excuse me sir but the frogs are at it again theres a midshipman aboard from admiral goodall sir he says were to stand out into the little road with all despatch uhuh lewrie nodded heavily very well mister spendlove do you wake the others and ill be on deck directly warn porter to have the hands roused and at stations for shoving off aye aye sir already at it again he wondered as spendlove departed dont the frogs ever learn their lessons wondering too if after the celebrations of the past evening they could hit a bull in the arse with a bass viol this day chapter t he colossus came in from cagliani with sardinian soldiers on the th bedford and a sardinian ship fetched more a convoy arrived from spain with foot horse and artillery and on the same day two neapolitan liners brought in reinforcements and a marshal forteguerri to command them there was some problem with forteguerrihe would not subordinate his men to the spanish military commander rearadmiral gravina insisting that naples treaty was with great britain only and he would only take orders from british officers fortunately brigadier general lord mulgrave had come to toulon with a detachment of british troops a single battalion of one regiment which raised british troop strength to about forteguerri considered himself under mulgraves command there was talk that one more british general was coming major general ohara with another regiment there was also talk that a spanish general had been appointed and would be arriving soon someone senior to ohara there was a tremendous scare on the night of september it was a night of thick fog and swirling mist so far the only action had been skirmishes between cavalry vedettes to east and west some desultory artillery duels between light field guns outside the perimeters of toulon the skirmishes had become a little fiercer as more republican troops from marseilles and the army of italy arrived and troops in the heights behind toulon had reported the presence of french units at jourris near fort valette patrols probing in the valley of the faviere river down towards the noreast pass at argeliers towards open ground yet the artillery duels in the little road were the constant the only serious action so far suddenly though there were french regiments in the hills the night of the th popping up from god knew where scaling goat tracks thought unscalable carrying light field guns up the steep crumbling mountain paths they erupted without a shred of warning upon spanish troops on the heights of pharon the eastern half of the northern massif above toulon in the confusion the spanish were routed from their positions run pellmell down from the heights of pharon in the dark and the fog abandoning all but their personal weapons leaving the republicans with fortifications and heavy guns which looked down upon the very heart of the enclave and the great road it looked very much like a disaster that night to lewrie and his men taking a muchneeded rest from bombarding hidden batteries by dint of a fog so thick they could not spot the fall of shot spatters of gunfire could be heard far off above the basin where zele was tied to the jetty spatters turned to ripping volleys of musketry punctuated with tiny flat bangs of grasshopper guns and lightweight mountain howitzers and dread rumours passed up and down the jetty were twoa penny yet in the morning brigadier general mulgrave spanish rearadmiral gravina and the game captain elphinstone led a hastily mustered force back up to the heights of pharon spanish troops eager for the restoration of their honour grim british veterans experienced in the bayonet and drilled to professional perfection the newly arrived sardinians and neapolitans and sailors and marines from the fleet with boarding pikes pistols and their fearsome cutlasses they scaled the heights on tracks no less steep than the french had managed slipped and slid on the dry gravelly crumbling soil and suffered miniature avalanches and after forming quickly upon narrow level places rushed the trenches and redoubts nearly frenchmen had taken the heights of pharon but only were in any condition to flee after they were overwhelmed and broken the coalition lost eight killed seventytwo wounded one of them rearadmiral gravina shot in the knee and two missing with fortyeight spanish hauled off as prisoners earlier a little scare after all the matter was quickly handled and any dread of republican rabble was blown to the four winds if they were that easy to rout the enclave breathed easier for a time chuckling over their silly forebodingyet looking more to the hills and wondering and through all those weeks lewrie was busy with zele daily they sailed out to do battle carefully selecting a new anchorage each dawning which would take the french gunners hours to pinpoint but the french shifted their batteries each night returning the favour to make themselves equally elusive down to the far south behind la seyne there were several new batteries to deal with on the heights des moulins and reinier above the civilian port the next hill back from the hauteur de grasse upon which stood forts de balaguer and leguillette the forts were manned by coalition troops as was fort mandrier and the lesser batteries on cape sepet s peninsula the french had no hope of rushing across the narrow tongue of land which connected sepet to the mainland that thin land bridge called les sablettes which formed the bottom of the golfe de la veche was bare as a babys bottom and two field guns could do terrible slaughter to troops attempting to rush across it packed into a killing ground along the road which bridged a salt marsh yet the batteries atop the heights twentyfourpounder siege guns and howitzers could scald the little road deny any use of the golfe de la veche and torment the defenders of fort balaguer from anchorages at the south end of the little road using de crillarts thirtytwopounders and his experienced gunners lewrie engaged those guns on the heights or hid in the shallows near the north shore of hauteur de grasse and let don luis de esquevarre pound them with his mortars some nights they did not return to port but hid in the little road under cover of darkness all lights extinguished and under oars to sneak out through the gullet and anchor round fort balaguer there they mortared french gun batteries from shorter range letting the army at the fort report their fallofshot with wigwag signals or dared the shoals of the golfe de la veche off the infirmarie to hammer the batteries on the heights at an oblique angle with thirtytwopounders somewhat safely out of french arcs of fire through narrow openings in their breastworks it became quite a game an exciting though rather noisy sport to match wits with the republican gunners but no matter how many times a breastwork was pounded into gravel no matter how many earthandwicker gabions were burst or guns dismounted and no matter how many french artillerists they slew the french guns were always back in action in a day or two in a new position and no amount of mortaring or cannonading seemed to deter them on october lieutenant colonel nugent led a night storming raid on the southern batteries spaniards piedmontese british troops with sailors and marines under lieutenant walter serecold once more pluck and daring paid for all thered been french in the batteries with another infantry in their rear for support the heights des moulins and reinier were no less steep or treacherous than those of pharon yet they annihilated the french gunners and routed the rest under fieldartillery fire they could not haul away their prizes so they spiked or destroyed the guns burning the carriages and mounts blowing off the trunnions effectually making scrap metal of a fourpounder a sixpounder two sixteens three twentyfourpounder siege guns and two huge thirteeninch brass mortars then returned to their quarters in the forts without harm but the french came back hauled new pieces uphill to replace the old rebuilt their breastworks and gabions dug a little deeper in the hills like soldier ants rebuilding their hive after children had kicked it over like the tide they came back and got just a touch closer to toulon lieutenant general valdez had come into port on october to replace rearadmiral gravina and the senior spanish navy officer admiral don juan de langara went with valdez to admiral lord hood to insist that valdez be given complete command of all troops in the enclave his most catholic majesty had given him that grandiloquent appointment hood demurred pointing out that toulon had surrendered to britain alone that allied troops supplied men on the stipulation that the british command and that major general ohara already had been given that command by his britannic majesty king george iii hood had sent so many ships away on various missions that there were scarcely ten sail of the line in harbour while langara still had his original seventeen langara put his threedecker flagship alongside victory placed two other st rates at bow and stern hinting more than strongly that hed open fire if valdez wasnt proclaimed as supreme commander of the allied forces at toulon to his credit admiral hood would not be bullied and victory beat to quarters valdez and langara backed down and returned their ships to their berths and major general ohara did arrive a few days later as did a major general dundas with a commission to replace admiral goodall as military governor of toulon unfortunately ohara did not bring the troops expected a mere men from the garrison of gibraltar came to toulon with him half of the number ordered to be transferred more sardinians dribbled in the last promised draft of neapolitans came a few piedmontese a few more trickles of ablebodied french royalistscivilians for the most part driven in by the advancing republican columns with thenguns and their guillotines by the beginning of november they had on hand french royalists piedmontese neapolitans spaniards british of the men total no more than were fit for duty the rest off in hospital sick or wounded and of those fit were tied to the perimeter scattered all across the many posts with only a meagre available to respond to a french thrust chapter how did it go ashore sir lieutenant scott asked when lewrie came back aboard zele from headquarters routed em thank god alan replied sleepily too sleepy to be enthused oharas aidedecamp was crowing merry six hundred frogs dead or wounded he said we lost sixtyone or so bloody good odds then scott crowed in his turn and damned good return on investment they think the frogs threw an entire corps against us lewrie yawned it was barely first light and a chill mist hung over toulon hed been roused long before his usual hournothing new in the navybut with a bit more urgency than usual too urgent to allow him his morning tea or chocolate or a morsel of bread think of it a whole corps thats what three divisions nine or ten thousand if wed lost fort mulgrave wed have lost the whole of the heights de grasse and both the forts by the gullet then whered we be i ask you if they have that many to throw at us on a whim then aye and well keep on killing em sir lieutenant scott boasted with his usual scorn for french courage and skill at ten or twenty to one theyll go bankrupt wagerin at those odds on a whim its too early to argue the toss lewrie sighed have we anything hot yet frog coffee sir scott scoffed he was a teaandbeer man when forced to drink coffee prepared in french fashion he found it a toohot toostout and bitter brew gittons lewrie called send down to the galley for a mug of coffee for me ill be in the chart space aye sir mister scott round up lieutenant de crillart and the comandante if youd be so kind weve something new planned for today here sirs lewrie said with a jab at the chart with a ruler on the east for a change in the plaine de la garde we hold forts malgue and st catherine on the east side of town the batteries at cape brun the post of bran and little fort st margaret about at the midpoint of the coast here to protect the bay of toulon a few days ago the frogs pardonnezmoi charles the republicans under general lapoype moved into fort la garde and occupied it and the ridge here in the middle of the plain behind it im told we had la garde long enough to ruin it blew its powder vaults toppled the parapets disabled the guns there no way to old eet so far from ze ozzer posts wizout cavalry for ze resupply hein de crillart surmised exactly charles lewrie agreed much more agreeable with his second steaming mug of coffee in his other hand we have to resupply all our coastline posts by water as it is well general lapoype has guns and mortars in the ruins of la garde again and hes opened on any supply boat he sees malgues guns dont have the range to reach that far and the ridge blocks st catherines the coastal strongpoints have guns yes but theyre sited to fire to seaward and the garrisons have only field guns regimental sixpounders and such facing inland st margaret is taking a pounding too so were we to work our way to here east of st margaret theres a low spot along the coast road near this beach and about a quartermile offshore theres sixfathom depth stripped as this raft is we only draw two more muddy sand that close ashore and the rocks are smaller so well have better holding ground an ve observe srough zis gap from ze fightingtops oui de crillart smiled then translated for comandante esquevarre ze comandante e say alzo mes amis de crillart supplied after a long palaver zat ze enemy ave tres difficulte to attack zose coastal posts vere ve to destroy zese string of ponts deux roads de la garde sud of ze ridge one eez good groun direct at ze st margaret ere go pas les savaux plan redon to ze coast road mais ze ozzer east of ze plan de galle eet go sud to notre dame de bon salut an ze chateau des pradets zen down to ze plage de la garonne ahah lewrie inquired more palaver back and forth ah ze comandante e say vous etes sailors mais e eez soldat e see what vous do not zey place batteries on ze heights near ze notre dame de bon salut an to ze west zey comman ze bay of toulon no sheep enter or leave ze bay zey shoot into ze great road ah lewrie said with slow comprehension that does put a different light on things but e say lieutenant de crillart continued with a sly grin zere are le petit pont ere groun eez mmm ow you say marshy scott offered with an impatient grunt ah oui marshy merci msieur scott deux bridges zen road cross zis stream on a sird anozzer bridge cross marshy marsh zen a fift ware ze sud road cross ze la reguana reever comandante don luis e weesh to use ze mortars on zese bridges aussi after ve bombard ze fort la garde so if they mean to move their army against toulon theyd have to come direct west right into the teeth of our fire or try to skirt past the end of the ridge and face the guns of fort st margaret on their flank while theyre all strung out ze comandante do not believe zey do zis mon capitaine ere are ze reever an ze stream zey mus still cross on ze good road to plan redon zen turn west across pont de la clue but zat ees covered by fort malgue post de brun st margaret charles shrugged in heavy gallic fashion with a snort of amusement to show how hopeless an endeavour that might be comandante just to do a complete bit of work why dont we blow this pont de la clue whilst were at it today last of all alan suggested to which after a translation don luis was quick to express his agreement cony lewrie called out the door to the gun deck aye sir hows the fog thickern london sir cony answered after a weatherwary eye at the sky but eres a wind comin up sir not much o one but a breeze might blow off inn ourr two sir i cn see bout two musket shotz all thatd be just enough visibility for us to warp out and row lewrie speculated tossing away his ruler and dividers sound our way down to the entrance in the log boom then set course through the gullet hug the coast all the way so they wont even know were in place until the first shell lets be at it then cony my respects to the bosun and hes to sound all hands stations for leaving harbour i think i can see now lewrie enthused aloft in the foretop it had been hours before they could make anything out farther off than a quartermile and had more felt their way east than anything else but they had tme anchored now in four fathoms of water east of st margaret in a little cove where the hieres road ran close along cliffs which were much lower than the rest of that daunting coast where that road dipped between two hills into a depression thats it i think has to be la garde sir lieutenant scott muttered spying the place out with his own telescope now the fogs burned off enough sure to be the only hill west of the ridge circular central keep with four arms and circular ends just clear enough scott traded his telescope for a sextant and slate i make it a mile and threequarters sir he concluded and it appears were anchored broadsideto lewrie looked at his watch quarter til ten in the morning and nothing stirring yonder due to the fogs the french had been bunded as effectively as everyone else on such a gloomy morning there was a wind up now from the souwest blowing into the cove quite briskly and rattling a chop against the base of the cliffs ruffling wavelets over the wide shingly beach to their right a wind which would blow their powder smoke away quickly making it difficult for the french to discover their position it might even take them a while to find that it wasnt a new mortar battery installed at fort st margaret itself lets give it another quarterhour mister scott let don luis have a peek at it and then well open fire lewrie decided aye sir ill fetch him by the time don luis de esquevarre his aspirante and sergeantgunner huelva had ascended the mast though the fog had been blown clearer fort la garde was no longer nebulous but sharpedged in the telescopes and don luis was eager to open upon them at once pleading that it would take hours to further reduce the place it was a masonry fort after all bueno lewrie grinned clapping esquevarre on the shoulder we begin don luis si fuego lewrie went back to the deck by a standing backstay while comandante esquevarre and his aides had to use the lubbers hole in the top and clamber down the ratlines and shrouds with landsmens clumsiness a full ten minutes was spent inspecting safety precautions just to be sure no one had omitted a step in the drill due to overfamiliarity or boredom the gun deck was running with water from the pumps the companionway to the orlop was trickling sea water the magazine passage was wetted down from overhead to decking the felt screen was soaked the hides were up in the laboratory aft only four kegs of powder were aft to fill shells at any one time the excess covered with wet haircloth the fuse chest covered except for extraction of the calledfor timing thirtytwopounder greatguns empty and tompioned bowsed up to the port sills and only two sets of slow match burning in the mortar well properly guarded garguen los morteros esquevarre ordered garguen a bombardear the lefthand mortar was prepared the touch hole reamed out and primed with finemealed powder the tallow seal was scraped off the top end of the fuse fosforo preparado fuego another day of noise and smoke had begun over and left sir mister midshipman spendlove shouted down from the foretop at the foot of the hill close for a first try lewrie beamed as the aspirante told his commander what that meant in spanish esquevarre fiddled with the traverse a touch cranked in a tiny change in elevation for the righthand mortar whilst the left hand was being thoroughly swabbed out up came a powder charge out came a fixed shell fosforo preparado fuego blam went the world loud as thunder at ones elbow rocking the floating battery so hard it felt like shed been hit with a substantial slab of cliff on target right in the center sir spendlove screamed with delight spoton yayy give em another carry on sir lewrie laughed damme but weve gotten maingood at this service he thought smugly going to the ratlines to go aloft to enjoy the mornings work with french and british help to do the carrying they got into a rhythm of one shell a minute it took the french at least ten to even begin to respond and their first shots in reply were directed at the closest coastal fort st margaret just as lewrie had thought and he didnt think the small garrison there enjoyed being taken for the goat within an hour of hot practice the fire from la garde began to slack off it had been furious for a while shells dropping all over on the cliffs on either side of the saddle between the hills probing far afield into the cove and upon the beach as they shot over initially then the first shell came singing overhead with a whistling moan it landed far out to sea perhaps half a mile away to splash a feather of spray then burst a minute later there came a second also an over more off the bows to their right but closer in theyre correcting to our smoke lewrie sneered to spendlove as yet a third shell followed the same path and blew up close to shore but far to the right almost dead on their bows the wind was veering more from the west now ragging thenstupendous powder pall eastward lower to the water before it collided with the back eddies off the bluffs so it might appear to the french that a gunboat was hidden in a cove even farther east where it at last arose beyond the lip of the cliffs just as long as they cant see our foretop sir spendlove inquired full of good cheer nothing tremulous to that young mans tone its barely over the saddle een so mister spendlove lewrie chuckled and with no topmast standing preparado fuego blam they turned to the next fallofshot they were firing yards twentyseven seconds of flight time for a shell with a quimhair less than a sixinch fuse and four drams shy of twenty pounds of powder down the chamber of the mortar zele was shuddering like a kicked hound to each shot in the foretop that resulted in a shock then a sway judders so short and sharp it felt like the mast was going to be kicked out of its step far below on the keel twentyfive twentysix twentysev hit spendlove said with glee as he had every shot of the morning hit or miss brumm la garde groaned as a section of tumbled wall was blown out massive blocks of masonry sent flying like so many rooks scared from one gleaning to the next by a farmers fowling piece dirty rags of smoke gushed out behind them gunpowdertan at first then darkening as other things began to burn in the aftermath of a magazine strike to grow to a spreading windflattened pillar of smoke worthy of a burning city and a shell splashed down behind zele out to sea on her starboard side but close enough to rock her when the fuse burned down underwater and made it explode as it sank to the rocky bottom found us lewrie frowned well it only took the clowns over an hour this time that may have been their parting shot though esquevarre kept on throwing a shell a minute at la garde once more though there was a shell thrown backtwo in fact one burst on the beach scooping up a hail of gravel to add to its shattered iron cloud of shrapnel rocks and metal slivers pattered in a rain into the sea between the beach and the larboard bows the second shell struck in the middle of the cove equally between their floating battery and shore and even on the foretop lewrie and spendlove were doused by spray bout time to shift anchorage mister spendlove lay below to the deck inform mister scott he is to ready the ship to hoist anchors and for the comandante to secure his guns aye sir spendlove replied crisply then agile as a monkey took a stay in a hopeful but sure leap and slithered down half sliding to the deck handoverhand there were sharp noises more bangs for a moment lewrie thought that fort st margaret had opened fire with her six and twelvepounders to delude the french though with the harsh pounding theyd taken earlier he rather doubted theyd be that charitable there was a splash about the bows the bows he frowned and no explosion solidshot he looked east towards notre dame de bon salut there a wisp of powder smoke it hadnt come from the arrowtipped bluff above the beach the lord be praised but farther east on the coast road just where it began to crest the eastern hill firing from defilade sure enough another shot erupted from what he took to be at least an eightpounder and fort st margarets shot moaned overhead in reply to strike flinty gravelly soil and leap and bound in deadly ricochet around it puffing up clumps of dust at every touching damned right were shifting anchorage he groaned to himself were getting out of here a second eightpounder now opened alongside the first there was a moaning in the sky the skree of a heavy shell on its way into the cove from la garde lewrie stopped with one hand on the standingbackstay to see a second slow in its upward flight to stand still in the air as a tiny black mote for a split second then dash to invisibility again hadnt he heard if you could see it it was dead on and with a sick premonition he looked down to the deck where comandante esquevarre was looking up as well his face blanched even under the grime of gun soot then the gun deck disappeared they struck zele right in the mortar well a shell must have been in the well fixed and ready to be loaded a powder charge too nearly twenty pounds worth free of its leathern cylinder wrapped only in an easily ignited paper cartridge there were two sharp explosions in one almost atop each other and a hail of splinters howled around him blown upwards to spatter into the bottom timbers of the fightingtop lewrie leaned back quickly throwing himself flat feeling wood jump beneath his belly as smoke gushed up the lubbers hole and the foremast shuddered and groaned he started to rise but fell flat at the second skree that was the one hed seen stopping he hadnt even seen the first that took the well he another crash aft no explosion he turned his head to look and saw a starshaped hole in the rear of the quarterdeck right through the tough planking and beaming of what had been an upper gun deck into the filling room if it blam timbers flew heavy beams shattered and wood splinters mixed with jagged iron splinters more groanings and wood shrieks and men crying out in pain and fear the mizzenmast toppled forward shorn off at its base furled and gasketed sails smouldering and rigging lines burning like slow match toppled forward by the force of the blast aft draping itself over the larboard gangways crushing them with its weight that amputated trunk thrown forward of its stump lewrie rose saw that the standingbackstay was still firm and slithered down to the deck through a fog of gunsmoke and the smell of burning wood somewhere they had a fire old and baked as their floating battery was shed go up like kindling and soon where away he called to the first person he met grabbing at the fellows arm the man howled with pain that arm was cooked raw and black still sizzling with embedded powder embers mon dieu mon dieu the man staggered away half his clothes blown off screaming with terror and the agony of his burns scott de crillart lewrie shouted above the din spend love ici mon capitaine de crillart shouted back emerging from the smoke zere is beaucoup de tres feu ze shells stored they both ducked as another tremendous blast erupted aft this time with ragged hungry flames licking upwards from the second great rent torn in the quarterdeck scott lewrie demanded taking de crillart by both arms i do not know de crillart replied shaky but determined get the men over the side charles shell blow skyhigh soon as the fire reaches the main magazine i dont think we can save her oui alain elle est morte pauvre tile alors mes amis nous abandonnons anglais ve abandon ship espagnole el barco abandonar there were not many spanish gunners left alive to obey that command lewrie coughed on the smoke looking down into the ruin of the mortar well sergeant huelva the aspirante esquevarre and the matchmen the loaders there was a ragged hole where the well had been blown to the base of the orlop and both mortars had crashed through it ruddy sparks glowed down there on the orlop and greasy smoke coiled upwards of the men serving the mortars at the moment of immolation there was little sign sir bosun porter shouted he and spendlove skidded to a stop near him we goin over sir aye we are lewrie agreed quickly trying to take a breath to steady himself what he wanted most of all to do was jump howling over the side that very instant anything counter to that wish could just be damned and god help the trampled but he was the captain if they went over the side in a panic it would be even worse and there was the fact that he couldnt swim a stroke with more courage than he felt hed ever deserved he caught that smoky breath and told his jibbering terror to wait a bit bosun gather up oars spare spars hatch gratings whatever is loose get it over the larboard side in the lee and lash it together mats of hammocks between baulks of timber as floats hurry we dont have much time mister spendlove gather some hands to help cony he bawled ere sir im acomin came a gladsome shout from somewhere forward he looked singed as he came through the smoke but lewrie had never seen a cheerier sight we have to leave her cony well search for survivors first and get them over the larboard side got gracey an sadler sir an a coupla tothers hoy here be lisney hows it below lisney lewrie asked fires is burnin sir aft mostly lisney coughed hacking and spitting blowing his nose on his fingers to clear soot from his nostrils and throat transoms blowed clean out sir ye kin see th daylight through er floodin bad so we sink before the orlop magazine catches fire theys fires on th orlop neath us now sir lisney cried between retches nothin big yet but after half i reckon men th gunner an is powder yeomen jus come back too smoky tsee wot yr doin ey soaked th madeup charges an kegs good longz we ad water runnin in th ose sir we have to go below lewrie announced chilling himself at his words seeing the shiver of fear and awe reflected in his men at what he was asking them to do theres gear below thatll float lads we need it and we have to check the magazine mister spendlove inform lieutenant de crillart where were going and have him round up as many as he can to assist the bosun then see if you can find lieutenant scott right men after me lets go bloody daft i am he told himself daft as bats but they followed him below that clutch of shuddering men went staggering down the companionway ladders into smoky darkness to gather up stools and armfuls of tightly rolled hammocks which might make temporary life buoys before they soaked through they ripped down partitions and doors from warrant and mates cabins cut down the mess tables hung from the overheads and handed them up looted the unused carpenters stores for baulks and planks of dry timber lewrie forced himself to enter the magazine crouched low under the coiling smoke coughing his lungs out even so the felt screen in the doorway was still wet and cool the door slimy with water farther aft the wooden bulkheads were only slightly warm yet he felt over a pile of paper cartridges sickly slick and tacky with water he worked in the darkbittfield their senior gunners mate had extinguished all the lanterns in the glassedin light room which usually illuminated the magazine lewries feet slipped and slid in a slurry of wet gunpowder gritty but soaked he almost wet himself when he realised it normally only felt or list slippers could be worn in the magazine to avoid sparks no matter how careful the yeomen of the powder were a small amount always spilled and one scrape of shoe leather could set it off like a bomb he heard trickling water god yes forward there was a tinlined water tank used by the galley to fill the steeptubs to simmer rations and as a fire reserve bittfield had axed his way through the overhead planking and punctured it hang the risk of a spark when his steel axehead had bitten into it the tank was slowly emptying itself into the magazine gurgling in shoeheel deep he felt the massive kegs in the dark they were wet to the touch though lewrie felt his nutmegs had shriveled up to the size of capers he decided that the magazine would be safe just long enough for them to get away before it blew there was doublebanked timber on all sides top and bottom which would only smoulder and char for a while his hideous duty done he quite happily fled all clear sir lisney coughed and wheezed at him when he came forward to the companionway where there was at least the hope of air and a little light lisney was fuming that hed taken so long that he could not flee himself until lewrie did cant say that i blame him alan thought hatchets lewrie barked between coughs take the ladders too break em loose then well haul em up after us aye sir lisney whined impatient to be away hoy lads it was a matter of seconds to break the ladders free to scamper to the gun deck then sling them upward and to the side lewrie followed them to the larboard side the lee and looked over there was no more he could do it was time to go half of em sir spendlove wailed standing on the forechain platform clinging to taut stays they just lit out for the beach and i couldnt stop them didnt wait to help or its alright mister spendlove lewrie said peeling off his uniform coat they cant help it he swung a leg over the bulwarks and stepped down beside spendlove on the chain platform it was only eight or so feet more to the water but it looked one hellishfar drop terrified as hed been down in the magazine well it didnt hold a candle to this no wonder they lit out he shuddered taking a look aft along the floating batterys side she was slightly down by the stern and fires raged unchecked aft snarling like famished dogs over the forward edge of the quarterdeck beginning to eat at the gangways on either beam and the afterhalf of the gun deck was sizzling with low sheets of flamelets and shells were still falling from fort la garde bursting above her splashing down all about the cove close aboard one came down in a knot of swimmers and paddlers clinging to any old sort of flotsam by the beach up rose a pillar of water mud gravel men or pieces of men broken coop crates and bits of timber when the feather collapsed there werent four heads to be seen still afloat mister scott sir spendlove cried tears running on his face yes lewrie asked staring at the sea below him with foreboding dear god if i cant find something solid to cling to alan shuddered dead sir spendlove shouted as if in accusation blown to dear god sir there were bits of him scattered he pointed aft to the raging furnace of the quarterdeck where scott would have taken himself to ready u to upanchor spendloves shirt front was wet with breakfast his terrified reaction to his first dead men lewrie could but nod at that sad news more concerned with surviving himself at that moment gazing like a hypnotised rabbit under a snakes steely glare at the sea hungry waters lapped and gurgled with what sounded like glee against the side as if theyd been waiting for him for a very long time see to the men mister spendlove get as many ashore as you can he ordered be calm theyll need that aye sir spendlove gulped fighting back bis own fears waistcoat too i spose lewrie surmised good broadcloth itll soak up water like a sponge he peeled it off and cast it away lewrie undid the buckle of his neckstock and lace front to toss them away too this day he wore old cotton stockings his worststained pair of cotton breeches the working pair he d had run up out of sailcloth it struck him that they were french and he giggled serge de nimes they called the fabric sailcloth bloody frogs invented it didnt they but he could not recall what the french called sails vela no that was latin weak and shuddering feeling a bit faint at his prospect of drowning chilling all over feeling his knees buckling and his death grip on the stay slipping he imagined he was already a spirit a shade freed of his bodys mortal husk outside of himself and distanced from the world his ears were ringing not from an excess of noise but from an almost total lack of sound a shell burst its fuse wrongly selected right over the bluffs and he could barely hear its barking crack sir sir from far away mister lewrie sir old on mister lewrie im acomin and there was cony paddling and treading water at his feet so far below though got ya somethin f ang onta sir cony promised there was a small rectangular hatch grating from a limber hole off the orlop deck a bar to intruders who had no business secreting themselves in the dark recesses of the bilges or the carpenters walks crosshatched of wood twobyfour with ventilation squares itll float like anythin sir ya gotta jump on down mister lewrie ill be right ere no worries ah lewrie said grimacing with fear that looked like a grin shes burnin damn fierce mister lewrie shell blow skyhigh any minute now cony insisted swiping water and soaked flaxen hair out of his eyes everbody elsez off er sir aint no reason tstay no longer come on sir lewrie sat down on the forechain platform easing his buttocks to the edge his toes dangling terrorbreaths whooshing in and out as if the next would be the last god love ya mister lewrie sir cony coaxed his face crimped with worry all these years tgether i dont mean tlose ya now wot i tell yr good lady an yr kiddies if i went an lost ya come on sir old yr nose an slide off ill be right by yr side swear it by jesus i do sir well he sighed he clapped his cocked hat firmly on his head took a deep breath held his nose compressed his lips took one last fond look at the bluffsand let go of the stay he fell he splashed like a cannon ball arrowing down down and down wanting to scream blinded by brine forever lost lungs aching wishing hed taken a deeper breath deep enough to last forever shit he yelped as he broke surface felt light and air on his face felt conys hand on his shirt collar retching and coughing from smoke from water in his mouth his eyes weeping with saltwater sting and pure semihysterical relief grab ahold o this sir there ya be safez ouses cony cooed and lewrie flailed about until his hands seized the hatch grating took it to his bosom trying to get his whole chest over the twobythreefoot grating feeling it wobble under him threatening to tip him over shit he reiterated ang on sir jus th edge tkeep yr ead bove water an cony instructed thats better sir you jus ang on anill tow lost my hat lewrie carped prying one stinging eye open hats no matter mister lewrie cony laughed gotta get shed o yr sword sir no lewrie insisted almost petulantly drag ya down do ya slip an let go sir cony explained no lewrie growled groping fearfully for the scabbard which dangled between his legs he dragged it around to lie athwart the grating before his eyes then resumed his death grip ere we go then sir cony fretted beginning to sidestroke and tow do ya kick yr legs sir push like ya wuz aclimbin real steep stairs thatd help yll get the ang of it once away from zeles side out of her lee they met the wind which helped propel them into the cove towards the beach grunting as he gyrated his legs in an unfamiliar motion he could begin to feel each tiny thrust as he clung to his raft gagging and spitting with the water just under his chin and wavelets slopping over his shoulders to his ears at times from behind halfway there he lost his right shoe no matter how hed crimped his toes to keep it there were dead in the water men floating facedown with their long hair come undone from tarry queues fanned out like tentacles from flattened jellyfish and bits and pieces of men whod been torn apart by one of those underwater shellbursts cony thrust their way through a bobbing assortment of broken barricoes stubs of lumber jagged still smoking planks and ships beams here an abandoned hammock inches under but still afloat there a man whod drowned even with two rolled hammocks about his chest coils of loose rope swaying upwards for the sun like sea snakes hed seen in the china seas sharks he quailed to himself grimly pushing and kicking finding a rhythm at last with conys towing strokes bloody hell ive seen em every shipwreck every battle looking for survivors some bit of halfsubmerged flotsam touched his bare foot and he all but screamed biting his sword belt to keep from unmanning himself rumblings distant earthquake quivers in the water pressure he could feel squeezing on his stomach and lungs groans and cries astern he dared turn his head to look and saw zele with twothirds heartily burning the foremast toppling slowly great gouts of bubbles foaming around her as she settled lower and lower her stern was probably already on the rocky bottom he thought with waves burbling around her greatcabin windows she at least would not have far to go not in four fathoms and she drew two shed lay awash until everything above that new waterline had charred to crumbly coals right sir cony said cheerfully were here hit me knee on a rock he left off sidestroking and stood up waistdeep alan was not that bravehe thrust with his legs until he was past cony before he groped for the bottom with his feet when he at last stood up hed reached thighdeep water and he was cold christ he sighed beginning to shiver his teeth to chatter as that brisk november wind found every waterlogged inch of him immersed it hadnt felt quite so bad his legs below the surface were warmer lucky we wuz so near th beach sir else weda froze up solid an gone under cony said hugging himself to still his own shiverings cony i lewrie blushed thankee will cony thankee aw sir cony shrugged modestly as they splashed through tiny surfrushes onto the gravel of the beach werent well sir after all this time id not care tbe servin another officer so i spect itd be better tsave th one im usedta whatever reason cony my hand ont lewrie offered shaking conys paw vigorously im in your debt damme if i aint all these years sir well i swore i wouldnt lose ya an so i didnt thankee sir thankee kindly now lets see what we have left lewrie said breaking free feeling a tad uncomfortable over such a close and affectionate display of emotion towards another man even one whod just saved his life there wasnt much de crillart and his gunners were grouped off to one side only about half the number lewrie had recalled trying to put names to halfknown faces trying to dredge up the identity of missing men of spaniards there were only four still alive spendlove porter and lisney were huddled together in a group he still had preston and sadler gracey gittons there was gunners mate bittfield bosun he called taken a muster aye sir porter nodded in a daze still nothin to write on sir i later lewrie agreed clapping him on the shoulder well sort it out later stout fellow porter to get as many as you did ashore oh aye sir thankee porter straightened bucking up lewrie undid the knee buckles of his breeches letting a minor flood of seawater escape down his shins he pulled up his stockings from his ankles where theyd settled and winced as he plodded across the rough shingle of the beach lockjaw fever was so easy to die of he couldnt recall a time hed ever gone barefoot even as a child there was a muffled boom from zele as part of her soggy powder at last took light in the magazine a dull whoomph accompanied by a spurt of smoke from her gunports shed settled now with only her upper bulwarks and gangways her jib boom and quarterdeck above the surface the fires had abated with too little dry timber to feed on she fumed now like a slag heap in birmingham the smoke thin and bluish like burning autumn leaves it struck lewrie suddenly that he had just lost everything his seachest had gone down with her all his clothes books a careerspan of official documents and letters orders and his two pairs of pistols shoes stockings homemade preserves he had packed that caroline had put up his dressing gown no one liked christ her letters he groaned and the miniature portrait and sewallis crude first drawings hughs messy handprints from the latest post that juju bag too lucy beauman had had one of her family slaves make it a witch to keep him safe from the sea long ago when he was ashore on antigua recovering from yellow jack he hadnt really worn it in ages but to lose it yet fat lot of good it did me after all he whispered i got ashore without it hurtful as his losses were the one that really stung was that for all his vows to keep his sailors alive come what may hed lost some of themhed failed and for the first time in his career he had lost a ship chapter charles lewrie muttered standing over the despondent lieutenant de crillart we have to get moving we stay on this beach well freeze to death it looks as if we could climb up to the hieres road and march to st margaret thats what bout half a mile oui alain de crillart nodded slowly getting to his feet as creakily as a doddering ancient lewrie offered him a hand up all zose hommes splendides moi my men i know mine too charles mister scott lewrie replied sir bosun porter shouted in alarm suddenly riders comin spilling down from the gentlest slope above the beach just west of where the french field guns had fired were a knot of horsemen men in oversized shakos bearing lances blue uniforms green uniforms all sprigged in red braiding and the lances bore small burgeecut pennons of bluewhitered the tricolour they were french about twenty cavalrymen followed by officers in cocked hats well shit lewrie sighed as the leading horsemen curvetted all about them brandishing lance points or sabres stand fast lads stay calm stand fast it was all they could do to run well thered be no running not shoeless on shingle no escape from a lance tip in the back they were already disarmed except for admiraltypattern sheath knives and captain braxton had made sure the points had been blunted long before sillylookin bashtids landsman preston grumbled some of the cavalrymen wore braids in their hair pigtails on either side of their faces with the rest long and looseflowing as women or shorn peasantshort in republican revolutionary style tall dragoon boots above the knee republican trousers instead of breeches gaudy new and unfamiliar uniforms not a queue not a powdered head in sight and they were a scruffylooking lot too as if their new rags had been sewn up from a set of old rags and they stank lord how they stank bad as rotting meat their horses galled raw by hard service oo eez een charge a cavalry officer asked one of the riders in green and red with the ridiculous pigtails beside his cheeks i am lewrie spat disgusted at being captured and so easily the cavalry officer extended his heavy sabre blade inverted and point down inches from alans nose with a triumphant smirk on his face parlezvous francais msieur he sneered ah foutre non lewrie said with a sad shrug je ne parle pas espece de salaud the officer barked making his horse rear and slash with its hooves baring yellow teeth je demande questce que votre nom vous fumier lieutenant alan lewrie royal navy he replied proudly refusing to give horse or rider an inch prickly with pridethe only item he had left in any abundance captain of the zele floating battery he pointed over his shoulder to the wreck parlezvous anglais oui the officer barked not sounding very happy about speaking the language of an ancient foe you ear me speak eet lieutenant or capitaine weech are you both lewrie grinned happy to have confused him et zйlй zat eez francais captured french ship british crew msieur why she sank so quick french alan said with another expressive shrug you mak ze leetle joke msieur hein the cavalryman grinned without mirth oui i make the little joke msieur the rider clucked and kneed his mount to take a step forward and alan had to give ground at last the sword point touched his chest and began to dig into his breastbone mais ve sink you an votre ship so oo is laugh now hein petit merdeux the rider laughed and swung his arm back for a cut arrкtez a voice shouted from up the hill leaving alan with a hairsbreadth between life and death as he beheld the weak november sun twinkling on the sabres freshhoned edge he knew he was being a fool knew his truculence could get him hacked to bits but he could not help himself but the officer balked looked over his shoulder and loosened the tension in his sword arm the sabre came down harmlessly to the riders side and he jerked his reins to ride away to speak with the clutch of officers who had called to him good god sir shouldnt you spendlove shivered if we get em mad enough aye mister spendlove ill be good from now on with the officer apart from them the cavalrymen the lancers and dragoons dismounted hemming in the survivors to a tight knot musketoons or long pistols out and halfcocked to pat them down for weapons for anything that struck their fancy too it seemed a sergeant came up to lewries side turned out his pockets and got a few shillings began to touch the sword alan glared at him and pushed the scabbard behind his thigh republican or not an officers glare was still useful on a revolutionary the sergeant moved his hand and tore his watch away snarling a garlicky breath through dingy discoloured teeth he held up the watch admiring the blue riband fouled anchor and crossed cannon fob done in damascene silver and gold opened the case and held it to his ear to see if it still ticked and made off with it chortling and jeering alan looked to the staff officers up the beach the cavalry officer was catching pluperfect hell from the fellow on the dapple grey gelding he sheathed his sabre bowed his head and turned red as the froggings on his jacket then they were coming down the beach towards lewrie the one on the fine dapple grey in the lead the horse stepping and prancing as headhigh as his master he drew to a halt tossed the reins without even looking to a lancer on the off side and swung a leg over the horses neck to spring lithely down another bloody minikin lewrie thought sourly as he studied him just like that captain nelson and young too christ he dont look a day over twentyone the officer wore glossy top boots snug buff trousers and a dark blue singlebreasted uniform coat cut horizontal across the waist with vine and leaf pattern embroidery up the front buttoned up against chilly winds almost to the throat the standandfall collar was also ornately embroidered with gold lace very wide and spread halfway to his shoulders a long burgundy wool sash about his slim waist a silverlaced black belt over it with a damascened buckle supported the frog for a lightcavalry sabre long shirt collar turned up against his neck wrapped in a silk stock plain black beaver cocked hat big as a watermelon dressed only with the tricolour cockade shadowed his eyes eyes lewrie noted that were not young at all very large penetrating studious and sober and so reserved yet darting lazily taking everything in lewrie reassessed his age upwardsmaybe midtwenties he thought the cavalry captain was like all cavalry english especially a hoorawing brute a danger to all including himself but this fellow msieur permettezmoi the cavalryman said in a gentler and much more polite tone of voice as he did the introductions ze lieutenant colonel napoleone buonaparte chef dartillerie a general dugommier commandeur de larmee is aidesdecamp ze capitaines marmot et junot msieurs ici capitaine luray marine royal de roi britannique georges troisieme colonel lewrie nodded laying a hand on his breast to salute with a slight bow capitaine luray enchante the little fellow smiled of a sudden and offered his hand reeling off a rapid very fluid french ze colonel say please to forgive e ave no anglais msieur the cavalryman translated but e eez delight to mak you ac acquaintance e offer is congratulation votre gunnerie votre courage magnifique you no strike votre flag sink viz les canons blaze magnifique tres magnifique he had no choice but to take the offered hand and shake it face to face at last with enemy frogs not the tame royalists in toulon it was a wrench though to be forced by gentlemanly convention to have to be pleasant to the fellow whod just sunk his ship that was a tad more than he thought should be expected of anybody the cavalryman rattled on laying on meaningless giltandbeshit compliments colonel buonaparte dropped his hand at last and took two steps away removing his hat and rinding a space of open ground where he could be seen better by everyone on the beach possibly to make a better spectacle of himself lewrie thought listening with half an ear lewrie knew preening when he saw it and he was a pretty picture without his hat he could show off his long hair so fine and straight it hung republican fashion down to his coat collars ungathered in any queue fell straight down along each side of his face and was combed forward over what appeared to be a good squarish brow like oils lewried seen of princes and pages in ancient times almost girlish he grinned slightly his nose was long and aquiline but narrow with wideish nostrils over a short upper lip a pouty thinlipped mouth but a most determined chin narrow highjawed face lean as a scholar hmm please convey to the colonel buonaparte that i cannot in good conscience take credit for the accuracy of our gunnery capitaine lewrie said once he had a word in edgewise our sea mortars were in the charge of a most experienced and talented spanish officer comandante don luis de esquevarre y saltado y perez and his bombardiers a most gallant man he went down with the ship unfortunately least i can do for the arrogant shit alan thought let someone remember his deeds now hes dead and gone ah msieur le colonel is sadden to ear zis capitaine luray e ad wish e may ave meet ze artilleriste avec ze grand courage ze colonel e alzo say e eez ave ze ighes respect pour votre generosity a votre late ami encore e espress is amazement de votre brave deeds i thank him kindly

same an not only sink une batterie de flotte but tak er officeurs an crew prisoner weech ze ozzer chef dartillerie do not the captain said with a smirk again damme there it is lewrie sighed knew theyd get around to a surrender sooner or later to this vauntin little coxcomb then well be months in gaol maybe a whole year before france gets beaten silly christ damned if i think im going to like that the colonel has been in charge of the batteries of la seyne lewrie asked stalling for time staving off the inevitable and trying to think of something anything for a plan of escape tell the colonel the gracious colonel buonaparte that my ship was the one that gave his gunners so much grief by balaguer oui us that saved them another precious minute as the young buonaparte looked almost wolfish that hed at last sunk the greatest thorn in his side his betenoire as he put it he smiled a bit wider sure he had done something praiseworthy and lewrie could surmise by then that he was a man who lived for praise and honours all the short ones did forgive me asking capitaine but lewrie said almost chummily by then i thought it was the mortars at fort la garde that sank us the colonel only had the two light field pieces and never hit us after a long babble in frog and some chuckles among marmot and junot and a look on young colonel buonapartes face like the cat that ate the canary the cavalryman began to translate the colonel crossed his arms over his chest pouting chinhigh in triumph posing right give em a chance to boast works every time alan thought ah oui msieur capitain luray the captain beamed slyly ze fort mais oui but he all but waved an impish finger at him colonel buonaparte e eez in la garde ze inspection nestce pas an e say e realise at once the dragoon captain snapped his fingers for emphasis as if he were tweaking lewries nose labatterie jeune new batterie eez not st margaret but you supplies arrive from la mer ze sea hein eef eez not fort st margaret zen

vite vis deux canon an ze flags de signaux you see e direc ze feu ze firing et voilа le colonel sink you he has my congratulations for his quick wits sir lewrie said with another slight bow feeling

demand of you votre surrender capitaine luray vite colonel buonaparte offer all officeurs la parole you keep vos swords receive ze treatment beau i lewrie began to say fingers twitching on his scabbard there was no more shillyshally no more delays he could think of and most especially not even the slightest hope of an escape attempt could he devise that wouldnt get a lot more of his men killed and what will happen to my men msieur he posed instead to my matelots my sailors zey be tak away the dragoon captain shrugged as if concern about the fate of enemy sailors didnt signify he looked them over with scorn like a remount officer deciding to herd off a pack of old nags to the knackers yard zey go to un fort under guard or ze prisoner ulks wen we take toulon and should i give you my parole id be forced to swear upon mine honour that i would no longer engage in combat with france long as the war lasts even if i was exchanged lewrie pressed hemhawing for time just a minute of freedom more zat is la convention msieur the fellow said growing testy and impatient once more vite your response lewrie turned to look around at the hangdog faces of his men faces still creased in pain and shock some mildly perplexed by the conversation their captain was holding with a foeman saw the vacant and weary defeated gapings of men without another ounce to give men hed vowed to defend to cosset to husband or to die with if needs must should he give his parole hed be almost free in some inland french garrison town sleeping in clean linen bathing and shaving regularly eating and swilling as well as any french civilian receive a packet of halfpay through the cartels letters from caroline arrange for extra funds to be sent him sleep late dawdle ride under guard with a sword on his hip the gentleman still hire whores if he felt the itch and all the while these men would be in chains fettered in a loathsome fortress cellar chained like a coffle of slaves aboard some foetid reeking condemned ship of the line like felons awaiting transportation for life eating slops and mushes and thinking themselves lucky if they only slept two to a blanket flearidden licecrusted je regrette he sighed dreading those prisonerofwar gaols just as much as his men would but he could not do that to them could not abandon them without a backward glance dear as he wished he might toddle off and call it the fortunes of war he could not nor end his naval career miss out on the blazing finale to a shortlived war as a mildly inconveniencedidler he lifted his hanger from the belt frog held the sparkling hilt up to the wan sunshine in front of his face saw the seashells wink as it turned in his grasp he kissed the handguard and held it out je regrette messieurs i cannot give you my parole the dragoon captain made to take it from him but colonel buonaparte shouldered him aside and reached out for it somberly he seized the scabbard at the midpoint his arm level with a sad gravity the young french officer brought it to his own face cradling it like one might a child to bestow his own kiss upon the bright silver chase and nod at lewrie with those large penetrating eyes of his glowing watery sir spendlove said stepping to lewries side and offering up his midshipmans dirk i cannot give you my parole either mes braves buonaparte smiled vous avez du poil au culs et vous msieur the dragoon captain asked de crillart oh shit alan shuddered they learn hes royalist theyll be havin his head off fore dinner and all his gunners by sundown he has no sword to surrender sir he lost it

catching his drift and nudging the others to play along oy lads old nipcheese a froggie they began to titter we do have men among us whom you might consider french sir lewrie confessed ignoring spendloves startled gasp at his elbow we recruited in the channel islands guernsey alderney some of our best sailors come from there the british channel islands mind aye they parlezvous some but

demanded parlezvous francais de crillart shook his head in the negative shrugging with a hopeless grin at the dragoon officer somezing in english msieur yes mister scott lewrie prompted as well turning to him in desperation say something in royal navy mister scott de crillart frowned cocking his head to one side it was his life he held in his hands and the lives of his gunners as well and alans once they found hed been lying like a rug and resented it arrh matey charles pronounced carefully aye aye capum alan stifled such a monumental snort of stupefaction he felt his sinuses were about to burst where the helld he learn that he wondered and whyd he dredge it up now god what a honid choice you may have a bit of bother understanding him you see alan sped to explain trying to keep a straight face no matter how hellish dangerous it was mister scott is a real scot a highland scot cant understand him meself half the time all his arrrhhin and burrin goddamnrright capum de crillart added bluddy oh god dont gild the lily not when alan winced he was interrupted by the most wondrous sound hed ever heard in his entire lifethe sudden spatter of musketry everyone jerked their heads to the source to espy a rank of shakoed heads on the tall bluff above the beach on the coast road lance tips winked beyond on the hill bared sabres flashed and a trumpet sounded they wore goldish yellow jackets with white facings spanish cavalry by god bullets spanged off the shingle sparks erupted crisp as struck gunflints horses reared and neighed and men cried out in alarm to arm themselves or to mount quickly buonaparte and his aides mounted lewrie looked longingly for his sword the bastard still had it the dragoon captain reached for the hilt of his sabre lewrie shoved him punching him in the face runnforritt he screamed bolting away dragging spendlove by the elbow this wayy as he headed for shelter under the bluffs up the cove under the guns of the cavalrymen his unshod right foot took terrible punishment on sharpedged stones and gravel every lumpy rock he stubbed on made him wince but it was better than a bullet in the back or a sword cut run damn yer eyes run he panted there were shrieks as a lancer got his tip into the back of a fleeing sailor another piteous cry of madre de dios noo ahhhl that ended in a rabbity screech as a spanish bombardier was hewn down by a dragoons sword cut open from belly to breastbone and french cries music to lewries ears as men were spilled from their saddles by ball or stirrupdragged by panicked chargers over the rough beach they reached the cliffs gasping with effort lewrie turned to see the french cantering south in fairly good order heading for the far side of the arrowshaped bluff below the beach where there was a way up and off steeper than the one theyd descended he spotted lieutenant colonel buonaparte on his dapplegrey patiently waiting as his lancers thundered up the draw past him braving longrange musket fire as his dragoons formed an openorder vedette to screen the retreat buonaparte made his grey rear stuck his arm in the air to wave the captured sword he was smiling damn his eyes ill get it back you bastard lewrie howled in his loudest quarterdeck voice jabbing a finger at the sword je prendre mon one day ill find you je trouvezvous je prendre de vous mon damme whats frog for sword espece de salaud he roared instead his voice echoing off rocks and hills va te faire foutre scabbarded buonaparte flipped the sword so the hilt was in his fistraised it to his face in mock salute laughed as his horse did another impressive rear he may have had no english and lewrie might not have had anything close to fluent frenchbut he thought he understood well enough with a saw at the reins the colonel was gone in a moment up the draw and out of sight seflores pronto a spanish cavalry officer directed skidding his mount to a sandstrewing halt near them ingles we go muy pronto darse hurry up not another language lesson not two in one day lewrie sighed the officer kicked an elegantly booted foot out of the nearside stirrup reached down to offer him a hand as his men trotted up to aid the rest with spare french mounts whose owners lay crumpled on the sands or the mounts of spanish soldiers whod been spilled trying to rescue them alan hoisted his foot reached for the saddlehorn and hung on as the officer spurred his charger back up the draw to the hieres road a minute sooner he muttered ungraciously beside his saviour just a bloody minute sooner thankee very much nothing could have spared him the shame of losing his ship of course but to see that swaggerin little bastard ride off with his sword in his hands his very honour vi hic portus inquit mihi territat hostis has aeies sub nocte refert haec versa pelasgum terga vides meus hic ratibus qui pascitur ignis lo here the enemy is affrighting our harbour and here beneath the cover of night he renews the battle and here see the backs of the pelasgians in rout this fire that devours the rafts is mine valerius flaccus argonautica book ii chapter he dined alone dispiritedly picking at his supper and pushing it about his plate more than he ate as thoroughly blockaded by land as toulon now was there wasnt that much food any longer and prices had gone through the roof at least the wine was still good and cheap there were few other diners in the restaurant half of them officers in strange uniforms proud with gold or silver lace sprigged in ornate gewgawy appurtenances which no matter their martial gaudiness still made their wearers look like scared shopkeepers sardinians neapolitans redmontese spanish lewrie was one of the rare british officers not out on the outposts bleak as his mood was the others seemed even more morose large liquid don and dago eyes aswim with fear or selfpity hesitant gestures where before they chopped at the air or waved their arms in braggadocio soft sibilant mutterings of defeated conversation much shrugging and sighing stopping occasionally as the drumfire of the artillery barrages increased in tempo or volume or a shell crashed into the town itself theyd been doing that a lot lately the frogs lofting mortars into their own city five or six rounds a day now they had the range kettledrums pounded the candle flames wavered on his table and glassware softly tinkled as siege guns tore loose upon fort malbousquet and fort malbousquet responded worried looks were shared among the foreign officers bleak little giggles in attempts at gallows humour and the french pausing for a moment stoic faces frozen in what they called sangfroid damnit but the french always had le mot juste the perfect word or phrase he sneered alan chewed on a slice of goose and swirled the cabernet sauvignon in his large wine glass studying his wine through the stuckinabottle candle flame studying the frogs the other diners pere et maman with their children old aristocrats still clinging to silks and satins successful merchants in wellcut wool coats and waistcoats the very image of moderate wealth and the latest styles and so few of them still wearing their bourbonwhite cockades the last few weeks theyd slowly shed them like oak trees giving up their final leaves to the winter winds on the outskirts of toulon it was said the new style was redwhiteandblue republican colours and in the middle of town there were hastily chalked or painted threats on walls fresh each morning no matter the patrols long redwool stocking caps were seen now in public sported by sourfaced hardeyed commoner patriots the sans culottes swaggering bullies who dared show the tricolour and glared at those who didnt as if memorising faces and names later they seemed to forebode well know who you are later msieur weesh his waiter asked pointing to his halfeaten and bedraggled supper an ubiquitous omelet only two eggs per customer now a last gamy oily slice of overcooked goose and a heel of bread aswim in the fats of halfburnt halfcooked pommes de terre escallopes non merci he replied sarcastically plus de vin non laddition lewrie sighed nearly a shilling it cost for what hed have paid no more than four pence back home and kicked the cooks arse for ruining it he got to his feet gathered up his hat and cloak and departed the others watched him leave in silence daunted by the grim look on the naval officers face the unspoken sneer of disgust he bore when he deigned to glance in their direction who is he to sneer at us they seemed to say a pinchbeck anglais in a ragged toolarge coat in sloptrousers instead of a gentlemans knee breeches worn old hessian boots a plain blue civilian cloak a hat that had seen a previous war and that pitiful excuse for a sword it was cold that night cold and icily clammy with a light wind off the sea street lanterns wore haloes of mist and it smelled like it might rain before morning lewrie wrapped himself in the toolarge and tatty coat purchased off another officer grateful its lapels buttoned over each other until he received his quarterly draft from courts he was forced to live on navy pay and a borrowed forty poundshalf of that gone already for the hat cloak and a mediocre smallsword of dubious temper the best of a table piled with secondhand blades of even more uncertain character at a civilian shopkeepers bargain sale he walked downhill towards the harbour and the basin listening to the drumming of the guns the batteries on des moulins and reinier were blazing away round the clock now the little road had all but been abandoned so fierce was their fire that no lineofbattle ship or floating battery could dare it for very long the streets were suspiciously empty of strollers or late shoppers even of whores and corinthians and where almost every shop window or appartement above had been open and ablaze with light they were now dark and shuttered or out of business temporarily a waggon creaked down the street drawn by four heavy dray horses moans of wounded could be heard withina hospital waggon bearing the days detritus to hopital de la charite north of town outside the walls a half mile from the site of the latest disaster of two weeks before the republicans had massed a battery on the heights darenes west of fort malbousquet twenty guns or better and had begun a deluge of shellfire against that most important strongpoint the key to the western side dundas and ohara had marched out next day on november with men spanish neapolitan sardinian of the few french royalist troops along with of their precious british a majority of the mobile reserves who werent tied to fixed positions the best of their mediocre illmatched lot a brisk attack uphill had driven the french from their guns again but instead of stopping there and consolidating the troops had rushed on down into a valley behind the heights darenes to attack the nextwest eminence but upon that bill all behind it was hidden the bulk of general dugommiers main body over carteaus men mourets thousands of soldiers kellerman and dugommier had brought in from lyons and the north it had been a sharp slaughter then a rout and the french drove the remnants scurrying into fort malbousquet general ohara had been wounded and taken prisoner attempting to rally the troops by the guns twenty british had died ninety wounded ninetyeight had gone missing and the allied casualties had been just as severe the french got their guns back intact and were now putting them to good use and the austrians damn their eyes lewrie silently fumed god how theyd sworn they were on their way yet suddenly the men theyd promised from italy couldnt be spared and rearadmiral gell and his squadron waiting for weeks at genoa and vado bay had at last sailed back to toulon empty sardinians and neapolitans liars too alan cursed their commissariats too incompetent disorganised or lazy to arm equip or train the men promised no matter how much moneyd been thrown at them they werent up to the task in the spring perhaps for more money fat lot of good theyll do us in the spring lewrie snarled in a harsh mutter place doesnt have a month left in it and british regiments that was the worst disappointment with their socalled allies so suspicious and jealous of england and each other hedging bets for after the war arguing points of pride and honour not cooperating what looked at times as nigh to treachery they had need of stalwart british regulars more than ever yet where were they dundas and grenville the new prime minister william pitt the younger theyd settled for war on the cheap they planned long before the war started to fritter the army away overseas in the west indies to destroy the economy of the french to take the rich sugar isles theyd always lusted after march up the hooghly to chandernagore above calcutta destroy the french indian and indian ocean colonies destroy their trade and choke them to submission thats where the bulk of the british army had gone there or into holland with the duke of york and for the enterprise at toulon they could not spare one regiment more and the army was now doing what all white troops did in the tropics dying by the battalion of yellow jack and malaria without firing a shot of no use to anyone gaining nothing barely able to muster enough strength to take what theyd been sent for drumfire to the south the frogs had erected five new batteries in front of fort mulgrave on the hauteur de grasse digging and trenching forward moving nearer each day if mulgrave fell there went balaguer and leguillette and with them any approach to toulon s basin or any hope of sheltering ships in the great road too that little coxcomb buonapartes work alan suspected with a sour groan aye take joy of it ya arrogant little bastard they were quartered once again in the guardhouse by the dockyard gate de crillart spent his nights at home with his family high up in the town but his twenty or so surviving royal corps of gunners bunked with alans fourteen not enough to make crews for two cutters or barges hed been assigned a dozen more men cut adrift from ships off on god knew what missions more survivors of brave but doomed adventures those plucked from the sunken ruins of other gunboats that the french had wrecked no more gunboats for them though floating batteries were a tad thin on the ground these days as were the huge sea mortars as were hollow explosive shells from the arsenals and fuses and powder the poudriere and fort millaud had shut down their production after theyd run out of charcoal saltpetre and sulphur and republican burstingshell had begun to drum around them threatening a tremendous explosion which would shave the hills level theyd also run out of royalist workmen who dared set foot in the places no lewrie and his men were boatmen now ferrymen equipped with cutters which shuffled supplies and such about under lugsail or oars to keep the coastline posts fed and armed to bear wounded from hauteur de grasse to hospital or scuttle between the lineofbattle ships and shore with replacements rum biscuit and salt rations for their hands detached ashore the wind was picking up ruffling his cloak and hat but alan stood his ground near the guardhouse gate unwilling to go inside to another night of frowsty air and loneliness cooped up alone in his miserable little room with the stink of all those men below wafting up to him there wasnt coal enough or wood enough to keep a warm fire going long enough to take off the chill nor enough candles or oil to read by what was the point hed lost all his books when zele had gone down and didnt have the patience to ruin his eyes trying to puzzle his way through something written in french anyway no he would spend another night mittened and cloaked abed with his eyes wide open staring at the low ceiling til sleep came or pace the wharves along the basin until he was too tired to care something was moving on the esplanade besides himself a woman also cloaked and mittened hobbling under the burden of a hardleather portmanteau and a large cloth sack her face was concealed by her hood and the sad straw brims of her bonnet which the hood forced down either side of her face like horse blinkers hunched against the cold winds bonsoir msieur she drawled etesvous seul ce soir oh a whore he sighed to himself for a moment hed thought it might be a refugee looking for shelter or some girl moving to cheaper lodgings seul oui mais he replied sourly already dismissing her alone yes ah msieur luray she cried suddenly dropping her luggage to come to his side msieur lieutenant cest moi phoebe she exclaimed folding back the hood of her cloak vous remember bonsoir oh poor mister scotts whore he corrected himself bonsoir phoebe he grinned havent seen you around not not since mister scott passed over he shrugged in sympathy she and scott had become regulars with each other he might have become all of her trade the few weeks before his death cest tragique pauvre barnaby she pouted e waz ze bon good man tres gentil avec moi beaucoup de bonte ver kin et genereux generous cest dommage she shrugged she did not say that barnaby scott had been gentle just kindly in fact lewrie thought hed dealt rather brusquely with her too deadset against all french people even the one hed been topping to be civil or gentlemanly now alan inquired comment allezvous maintenant mademoiselle phoebe ah je suis tres seule msieur she replied snuffling from the cold though with a game little smile am ver lone avant

monnaie phfft too beezy too pauvre too effrayant frighten that was another ominous portent to lewries mindthat men in the enclave no longer had coin or time enough to waste on the whores of toulon too wrapped up in fears for their safety too concerned about plotting their escapes with their whole skins to rattle hed expected the opposite would be true that theyd be kicking her door down rantipoling

shivering with more than cold stepping closer to him i mus ave votre protection plais mon dieu you weel protec moi plais the tiny mort entreated her soft brown eyes huge in a pinched little gamine

trustfully here it comes he sighed to himself the hand on my purse wan you partez you leave toulon she dared to whisper up at him head cocked most fetchingly you weel take pauvre phoebe that wasnt

searchingly though her belly was pressed against his in promise her gaze was so forlorn yet hopeful her eyes aswim with tears for fear of his rejection and her fate if he did turn her away he felt his resolves slipping again god save me he whispered in surrender know what your name means phoebe je ne sais pas msieur she replied softly putting all her kitteny fondness into her voice sensing his agreement at last it means sunshine in latin he chuckled giving in to her neediness and his own like a happy sun comme le soleil heureux she tittered smiled at last and took a moment to wipe her nose and eyes on her mittens then threw her arms around his neck daccord msieur alain you protec me nous demeurons reside ensemble oui he nodded with a sheepish grin we demeurons ensemble ooh she cried suddenly bouncing on her toes to hug him and giggle with relief you are fhomme tees sympathique so good so gentil si magnifique je suis si heureuse so appy an i mak you so appy aussi quand wan ve coucherons ensemble phoebe vowed suggestively aimestu la coucher alain oui he chuckled mais oui beaucoup an wan you leave toulon she paused inquiring of him more closely for an instant leaning back warily to see if all particulars of their bargain were sure like any levelheaded woman of business et ve sail way ensemble aussi alain oui i swear ill get you on a ship when the time comes ma petite jolie phoebe swear promise uh croyezvous believe me he gathered up her bags those two items bearing all her worldly goods he led her into the courtyard of the guardhouse past a sentry who first gaped then averted his eyes up the stairs past the few men idling and yarning in the guardroom daring them to gawp at him into his room where he shut the door on all outside distraction and curiosity he lit a candle as she doffed her cloak and mittens and thawed herself at the small fireplaces grate there was a bottle of cognac on the scarred rickety night stand by the bed only one glass which he filled for her which she accepted eagerly he drank from the neck listening to the rising winds as they rattled the shutters someonecony perhapshad been thoughtful enough to obtain a warming pan for the bed and had set out a covered dish a quarterloaf of bread with a hank of sausage she devoured it ravenously childcheerful as he put the warming pan back on the grate and removed coat and waistcoat they hung their clothing on wall pegs suddenly sombre and shy with each other after she was done eating she smiled at him as she pinched out the candle and shooed him to turn around so she could undress completely m maintenant mon cheri she said at last faint and shaky bloody he gasped as he turned about to look at her she stood nude on her knees in the middle of the bed whorebold yet as shy as nervous and giggly as a virgin might on her first night of marriage totally feckless and artless at that moment without a jot of a whores weariness pouting boredom or experience her light olive skin was dark against the pale sheets caressed by flickers of firelight her hair a long curling dark brown cascade down her back to her waist over her shoulders halfconcealing breasts small but well formed almost perky so slim and neat so girlish and tiny she looked almost thin jai froid mon cheri she shuddered in a wee voice as she hugged herself for a moment her eyes huge with want viens a moi come to me depeches vite she implored stretching out her arms for him he rushed to the bed to embrace her to kneel close to her run his hands hungrily over her velvety firm young flesh feeling her goosepimple at his touch si belle tu es si belle si petite si he praised such a beautiful little pretty you mak me warrum alain she shivered somewhere between a nervous laugh and a helpless plea you keep me safe an warrum mon gentilhomme fantastique she leaned back from his kisses to take his face in her little hands to regard him to force him to regard her for a serious instant alors a toi je donne tout mon coeur zen my all i give to you mon corps mon coeur moimeme she whispered in touching tears that scalded as they splashed on his cheeks as they kissed again they fell into the warmed bed hurling the covers up to their chins burrowing eagerly into the welcome warmth of presshot sheets grasping to clasp their warming flesh together beginning to chuckle and sigh to simper and giggle like goosegirl and stableboy when did she learn my given name he idly wondered too busy for much real thought as they rolled and interlaced limbs twining as sinuous as snakes mouths pressed together stroking and exploring scott must have told her she was always friendly enough amusing and anxious to please to fit in hang everything he decided just all of ithands the war the siege all of it just a few nights for the love of heaven ma belle he sighed in her ear lost once more humours ablaze as he nuzzled and savoured afire for her and nothing else but a few precious moments of sweet tumbling oblivion ma petite oui ill keep you warm je fais tu chaud and safe oh mon cheri she swore going breathless mon coeur mon amour aimesmoi to seal her bargain to coax him or cajole him to winnow her way into his sympathy and affection to hold him to it she repaid him in the only coin she had left or perhaps understood but with passion so intense so open and eager so far beyond a coquettes artful practice that he could not believe her giving of herself so completely was totally feigned towards the end especially panting on his shoulder tears in her eyes kisses deep and searing softly lingering and full of gentleness and seeming affection as if for a time at least the girl could shut the door on her own very real fears for her future phoebe had as much need as anyone to abandon herself deny the terrifying world outside and sink mindlessly and carefree into a sweet oblivion of her own surrender time and time again to pleasures so imperative that rife beyond her bodys sensations had no terrors which could even compare and sleep at last draped half over him her head resting on his chest clinging in her sleep as doggedly as he had to his raft so light and sweet so soft and toasty warm with her hair spilled like a quilt over them sleeping peacefully purring gentle and slow twined about him completely spent yet happy dreaming perhaps he wondered as he drowsed alongside his arms cocooning her what did whores dream about anyway her world was so narrow so limited and she such a willow branch to any wind that blew did she dream of safety new gowns a little place to call her own of surviving long enough to continue her same narrow life he glanced at his new watch on the night stand by the firelight another cheap piece o work just gone eleven he yawned completely utterly spent himself yet happy as well in his own way whatever itd beena young whores practiced arts to earn her passage or a frightened girls exquisite gratitude some small measure of true affection and desire at last awakenedwho knew he asked the ceiling it had been bestial magnificent tender and grand he slept himself then as the skies opened and a cold sullen rain began to fall slashing at the besieged port driven by a halfgale of wind pattering and rattling on the shutters drumming on the roof slates making him glad he wasnt at sea on such a fearsome night he slept at last as real natural thunder growled and rumbled forcing him to nestle closer to phoebe to clasp her tighter and feel her reply with a snugger hug of her own as he rolled nearer as a faroff storm voice marched closer and mingled itself with the dolorous drumming of guns chapter very far off someone was shouting something incomprehensible which sort of sounded like allez allez vite mumblemumble le blahblahblah perdu dull thuds somewhere something froggish lewrie halfdecided and snuggled closer to the warmth of his girl les republicans arrivent bad dream bugger it sweet soft warm smooth shoulder more thunderings up the stairs this time or the storm still rumbling guns still rumbling what else was new merde alors phoebe muttered crossly in his ear waking first leaning across him to listen her long tresses tickled his nose half smothering him but drew him most unwillingly nearer the surface of his pleasant stupor he opened one eye beheld a perky young breast dark aureola and pinkish nipple staring back an inch from his lips alan gave it a little flick with his tongue thinking that a marvelous way to be awakened oohn she groaned in spite of herself with a chuckle deep in her throat more bloody bangings on the door hard and insistent alain someone eez phoebe prompted sleepily hmmphff he grumbled rolling on his back what alain a voice shouted as the door burst open with a bang at the sight of a man in uniform a french naval uniform with a brace of pistols in his belt phoebe gave out with a loud scream of pure royalist terror as she sat bolt upright lewrie felt his hair go on end for a second until the dim light filtering through the shutters revealed the man to be charles de crillart sacre charles gawped his face suffusing christ charles cant you knock or something alan carped alain i uhh lieutenant de crillart stuttered his eyes swiveling from lewries puffy face to phoebes bare charms then back mon dieu pardonnezmoi mon ami lewrie sat up claiming the top sheet to shroud his groin as he put his torso between phoebe and de crillart she dragged the coverlet to her chin huddling tiny in a corner of the bed by the headboard alain ze republicains charles explained stepping out onto the small landing and halfclosing the door fort mulgrave cest perdu lost what he barked leaping from the bed for stockings and sloptrousers lost how ze storm early zis morn zey avant vis ze bayonet wan

lewrie paused rubbing his face he turned to share a look with phoebe who was white and blanched with fear ah any orders for us yet charles he hurried to button up his waistcoat and don his stock non de crillart sighed eet eez still rain hard an ver foggy no one know anysing or see anysing lewrie stepped out to join charles now he was decent and shut the door so phoebe could spring from the bed

bien admiral lord hood major general dundas admiral de langara and lieutenant general valdez forteguerri the neapolitan rear admiral gravina sir hyde parker prince pignatelli chevalier de revel and sir gilbert elliot held a quick counsel of war as the sounds of battle and barrage faded away to nothing for the moment the republicans were as spent as anyone else except for a few spatters of musketry as patrols in toulon discouraged looting or sans culottes acts of patriotism there was little to indicate a crisis had come except for the people in the streets the handcarts laden with household goods and valuables waggons streamed downhill from the outlying districts to the quays piled up in confusion rain continued to fall a chilly drizzling misty rain that shrouded the heights of pharon and the surrounding mountains almost cut off any view of de grasse peninsula frightened as they were the royalists endured with a stoic calm waiting for news waiting for evacuation waiting for a ship to board it was the foreign troops who were the most unruly those routed from the heights the peninsula those who should have still garrisoned the remaining posts but who drifted back into town looking for ships of their own neapolitan soldiers were already filtering aboard their lineofbattle ships tancredi and guiscardo british troops remained disciplined as did the spanish it was they who maintained order in the ranks even if they had to threaten the neapolitans with cannon to make them march out of their positions turning their own guns on them there had already been some shooting in neapolitan lines where terrified men had panicked and fired off their muskets at any affright killing or wounding dozens of innocent civilians whod streamed past on their way to the harbour thinking them a french advance out of the fog headquarters was not very informative it was a beehive of men dashing about of stacks of papers being sorted of piles of rejects on pyres and chests and campaign trunks being packed and slammed closed the sight almost made lewrie glad he had so little by way of possessions to worry about he felt more mobileand quicker when it came time to flee it made him faintly sour too to see the many valuables being carted off silver plate gold ornaments clocks an entire crystal chandelier crates and barrels of rarevintage wine cognac toulon had been a very rich city and it now appeared that it was being looted by the defeated to deny the victors their proper spoils anything for me and my men to do he asked once more of a junior officer for gods sake sir no the man shouted back over his shoulder in passing how many times do i have to tell you i have no orders for anyone in the navy at this time they had had orders all contradictory first hed been warned to ready his boats to aid in the evacuation of balaguer but before he could get that in writing they were cancelled then it had been word to prepare to evacuate the batteries at cape bran and fort st margaret but others thought that a bad idea for it would expose every ship in the great road to enemy fire were they not held to the end does anyone have a clue whats happening a frustrated postcaptain shouted after the army aidedecamp in exasperation there d been a constant stream of officers from the ships in harbour captains and commanders first lieutenants coming and goingmostly with word to shift their anchorages to the great road or the bay of toulon wait for further orders to prepare all their boats but mostly to wait christ not in this raree show there aint lewrie muttered anything but indecision a postcaptain near lewrie agreed in some heat anything but delay high as i esteem admiral lord hood but perhaps the situation requires deliberate action careful thought and planning else the evacuation will be a disaster cant imagine why theyd start thinking now lewrie sneered softly his face bearing a sardonic grin a bit late that they are still our superior officers sir the little fellow stiffened christ it was captain nelson in our hour of travail they deserve our unstinting support sir i know you do i sir alan lewrie captain nelson he replied stiffening himself in sudden wariness of the cockerel frigate currently naples nelson smiled of a sudden i heard of you from the hamiltons my predecessor to that delightful port you get stuck into lady emma too did you lewrie thought before that sir during the revolution god yes off cape francois nelson enthused recalling dewey lambdin turks island captain nelson just a few weeks before the end of hostilities uhm yess turks island nelson frowned hed come a rare cropper over that one trying to retake the island from the frogs whod garrisoned it with more men than nelson had in his entire adhoc squadron a squadron he had no right to assemble or lead brig o war shrike was it not sir and your captain was grievously wounded aye sir still in the navy though all thanks to your speaking to lord hood on his behalf captain lilycrop lost the leg but hes in the impress service made post i never did get the opportunity to express my undying thanks for your kind deed sir i do so now sir he threw in a bow leg extended his hat upon his breast and maybe hell forget the strip he was about to tear off mine arse for mouthing off alan hoped to himself and mine to you lieutenant lewrie for preparing the ground so to speak in naples with his majesty king ferdinand nelson replied with an equal bow he stepped closer and took lewries hand sir william lady emma acton his majestyall spoke highly of you they are all well sir and thriving including queen maria carolina i did not have the opportunity to meet her but delivered of a healthy heir sir i am quite happy to relate soon after your departure aye well and thriving personally that is though our impending defeat here will be no cause for delight with the neapolitans enthusiastic allies perhaps too enthusiastic to be firm or steady allies nelson gloomed like many mediterraneans possessed of the ability to elate or despair in equal measure do we get their troops away with no further losses sir then i am certain sir william hamilton and lady emma may buck their enthusiasms up again lewrie grinned aye i dare say nelson chuckled lifting on the balls of his feet with an enthusiasm of his own an amazing woman lady emma so manyfaceted like a precious gem he did get the leg over lewrie speculated such perspicacity in a female such wit and charm and how well she wields her influence so subtly nelson raved on aye nailed her so talented were you a guest at palazzo sessa sir and view her attitudes oh you had to sleep aboard your ship too bad the hamiltons were most gracious to me the duke of sussex was to visit in naples his guest suite was prepared yet they lodged me in it and sir william informed me i was quite thunderstruck by this that in all the years hed been plenipotentiary to the kingdom of naples i was the very first naval or military officer ever granted such of his hospitality can you imagine nelson blathered on seeming to preen the short ones always do lewrie thought keeping a straight face nelson that frog buonaparte god id love to get those two togetheritd be a cat fight no error and i avow sir nelson said with a determined wistful air as i wrote to my dear wife fanny that lady emma is a credit sir to the station in life to which she has been raised ah no he didnt after all lewrie smirked in secret captain nelson do you have any notion where the cockerel frigate may be weve been detached ashore since midseptember with no communications with her under the circumstances we should be standingoff and on without cape sepet the last i saw of her lieutenant lewrie nelson informed him but that was days ago you mean to tell me your captain in all that time has not communicated with you but ive seen her lying at anchor in the great road quite nearby oh she was off with admiral gell to vado bay with the royalist french squadron but she returned days ago after the austrians well the austrians nelson sighed petulantly pulling at his long fair nose dear as id wish to return to her sir well therere the royalists i have with me lewrie explained summarising his recent duties with de crillart and his gunners the families now assembling dependent upon him their crying need for evacuation ah word at last perhaps nelson broke off as the doors to a large salon opened and the senior officers were summoned inside do come with me lieutenant it is sure to be informative gentlemen it is unanimously resolved admiral lord hood began to speaktall beaky hunched and wearylooking wearing a floured periwig with elaborate horizontal side curls tumbling past his ears a famous nose riper and fuller than even il vecchio nasoneby all the allied representatives and by the committee for war which represents the native toulonese that our enterprise here is doomed to failure he went on to encapsulate the present situation the command the republicans now held over the forts the harbour and the roadsteads a few months ago i wrote london that had i but five or six thousand men toulon could not only be held but could serve as base of operations for an invasion of the entire midi the south of france the republicans however have according to the intelligence which we have gleaned from various deserters or prisoners over men opposing us and sadly even should we through force of arms claim back those redoubts which were lost last evening well the situation in which we find ourselves would be no less parlous anent another assault upon us from the french of even greater strength so we must evacuate toulon orders are being drafted now for military units pray allow me to refer to the map the redoubt and lunette of pharon below the french positions will be abandoned troops there are to retire to the forts of artigues and st catherine and will hold them as long as is humanly possible to deny the republicans entry to the town the major redoubts of both the great and little antoines on the norwest mountain shall also evacuate as will the st andre the pomet fort millaud and the powder mills and once the guns are toppled or spiked all troops at forts leguillette and balaguer will cross the gullet to fort la malgue and st louis at its foot at present fort malbousquet and fort missicy still daunt republican troops from entering the city from the west they shall be held admiral hood insisted with a stern glower at the clutch of senior army officers to his right all outlying posts to the east will be abandoned we intend to begin evacuating the wounded from the infirmarie and the hopital de la charite at once first to fort la malgue thence down to the water fort st louis and embark in cutters and barges to such vessels of the fleet as have space for them and the means to care for them we may have a day or two as a grace period hood spoke with faint hope even so the republican assaults resulted in many wounded among their troops the weather is abominable and the trails and goat tracks are slick and wet everywhere they met with success it may be some time before they are able to shift heavy guns in numbers sufficient to threaten our ships or mount another assault so soon after the first upon the city itself whistlin in the wind lewrie thought if theyre smart theyll be at us tonight and i doubt we cost em tuppence this should give us at least one full day and night to prepare the basin the arsenals and the magazines for destruction accordingly every french ship which is in any forward condition armed or able to go to sea shall be taken from the basin at once and anchored in the great road there to receive troops as they come off shore and those french royalists who may wish transportation away from toulon right lewrie sneered as if any of emd stay admiral don juan de langara will be in overall command of firing the inner basin and the french fleet hood announced all the powder remaining will be concentrated in two prizevessels and sunk at the last the destruction of the fleet will not be undertaken until we have safely extricated troops and innocent civilians under cover of darkness nelsons hand shot up at once and lewrie could see him quivering with eagerness to participate instinctively he slid a halfstep away from him hed seen captain horatio nelson at work before at turks island and didnt wish to take part in another of his harumscarums neckornothing damnall adventures hed had quite enough lately thank you very much ahum hood frowned pulling at his florid nose as he gazed in nelsons direction shaking his head sorrowfully to command the british party from the royal navy which will assist admiral langara in his endeavour i have selected captain sir william sidney smith dear lord nelson whispered sotto voce absolutely crushed he could not take part he sounded truly deeply disappointed how did he come by that thatswashbuckler whos this captain smith when hes up and dressed sir alan whispered the showy one nelson sighed tilting his head towards a man in almost a parody of naval uniform he was big bluff mehearty smith was the sort who wore a perpetual pissmeintheeye belligerence an exuberant sort who positively swaggered bold as a doginadoublet the sort with abounding selfconfidence who knew no fear whatsoever came in a fortnight ago from smyrna on the turkish levant nelson muttered from the side of his mouth purchased a little lateen rigged boat called it swallow hired on a crew of englishmen who had been languishing out of work there hoisted his own commission pendant wrote his own admiralty orders in essence and has been perfectly thrusting himself forward since sir ahead of you has he lewrie deigned to think with a dart at his putative host to see the envy burning in captain nelsons eyes sir william sidney smith wasnt the only enterprising and aspiring captain in the salon hood made some dismissing statements to gird their loins stick fast stout hearts and stalwart will that sort of thing just before they went their separate ways lewrie tagged along as nelson approached the admiral im sorry nelson admiral lord hood said giving him a faint grin and taking his elbow protectively but i so prize your sterling qualities that i cannot find it in my heart to wager your future contributions upon a rather weak hand and you have accomplished so much for me already tunis naples though i would desire to reward you with a larger ship a more important command a perhaps milord i am so completely in your debt for all your many kindnesses your espousal of my cause with the finest most gracious and most indulgent patronage nelson sighed i would have liked to command the party if only to in the slightest wise be able to reward all your goodness towards me with measure for measure no matter the risk i am as always at your instant command of course i know youre disappointed but after all hood beamed as for a larger ship milord i am so very happy with agamemnon for a shes the fastest twodecker in the fleet nelson rejoined proudly and as i have stated before milord no officer has ever been so blessed with such a talented chearly wardroom as i offered victory herself milord i would be forced to demur i cannot give up my officers and you lieutenant lewrie hood smiled pleasantly turning to regard him my condolences upon the loss of your gunboat zele no need to even muster a court once i read the accounts how do you keep young sir most excellently well milord your servant as always lewrie toadied to his patron taking a page from nelsons book on how to sound obsequious not that excellently from what he told me milord nelson interceded for him quickly outlining lewries plight regarding cockerel at naples and the time since and the refugees now gathering under his wing but i suspect lieutenant lewrie deemed his own problems too tiny to be of much concern given the circumstances which obtain you are too modest young sir hood grumbled i mind when your captain came aboard victory i gathered the impression hed been the one who had visited with king ferdinand and had spoken so eloquently for an alliance now i discover from captain nelson that such is not the case hmmm and for him to strand you bereft of any exchange of communications i once rewarded lieutenant lewrie well twice i have given him a command in as you recall nelson at your behest and in after actions in the far east so perilous yet done to a perfect turn i believe young sir that you may serve me best excuse me for intruding milord but i shall be going now sir william sidney smith butted in simply wished to thank you again for the faith you place in me which shall be amply rewarded with a conflagration so intense theyll see it in paris milord my word ont must not have a jot of brains in his head to rattle alan thought hes actually lookin forward to it howd our british cavalry miss recruitin thisun introductions were exchanged sir william given the briefest thumbnail sketch of lewries qualities and source of his patronage gad just the sort i need with me milord captain smith said with a toothbaring bray neckornothin stick at nothin fellow cry havoc and let slip the dogs o war hey mister lewrie oh bloody jesus meek an mild save me from this ill be good swear it never rattle another mort me entire bloody he prayed most earnestly i am heartily sorry i cannot oblige you in this sir william admiral lord hood said glancing at lewrie for an instant thankfully not seeing the shivers he fought i concur that lieutenant lewries courage would be of inestimable assistance to your endeavour but there are other duties i have in mind for him in this fell instance thankee god thankee milord bloody damned right there are after smith had bowed himself away hood turned to lewrie again there are ships in the inner basin lieutenant nighenough ready for sea this lieutenant de crillart of yours hed know them best with his men and yours you will ready one of them for departure warp her to the great road soon as you are able provision her and be ready to take aboard troops refugees or both i recall your own worth lewrie and ill no more toss you away than i would my invaluable captain nelson i fear this war will be much longer than any of us at the onset could have ever suspected england will have desperate need of you both in future orders will be forthcoming empowering you to provision and arm to your personal satisfaction mister lewrie you have but to present those orders which shall bear my personal signature and be assured that any reasonable request will be granted you instanter should i not see you again in the days to come before we quit toulon admiral hood said a bit sadly do present to me your compliments once you have attained gibraltar he offered his hand for lewrie to shake and i wish the very best of good fortune go with you sir god speed and fair winds thankee milord for your goodness to me alan said firmly as he shook that offered hand and for your trust i will safely bring away all you send me milord my dear lieutenant lewrie i rely on that steadfast promise just as surely as i expect tomorrows sunrise chapter zey are merde de crillart griped picking at the faded bulwarks of their ship ze discipline phfft an no one care to keep zem in proper fashion cep for mon alceste he sighed wistfully as his precious frigate began to make sail out past the log boom in the fairway for the gullet ragged her scratch crew was sloppy and uncoordinated as a pack of complete landsmen that was understandable for alceste had been requisitioned by one of the allies and now flew the sardinian flag at her taffrail gaff after conferring with charles bosun porter and a senior hand from the french sailors party hurriedly inspecting several ships in the basin theyd settled on a fortygun frigate an impressive ship to all outward appearances certainly not in cosmetics but in lines radical shed been renamed after the revolution but she had been commanded by a procession of jumpedup quartermasters and bosuns promoted to officers from the lower deck then shed been run almost by committee and the rights of man with but the easiest maintenance neglected by a vote of her crew shed rarely gone to sea and then only in fair weather and after the arrival of the royal navy back in august and the departure of rearadmiral st miens men radical had lain idle sternto at the eastern quays sandwiched in between other frigates and had slowly disintegrated as all ships will without reverent and daily care her bottom they could see was weeded but shed been careened and breamed in may and her coppering had supposedly been redone the uppr works were filthy and shabby her bold paint faded and peeling so badly that she looked more like a merchant ship than a frigate browned and seared stained and grey her standing rigging was still sound in need of slush and fresh tar some hauling at the deadeye blocks to set her taut once more running rigging had stretched or shrunk rope gone stiff and brittle but a quick reroving with fresh from the warehouses could renew that once they set to british sailors made half a days labour of what might have taken her french owners a week the important thing was that once swept fore and aft swabbed out and vinegared all the accumulated rat droppings spider webs and dust piles of trash and detritus overboard she would be roomy she would have bags of space on that long beamy mass deck to accommodate hundreds of refugees or soldiers for the short voyage to gibraltar should the winds turn perverse she had the waterline to make a goodly way closehauled the beam to survive rough seas especially as shorthanded as theyd be forced to man her and there was depth enough on the orlop to store saltmeats water casks wine and biscuit to feed a multitude for an entire month if need be and those saltrations already aboard were still fairly fresh so provisioning took less time on her than it would have aboard another ship guns lewrie was a bit worried about that aspect though being in a convoy with warships near at hand shouldnt present too much danger radicals former owners had been in the process of rearming with eighteenpounders to replace the twelvepounders frigates usually bore some guns had come aboard before work had ceased in august and shed been robbed of artillery since to augment the firepower of coalition strongpoints ashore as a consequence she had only four eightpounders on her quarterdeck and two long eightpounders on her forecastle as chase guns her main deck carried only a dozen pieces of artillery a pair of her original twelvepounders forward one to either beam and a matching pair aft beneath the quarterdeckand eight eighteenpounders four per beam fore and aft of the mainmast all spaced out so far apart they appeared as afterthoughts she was technically en flute a warship stripped of artillery to make room for the transfer of troops were her gunports to be opened the empty ones would resemble the ringer holes in a piccolo but that was alans intent in the first place another reason she was more suitable they could have taken others there were even larger fortyfourgunned frigates rd rate s with even more space aboardbut theyd demand a much larger crew to work them properly and some of those others had been in even poorer material state so emptied of guns and rations that it would have taken a week to prepare them for sea or were so weeded to the bottom of the basin so neglected it was a wonder they hadnt sunk at their moorings they chose her by midday on december and by dawn of the th had her ready to warp out of her berth set scraps of sail and work her out past the bombproof jetties carefully keeping eastrd of the shoal which ran from the west jetty to the narrow channel through the log boom by dinner they were anchored close to the waterfort of st louis beneath the protective shelter of fort la malgue theyd simmered up supper for their refugees the night before and had served a cold breakfast and dinner by then though nothing they could do by way of hospitality could really cheer those refugees chevalier louis de crillart had come aboard a lieutenant in command of a remnant of his royalist lightcavalry troop about a dozen men all told and their families there was a major de mariel whose vineyards and estate lay just a little east of fort st catherine an infantryman with wife and three children servants and their families and perhaps twenty of his remaining soldiers and their families charles de crillarts gunnershalf of them had wives girlfriends or kids some of lewries own british jacks had made the acquaintances of girls of their own and had snuck out to fetch them to the guardhouse onto radical before she even left the quays and theyd brought their parents and children or their friends as well after the greatcabins had been parcelled out to downattheheels aristocrats and royalist officers with families the wardroom dog boxes going to families and the warrant and mates quarters assigned to people with children he threw up his hands and let refugees simply hang blankets from overhead beams tack canvas to carline posts to partition off small areas of mess deck as cold and drizzly as it was lewrie might have to assign people to the gun deck with old sails stretched taut over the boat beams in the waist and let people doss down between the guns madame de crillart and sophie de maubeuge already had his sleeping coach louis and charles with two other single officers shared a stack of straw mattresses in the dining space and the day cabins were awash in once wealthy or once titled humanity mattresses luggage and children everywhere one looked he was crammed into the chart space finally after receiving two more miserable boatloads of royalists though not their piles of possessions and a reduced company of the th regiment of foot the royal irish he had to beg off there were nearly people aboard excluding crew and he didnt have room or food for a jot more where do i quarter my men sir the officer of the th asked weve space below on the orlop sir lewrie informed him a stores deck lieutenant uhm between kegs and such but kennedy sir the wiry infantry officer beamed one of those fellows lewrie could see at a glance who was able to abide almost anything with a smile upon his lips stephen kennedy he added shaking hands jovially yes the orlop we discovered all we wished to know and more bout the orlop on our bloody passage here bloody hate a sea voyage now were whittled down so well more room for the men below hoped to have the whole regiment tgether whats left of us but any port in a storm hey captain lewrie indeed sir alan smiled in reply heard any more how are things he asked waving towards shore buggerin awful if you ask me sir lieutenant kennedy grumbled with a scowl bloody damned dons bloody damned dagoes cut an run they did we were at mulgrave night o the sixteenth frogs broke through the spanish our captain connolly he rained us and a prettier setto a mans never seen sir held as long as we could but had to retire down to the shore and creep to balaguer an would ya believe when we got there the buggerin dons thatd run into the place took gods own sweet time to let us in sir so i gathered lewrie nodded latest now sir kennedy went on blowing his nose on a calico handkerchief we lost fort malbousquet and missicy damme he griped as a pack of children came tearing along the gun deck hallooing and yelping around and between them we were in town by then that artigues and the st catherine abandoned town malgue and western forts was the new line well the buggerin neapolitans sir just up an ran nobody firm at em yet just didnt want to be last into a boat i spose but by all thats holy off they went shootin in the very air at their own shadows moren like yelpin like hounds on a scent up and left missicy and thout missicy held the frogs could march on it and cut malbousquet off get into the town too i spose so out we had to march least im told we toppled the guns before we decamped them on the town sides could have held another day cept for our allies so the french have the western forts the powder mills fort millaud and all by now lewrie speculated thinking that anyone in mind to burn the french fleet was going to have a very hot time of it with french guns and sharpshooters that close to the basin far as i know they do captain lewrie but i doubt the frogs will be that active kennedy chuckled bless me sir but theyve an eye they see the writin on the wall us packin our traps and away all they have to do is sit back and cheer no sense in killin their own troops assaultin toulon when itll fall in their laps by tomorrow and theres few soldiers i know wholl wish tbe the last man to die just as the victorys won dye see so at least the fleet gets away safe aye captain lewrie kennedy honked again into his handkerchief see youre only a leftenant but i learned to call the skipper of a boat captain brevet promotion hey he cajoled getting chummy now sir when do we eat im fair famished an so are me lads wheres the officers mess and more important what do we eat sir where sir lewrie had to smile catch as catch can sir as for an officers mess weve not one the greatcabins and wardroom are bung up with refugees as for what lieutenant kennedy i sincerely hope the th royal irish is fond of saltbeef sir you just wont set a good table willya now sir lieutenant kennedy boomed heartily no port no biscuit nor cheese ah well oh dear god now theres a pair orareuns oh tell me ive a cabin man one tiny shred o privacy kennedy sighed looking with longing over lewries shoulder alan turned it was sophie de maubeuge with of all people the young phoebe on the quarterdeck above them chatting amiably almost in each others pockets peeking into a basket they bore between them i hate to further disabuse you sir alan grinned but the redhaired one is a vicomtesse and under the protection of her two male cousins meanest pair o blackguards ever you did see tother she is hmm mine oh buggeration kennedy sighed again told you i bloody hate sea voyages he stomped off bawling for his sergeant rufoote honking into his rag again looking for a dry empty spot alan took time to ascend to the quarterdeck to join them doffing his hat and making a formal leg bonjour mademoiselles might i say des plus belles mademoiselles msieur lieutenant luray enchantee sophie beamed dropping a graceful curtsy though sharing an impish smile with phoebe msieur alain enchantee phoebe said miming sophies graces but laying subtle claim to him by using his first name that tweaked one of sophies eyebrows in puzzlement lewrie compared the two side by side sophie was fifteen he knew and phoebe couldnt be any more than three or four years her senior he thought now that he had someone to compare her against he cocked a brow as well as if to caution phoebe to mind her manners round sophie who probably was in total ignorance of her newfound friends profession msieur luray nous sommes sur meesion of merci sophie said sounding more excited and happy than she had when last hed seen her you be so kin a phoebe

kneeling down to look at them knowing his face had gone all soft and goosesilly but he could not help himself oui i love cats jadore les chats he stuck a tentative hand into the basket wiggled his fingers at them two of the kittens were girls he discovered as he toyed with them mostly white with pale tannish stripes or blotches they shrank back to a corner behind each other little tails so very erect and blue kittencoloured eyes wide in fright there was a male mostly greytan tabby just as scared and there was the black one there was white on paws and chest white whiskers on his brows and chops his chops were white though his nose and underchin were black and a white blaze tapering upwards along the bridge of his nose to terminate between his bright yellow eyes he was the only one intent on lewries fingers shifting his eyes and head back and forth faster and faster to follow until with a manly little mew of delight he pounced tiny teeth and claws sinking in holding on as lewrie rolled him on his side so he could break away and awkwardly pounce back ow you little bugger lewrie chuckled i dare you to do it again like the finger want a wood shaving to play with hey the kitten

him on his upraised knee atop his cloak and began to stroke him which elicited another tiny mew as the kitten began to scale his cloak up to bat at a corner of his cocked hat almost fall off dig in and make another swat at it from alans shoulder he lost interest in that quickly to nuzzle and prod under lewries hair to sniff at his neck and go for an ear lobe as if it might be one of his mothers teats i really cant alan sighed wistfully once i rejoin my old ship my captain i shouldnt be tempted notre vielle chatte ze mozzer cat sophie de maubeuge told him as the kitten leaned far out to rub

noble grace striving for a gay air ve ave un chaton pour msieur luray mais trois bebes de plus switching to french only she swore she could explore the lower decks and find some families who might wish to adopt the rest graciously she excused herself insisting that it would be a matter of minutes only and that she would catch up with phoebe later they curtsied to each other and sophie departed phoebe tossed back the hood of her cloak to bare her head and leaned on the starboard bulwark arms widespread along the rails to gaze off at the brooding shrouded northern hills taking a deep taste of

entire world an now i ave ma grand amoureux comme amant tu crйe partout back encore an monte comme un ane comme le franchouillard mais le plus formidable im what he chuckled comment je ne comprend pas

until tonight nestce pas au revoir mon amour au revoir i would be most honoured should you be able to dine with me mademoiselle he said on public show once more doffing his hat to her and bowing her away she dropped him a rather good curtsy then fled bloody hell until tonight then he crowed in a secret mutter rocking on the balls of his feet bank on that ma chйrie chapter the last diners had been served the last families had slowly shuffled forward to the galley on the mess deck with poor pewter or wood messware soldiers issue tin plates and cups or aristocratic china with sterling silver where theyd eaten had been their problem to solve since there were too many for wardroom midshipmen and greatcabin tables for the pettyofficers messes but they had all gotten a full belly of boiled potatoes a quarterloaf of crusty dry bread a slice of cheese and a portion of saltbeef carved off hard joints and a halfpint of vin ordinaire so much shipping had mustered round fort st louis that they had moved radical in the late afternoon to a new anchorage close by the cape sepet peninsula just under the battery named the brothers waiting for the signal to sortie waiting for captain sir william sidney smith and his party and the spanish under admiral don juan de langara to begin the destruction of the french fleet there was not another inch of room in the great road seventeen spanish sail of the line and god knew how many lesser warships in attendance twentyone british plus frigates sloops and brigs of war and french warships taken from the basin commercedemarseille the magnificent gunned st rate the pompйe and scipion the frigates arethuse topaze perle aurore lutine alceste poulette and belette s proselyte mozelle mulet and sincиre both gunned corvettes and the gunned tarleton brigsloop all crammed together in the great road with a fingernails grasp upon france an anchors flukes binding them to the ground so many ships left behind but certain to be destroyed there simply werent enough men in admiral hoods fleet to man them all to provision them or overhaul them in time crammed too those french prizes were with french royalists in their thousands over alan had heard from the flag lieutenant whod come round just before dusk repeating the orders to be ready to weigh anchor once the fires were lit and over troops they had had all off now but a handful a rear guard at fort la malgue soon to scurry down to st louis at the base of the bluffs and take boats lewrie and de crillart stood on the quarterdeck apart from the other officers allowed on that hallowed ground serving officers from royalist units or the th foot a sprinkling of aristocrats or rich men whod snuck up anyway beggin yer pardon sir will cony muttered coming to their side uh me an th bosun need tspeak with you an mister de crillart sir shorthanded as they were alan had been able to promote cony to a position as acting bosuns mate porter came forward hat in hand knuckling his brow in salute yes mister porter ah capum porter frowned ya know that foot o seepwater we pumped outn er yesterdy right after we come aboard er well sirs hits back some o hit good christ we have a bottom left at all lewrie asked dumbfounded how big a hole would that take i ask you not a ole sir cony volunteered maybe lotsa litluns we sounded th well bout halfhour ago mister lewrie an she come

lightdraughted shed be fine suck in slowlike but this many folks an tonnage aboard full casks and all shes back on er proper waterline maybe an inchr two over hit we laded er deep sir i see lewrie fumed clasping his hands in the small of his back again and pacing off his sudden fretfulness nothing much we may do about it cant go back to the basin and swap for another can we now is she wormed and how badly aye sir porter confided first time we pumped her dry we checked and theys some soft patches sure but she was mostly sound at froggie bosun e told us shed been careened breamed an copper redone in may thought shed weeded too fast but i took mat for sittin idle stead o sailin hit off an then we found ese show th capum cony cony offered them a handful of nails to look over by the light of the binnacle lantern alan could see that some were copper and some were iron some were bent as if theyd been driven badly and pulled oh christ lewrie said sacrebleu de crillart moaned as right sirs cony agreed with a disgusted expression over shoddy workmanship aye they recoppered er but we foun these all mixed tgether so we think they got sloppy an used iron nails to drive through copper platin when they laid on fresh stuff sirs but evryone know copper an iron ensemble in seawater zey eat each ozzer de crillart cried merde alors i know ze peegs are lazy mais not not stupeed paysans connardes cons comme la lune zut an now some of ze copper fall away oui expose ze cloth anze caulking zat eez ware ve leak hein ils sont dйbiles uh yessir i guess thatd be hit mister de crillart the bosun

but some o th lowest down long th keel members looks like hit wuz a dirty job o work an they didn put much effort to hit scrimped on oakum and tar paying the seams mister porter aye sir damn my eyes lewrie spat putting a hand on his hip staring aloft then realised how foolish he looked right then we made four inches of seepage in well no yesterday noon til noon today and its almost he pulled out his cheap replacement watch to add up the hours but it had stopped buggery damned clock he grunted giving it a shake french i ask youoh sorry charles the forecastle watch bell chimed six bells of the second doghalfpast seven in the evening lets say thirtytwo hours to make four inches thats an inch in every eight hours do we work the chain pumps for say one hour every eight and should the seepage not get worse pray god we may be alright the hands though sir porter winced i know theyve enough on their plates as it is but we do have all this idle soldiery aboard the royal irish the french put it to em nicely and we could use them on the pump levers charles youre so much more diplomatique than i especially with your fellow frenchmen mm perhaps you might be the one to spread the word quietly daccord mon capitaine de crillart said with a wry look might let em drill a bit too lewrie decided on a whim get organised the major de mariel in overall command lieutenant kennedy and your brother as his captains it might keep them out of mischief and make em feel as if theyre earning their passage appoint some as mastersatarms too sentries like marines especially on the magazine and such found children dashing in and out of there this afternoon wild as red indians thatll spare our ordinary and able seamen french or british and our experienced landsmen too much work aye sir porter agreed i weel tell zem mon ami de crillart agreed damme leaks or no ill tell you all it feels mighty good to be aboard a ship again lewrie smiled revealing too much being too open for a proper captain but knowing that they felt the same way and would forgive his lack of august aloofness for he said no more than any of them might and thus spoke for them all eight oclock came and went full darkness the skies were now clearer the winds dryer though still cold they should be starting to burn the french ships he thought but there was no sign of that some brief firefly glitters on the hills around malbousquet from leguillette and balaguer bright brief little yellow sparks musketry alan imagined a fire or two in toulon proper sans culottes looting and revenge abandoned royalists homes being trashed there were redder longerlasting sparks now appearing to come from dubrun or millaud a faint drumming light artillery what the republicans could manhaul to the shore musketry sweeping slowly forward like a grass fire towards the arsenals the warehouses and the dockyards downhill from malbousquet and missicy from the heights above toulon nine oclock and still no signal to weigh anchors brisk little exchanges of fire even closer to the dockyards more light artillery winking amber from the shores ze end de crillart moaned at his side suddenly ma belle france pauvre france i see er no

the evening watcha matchlike tongue of flame appeared in the basin at last they were three miles or better away with the northern headland of the gullet between them and a clear view but it soared up over even that and the waters of the little road began to glitter like reflected candle flames through their telescopes they could espy tiny buglike rowing boats as black roaches scuttling over the road beyond the booms which guarded the entrance channel some hung up on the booms rowing furiously yet going nowhere more flames awoke from the arsenals and warehouses sparks arose borne on blackbellied columns of smoke from the slipways and graving docks where ships under construction were lit off like autumn bonfires as if awakened from slumber the republicans doubled then redoubled their fire the nearest hillsides the basin itself the headlands of the gullet sparkled with tiny flashes from firelocks and gun barrels light artillery began an unsteady drumbeat near misses by the rowing boats frothed feathers of spray and musket fire pattered a rainstorm about them now the fires were lit the french had an open field of fire and targets illuminated so well so close within range buhwhoom they felt that one in their bones radical shuddered seconds after to a shock wave so stupendous as a massive fireball a swelling and expanding miniature sun flashed into life inside the basin the arsenal and all its powder the powder removed from the forts went off sending debris and flaming embers soaring as high as the heights of pharon and stupefying people close to it friends or foes into awed silence guns fell silent musketry winked out all that could be heard for a time was the whooshing crackling distant roar of a monumental fire that threatened to devour the entire city of toulon the rush of wind as it was drawn in to feed the flames the fireship vulcan was a torch put to the closely packed french ships of the line laid across their sterns to set them alight from the aftermost corner of the starboard quarterdeck they could see rigging and yards aflame they should have been preparing to get underway but the sight of an entire navy being burned was too besotting gradually the blazing fireball subsided and smoke occulted their view lit only with sullen smoulderings at the base of the smoke clouds yet as the light faded the french guns opened fire once more well then lewrie said uselessly mister porter do you pipe allhands soldiers to the capstans topmen prepare to lay aloft trice up and lay out to make sail aye aye sir soldiers and civilians breasted to the bars began to trudge in circlespawls began to chunk and clack in the wellgreased capstans as the lighter messenger lines wound in dragging the heavy hawsers to which theyd been nippered barrroooommmmm another huge explosion perhaps even larger than the first hot wind coming from astern suddenly shock waves rushing across the great road radical not only shivered this time she heeled to starboard to the force of the explosion rocked and dipped her bows lewrie didnt think thatun had been planned exactly what in the world once the arsenals were gone contained that much powder a pair of prizes iris and montreal had been filled with the gunpowder garnered from the french fleet and the poudriиre the mills but they were to have been sunk surely no one in their right minds would fire them would they thousands of barrelsnot pounds of powderbarrels of gunpowder it was the largest blast he could ever imagine short stays sir cony howled from the focsle by the bower catheads heave you lubbers gracey goaded the refugee landsmen up and down the bower cable bowtaut a last heavyheave and the anchor broke free of the holding ground pawls clattered like the rapid clopping of a trotting horse aloft let fall focsle haul away the inner jib a land breeze one of mans devising the outrush of the fires found her canvas fore and main course foretopsl spanker and inner jib enough to give her steerageway ebony waters scintillating with flame points chattered and gurgled about her cutwater under her forefoot two knots at best she made ghosting past batterie la croix and the headland bluffs her shadow flickering like an errant moths on the bare crumbly land face out due eastrd to the bay of toulon aiming at cape de la garonne which could almost be seen as clear as daylight ruddyhued as twilight sunshine ahead and an amber and rose red glow astern spreading and growing an illuminated tinted woodcut from some germanic artists medieval hell or a glimpse down a volcanos seething throat round cape sepet sheering close as she dared to the shoals clear of the ordered files of warships farther out in the channel as they made their southing turning each in succession in lineahead hulls gleaming with ruddy unseeded sheens buff gunwales bright as ivory sails umber with the colours of a false sunset a sea breeze then a puff on the cheek a luffing aloft canvas drumming and fluttering squeals from blocks and parrels as yards were braced about pivoting on the masts as sails filled on the opposite tack vast heaving and belay well the braces well the sheets do you hear there larboard tail onto the lift unes radical lifted her bows to the first scend of the proper sea did a slow and regal rou to the first rollers that kissed her hull a little forward of abeam on her larboard side creaking and groaning timbers in adjustment masts and stays taking a new strain as a second nightfau of december found her stars appeared overhead to windward and the south thin rags of cloud far off simmered pale and indistinct and blue white to the north astern they were red above cape sepet and the peninsula there was red and amber a pau which cut off stariight and the signals cross stood on the highest hiu silhouetted on what appeared to be a tropical sunset as stark as his on golgotha well the lifts mister porter belay lewrie shouted down to his hands he walked back from the quarterdeck nettings to the wheel looking at the malevolence brewing astern like a witchs cauldron glad to be away in one piece to where he had no idea after getting this temporary command to gibraltar turning his back on their doomed adventure he faced forrud leaned over to peer into the compass bowl quartermaster steer sousouwest give nothing to leeward sousouwest it be sir nothin tloord it was dark before their bows and a cold sea guttered and danced on the faint starlight windrush across the decks a gentle keening in the shrouds and running rigging a weary deliberate movement beneath his feet as radical conformed to winds and sea the sluicing of ocean along her sides under her quarter a peaceful soporific sighing the way things ought to be lewrie thought for a time at least it was peaceful after such a dispiriting defeat chapter radical was weeded worse than they had thought she could not for all her elegant length of waterune or finely moulded entry make a goodly way weed barnacles algaelike green scuma peek overside from the quarterdeck hanging from the larboard mizzen chains on the windward side showed that her quickwork which should have been smoothjoined copper and paint was erose and irregular with natures seagoing pests weed waved like discarded rope in clumpy garlands up to three feet long and all of it save for the scum which thinned by morning of the th and no longer sloughed off as appetising morsels for the myriad of sea birds which swirled and mewed in her wake was so firmly attached that a seething run with sails set all to the royals would not have scrubbed even a portion of it off a ship as long as radical with feet of keel and waterune should have logged nearly ten knots under plain sail they were lucky to have averaged six and the weather had been just boisterous enough to force them to shorten sailfirst reefs in fore and main courses second reefs in fore main and mizzen topsls forget setting staysls tween the masts or freeing the gasketed tgallants they were too shorthanded plus there were the unpredictably perverse currents in the golfe du lion then there were fluky windshifts which had them at times closehauled beating into weather to make their southing time lost in tacking to keep other ships in sight neither lewrie nor de crillart could believe theyd made more than miles to the good since leaving toulon as for determining position the skies had gloomed up again after dawn of the th making noon sun sights impossible and had stayed grey and overcast rendering lunar or stellar sights hopeless too theyd fallen back on the old and inaccurate dead reckoningby guess and by godestimating progress on casts of the knotlog the th hadnt been so worrisome since there were many others in company and if they followed along like lambs tagging after the bellwether they couldnt go very far wrong so many captains and sailing masters all slowly trundling along in the same direction simply had to know where they were headed by dawn of the th though they were almost alone slow the lineofbattle ships might be sailing in rigid order luffing or backing topsls to keep their ordained separation in lineahead but they were faster manned well enough to take advantage of wind shifts there were two merchantmen astern about two miles off a brace of hired transports crammed with refugees wounded or troops straining to keep up flying more sail than the weather would really allow off to leeward on their starboard bows was another transport an unarmed hired horse transport with people in her stalls instead of chargers only one more ship was in sight far ahead hull down with only topsls and a lone tgallant showing making matters even worse now radical was upon the open sea her seams were working worse than theyd feared requiring a full hour at the chain pumps every six instead of eight their music to celebrate what looked to be a christmas day at sea would be the mournful clank and suck of the pumps and the irregular spurting gurgle of floodwater going overside could be worse lewrie reassured himself at least once an hourworse things happen at sea right count your blessings two more days and well be in sight of minorca the spanish balearics fall off loord and were between them and the spanish coast seamarks and charted positions again fishing ports to squeeze into if the flooding gets bad maybe not gibraltar but another blessing its warmer clouds or heading south and this soueaster out of africa and it isnt raining five more days maybe to gibraltar moneydraught from courts and mister mountjoy letters from caroline new clothes and seachest a slight change in radicals movements a soughing wallow with a slower rise of her bows to the next quartering sea he looked aloft to see the coach whip of her pendant change angle curl and falter a change in the wind not for the good damnit pardon mon capitaine lieutenant de crillart said coming up to him at the windward railings ze wind eez drop an back un point astern we shake out meezen topsl reef main course reef i ave you permission yes charles carry on lewrie smiled another blessing he thought to have at least one experienced watch officer aboard to share the quarterdeck with him though they were forced to stand watchandwatch of four hours each definitely not a blessing that scheduletrying to eat nap scrub up and pay proper attention to phoebe all in a mere four hours porter and spendlove to make a third hmm definitely a blessing though a girl willing to accommodate herself to his horrid backtoback hours affectionate enough to be supportive in those times when their privacy was interrupted and wit enough to understand that he had two mistresses one infinitely demanding to which she must take a back pew for a time precious few able seamen aloft topmen laying out to let fall a line of reefpoints landsmen and civilian volunteers on the gangways tending the braces in the waist easing clews hauling on sheets for a moment he wished he could dare let fall the tgallants but should it come a blow and in the mediterranean there was little time before squalls struck little warning the wind was already trending more easterly another fierce levanter on its way no they were doing the best they could with what little they had left to work with hed have to swallow his impatience and tread on the side of caution overpowered by a squall they could lose the upper masts in a twinkling broach her to roll her on her beamends or be driven under as too much canvas cupped too much wind and radical exceeded her ultimate hull speed damned galling alan thought moodily testy with himself for lack of sleep here we are one of the worlds handsomest frigates crawling along like a snail fair game for he looked around the horizon merchantmen were all he saw tired plodders wallowing along shorthanded packed with humanity who couldnt even begin to help their thin crews landlubbers whod more than likely never set foot aboard a ship before heaving their guts up helpless it struck him suddenly that they were the only warship present no matter how poorly armed no matter how shorthanded or so crippled by their own multitude of йmigrйs one just one republican frigate could gobble up every ship in sight fall upon them like a fox in the hen coop and have them all in an hour there were frigates corvettes even s which hadnt been at toulon scattered in ones and twos all over before toulon s surrender in french ports west of marseille and toulon perhapsnow at sea to see what they could eat like a pack of wolves on the hunt falling upon the slowest weakest oldest of a deer herd thats us by god he muttered pardon lieutenant de crillart asked now his task was done and he reported back to his temporary captain charles ive been a fool ive been remiss lewrie grimaced feelin too sorry for myself he scathed himself too defeated too busy bein a ferryman worried about leaks and weed to damme id more thought for another tumble with phoebe than i had for being a kings sea officer countin seconds til i can sleep again charles does a republican ship come across this miserable lot of barges were done for theyd have us sure as fate and take us as easy as a pack of sheep we should be doing some drilling at the guns organising volunteers getting ready for a fight putting together at least some means of resistance but to offer bataille mon ami de crillart shrugged ve are so weak an vis beaucoup de femmes et denfants aboard zey weel die uhm during ze bataille an they stand a better chance fighting for their lives than they do surrendering and being taken back to toulon to the guillotines charles alan said firmly men women and children chop resist though well enough and we might only lose a tenth not all and get away these other ships easy meat but us too tough to chew mmm peraps mon ami de crillart nodded slowly understanding coming to him look weve major de mariel and what about sixty soldiers alan enthused they could be our marines and sharpshooters gunners yours and mine not enough hands to serve the guns and tend sail but weve all these civilian men work as landsmen at the braces and such theyre already doing that some of em heave on the gun tackles too like landsmen in naval service run em out overhaul it only takes one guncaptain one experienced rammerman and loader per gun the rest are strong backs anyway bittfield and his yeomen below in charge of the magazine plenty of boys aboard to be powdermonkeys and shotfetchers we put out a hotenough fire a foe might sheer away from us and between louis men de mariels and the royal irish and the rest of the male civilians with guns should it come to a closeaboard fight ze veapons zough charles countered ozzer zan ze troops ve ave

chuckled clapping him on the shoulder most especial he helps them who got ready beforehand just in case he was short on miracles oui charles grinned an eet tak zeyr min off aving ze mal de mer daccord mister spendlove mister porter cony lewrie bawled suddenly come to the quarterdeck if you please god but it was disheartening they had beyond the muskets and infantry hangers lightcavalry sabres and such brought aboard by the soldiers barely enough cutlasses for the french gunners and his british jacks there were no boarding pikes at all civilians owned light hangers hunting swords aristocratic and elegant smallswords some older heirlooms among the elderlyrapiers and poignards or a fencing masters stock of foils and true йpйes doled out to others there were few french caliber st etienne muskets british tower caliber brown besses a handful of mod cavalry musketoons which fired a lighter ball as for pistols there were as many types and calibers aboard as there were adult males most gentlemen though had one or two pair and those were allotted to those without boys to serve as powdermonkeys that was no problem teens in plenty volunteered treating the whole thing like a lark men without any personal weapons commoners and shopkeepers the poorer class who had never hunted served in the army or dared aspire to fencing skillthey went to serve the guns mild and fubsy tailors chefs cobblers and domestic servants ended up with runout tackles traintackles and swabs in their soft hands or were taken over by experienced able seamen pressed as landsmen on gangways or in the waist there was eightpounder shot and twelvepounder shot in plenty for the quarterdeck focsle and foreandaft guns there were several casks of powder below but few madeup cartridges there were several bolts of serge for cartridgemaking but impressed silk shirts and gowns were commandeered as well bittfield and his yeomen were delighted to be in charge of a pack of women to aid them milliners dressmakers housemaids and seamstresses with a few elderly nearsighted males who had tailored for the quality giggling tittering chattering as gay as magpies sewing neat fine stitchesbut taking as long with each cartridge bag as if they were running up a new gown for some very particular lady patron for the heaviest armament though the massive eighteenpounders amidships there was only enough solidshot for about twenty rounds per gun shooting to one side only before they were exhausted grapeshot was almost nonexistent they could doubleshot the eighteens four times at the most musketshot and pistol ball was short so they had to satisfy themselves with scrap iron bent nails both copper and iron and the shards of broken bottles and stone crocks tied up in spare stockings in the eightpounders only radical had no swivel guns much to lewries great disappointment as the organisation wore on he felt like kicking his own arse time and again for those things which had slipped his mind when theyd hurriedly outfitted or those things which he had thought of by way of armaments but had consciously decided to forego deep below decks though the french gunners had discovered some shot for the eighteenpounders which had been neglected when radical had been stripped then abandoned chainshot elongating barshot and multiple barshot designed to take down masts and rigging the french were more fond of it than the royal navy it was their standard tactic to cripple a foe at longrange first destroying his motive power and the ability to maneuver or flee lewrie thought it was a waste of time and precious powder the results of the drills didnt enthuse him much either they worked without firing since they had so little powder to waste and it was a shambles people tripping over ringbolts in the deck tripping over tackles standing cunnythumbed and unknowing in the bights which in action when guns recoiled would have had their feet off standing behind the guns so please you totally ignorant of recoil at all one hour theyd drill then rest for half of the next whilst earnest gunners tried to explain over and over again how to do it safely and with the least confusion then back to the guns once more for another hour of drill trying to cram three months experience into their heads in a single day the soldiers were easier to deal with they understood crouching behind bulwarks and letting fly byvolley the bayonet the mкlйe few however were anywhere near marksmen their common practice was to line up shoulder to shoulder three or four ranks deep level their muskets in the general direction of the enemy aim for the breastplates close their eyes fire and hope for the best to work jn small teams aloft in the fightingtops firing at single targets was too much to hope for thankfully there were young aristocrats too well bred to stand in the line unless they were officers who were also sportsmen who took pride in their marksmanship with singleshot hunting guns or fowling pieces on a chase over their ancestral lands and who could with a few commoners whod worked as gamekeepers go aloft as sharpshooters and pick off a man in an officers uniform but they were painfully few they drilled for another hour took another tutorial rest period and then it was time to break and pump the bilges then serve dinner to all they had two more spells of drill in the afternoon until it was time to pump the bilges once more christ itll be hopeless lewrie thought watching them traipse away for a liedown or a sitdown trailing their muskets or swords more like walking sticks than weapons they were beginning to get an inklingbut only the barest inklingof what might be demanded of them like a brandnew warship just fittingout her crew as raw as a side of beef nowhere near ready to upanchor for weeks engaging in a first day of sailhandling trainingin the first hour of river discipline he crossed his fingers hoping against hope that theyd not come afoul of an enemy ship their best would be pathetic nowhere near enough lewrie put his head down on his crossed arms swaying against the quarterdeck rails over the waist boneweary his little enthusiasm had cost him two spells offwatch and it was properly de crillarts turn to go below it would be eight that night end of the second dog before he could let himself rest or even close both eyes longer than a blink sure enough eight bells chimed forwardfour oclock and the end of the day watch he thought of staging one more drill before supper but no his volunteers were by then too tired themselves too full of strange and new concepts not yet halfabsorbed more drill would put experienced impatient sailors too much on edge and the volunteers would rankle at the abuse which was sure to come then theyd learn nothing more this day might even bridle so stiffly some of the aristocratic ones that theyd have no more to do with it tomorrow or blithely forget the lessons of today let em rest he thought and dear god let me chapter alain a soft voice crooned in his ear he smacked his lips trying to ignore it sunk so deep in a well of turgid blackness echoing swirling feverdream deepness both unable and unwilling to move a single limb alain mon cerf formidable arise mon coeur oh god he whispered whats the time almos six phoebe cajoled softly but insistently ze aspirant msieur spenloov e sen down pour toi god lewrie reiterated flat on his back rubbing his eyes to pry them open there trouble did he say non mon amour phoebe assured him with a gentle kiss on his lips e say eet eez ze ten minute aprиs laubй ze dawn uhmm lewrie sighed trying to will himself to rise once he had come below hed fallen into an exhausted sleep almost face down in his soup gone back on deck at midnight and had left orders to be wakened around dawn no matter hed barely gotten his shoes and coat off before tumbling giddyheaded onto the bed cot putting his arms about her an instant before total dreamless sleep had claimed him maintenant ze cinq minutes ave pass right then he grunted letting a leg fall towards the deck he swung to a sitting position head hung in weariness that a sleep of an entire night and day couldnt cure i ave ze cafй trиs chaud et noir phoebe said perkily i know shes bein affectionate supportive an all he thought but damme its too bloody much cheerful too early for me she put the mug under his nose

lightermarked sisters whom phoebe had also claimed they were tumbling and pouncing each other all over the map table at that moment too busy to say bon matin scattering rulers and dividers almost upsetting the inkwell uhm thanks for the coffee phoebe he said as his thoughts began to trickle through his brain you must have gone forward up to the galley very kind of you merci bien pauvre alain eez leas i do pour toi she sat beside him almost prim though swinging her heels girlishly as they hung above the deck ver beau jour nice day i am sink i weel not ave to worry concernant toi visou you

yet seductive wan we arrivons а geebraltar zough now go speed oos zere i let you navire ave you until zen with an offer like that he could not depart without rewarding her with a passionate kiss and a grateful embrace a moments dally with the kittens and he was off morning sir mister midshipman spendlove reported crisply the dawn was at halfpast five sir horizon clear we logged six and a quarter knots the last two hours sir winds veered more southerly too so it doesnt feel like a levanter i think sir and you let me sleep twenty minutes past dawn when i left orders to be summoned at that time mister spendlove lewrie glowered still too testy to be approached uhm sir we tried to wake you me and the uhm mademoiselle aretino both sir spendlove blushed who the hells that alan wondered damme never even took time to discover her last name oh well my apologies for biting your head off then mister spendlove alan sighed bad as one of hercules twelve labours was it no error sir spendlove grinned shyly where away the other ships lewrie asked turning back to business one ahead sir shes topsls down now the horse transport down to loord must have hauled her wind during the night a point or so shes about another two miles off almost hull down the pair astern are about where they were last night sir might have lost some ground on us very well mister spendlove ill sail ho christ he said instead wishing his bladder wasnt full deck there two sail astern two points off th larbrd quarter hull down tgallants all i see you and the bosun have the deck mister spendlove lewrie inquired pray do you keep it a few minutes longer he took a telescope and went aloft the mizzen shrouds as high as the catharpings to peer astern three sail deck there three sail astern the mainmast lookout shouted down three sail all threemasters two points off the larbrd quarter he could barely make them out three sets of three tgallants on the horizon greyishwhite sails bellied full of wind radical rose on a wave giving him a slightly better view then dipped once more raising the horizon like a stage curtain the strange ships rose and fell also too far off to determine their identity but he could hazard a morbid guess the ships around him had been at sea long enough for pale white canvas to go mildewed and tan royal navy ships wearing their working suit of sails were usually amber or tan these ships though had not been at sea much hadnt exposed their tgallants to the weather they were nearly new and pale weather nowhere near boisterous enough for the heavyweather suit to be hoisted aloft too gusty for the tropical suit these were ships which hadnt been out of harbour in a while and three close together travelling in a pack or a squadron he feared they were french bloody hell he sighed to himself now what to do he snapped the telescope shut descended the ratlines to land with a final short jump to the quarterdeck mister spendlove well err on the side of caution dig into the taffrail lockers and prepare a flag signal for the other ships he directed first number ten followed by make all sail whatever that is this months book therere sea officers aboard to read em number ten sir spendlove gasped eyes wide aye mister spendlove enemyinsight short bluffbowed undersparred and terrified the merchantmen and transports tried to make more sail more than likely they had one poor overworked royal navy officer aboard assigned to a civilian master who possessed as few crewmen as he could scrimp and still work his ship under admiralty contract they had guns of course no ship put to sea unarmed but to work them to really fight back always sailing in large convoys or under close escort they were there merely as afterthoughts for most merchant ships in european water supposed to man to something close to admiralty standards paid to yet a prudent man would have let fall every reef let fall every topgallant and sail off and leave them to their own devices yet those ships were so jampacked elbow to elbow with helpless civilians alan could not abandon them there was precious little he could do for them either he couldnt fight one enemy vessel really and certainly not three radical didnt have the welldrilled crew to allow him freedom of maneuver to dance with the approaching foes and he observed most bitterly even had he attempted to run away he couldnt radical wallowed she couldnt pass seven knots in a full gale and the ships astern were gaining within an hour the three ships had sailed their topsls above the horizon within another hour the first sight of their courses as well stunsls which radical lacked spread snowy to either beam of their masts steyls between topmasts glittered fresh as newboiled bed sheets the transports astern had caught up by perhaps no moren a single mile strain as they might their own topmasts appearing to bend forward under the pressure of tgallants and unreefed topsls the horse transport down to leeward had made better progress now headreaching ahead of radicals bows sail ho god not another one alan groused where away fine on th starbd bows came the wail threemaster er tgallants only f r now a fine trap they laid lewrie thought massaging his brow in concentrated thought and fidgety frustration three to herd us one downwind to beat back and cut us off horse shit didnt even know where we were til dawn when they spotted us ahead of em horse transports hoistin an ensign sir spendlove cried in wonder and a private signal of course shes closer to the newun maybe deck there strange ship tloord the lookout shouted with sudden glee answerin private signal he called off a string of code flags that months secret recognition between ships of the royal navy lewrie flipped through his slim signals book they were correct deck there white ensign royal navy frigate white ensign a ship of admiral lord hoods fleet would show it since he was a full admiral of the most senior squadron or a frigate on independent service would fly it instead of the blue or the red of a lesser admiral mister spendlove hoist our own ensign and number ten he roared filled with immense relief help was at hand if the strange frigates presence didnt cow the french then at least should he be forced to engage he would have more even odds number ten twoblocked yonder the lookout bellowed she reads us sir dye hear there right then lewrie dared smile and clap spendloves shoulder glance at de crillart and the rest of the military men whod gathered together on the quarterdeck i think were going to be fine nother hoist sir the lookout yelled calling off a string of flags private signal spendlove opened his book thumbing through the many entries he had a short list of those vessels known to be in the mediterranean those further separated into rates scanning th rates took another fumbling moment to find the right handlettered page hed diligently copied out cockerel sir spendlove informed them at last hms cockerel frigate come to save us sirs a cheer went up from cockerels detached tars when that news was quickly circulated along the gangways down to the waist and magazines and for once it didnt sound the slightest bit derisive closehauled though she laboured within another hour she could be up to them with her thirtytwo guns primed loaded and run out just about the time the french squadron overhauled the fleeing merchantmen lewrie began to consider coming about then to offer battle he already flew a borrowed royal navy ensign and radical was a frigate by god at rangeofrandomshot who was to say that she wasnt a frigate in full commission propermanned and armed and spoiling for a fight quartermaster helm up a point no more he ordered give us a point free to leeward mister spendlove a signal to the ships astern of us direct them to pinch up aweather we will interpose our vessel between them and the french aye aye sir spendlove piped seeing the plan at once dashing aft for the flag lockers dont spose those are friendly captain lewrie lieutenant kennedy inquired hoping against hope and nervous about fighting aboard ship instead of on land where he knew what he was doing slow as we are sir lewrie scoffed gently and tagend ofthe fleet hardly ve steel offer bataille mon ami de crillart asked from the other side if we have to charles lewrie stated turning to face him and the rest of the officers major de mariel the chevalier louis and the senior gunners mates hopefully we will make a demonstration of force more than anything else with a royal navy frigate to aid us that might be enough now gentlemen raw as we are hmm lets not delay and do things in a lastminute panic let us go to quarters now uhm aux armes messieurs an agonizing quarterhour passed as the decks were sanded the water butts and tubs filled slow match ignited and coiled around linstocks coiled around the upper rim of the tubs the galley fire was extinguished the coals thrown overboard women and children trooped below to the safety of the orlop low near the waterline to huddle in between kegs and casks boxes and bales their chests and luggage at least radical would have an overabundance of surgeons the royalists were mostly people of the upper or professional classes so they had no less than four surgeons two physicians a dentist and several of those worthies personal servants as surgeons mates experienced with assisting their masters daily work for loblolly boys to bear the wounded below they had the leastuseful older gentlemen or the ones who simply could not grasp the fundamentals of artillery drill and some few stocky older women who were stronger than most of those men it was impossible to clear the mess deck though to empty that lowceilinged cavern of junk there were too many trunks and chests to carry below out of harms way too heavy to tote quickly there might be clouds of dangerous splinters flying there perhaps but with people at least herded below to the orlop lewrie thought the noncombatants would not have to face that danger the boats radical possessed and those extra cutters lewrie had brought along from their ferrying days already were astern under tow for the simple fact was that he hadnt had the labour available to retrieve them and stow them on the boat beams which spanned the waist one less source of splinters he thought grimly though through no forethought of his own british troops of the th the royal irish to larboard along the gangways major de marieps infantry and louis lightcavalrymen to starboard red coats and black shakoes on one side and pale whitishgrey coats with black cocked hats or blueandbuff coats with plumed blackleather helmets on the other the bowsings for the guns were cast off runout tackles overhauled in neat bights the guns were rolled back from the port sills tompions removed barrels checked for obstructions touch holes cleared by the thrust of linstock ends sharp enough to puncture cartridge bags gun tools were thrust into shaky hands and men stood atremble as if yesterdays drills had never occurred with stiffened rope rammers rope swabs crow levers wormers used to scrape out clogging scraps of powder and the buildup of gunsoot after a few firings or to draw shot nine men to each eighteenpounder seven to serve each twelvepounder and six for the lighter eightpounders those were the required numbers in the fleet though guns could be well served with slightly less under the circumstances they would have to be still not enough even with all the volunteers to man both larboard and starboard batteries at once ve load mon capitaine de crillart called from the waist he would be in charge of the gun deck since most of the guncaptains and volunteers were french mon maоtrecanonnier e sugges ze chainshot dabord not customary а langlais mais ve are ver good vis it zey are mos esperience tak down ze reeging crac an ve are not ze maneuverable nestce pas aye charles lewrie called back from the quarterdeck thinking it made good sense to render a foe as clumsy as they already were evening the odds dabord the chainshot barshot all of it cartouches de poudre the grizzled mastergunner demanded and a herd of boys emerged from the midships companionway hatch with wooden or leather cylinders which contained the powder bags the artillery was charged rammermen shoving the bags down the bores to thump against the rear of the breeches from the shotgarlands the guncaptains picked shot blunt iron cylinders cast in two halves linked by two bars between with eyes hammered round each bar elongating barshot which would fly apart to their full extent upon firing longer roundtopped bundles of castiron rods which would spread like spider legs to whirl through the air to rip away sails rigging and light sparsthat was multiple barshot and chainshot loaded as what appeared to be solid iron balls which became two hemispheres linked by a short chain that and the elongating barshot were the heaviest designed to take down a tgallant or topmast above the fightingtops to shatter even the stout coursesail yards alan had been on the receiving end of french artillery before and had never been that impressed with the concept never been aboard a ship really disabled by such ironmongery but de crillart and his mastergunner seemed confident about it the enemy have hoisted their colours sir spendlove was quick to point out all three ships had run up huge tricolour flags the one in the lead flying a smaller second one at her mainmast truck as well lewrie lifted a telescope and went to the starboard rails the lead ship was definitely a frigate the other two lieutenant de crillart could you join me on the quarterdeck for a moment he loaned charles the telescope dont happen to know them do you charles non i do not reconise de crillart intoned soberly mais ze frйgate eez ze trentdeux ze sirtytwo she weel ave twelvepoun canon an ze sixpoun canon de chasse et canon de gaillard quarterdeck ze ozzer two are ze corvettes vingt canon tweny ony eightpoun i sink only the man says lewrie snorted flexing his fingers on tiie wirewrapped leather hilt of his smallsword theyll be up level with us in about half an hour rangeofrandomshot whats that with barshot and chainshot a mile oui vis you frйgate out zere zough we not ave to bataille all at once mon dieu merci de crillart chuckled though his mouth looked a touch compressed and white alan took the telescope back went to the mizzen shrouds again and scaled them for a better view would they stay in a pack he speculated or would the easy pickings encourage them to split up radical on a slowly converging course to meet them on their windward larboard beam cockerel downwind but ready to slide along their starboard side or cut across them to rake the leader take us separately or together he couldnt suggest tactics to captain braxton he was senior on the scene and if he knew who i was aboard this barge alan thought in secret glee hed be even less willing to listen no hell keep simplicity in mind hes a cautious man eager to make a grand showing after ah these years yet hell not do anything too rash too risky pass them on the opposing back starboard to starboard then tack around the stern of the last corvette in line and rake her then une up behind radical to make a battle une he wondered if braxton thinks we truly are another royal navy frigate he might now what would i do were i the frog commander yonder claw upwind now he was dead certain hold the windgauge on the british and at the same time sail nearer to those panicky merchantmen threatening them force cockerel and radical to go about first to combine strength then force them to beat up towards the three frog warships to save the transports au during that long labouring approach fire chainshot and all hoping to disable the british frigates before battle was reauy joined the french would be faster they almost always were so they could outfoot them and neither cockerel nor radical could point any higher to windward than they could so it would turn into a long stem chase with even more longrange chainshot more chances to disable then gobble up hmm he sighed to himself rubbing his unshaven chin maybe i ought to come about go hard on the wind now be level with em or hold the windgauge myself draw cockerel to me if braxton wishes a name for himself hell follow along mister spendlove mister porter he bellowed from his perch hands to the braces lay her full and by on the larboard tack closehaul aye aye sir deck there cockerels goin about the mainmast lookout screamed his voice cracking a tone of wonderment in his voice which drew lewries attention aloft first before he turned to eye his former ship cockerel had been reaching across the wind now out of the soueast her bows pointing noreast to harden up closehauled would lay her just a little north of due east should she remain on the starboard tack with the wind across her right hand first sure enough she was foreshortening in the ocular of his telescope should have waited should have waited lewrie fretted growing uncertain of braxtons tactical skills harden up on the starboard tack first then cross the eye of the wind to larboard tack and beat up to me cross their bows before they get anywhere near you this early tack would put him a couple of miles away on the same course as radical but out of gun range damme hed done that before hadnt helast year that frog convoy and that big fortyfourgun frigate lay off and be safe appear like he was doing something positive but avoid action the shrouds swayed as radical leaned to the force of the winds decks and masts angling to leeward as she hardened up to weather lewrie had to take both hands to secure his perch to slip his arms in around the stays and ratlines for a firmer stance for a moment when he raised his telescope again cockerel had just completed her tack across the wind sails luffing and spilling shimmering like a heat wave in the ocular like bed sheets in a stiff spring breeze out on a line to dry before her hands could wheel her yards about haul taut on braces and sheets and kept on turning no you bastard lewrie muttered in surprise closehauled at least you for a hopeful moment he thought cockerel was just clumsy and slow every ship usually fell too far off the wind for an instant upon tacking before hardening back up to the proper course as close to the wind as she might bear but no cockerel kept on wheeling about her yards going farther round until they were almost endon to his view courses topls and tgallants bellying taut and full the profile of her low sleek hull entirely presented cockerel had come about ayetacked since it was the quickest maneuverand was now sailing westsouwest not to join forces with him not to stand off on a parallel beat downwind and safe she was running oh you bloody man you perverse bloody man didnt matter he grumped me aboard this tub nor anyone else least it aint personal the ah hed never know who he abandoned couldnt care less all his plans in shambles for the moment without a clue faced with the prospect of fighting those three french ships alone once more let down by his own navy you filthy bastard he yelled just for the temporary relief you bloody coward chapter calmly lewrie thought as he climbed down to the quarterdeck calm and deliberate theyre not navy theyre not used to my ways hands behind his back chin tucked in low eyes down in thought pacing to the wheel to look into the compass bowl for a moment his natural reaction so untypically english as charles pointed out would be to curse and rave gibber with anger foam at the mouth or fall flat on the deck and pound upon it which would set off panic by the bagful and there would go any thoughts of resistance from all his already barely willing volunteers what to do then he asked himself scheming in a fury conflicting notions at odds in his head hold this course keep the windgauge he turned to glower aft the two hired transports were astern just a little left of deadastern still running with the soueast winds large on the larboard side closehauling would make no sense for them they were on their very best point of sail already and to claw up to windward to try and escape made them slower their capture even more certain and sooner farther left and beyond were the french warships astern of the transports a little downwind of them sailing only a touch closer to the wind making rapid time even so they hadnt gone closehauled he frowned in puzzlement waiting another halfhour before they came level with em passed them really before they turned up towards them or tried to cut ahead of their bows and take them leaving it damned late when they could do it now another halfhour and radical would be so far to windward of the transports and the french no one could ever touch them though radical would have abandoned them letting them take the brunt of things like a sledge in a russian winter would throw meat scraps to slow down pursuing wolves throw out servants hed read yum yum hot and tasty stacked almost overlapping from his angle of view frigate in the lead echeloned down to leeward so each would have clear air on her quarter why to leeward he asked the aether more speed aye but for what purpose shouldnt they be rushing right at the transports and at him too beamreach in lineahead and still have clear air no blanketing damme he laughed of a sudden you greedy pigs the transports were meat on the table the french could scoop them up anytime they were standing on going for the horse transport and the tantalizing glimpse of that twodecker on the souwest horizon far ahead and suddenly it came to himthey would separate with cockerel running away the lead frigate would dash on overhaul the twodecker horse transport because she looked such a rich prize and leave the corvettes to face off with him then take the two ships astern bosun porter he called hands to the braces well haul our wind quartermaster new course souwest trim for a beamreach aye aye sir porter replied obediently yet sounding dubious as if he was of a mind that sailing high upwind was much safer radical came off her laboured beat sloughing and slowing yards reangled to cup the wind that now blew at rightangles across her decks those decks levelling as she sat down flat on her keel on the easiest point of sail and lewrie waited pacing aft to the taffrails then to the starboard gangway ladder over and over deck there the lookout shrilled a few nervous minutes later two chase goin closehauled astern lead ship standin on the frigate had left her consorts stunsls and staysls still flying tgallants and topsls bellied windfull the corvettes though had drawn level with the stern of the trailing transport and had turned upwind mister porter hands to the braces stations to closehaul radical had slowed on her beamreach the transports had made up some ground on her still labouring though about a mile and a half astern almost in lineahead behind her right you bugger stay greedy he sneered to the distant frigate standing on so swiftly so effortlessly swung away as she was towards the wind once more radical would soon have her abeam of her last position up to windward of the transports two or three miles of hard distance between the more powerful ship and where radical could be in ten minutes and the corvettes would still be to leeward of him too he waited a little longer fingers fretting against each other peering stoically at the frigate which was now off his starboard quarter now no not yet wait a bit breathe deep to shout no mister porter stations for stays he boomed at last ready to come about to the starboard tack mister de crillart secure your gunners all tackles ataut bowse the starboard battery secure manned porter screeched at last lewrie looked down to see de grillait give him an assuring fist in the air helm alee rise tacks and sheets slow a bit crank indifferently balanced with all the civilian stores put aboard catchascatchcan radical swung up to the eyes of the wind luffing and clattering groaning and complaining british men for the most part served the ship men hed drilled and trained aided by raw landsmen who were terribly confused by sailhandling much less the use of a foreign language but she came aboutcrossed the wind reluctantly she was about on the starboard tack haul taut now haul mainsl haul meet her quartermaster nothing to leeward for now mister porter well haul our wind soon remain at stations north by east she stood running almost a reciprocal course to the transports getting everything flaked down and sorted out sailors still ready at the braces and jib sheets driving for a moment within six points of the apparent wind rushing back towards the transports their combined speeds hauling them near rapidly new course noreast quartermaster helm up let her fall off four points no more trim for a reach mister porter then prepare to take in the main course suddenly after what had felt like hours of snails pace things were overlapping each other almost too fast to be dealt with leading transport on the larboard bows now dashing to abeam in the blink of an eye trailing transport coming up rapidly french corvettes beyond and still not near enough to ease off their beats to open fire just beyond the rangeofrandomshot radical slowing as she lost the drive of the main course the transports werent half a mile alee people cheering waving coats and hats havent a bloody clue he sneered but thankee anyway second transport huge twodecker working alive like a crowded anthill awash in people coming up fast her bowsprit framed in the foremast chains just over the larboard anchors cathead helm up quartermaster shave her arse ease her porter man for a gybe mister de crillart once weve gybed round the transport be ready to open fire on the nearest corvette with the starboard battery radical pointed herself at the transports sides changing the cheers to cries of consternation for a moment abeam of her passing close jib boom aimed at her quartergalleries and stern the helmsmen judging it to a nicety of perfection to dash almost under her counter and transom using them as a shield a fence between radical and the corvettes ready to wear ship he called main clew garnets buntlines spanker brails weather main lee crojack braces haul taut the transports stern was a pistolshot away before the mizzen chains a seconds more separation then up mainsl and spanker clear away after bowlines brace in on the afteryards up helm lewrie yelled on tiptoes with excitement around radical came again balky and truculent even slower than shed been to tack without the main courses power yet trimming about her crew throwing themselves upon the proper rigging from long training round she came until she lay with her bows due west gunports coming open gunners hopping about to remove quoins below the breeches for maximum elevation shimming them up again as they aimed a touch at a time preparing to concentrate their fire on the leading corvette the one nearest them about a mile away still closehauled prйparez tirez de crillart shouted waiting for the uproll radicals starboard broadside went off as one twelvepounders firing solidshot the eighteenpounders spewing disablingshot gigantic gushes of powdersmoke wreathed her to be whisked away to leeward thinning out as her shot neared the target shrieking and wailing as they flailed in the air tumbling and spinning they threw themselves on the guns to swab out clear the vents directing gawping civilians to keep their eyes inboard on their work for their very lives only the senior gunners knelt to peer out empty gunports to see the results linstocks at their sides jammed in the deck by the sharp ends like ancient spearmen powdermonkeys scampered up with fresh charges loaders hefted more disablingshot well damme lewrie gloated as the corvette was struck struck for fair she seemed to quiver from masttrucks to keel as that flailing slashing ironmongery amputated her foreroyal mast tore away her foretgallant yard sliced through fore stays and jib halliards spilling everything forward of the mast into a sagging ruin and tore gaping holes in her foretops and course spilling their wind those ravaged sails ripping open tearing across as far as the boltrope edges you see mon ami de crillart crowed now encore guns charged and shotted run out through the ports cartridges punctured and vents primed slowly clumsily guns squealing and complaining on their low trucks tacklemen taking foreverone side of a piece hauled too forcefully the other too weakly jibbering them about before the ports as if they were iron mastiffs hunting for a scent the corvette had fallen off the windhad to fall off with her windwarddriving jibs gone all unbalanced she showed her profile but also began to display a line of open gunports parallel to radical quoins inserted deeper this time lowering the aim of the barrels gunners shouting and babbling waving their hands to instruct their raw assistants to shift the lay of the guns with crow levers and handspikes to right or left then the excess crewmen were hustling away to avoid the recoil the roar and the stink after overhauling the tackles a last onceover then matches were blown on lowered near the vents on the uproll tirez another brutal clap of sound another howling broadside guns rolled backwards to snub on the breeching ropes making the stout bulwarks cry rope groan iron ringbolts squeal they juddered and they reeked some slewed offline gushing thin trails of spent smoke and their frigate shaken to her heart by the force of the runback a moaning in the air a shrill shrieking as roundshot returned towards them dull thuds splashes alongside towering over the bulwarks iron ball flying across the ship sizzling sibilantly crisp bangs up above where the furled maincourse yard was struck one end turning to a shattered stub as the ball glanced off the corvette twitched anew her mainmast struck this time more destruction rained down from aloft onto her decks to dangle in her overhead boarding nettings there was a hole in her spanker where barshot pierced it a handful of men in her mainmast fightingtop spilled out by a whirling multiple barshot her main tgallant mast above shook then slowly leaned forward under the press of the wind as upper shroud lines parted the crosstree braces shattered more fire was returned raggedly as if in retribution a shot screamed over radicals quarterdeck slapping a hole in her spanker just over lewries head forward the starboard gangway bulwark caved in as an eightpounder roundshot pierced it making a rent about two feet across and the air was awhirl with jagged oak splinters three french infantrymen standing behind the rent were ripped away tossed over the rope railings into the waist onto the gun deck riddled with wood and iron shards another ball struck lower down below the gunwale with a dull thonk creating wails of sudden terror among the noncombatants on the orlop deck a third hit a closed gunport behind which tacklemen were sheltering waiting for orders to throw themselves on the guns once more there were screams of pain and disbelief as two volunteers were cut down cries from a dozen more throats as they beheld the ruins of men twitching and thrashing bloody at their feet lieutenant de crillart and his senior gunners were there in an instant to shout them down shove them back to their duties urging them to be brave no longer gently tutorial the time was past for that loblolly boys lewrie shouted directing the pasty wheyfaces framed in the midships companionway hatch help em damn yer eyes the dentist appeared seized the one at die top of the companionway ladder and dragged him out they skittered fearful as low as hounds to the decks following him with a mess table turned into a stretcher three men were dead abandoned round the base of the mainmast while two who screamed and wept were carried below to whatever further horrors awaited them at the surgeons hands the range had closed to about threequarters of a mile alan took a quick look astern for the second corvette she was coming on still on the wind bows pointed almost directly at him there was a bloom of gunsmoke from her larboard forecastle chase gun still about a mile off he decided still time to hurt the other even worse hit her again charles rip her guts out he shouted hurry shocked as they were though the gun crews hadnt much hurry in them a wellserved artillery piece could average three rounds in two minutes in royal navy practice these poor fellows were lucky to get off one in a minute and a half the corvette managed to fire again a ragged stuttering broadside more shot coming for them trembling volunteers flinging themselves flat on the deck to hide from it radical quivered as she was struck twice thrice then thrice again not bad shootin lewrie thought for a crew whod been in port so long without much chance for livefiring practice quivering in his boots himself willing himself not to flinch or duck damme there was a crash above his head a groan of livened timber and he looked up to see their mizzenroyal and tgallant masts shot away to come down in a spiral like a badly sawn tree ware below he shouted scampering aft away from its arrival jackknifing upon themselves the masts dropped trailing rope rigging and furled canvas yard ends flailing blindly ripping across the face of the mizzen topsl before the entire mess speared into the deck just at the forward edge of the quarterdeck hung up by the broken spars on the nettings over the waist down with it had come two topmen and one of the aristocratic french marksmen from the fightingtop cut it away sir spendlove yelled through chattering teeth at his side no men to spare lewrie groaned no leave it but see to the men who were aloft aye sir spendlove nodded his eyes wide but he dashed off on his errand chivvying loblolly boys to their ministrations prйparez de crillart screeched from forward and below ordering his spare tacklemen away to the sides tirez slow they might be quaking and gulping hot bile in near terror but the gun crews were still slaving away sticking to it like men a broadside lashed out and away ordered controlled and well aimed by the steadiest older men eightpounders yapping twelvepounders erupting in harsher barks and the four eighteenpounders bellowing almost going off as one immense avalanche of noise fired on the uproll when the ship would hang pent for a breathless second of steadiness the french corvette took the brunt of it as the sea beside her frothed with near misses and ricochets from the lighter guns heavier twelvepound roundshot tore through her sides this time flinging bulwarks and scantlings into trash flicking planks into the air and her mainmast was shot away completely it was shorn off halfway between gun deck and fightingtop that massive trunk carved in twain it jumped hung suspended for a second upon the very air then the shattered butt slid forward and it teetered halfturned and fell to starboard and all above it came crashing down in disparate bits the fightingtop to hammer itself onto her starboard gangway crushing everything beneath its brutal weight she showed her coppering as she rolled and rocked cheer lads cheer lewrie shouted encouraging his english sailors charles vivats vive what you call em make em yell and cheer look what they just did the poor scared buggers he thought aye cheer you bastards put some heart in yourselves at last you can do it if you try for a moment they gaped in total disbelief then began to yell to throw their hats in the air clap each other on the back embrace and buss in gallic fashion and exult not navy practice is it alan asked himself with a smirk but they needed that now maybe theyll have more confidence now just where do we stand he wondered peering about he went to the side to look out with his telescope past the ruin of the corvette which was sagging down to leeward all her masts and sails trailing over the side and acting like a sea anchor she wouldnt be going anywhere but round about in circles for a while not until they hacked all that loose and without replacement upper masts and mainmast nowhere very quickly for some time after either with only her mizzen standing the frigate the most dangerous warship present had finally put about taken in her stunsls and staysls and was close on the wind on the larboard tack but she was at least four miles down alee and four more miles farther to the norwest to beat back to radical where she was at the moment would be the better part of an hour since she would have to tack first and lewrie was mortal certain hed not be anywhere near his current position when she arrived the second corvette had fallen off had hauled her wind a little below the ruin of the first as if she were about to go alongside to aid her she was less than a mile off still on radicals starboard quarter no not to aid lewrie sawto shoot her gunports were open already blossoming with orangey flashes and gushes of smoke feathers of spray leapt into the air astern glass and transom wood shattered as roundshot lashed her stern a portion of the taffrail went flying and one of the lanterns burst asunder cease fire cease fire he directed mister porter lay us on the wind man the braces and sheets ready to haul taut quartermaster helm alee lay her full and by full an by sir aye the senior man grunted already heaving on the spokes hed whittled the odds down thoroughly disabled one corvetteand most importantly placed himself so advantageously that the frigate might have to spend the rest of the morning to catch him up and closehauled radical would all the time be driving roughly sousouwest to the balearics into shelter into the patrol areas perhaps of spanish warships which might aid him no he thought lets not be greedy ourselves get back up to windward draw this last one after us if he wishes i think we might run him a decent chase he follows us the transports get clean away too if he follows with a shrug he realised that the corvette and frigate might be more amenable to going to the aid of their crippled consort or bagging the transports after all and letting radical escape too tough a bone to gnaw realising too that hed shot his bolt in essence fought and won without getting his precious civilian charges slaughtered by artillery and swordswinging boarders well not too many he amended yet what if they went after the transports at least aye ive saved most of my own but those others are just as full of йmigrйs just as packed with women and children can i turn a blind eye perhaps i must every man for himself now and save what you can the corvette astern turned back onto the wind barely a minute after radical had altered course this put her from lewries view by the wheel just atop the starboard corner of the taffrail bowson to him heeled hard over as she laboured for every last inch of windward progress she got a gust he saw a puff of wind that he did not and she pinched up higher as that gust backed clawing out ten yards or so mister porter i think were ready to send the topmen to loose the fore and main tgallants lewrie ordered then checked himself aghast and let fall the main course let fall and sheet home he flushed with anger that hed been so remiss so muzzy without sleep as more canvas appeared aloft radical heeled further over and began to surge hobbyhorsing over the waves casting first her bows then her stern towards the sky spray began to dash alongside droplets wetting the starboard gangway mister lewrie sir cony called appearing from below got a leak sir starbrd side forrud betwixt th cathead an fore chains think we got hulled by one o their shot bad he muttered on this tack aye sir cony winced suckin water like a drain got a couple o chairmakers down there nailin on a patch tslow hit down but we need to fother a patch from overside theres nigh on five inch o water in th bilges now an its climbin an the seamsre workin o course but thats nothin new sir but i spects longz we beat twindward sir theyll work arder need tpump soon sir a hole in her quickwork starboard side heeled over starboard toothat would practically shovel water into her and shed flood forrud when what she needed most of all closehauled was for the bows to ride high and light over the water reducing the effort which went into beating should her bow end get too heavy shed slough in and snuffle all the fineness of her entry and forefoot cancelled out tell mister de crillart to secure his guns for now lewrie decided after a moments thought work the forrud chain pumps maybe some will trickle past aft and tell mister de crillart to send men to the quarterdeck well shift two of the eightpounders rightaft to the taffrail for sternchasers maybe raise her bows a couple of inches and take some pressure off the shot hole fother from inboard spare sail and bosuns stores once your chairmakers finish their plugs aye sir there was a rustling in the air an atonal whistling that rose up the scales then roundshot cracked overhead to sail past and hit far up to windward on the larboard side the french corvette had her bowchasers working radical heeled a little farther and slowed watch yer luff lewrie said rounding on the helmsmen wind veered ahead sir adda bear off the senior hand replied working on a massive tobacco quid gazing aloft as he regained the spokes hed lost sailing most intently by his luff and the devil with the compass at that moment course did not matter but the very razors edge of the apparent wind where lay safety in both speed and windward advantage did another shot from the corvette astern this time pocking a hole in the main topsl as gunners loosed one of the quarterdeck eightpounders from the breechingrope ringbolts and laid on block and tackle to a fresh set farther aft tethered like a trussed hog the cannon must be restrained moved gingerly from one lashing to the next before being sited at one of the pair of sternchase gunports in the taffrail the french corvette reached the point in radicals wake where the wind had veered ahead she wavered fell off perhaps a point no more and sailed through it pinching up once more as the wind steadied pinched up higher luffing up a touch trading forward progress for another ten yards uphill to weather she was headreaching them and she was faster lewrie realised by the time the first gun was ready at the taffrail and the second began to be moved larger she loomed back there framed now from the wheel squarely in the center of the taffrail shed gained about one hundred yards in a little less than five minutes threequarters of a mile lewries mind creaked over his sums two thousand yards to the sea mile five minutes to make an hundred so shell have her jib boom over the rail in a little over an hour a horrible harpylike ululation came up from astern there was a crash forward aloft the main tgallant yard shattered lee side draping like a broken wing multiple barshot maybe less than an hour he sighed softly sensing defeat at last goddamn fool could have stayed to windward run never took time to fight gave up a mile advantage to windward for nothing le canon il est prйparй capitaine a french gunner called out patting the breech of his eightpounder nous tirerons oui tirez blaze away lewrie nodded too spent to care the gunner directed his small crew to charge to shot to runout he knelt hopped fiddled with the quoin had it spiked to the right a touch then waved the men away he primed waited then lit it off with a sharp bang the eightpounder reeled inwards a waterspout leapt up to the right of the corvettes bows close under her jib boom and bowsprit lewrie watched groggily detached and above it all there was a chance he was sure that their sternchasers might damage the french vessel enough to slow her to rob her of just enough speed to reel out this pursuit til nightfall late afternoon should fetch minorca under radicals bows did god grant them just a morsel of luck the corvette fired in reply both her bowchasers barked together this time so near was she to being dead astern framed on the very last vestige of his ships foaming spreading wake one ball flew high low above the starboard gangway to smash into the forecastle bulkhead up forward the second slammed into her transom again low down below the wardroom windows there were muffled screams below if the surgeons had been using the midshipmens berth the cockpit as their surgery on the orlop those were womens screams just as easily the corvette could pick her apart too shoot radicals rigging to lace and slow her down rendering her helpless then surge alongside cannon blazing pointblank boarders ready strike the colours he mused surrender to the inevitable then those french boarders those revolutionary republican men with steel in their hands and blood lust in their eyes would murder everyone aboard soon as they found out what his passengers were and cheat the guillotines british sailors could expect no better treatment either theyd butcher and slaughter as merciless as pirates those victorydrunk vengeful french republican sailors niceties of nationality bedamned for a stark moment of bleakness lewrie looked upon his death as a given an inevitability soon to be realised outrunning them wasnt in the cards one more wellaimed shot could end it all and render his ship as crippled as that first unfortunate corvette god a little help here im runnin out of options he prayed havent a bloody clue what to do next shot my last bolt so weary i cant thinkl got a storm in your pockets a slant of wind another roundshot sighed in singing a piccolo tune smashed into the transom again blowing a cloud of splinters aloft from starboard as it demolished the wardroom quartergallery he surprised himself when he snickered aloud at that thankee god already scared so shitless and here they just blew out the jakes strike stand on clueless or fight mister spendlove oh there you are lewrie said of a sudden turning away from his fell musings right then summon all the officers foot horse and marine weve some scheming to do chapter we are too slow lewrie announced amidships of the quarterdeck nettings looking down into the waist at his assembled crewmen and lieutenant de grillait translated for him phrase for grim phrase we cannot outrun her we cannot strike our colours either and surrender you know what that would mean for yourselves and your families as that was turned into french he peered into their bleakset faces lips compressed and mouths pale women and children had come up from the horrors of the echoing drumming orlop drawn by the cheering and the lack of dangerous noises which had followed the absence of broadsides being fired guntrucks thundering and squealing a bang or two now and then from far aft the keen of roundshot from the frog corvette was nothing in comparison they too stood with faces grim some whimpered cooed to vexsome querulous children dandled babes in arms who sensed what was to come without waiting for a translation they stood with their men where they could those who still had men listening as lewrie stood foursquare above them delivering what even he thought was a whistling past the graveyard peroration roman legions got perorated before every battle to boost their fighting spirit alan recalled from translating so many of them in his schoolday latin classeswondering if his was on a par with the ones delivered just before lake trasimeno or crassus before his army was wiped out at cannae the royal navy frigate put about to summon help he lied with a straight face unable to tell them they were beyond aid the french frigate downwind yonder is too far away to matter this last enemy vessel pursuing us is our greatest danger while charles turned that into french he looked alee raising his eyebrows in perhaps the only delight he could discover the enemy frigate was too far downwind dithering shed come hard on the wind on the larboard tack for a time clawing her way south but had gone about to starboard tack to take a look at her injured consort before hardening up once more shed abandoned her pursuit of the twodecker on the horizon and the horse transport and was now approaching those two transports lewrie had earlier used as shields content with taking something at least after a frustrating mornings work that put her five miles alee instead of four and a full hour away even should the transports strike to her at once ahum charles prompted with a fisted cough drawing lewrie inboard once more they have welldrilled gun crews we do not alan continued pointing astern as if in punctuation two roundshot droned overhead making everyone duck and cringe we cannot stand beam to beam and trade shot with them but he cried leaning one hand on the net and light wood railing above the tangle of fallen mizzen topmasts and pointing at them with the other you have defeated one ship and you will defeat this one we will close with her they will not expect us to do that we will lash to her and we will board her we have men of the th regiment of foot the fearsome royal irish among us among us we have brave infantry royalist infantry gallant cavalrymen and we have hardhanded men of the french royal navy and best of all my british tars shoulder to shoulder with their cutlasses they may cut and slash their way to the gates of hell may the devil himself take arms against them right i dont believe it either alan groaned to himself seeing what little encouragement the french civilians felt to his bloodthirsty promises his mounting harangue they looked like bored voters and when we board her lewrie concluded you courageous gentlemen of la belle france you must strike them down sans mercy it is your blood or theirs we must conquer them or they will conquer you when the time conies fearless gentlemen of france bloody toadys what you are me lad he thought in spite of all strike for your beloved murdered monarchs strike for your nation strike for your honour and strike lewrie softened from a hoarse shout to a voice they had to strain to hear for the lives of your wives your children your dear ones strike to protect the helpless babes put your own lives at risk and fight like true men stead of kneeling like whipped animals at the foot of the guillotine he paused seeing some steel appear in their eyes some heads up more erect and some trembling like treed cats with tears upon their cheeks faces twisted with impending grief and fear into death grimaces we dare all he called loud once more we will fight as men if we die as men we die on our feet not on our knees they those revolutionaries astern of us have only their hatred to die for where are their families where are their convictions be ready the two sternchasers went off with a close double bang to end his peroration and a thin cheer from the gunners aft whod finally hit something said more than anything he could further compose he looked to madame hortense de crillart beside her son louis trying to be as brave as a spartan matron whod send her children off to battle urging them to come home with your shield or on itdead before dishonoured sophie de maubeuge stood trembling with her eyes wide in fear eyes only for charles phoebe aretino not too far away from them among the lowerclass dependents and the few suddenly widowed or orphaned therefore shunned as if it was catching the ladies must go below once more out of harms way see to your children and each other be as courageous as your menfolk will be lewrie turned away to stride to the wheel and look aft at his foe she was up within a half mile of them by then edging even more upwind of radical he could see down her starboard side magnifique mon ami lieutenant de crillart said coming to join him ve franзais trиs dramatique hein i add to you speech pardon ony un peu now vot ve do to defeat zem frankly charles i havent a bloody clue lewrie confessed ah the corvette would have to swing off the wind and lose all the progress shed made upon them if she wished to employ her main artillery to swing up harder to the wind would put her inirons so it was not the starboard battery which he could see that would be the threat she could fall off haul her wind slew about briefly and touch off a broadside from her larboard battery before coming back to fullandby but that would sacrifice her slight and hardwon windward advantage and perhaps an eighth of a mile of separation which she would have to make back up shell stand on as she is lewrie muttered aloud quarterhour more and shell be upwind of us bout an hundred yards or so and off our larboard quarter that is if they dont shoot something else away from our rigging beforehand ze wind an sea charles pointed out with a sour shrug a drop in the wind a calming of the seas neither vessel hobbyhorsed any longer cleaving smoother paths that was advantage to the french they knew they would have less wave resistance could go faster to windward and pinch up to gain even more windward position without a heavy quartersea butting against their bows when they did so and it would make their fore deck a much less boisterous gun platform so their aim would surely improve prйparez tirez one of the french gunners called out to his men the larboard upwind sternchaser barked hourra le coup au but he crowed in triumph oh well shot lewrie exclaimed the eightpounder roundshot had hit along the starboard side fine on the bows among the pinrails for the jib sheets right next to the starboard bowchaser men had spilled wounded or frightened from the gun and the corvettes jib sheets had been set free the taut ellipses luffed and spilled wind flagging to leeward bulging flaccid losing their knifeedge tautness inner and outer flying jibs and fore topmast staysls balanced a ship working to windward gave her the foreandaft drive to lay her there slicing the apparent wind without them she would have to fall off square sails no matter how braced round could never drive a ship that close to the wind the corvette slewed indeed heeling farther to starboard for a moment her helm down to keep what they had for a second it appeared she might round up higher yielding to weatherhelm but she did fall off at last as men raced to control those sheets haul them flatin and belay them once more but when she settled under full control she was deadastern her windward advantage had been lost a quarterhour to close to musketshot but lewrie grinned that closeaboard dead in my wake he schemed lets say we haul our wind give him the starboard battery a pointblank broadside no hell take it then rush on past our stern id have to fall away almost dead downwind to fire and thatd lay our stern open for her to rake us that didnt sound promising a sternrake would expose everyone below everyone on the gun deck to roundshot bowling through the thin transom timbers the greatcabins and wardroom the orlop cockpit an avalanche of iron tumbling and ricocheting along her entire hull the roundshot caroming from the thick hull timbers contained within there could be fifty sixty dead and wounded in a twinkling all his precious fighting men women and children too best take it abeam lewrie thought radicals a fortygun frigatebuilt to take twelvepounder fire reenforced to take eighteenpounder shot itd make sense for them to stiffen her to take the recoil of her new gun batteries if nothing else i can stand her eightpounders a lot easier than her timbers could my shot even hull to hull or not take her fire at all bowrake her let her stand on as she is and lewrie almost squirmed with hopeful expectation quartermaster aye sir let her fall off slowly very slowly lewrie commanded a half a point no more give it up spoke at a time haul our wind sir the helmsman yelped turning to look over his shoulder at him for a dread outraged instant before discipline and years of training to concentrate aloft and nowhere else took over aye aye sir he said at last returning his concentration to the coachwhip of the pendant overhead the luffs of the mainmast sails he eased the helm a single spoke then began counting to himself under his breath before hed yield the second alain pourquoi de crillart demanded similarly outraged why to have the bastard charles alan replied almost gleeful to have the bastard mister porter come to the quarterdeck aye sir porter said hat in hand leak sir they be nigh to a foot below now if thats wot yr askin bout mister lewrie mostly aft lewrie asked with a chuckle well aye sir porter rejoined seeing nothing humorous about their predicament wot got past th forrud chainpumps thatll make her quicker to come about the bows light and the stern heavier lewrie nodded seeming pleased when i give you the word mister porter i want the hands to brace her round like we were tacking before that just before i want everything aloft scandalised brailed up damned sharp in spanish reefs then belayed before every hand takes arms ready for boarding he glanced astern as the corvettes bowchasers were got back in action barking shrill as terriers we might have about ten minutes mister porter i wish you to be ready with at least four grapnels two lightuns for tossing when i give you the order and two more on heavier lines three r fourinch manila that can take a strain about half a cable each for the heavy ones ready round the capstans fore and aft got that aye sir i think so scandalise brail up the first order stations for stays the second two light grapnels and two heavy to the capstans then allhands to the gangways as boarders until the heavy grapnels are across and a strain taken leave a crew at the capstans mister porter three men each even after so we stay put more important she stays where we put her aye aye sir porter agreed though mystified im giving her the windgauge porter lewrie explained with a hand on the mans shoulder shell take it certain then when we are too close and shes going to shoot us to flinders well brail up and slow down like we just threw over a sea anchor tack right up inirons across her bows and grapnel to her with our guns charles he said turning to look at de crillart with our guns aimed pointblank in a bowrake and none but her bowchasers able to bear upon us and major de mariel he called letting porter go then your sharpshooters will clear her fore decks and we will board my sailors first with pistols and cutlasses and the heavy grapnels then lieutenant kennedy your company after us cover my men with volleyfire whilst we affix the grapnels after that gentlemen itll be bare steel and devil take the hindmost then we all board her over her bows to support my sailors and lieutenant kennedys th foot to take her gentlemen to take her before she can hope to take us a fight to the finish toe to toe and no quarter until we stand upon her quarterdeck and cut her colours down chapter soldiers gathered to larboard huddling below on the gun deck or hunkered down behind the bulwarks on their knees aristocrats in the tops cautioned to clear the enemys foredeck rifled hunting guns loaded and primed once again lewrie deplored his stupidity dearly wishing he had but three light swivel guns aloft one in each fightingtop to spew clouds of pistolball or langridge lieutenant de crillart was admidships in the waist his gunners low to the deck behind the guns of the larboard battery which had been runin charged and shotted primed and runout to the port sills doubleshotted with their few precious grapeshot loads atop solidshot with the powdermonkeys ready with only one more cartridge bag the gunners ready with only two more roundshot for a second doubleshotted broadside before theyd abandon their guns take up small arms and board it was a slender hope he knew a tenuous neckornothing act of desperation no matter how enthusiastically he had couched his plan to the others he paced to the windward bulwarks of the quarterdeck studying his command looking astern at the french corvette she was now within two hundred yards of radicals stern banging away with her starboard bowchaser about once a minute and employing her two forrudmost mainbattery eightpounders which could be crowed or levered about to bear whilst his own gunners had been reduced to the single twelvepounder in the greatcabins of the larboard battery and the lone eightpounder sternchaser to larboard as well the frigate he turned to look to the north downwind there she was overhauling the trailing transport at last gunsmoke shrouding her side the transport attempting to shoot back but too far off to even hear the reports of their guns the corvette againperhaps twenty yards closer up to windward by about a single musketshot quartermaster nothing more to loord he called begin to luff up spoke at a time very slowly he heard the clinking of bottles somewhere damned good idea he thought someones thinking liquor your boots for this madness and wishing he had a glass of something too sir cony called to him from the waist aye cony he forced himself to grin going forward to look at his longtime man bloody hell cony there a dram left for me will cony held an entire armful of squat port bottles swaying a bit more than the sea demanded as if hed been into all of them with him was an older french gunner who bore a short smouldering linstock with slow match coiled about its length and laid in the top fork nary a drop sir sorry cony laughed me an monsooer ahnree here sorta sampled it like sampled aye

is over let em find it so she could draw on my funds start over somewhere not be he shook himself all over lifted his head and took a deep lungful of air to clear his gloomy thoughts there was the corvette close now less than one hundred yards astern less than fifty yards upwind more of her starboard gunports were opening as she ran them out to fire theyd bear now levered to the forrudmost rims of the gunports but even with quoins fully out breeches hard on the carriages shed not be able to shoot high enough to damage rigging or harm the upper decks as heeledover as she was by the press of wind another advantage to be below her he took time to gloat the one thing he had over which he could gloat these last few minutes of sternchase they had not been able to fire at anything but his waterline or his stern up to windward the lee guns were always canted too low for good gunnery he squatted down as the corvette let fly even so four balls struck almost immediately thanking into radical below the quarterdeck there were screams womanly cries grunts of alarm from men but his ship had taken the corvettes best fire and his frigates timbers had proven tough enough to hold he stood back up wincing as some french marksmen began to fire with their muskets a ball whistled past his ears like a bumblebee alan ignored it judging his moment lifting his arms slowly taking in a breath with which to scream wait for it wait for it now porter he bawled feeling faint and dizzy with the effort he put into his cry scandalise her quartermaster helm hard alee ready the larboard battery troops on deck muster in the waist round she came luffing up to windward yards crying and sails cracking like gunshots masts groaning and loose gear coming adrift from aloft the square sails were being brailed up goosewinged by spanish reefs the foresails and jibs sheets freed the braces let ease radical slowed quickly going from a painful struggle to flee to a weak surrender the sort of rubberylegged shudder a deer chased to exhaustion might display as it came to a halt at last tongue lolling and ribs heaving to face the dogs and its death the french corvette stood on for a startled moment laid as full and by as she could lay as radical fetched up across her course under her bows almost at rightangles to her she began to swing away haul her wind hoping to shave past radicals stern within spitting distance but lewries borrowed frigate had come up inirons dead in the eye of the wind her squaresail yards purposely thrown ailaback flat against the apparent wind then against the true wind as she groaned to a dead halt in a welter of disturbed water began to make a slight sternboard the corvettes bowsprit and jib boom came thrusting inward like a lance soaring over the larboard side steeved high into the air almost as high as the maincourse yard just before the mainmast chains her spritsl yard crossed beneath her bows but not deployed tangled in the stays ripping off rigging lines parting like pistol shots timbers moaning in agony as her elaborate beakhead rails were crushed back into her bows as her cutwater slammed into radical with a monumental hollow booming that shook both ships like striking a rocky shoal atspeed everyone was knocked off their feetradical shuddered her side gave way to the impact of nearly four hundred tons of oak and iron striking her almost at rightangles first grapnels away lewrie howled getting to his own feet even without looking tireurs there you marksmen tirez charles give her a broadside radicals gunners clambered back to their guns opened their gunports and ran out men teamed up on crowlevers to shift their charges to aim inward aiming pointblank at oak scantlings mere feet away the twelvepounders far fore and aft laid so canted at their ports theyd snap their breeching ropes musketry aloft snapping and cracking shouts of fear from the french gunners on the foredeck and focsle as lead struck about them clawing at their wounds as they were picked off before they could get back to serving their guns or freeing the flung grapnels then radical fired her broadside twelve hundred feet per second a ball flew when it left the muzzle of a naval artillery piece grapeshot more like a sack of hard iron plums and eighteenpounder solid roundshot behind that the corvette screamed wood cried out as it was blasted away timbers flew scantling planking whirled in the air thuds and thonks rose from her as her gun deck and mess deck were turned into a pair of bowling pitches and heavy iron tore through tightpressed men overturning artillery on carriages shivering masts as they struck on the lower trunks carline posts scantling decks overhead deck beam timbers broke or were turned by caroming ricochets into jagged clouds of wood sprinters bits and pieces as big as bayonets flicking quick as birds quilling sailors and making them cringe or cry in terror lewrie scampered to the larboard gangway above his guns sword drawn cockerels to me he called waving his tars to join him at the bulwarks grapnel men boarders boarders first you too my man he shouted as he espied cony and his french mate with their portbottle grenadoes they came with muskets pistols and cutlasses bare and brutally glittering there was nothing subtle or scientific about cutlassesthey were choppers not really swords now cockerels ready follow me lads he screamed to left and right boarders awwayy boarderrss they surged across the narrow space scrambling along the foot ropes and bracing cables below the ruin of the corvettes jib boom and bowsprit weapons in one hand and leaping from fore stay to fore stay with the other some spryer topmen sprinted down the jib boom as if running across a wide log footbridge horny bare feet tough and sure on pine spars and woundrope doubling bands all with a hank of white cloth tied round their left biceps over their shirts or jackets marking an ally for the sharpshooters above there was a quick mкlйe among the survivors of the bowchasers crews those who had not already been picked off or had fled french sailors were overrun in a twinkling hacked down with cutlasses or axe heads a fleet few screaming in terror and scampering over the top of around the sides of the petty officers heads in the roundhouses of the forward bulkhead kennedy lewrie shouted from the beakhead platform bring your men now grapnels well take em to the anchor catheads be ready with pistols he said drawing the first of a borrowed pair he climbed up from the beakhead platform to the foredeck and the abandoned chaseguns shouldered into the bulkhead and hopped up for a view trying to scale it a french sailor was climbing atop it with a musket in his hands eye to eye not a single yard between he brought up his pistol cackhanded snapping it back to fullcock with his swordhand wrist leveled and fired the mans forehead turned plummy and the back of his skull was blown out flinging blood and brains in a sudden rain behind him his own dying scream was echoed by the men whod been in his rear trying to dash forward to repel up men lewrie yelled give em pistols pointblank his men erupted from either side of the bulkhead and the roundhouses shouldering into rough line and leveling their weapons guns went off from both sides a british sailor was flung backwards with a howl there was a sharp crack a cloud of smoke from the far side and more howls among the french followed by another light explosion and the air sang with lead and broken glass cony and his grenadoes lewrie got to the top of the bulkhead crawled across it and looked down onto the forecastle there were half a dozen dead below a like number writhing and shrieking but a full two dozen running forward towards him muskets crackled near his ears making them ring and a few of the french skidded or tumbled to a halt the ones behind tripping over them and coming to a stop lewrie drew his second pistol glanced left to see a reassuring flash of red uniform coat the irish had made it across the french took pause confused by the sight of british red a heartbeat standing still then the corvette was quaking to a second broadside and the men below were scythed away by raking fire as more iron bowled and caromed the length of her gun deck take the forecastle lewrie pleaded turning to search for lieutenant kennedy there he was kennedy take the forecastle right to the railing volley and cover us the irish swept past him bayonets winking muskets presented at hip level about twenty men shuffling into ranks whilst the first brave ten hurriedly reloaded to a clatter of ramrods grapnels now set em to the catheads behind the troops he took the larboard side bosun porter the starboard trailing heavy fourinch manila lines across from radical heavybarbed grapnels being carried by seamen skulking low as the french got organised at last as they picked themselves up amid a welter of blood and smoke of sensible order overturned ignoring the shrieks of men torn in half by iron shards those quilled like hedgehogs by splinters or crushed and howling beneath shattered gun carriages they were advancing their numbers growing quickly musket fire began to buzz around them men went down lewrie lost his second hat felt a brush against his scalp and staggered as a musket ball clipped the hair above bis left ear but they had the grapnels set two wraps about the projecting cathead timbers then driven deep into the bulwarks lewrie could see the strain coming on the lines lifting them like snakes from the deck and turning them bartaut and a look forward showed him de crillart and some of his regular gunners coming over with french soldiers in a bunch along radicals gangway clumsily scrambling for handholds hurry he shouted to them waving charles forward for gods sake hurry em over we cant hold long sure enough there were men dashing along either gangway towards his outmanned boarding party porter to starboard had two pistols in his hands seamenroyalist french and britishat his back ready with cutlasses or a few loaded muskets lewrie cocked his second pistol and leveled it glaring down the barrel at the men running directly at him hoping they might flinch and his own body turned sideon like a duellist hoping he wouldnt be shot first rank yr lef front kennedy bawled level fire ten men fired by volley into the head of the pack facing bosun porter taking down five and throwing the rest into confusion which porter exploited with a pistol or musket volley of his own first rank recover and reload second rank yr right front level fire lewrie shot first taking down a french midshipman an aspirant who had been brave enough to charge him until hed seen the pistol in a dead line with his chest hed stumbled to a halt bringing up his own getting bowled over by his seamen the boys waistcoat turned red as he was flung backwards by the ball almost going erect again before being trampled by the ones behind alan brought up his sword matched blades with a cutlassswinging petty officer whod outrun the pack as kennedys soldiers tore gaping holes in the men whod been slow to follow him screams of alarm of disbelief as men realised they had been shot down or that theyd been spared whilst a friend had not two three engagements clashing steel against steel high then low to his left as the petty officer swung again parrying him off to the right and over his head tripping him with his foot and shouldering the burly man off balance a heartpounding gasp as he leapt back and ran him through sideways ducking as the cutlass came swinging at his head backhanded but the petty officer going down to his knees with a death wound below his ribs no time to reload no time to think another man leaping the carnage the th had strewn on the gangway confronted him an officer for sure with a smallsword up came his bloody blade to ring upon the foes but lisney was beside him with a cutlass at the head of the larboard forecastle ladder making him spin away to confront them both and gittons beside lisney two more british sailors following them the officer broke off beginning to backpedal glancing over lewries head as if to draw his attention off now and again third rank advance to the railings cock yr locks and level kennedy was shouting and there were french shouts too of encouragement coming from the beakheads and bulkhead behind lewrie he advanced with a leap sure he was being reinforced at last the french officer was forced to meet his blade begin the clashing of steel the thrust parry and anticipation amid the clatter of metal on metal as if an itinerant tinker band was repairing pots hilt to hilt the frenchman growling as one of his best overhand thrusts was averted he leapt back stamped his foot to advance fencingschool fashion and came spiralling in lewrie met his blade on the edge of his about midlength and the damned thing snapped his foe grinned as he cleared his arm for a thrust desperately alan was on him right shoulder forward brawling now instead of fencing seizing the mans swordhand wrist and jabbing him through the throat below his jaw with the ragged stub gave him another lower down in the belly as he sagged against him nose to nose looking into those dying eyes for an instant jumping back to avoid the rush of gore from his mouth as he tumbled facedown and taking his sword from him cockerels he bawled waving his new weapon on high to me lads kennedy take the gun deck now dont give em time to think he turned about to see louis and his cavalrymen mustering to starboard on the forecastle louis the gangway charge et damme dйbarquement the gangway clear it porter show im we ave arrive mon ami charles de crillart said breathlessly he shouted over his shoulder ordering his gunners to join porter and louis on the starboard gangway as major de mariels first soldiers came up join kennedy and de mariel clear the gun deck ill take the larboard gangway meet you aft charles bonne chance oui bonne chance alain charles agreed drawing his sword cockerels lets go lewrie shouted advancing kennedys th royal irish not waiting for de mariels men to take order in their rear advanced bayonets leveled down the ladders to the gun deck forming up before the focsle belfry in two long ranks across the deck forward the th up the irish lieutenant kennedy cried and hey charged hoolooloolooloo they screamed an ancient pagan gaelic war cry fullthroated ululating hatred and slaughter the wolves of erin who had never been conquered by caesars legions these fierce rejects of that unhappy land hoolooloolooloo they bayed and foes shrank in terror before them a continual fusillade of pistol pops musket reports screams and wails the tinny sounds of blades battering against each other mкlйe and mayhem a swirling twisting nightmare dream of killing of being killed of narrowly avoiding death down went a man with a boarding pike to lewries new sword skewered through the belly another blade glittering as it descended towards his outstretched arms lisney there to fend it off to hack the next foe down midshipman spendlove under his arm to dash forward dirk in one hand cutlass in the other cutting right and left horizontal sweeping the cutlass upwards to tear a topman open stamping and extending his left arm to stab another lewrie sagged against the bulwarks panting for air wincing to a cut on his left leg he couldnt recall receiving his mouth dry as dust looked to his left saw chevalier louis at die head of his thrusting swinging cavalrymen popping off with musketoons and pistols and saw louis and the three men behind him taken down by a blast from a swivel gun on the quarterdeck the gunner leaning far out over the bulwark to fire down the gangway was shot through the heart the next moment below irish bayonets jabbing overhand and underhand a french sailor with an frish soldier by the throat dirk stabbing all the while his own body rising off the deck hoisted by three more bayonets a pistol going off near kennedys head missing at pointblank range and kennedy hewing the shooter down conys grenadoes going off far aft lofted as far as he could throw them waiting dangerously long as the fuses burned down so that they went off in midair at eye or waistlevel and dragging himself back into the fray as the french sailors began at last to give way falling back as far as the main chains half the corvette was theirs slipping and sliding aft along the larboard gangway stepping over dead men the cruelly wounded hacked and chopped open or apart by british sailors going through the whole brutal ballet of the full cutlass drill the next minute or so lewrie was too busy to ever recall what hed done as he slashed and stabbed fired off a pistol he thought once and took down a bosuns mate with a musket then he found himself on the enemys quarterdeck a cutlass in his hand from where he had no memory facing off with an officer in a coat ornately trimmed in goldlace oak leaves clash slash stamp return to the balance foot recover then stamp and slash down and left advance back and right balance and recover his years as a midshipman and the cutlass drill had never left him and the man was throwing down his sword backed up against the doublewheel drum throat bared panting hard with fear in his eyes strike alan gasped amenez vous кtes le capitaine oui the fellow wheezed slipping to his knees amenezvous you strike lewrie demanded oui the man nodded weakly eyes shut and filled with tears lisney alan called out es dead sir seaman gold said at his side gasping for air himself and bleeding from several scrapes and cuts take him gold hes your prisoner lewrie ordered filled with wonder he strode aft to the taffrail cutlass ready should any of the foemen huddled there present a danger but they threw down all their weapons at his fell approach cockerels mes amis quarter merci theyve struck to us he shouted turning to face the soldiers of the th the royal french infantry coming up to the quarterdeck then took hold of the flag halliard and set it free hauled in and lowered the gigantic tricolour battle flag to drape below the stern trailing in the water over the captains stern gallery in sign of her defeat capum sir cony summoned as lewrie leaned against the taffrails feeling utterly spent woozy and weary beyond belief mister lewrie sir tis mister de crillart sir ya gotta come quick sir hes adyin sir an es askin f r ya lewrie lowered his head to his knees for a second took several restoring breaths then followed as cheers of victory began to rise as men opened their mouths to yell to the heavens that they were still ahve and able to yell lewrie found his friend charles de crillart had been blown almost in half just as hed begun to ascend the starboard quarterdeck ladder up from the waist he had been the first man struck by a load of grapeshot from a swivel gun his heels still rested over his head on the ladder the rest sprawled awkwardly brokenly at its foot his head below his trunk perhaps was all that kept him conscious alain he muttered weakly clawing at the deck in agony as the shock wore off and the pain of his ravaged lower body sank in his legs were both broken almost amputated his belly plumbed by shot here charles alan groaned when he saw him he could not help sinking to his knees beside him de crillart reached out blindly eyes wavering back and forth as if his sight was already slipping and alan took his hand maman et ahahh he flinched trying not to writhe to his intense pain yet having to which caused even more maman et sophie alain i am going i canno aid ahhh he had to bite his lip so hard to keep from crying out and unmanning himself that he drew blood alain promesse louis de crillart grunted louis is alan said wondering if he could lie to ease him i see alain i see eem fall e eez

honour charles as an english gentleman as a commission officer in the royal navy i swear to you ill take care of them ill see them someplace safe he croaked blinking back tears bon de crillart sighed shrinking away his hand as cold as ice slipped from lewries hand bon he said again the breath his last hissing out to rattle in his throat as his eyes glazed over alan closed them for him crossed his arms upon his breast goddamn he whispered sitting back on his heels good feller e waz sir cony said in sympathy so were a lot of men just died lewrie grunted chin on his chest god help me cony im so

like slaughtered game birds but mostly french republican sailors thank godhewn down hacked down scythed down by musketry doubleshotted iron and cutlasses moaning emptyeyed wounded clutching their hurts sitting on the decks in shock there was a cannon shot a deepbellied roar oh god no lewrie wailed losing his rigidly enforced calm that bloody frigate he and cony dashed forward leaping over obstacles to ascend to the foredeck where they might have a view there closeaboard was a warship her pristine masts and yards towering over the two entangled ships flying a white ensign and do you require assistance lewrie waved to her both arms wide she was huge bluff and tall a massive twodecker where had she sprung from he wondered sir spendlove shouted from radicals quarterdeck aft at her

until agamemnon sends her hands to aid us and get everyone no matter who working on the chainpumps aye aye sir lewrie crossed over to radical working his way out the jib boom sideways on the foot ropes to the bulwarks in which the corvettes bow was deepsunk looking down he could see crushed planking between two rows of vertical hull timbers perhaps that was the worst damage none of it too far below the waterline he hoped he gained the larboard gangway and looked down into the waist women and children milled about down there weeping and wailing crying to heaven surgeons moved among them loblolly boys were fetching up more from below on the orlop wounded women dead lolling children dear god that last broadside she got off just before we went up inirons he quailed the collision everything come adrift below i killed em winnin my damned victory he was at the head of the larboard quarterdeck ladder about to descend when phoebe came rushing from the press to its foot came up to throw herself upon him laughing and weeping at the same time thankee jesus shes alive thankee he thought hugging her no matter who saw them stroking her hair as she babbled one minute trembling and bubbling over with joy the next instant bawling fit to bustall punctuated by hiccoughy french tripped off so fast he couldnt catch a word in twenty calm phoebe calm im alright now calm he shusshed oh alain merde alors ze canon beaucoup de femmes et denfants zey tuer keel si trиs beaucoup hurt charles came a scream from below them sophie de maubeuge scrambled up the quarterdeck ladder blood on her gown msieur lieutenant luray charles he let go of phoebe extended his arms to her but she did not accept his embrace but stopped short paling as she realised what he was about to say by the expression of grief and sympathy on his face non non mon dieu on mademoiselle vicomtesse je regrette he said gently taking her hands instead charles auguste baron de crillart il nous a quittй before she had time to take a breath for another hysterical scream he told her the rest aussi chevalier louis de crillart il nous a quittй god how i hate that bloody phrase he thought nous a quittй left us gone away from us like it was their bloody idea sophie let go of his hands put them to either side of her head as if to tear her hair out by the roots and screamed and screamed as she sank to her knees had not phoebe gone down to her she would have tumbled to the base of the ladder broken her neck phoebe cradled her head upon her breast crooning to her gentling her while alan stood embarrassed by his role and his slowness his uselessness charles louis sophie wailed gone white with her eyes ready to roll back into her head in a faint madame what lewrie started finally noticing the blood on her gown oui alain phoebe whispered as he went down to them looking up with tears running free on her face as bleak as if shed lost someone too madame de crillart ze murs uhm walls zey break open boulets de canon ze grande dame elle est morte pauvre petite mademoiselle she as lose er famille entiиre ave no one now i he whimpered turning away overcome and sure that it was all his own bloody fault oh bloody go i see to er phoebe urged you ship she lewrie staggered away across the littered quarterdeck and his borrowed cutlass clattered to the deck as it slipped from his nerveless fingers he fetched up at the battered taffrails by one of the sternchasers which still radiated spent heat scrubbing bis face with both hands trying to deny what hed done wondering if he could have done something different taken another course of action that wouldnt have gotten so many innocent and helpless slaughtered off on the noreast horizon a frigate was flying pursued by a british ship near the transports both fetchedto and looking as if theyd been knocked about cockerel cruised slowly and the corvette hed crippled had struck her colours a royal navy ensign flying at her taffrail how had the civilians fared aboard those transports he wondered had they suffered this much after putting up token opposition then striking he feared they hadnt damme he thought i could have stood on just a few minutes longer endured her fire and help would have arrived these french would have had to sheer off soon as they saw our warships closing he turned to the sound of tumult saw wounded men being brought aboard the healthy slowly crawling across the bulwarks as emptyeyed as the defeated saw his mates and petty officers putting them to work on the chainpumps after theyd embraced their families and gotten a sip of something to relieve their dry mouths agamemnon fetchingto and lowering her boatsboats crammed with strong helpful sailors to salve his ship and his prize and saw men whod faced battle and suffered come back aboard to find a loved one departed shouldnt be like this he groused hard as the aftermath of a battle is shouldnt be like this men could fall be cruelly wounded and linger in their agonies among shipmates in a tough masculine world where men could josh the dying buck them up to go game or offer awkward comfort and grieve for good friends departed of a certainty as their canvasshrouded corpses were put over the side with roundshot at their feet but to hear the lamentations of the orphaned the widowed stead of imagining some faroff bereavement notified half a year later that the son the father the brother the husband or lover was discharged dead shouldnt ought to be like this he muttered leaning on the taffrails for a few last private moments letting his own tears flow choking on his own bereaved sobs before stern duty recalled him phoebe had quieted sophie de maubeuge last vicomtesse of her lineage turned her over to the care of another aristocratic familys women and made her way back up the quarterdeck ladder to find him she saw him far aft leaning forward head down squeezing the rails and her heart went out to him she hitched up her skirts ready to run to him but spendlove intervened maam he called stepping in front of her snuffling himself as the list of familiar hands whod fallen accumulated in his ledger as he recognised the bodies of friends and mentors and troublemakers from a full years association dont not now msieur spenloove e need phoebe pled weakly maam spendlove objected gently taking her nearest hand i know you an mister lewrie well taint my place to say whats but maam do you care for him do you love him vis all ma eart she declared weeping anew at the force of her affection then maam give him a minute or two more if you do mister midshipman spendlove dared to suggest hell be back with us for now though maam let mister lewrie let our captain have a cry lenvoi cessere ratemque accepere mari per quot discrimina rerum expediter they have yielded they have received the vessel on the sea i find my way now through many a change in fortune valerius flaccus argonautica book chapter twilight at gibraltar on the decks of hms victory the fleet anchored about her with glims and binnacle and belfry lights agleam and lanterns strung by entryports poop and quarterdeck aboard the flagship wardroom and greatcabin lights reflected off the waters from over forty vessels and from the transports from england the ships that had brought just a few weeks too late the regiments of british redcoats that might have made the difference the ones held back too long by indifference miscommunication theyd put in to gibraltar just days before admiral hoods ships had returned from the defeat at toulon as if in the worst sort of mockery they had been held at gibraltar pending instructions from hood to send them on to him though he had no idea of their arrival at all and was even then arranging for the hurried evacuation of coalition forces lewrie paced fretfully turned out in the best that local chandlers could boast now his packet had come from home pristine new breeches waistcoat and shirt and a new hat hed clung to the hessian boots thoughthey seemed to be all the rage among sea officers latelyand perversely to the tatty older coat he wore an elegant smallsword at his hip taken from the captain of the corvette he had captured as prize though he still longed for his original hanger lieutenant lewrie a flag lieutenant called at last milord hood is now free and may see you sir lewrie crossed the vast expanse of victorys quarterdeck aft to the admirals quarters under the poopbut was brought up short by the sight of captain howard braxton leaving those greatcabins he seemed ill as ill as he had in the days just after his recovery spent and old whitefaced the incline of his mouth to larboard even more pronounced sir lewrie said icily doffing his hat properly in salute it took braxton a moment to notice him when he did he turned even paler almost dropped the bundles of logbooks and ledgers he bore then his eyes flared before slitting in anger and mottled ire coloured his cheeks goddamn you sir braxton bleated in a harsh whisper happy now are you lewrie happy now may god damn you to hell he hissed before stalking away for the entryport hmm well lewrie shrugged to the flag lieutenant indeed sir that worthy rejoined with a sad embarrassed moue lewrie good admiral lord hood grunted as he mused upon the paperwork on his desk in the day cabin to which lewrie had been shown a festive display of linen crystal fine china and a sideboard buried in bottles hed seen in the dining coach and reception area evidently the admiral would host a supper party that evening milord so gracious of you to receive me alan replied take a pew sir a glass of something do avail yourself of a quite decent brandy there on the side table pour one for me as well hood signed his name with a quill pen before rising to cross the cabin to join him hood accepted the glass lewrie offered him and sat himself in the matching highbacked wing chair crossing his legs as if ready to converse with a close acquaintance at his london club now sir hood began after a refreshing sip read your account of cockerels performance last week and that report i requested of you anent her past since her commissioning appalling simply appalling but there will be no court martial i have to tell you sir i thought sorry milord lewrie sighed disappointed a bit appalled himself at the reach of patronage and politics matters been dealt with hood was quick to assure him cant abide being lied to either by omission or commission most certainly i cannot abide a scoundrel who will not support a fellow captain brought to action a total poltroon no matter how plausible his explanations nor one sir who will falsify log entries in such fraudulent manner for a disconcerting moment alan thought hood was speaking of his actions wondering if braxton had lied his way out once more even if his words on the quarterdeck sounded as if he hadnt braxton sir hood continued with a disguised snort should never have had command of a harbourwatch cutter fascinating really made all the appropriate noises bout fetching aid claimed he took your prize frigate and that horse transport can you believe it for a brace o warships so he felt free to scuttle off the situation being so well in hand changed his tune when pressed though said he could not accept battle against three frigates could never be expected to do so conveniently forgetting that hed already misidentified your two ships and was later amazed to learn that two foes were corvettes admitting in essence hed put discretion above valour and fled not only showing cowardice in the face of the enemy but disobeying a direct orderfrom mine own hands sirto safeguard the laggard ships to his utmost what he could have done with a single th rate had he remained your valiant action sir proved that most assuredly as for lying to me anent naples he and his clerk most likely rewrote portions of cockerels log for that period no mention of sickness yet never thinking that i would have in my possession correspondence from sir william hamilton which proved him a complete liar sir well didnt think hed go that far milord lewrie replied easier put it to him direct hood said with a wolfish grin take a court of mine own appointing dye see sir take his chances with a board of seven postcaptains or he could for reasons of health throw up his command ask to be relieved immediately and go on the halfpay list return to civilian employment resume his service with john company lucrative as that is but i was quick to assure him i would append to his letter of resignation a letter of mine own to stephens and jackson and our lords commissioners that while he may be continued on the roster for postcaptainsindeed may attain should he live to the very pinnacle of that listhe should never have another appointment of any kind seagoing command or sinecure ashore and further that even should captain braxton rise to the highest seniority as postcaptain he shall never never sir be yellowsquadroned as a flag officer i believe that takes care of that problem do you not as well mister lewrie hood all but snickered i do indeed milord most handily despatched with the very least harm to his sons career or to his family i fully expect his letter of resignation aboard by eight bells of the morning watch failing that well hood chortled almost looking forward to a court martial now sir cockerel she shall have a new captain aboard by eight bells of the forenoon should captain braxton oblige me and himself tell me all about her who needs weeding out and explain this uhm mutiny which took place sir for the next quarterhour hood listened having his flag lieutenant in to make notes nodding grimly surprising lewrie by laughing when he came to the mutineers aye hood said at last mister clement braxton deserves a second chance the midshipmen must be separated and assigned to new ships under a new order of captains tell me lieutenant lewrie you ended up with most of those men whom your captain deemed troublemakers did they ever cause you any grief sir none milord lewrie could state with assurance damme loath as i am to turn a bund eye to an act of mutiny or to condone the crime by taking no action against the perpetrators hood gloomed terrible times we live in lewrie rights of man and this spirit of revolution a world turned upside down as it were time out of mind weve kept our sailors in strict discipline with the lash which they understand now faced with two nations which have revolted against the proper ordained authority of their betters i fear your captain braxton may become a more common figure aboard our ships in future as our tars absorb the radical levelling teachings of the american rebels and these french we fight we may all have to become ever more watchful and tauthanded to keep jack obedient i should excuse me milord but the flag lieutenant interrupted your guests should even now be arriving aye enough for now then you will do me the signal pleasure of dining aboard as my guest lieutenant lewrie with all gratefulness for your kind hospitality milord he replied stunned by the invitation it was hearty english fare portable navy soup local fish in a vinegar sauce chicken with vegetable removes then salad and roast beef of course lewrie was in heady company admirals gell goodall and cosby captain elphinstone off robust nelson off agamemnon and a dozen more distinguished officers victorys rearadmiral sir hyde parker and her flag captain john knight holloway off britannia and sir thomas byard off windsor castle flag captain john childs purvis of goodalfs princess royal and gelfs captain thomas foley from the st george with a sprinking of commanders towards the middle of that groaning table and a smattering of lieutenants who had distinguished themselves on detatched service at toulon at its foot with the food came lashings of wine a new one with every coursenational origin bedamnedof which lewrie took full measure down near the token midshipman who served as mister vice at its far end it was a convivial very sociable supper with many toasts made and drunk and officers proposing individual a glass with you sir duet toasts among themselves almost every minute to observe them it would have seemed hard to believe that these were officers who had just taken part in an appalling and embarrassing defeat finally the last plates were cleared the linen and water glasses removed and cheeses fresh from england nuts and extrafine sweet biscuit set out with the port bottles which began to circulate larboardly hood was prosing on from the top of the table conducting a conversation concerning the material condition of the ships brought away from toulon and no one sounded exactly pleased lewrie noted though a touch squiffy few of those prize vessels sounded like theyd been exactly good value returned upon their investment lieutenant lewrie hood called out making alan start in his chair and set down his glass of port that vessel you brought off radical was she tell us of her state sir he explained the weeding the slovenly dockyard work done by the french the iron and copper and the further damage shed taken milord gentlemen i fear she may require a full quarter of this next year in dock to set her right lewrie concluded queazy with all eyes upon him decommissioned though a chance to rename her he said with a quirky and shyly ingratiating grin quite viceadmiral cosby grunted cant have a ship named radical in our navy nothing radical allowed ha ha said sir thomas byard quite amused and halfseasover with drink and those two corvettes you fought lieutenant lewrie hood probed on the uhm oh the sans culottes and the one we disabled milord the libertй alan replied sitting up straighter or trying to both are in decent condition milord libertй requires minimal repairs new masts spars and canvas mostly sans culottes perhaps a month in the yards to repair battle damage other than that fully found three warships the gallant lieutenant lewrie has won for us gentlemen hood announced though with so many of our vessels insight at the moment the corvettes struck their colours i fear little in the way of prizemoney and headmoney as reward dare i say though milord captain nelson posed that given the parlous state of his prize frigate lightly armed as she was and with so many untrained civilian volunteers aboard to dare a full three enemy vessels cripple one and take a second was an act of such conspicuous skill not to mention pluck and bottom that lieutenant lewries gallantry and his victory were the true rewards hear hear they shouted lifting their glasses high pounding their fists on the table and i suppose hood said with a twinkle in his eye after the tumult had died down that we may avail ourselves of those two ships time in dock to decommission them and rename them as well libertй perhaps is innocuous but tradition is to keep the name of the captured ship milord sir hyde parker countered in sign to our foes that the royal navys to be feared upon the seas if only our foes had the good sense and common decency admiral parker to christen their vessels with worthy names captain sir george elphinstone of robust rebutted with a chuckle his comment raising a laugh among the others sans culottes i ask you quite right sir george captain sir thomas byard merrily said why given our tars penchant for a baser humour what would they make of that i ask you gentlemen eh lewrie most like sir thomas theyd be calling her hms bare uh legged in a dogwatch lewrie jested quite happy that hed caught himself from saying what first sprang to mindhms barearsel worse than that i fear sir byard continued drolly without breeches it means but what state is that hey encouraged by too much drink and the jollity of the assembled senior officers lewrie could not help himself you suppose captain byard that they might refer to a state involving another part of the anatomy one more uhm fundamental sir thomas that set them off to another round of fistpounding and laughing lewrie quite enjoyed his clever play on words until he noted that admiral lord hood was most definitely not amused as the last chuckles died away hood spoke lieutenant lewrie has always been so i have gathered quite the wag gentlemen quite the witty fellow indeed hood purred it sounded so much like censure that the others sobered oh christ ive fucked it again lewrie groaned to himself damme and my open mouth never know when to keep it shut aye gentlemen well rename our prizes hood announced as he poured himself a glass of port a full glass as for libertй as i earlier stated that is somewhat innocuous though it would not do to encourage her crew to dwell pon her name too closely before shes recommissioned well think of something suitable as for the sans culottes hood made a little moue gave a tiny shrug our tars would make something of that wouldnt they admiral lord hood said with a brief smile so gentlemen since she is the worst offender do you charge your glasses i was struck just now with an inspiration and i would be gratified were you to indulge me the bottles made their way about full bumpers were poured and set before a multitude of thirsty fists in expectation a double toast if i may sirs gentlemen hood explained as he lifted his glass in the jocular spirit of this evening allow me to propose that the french national ship the twentygunned prize corvette sans culottes shall be bought into royal navy service as his majestys th rate sloop of war he paused dramatically a twinkle in his old eyes jester sirs gentlemen i give you hm sloop of war jester proudly may she tweak the noses of our foes hm sloop of war jester they repeated loudly in a rough and manly chorus draining off half their port and waiting glasses pent at midchest for the rest of the toast and to the jolly wag responsible for what little merriment we enjoy this evening the provider of the one bright spot of cheerand may i say of gloryto illuminate our hopes for success and victory in future hood beamed at last looked down the table direct and locked his eyes on alan and allow us to close the book upon our recent enterprise with an exemplary display of wit courage shiphandling and gallantry in the finest tradition of the sea service the young man who took her commander alan lewrie jesus bloody lewrie gawped as they shouted his name and his new rank his glass sat between his shaky hands as they tossed theirs off beyond heeltaps head down in modesty true modesty for once it must be said too surprised to do else but shyly smile hm sloop of war jesters new master and commander admiral hood said as an afterthought once the tumult had died down a captain in your own right at last sir use her well and take joy of her chapter hm sloop of war jester stood out past europa point hardening up to a land breeze from spain on the starboard tack gun salutes had been fired and the artillery secured sparse as gibraltar dockyards were supplied it had taken two months to set her right more than the single month her captain had supposed now she was off for england with despatches to recruit and man to replace french eightpounders with british long nines to add some carronades to her quarterdeck there was a sprinkling of maltese seamen in her crew though the hard kernel of her experienced men were former cockerels those whod served detached with him and some whod asked to turn over to her from their old ship after her new captain had read himself in plus those men separated from other ships whod been with him from toulon a few more volunteered from victory agamemnon most graciously offered by captain nelson though he was shorthanded himself by then and the other flagships enough to man her voyage home to portsmouth doubling cape st vincent along the spanish and portuguese coasts and lash cross the boisterous westerlies of the bay of biscay for ushant risking french warships but jester was a fine vessel no error lewrie thought proudly savouring a first morning at sea the fresh breezes the warming climate of an early march mediterranean spring day she was well built of adriatic oak properly joined caulked and payed newly coppered with quickwork as clean and smooth as a babys bottom and she was fast he was certain jester would get them all home safely and swiftly sure his rising impatience would soon be satisfied to go ashore and visit caroline sewallis hugh once more and see how much little charlotte had grown during his absence caroline had written that theyd coach down to portsmouth and all be together during jesters brief refit so long apart so eager to see them to hear their voices touch them to hold his dear wife once more by the time of jesters landfall the news of his battle his victory and his promotion would have made the marine chronicle and the london gazette he had not yet received admiralty confirmation of his promotion but surely that was a mere formality with hood speaking for him beyond winning a fight against appalling odds twoapenny for the public beliefs hed brought off women and children rescued then protected innocent lives that made his official report he was sure the sort of fame beyond the normal even if he had gotten some of the innocent slain in the process he groaned reliving his errors again trying to think of something he could have done better he still felt guilty about those dependents who had died admittedly he felt rather guilty over his infidelities too of his failings as a proper husband though he felt drawn like filings to a lodestone eager to rush home he wondered if his sins would show in his face if caroline would know at the first instant of reunion fearful too of his charge alan looked to starboard over to where mister midshipman spendlove was engaging in shy clumsy repartee to mademoiselle sophie vicomtesse de maubeuge who was taking the air on the quarterdeck now the ship was secured for sea properly chaperoned by an йmigrй royalist french maidservant shed taken on no help there lewrie thought sourly midshipman clarence spendlove was a year younger than she of middling worth to begin with and bloody hopeless as a swain now lieutenant ralph knolles on the other hand he turned to look at his first officer freshplucked from fourthlieutenant obscurity in windsor castles wardroom he was of an age about twentyfive came of a good family and had been very witty and charming when about the vicomtesse most swainlike indeed hmm lieutenant knolles felt his captains intent perusal on the back of his neck turned from his pose by the nettings forrud and raised one quizzical blond eyebrow wary of his new captain and their brief acquaintance a good day for it mister knolles lewrie grinned with false cheer clapping his hands as if in pleasure good to be back at sea indeed sir knolles replied relieved carry on you have the deck sir lewrie assured him gaily aye aye sir have to speak to the young swine alan told himself dine them both in he could take her off my hands pray jesus with no place else to go no other living relations and so poor in pelf with which to establish herself on her own even if she could at her tender young age lewrie had been forced by that promise hed made to charles de crillart upon his very honour that hed look after the unfortunate sophie de maubeuge there had been time enough for his letter to go to caroline and to receive a quick reply on a packet brig caroline had been reduced to tears both by the girls piteous plight and her dear husbands tender and magnanimous promise to such a gallant dying man for the few years before sophie was come to her majority caroline had insisted that the girl simply must come to live with them as their treasured guest close as catercousins let her tutor the children in french in poetry and such music of course but raise her and let her acquaint herself with a new life in england safely away from city evils in the bucolic splendours of anglesgreen and what the tender young sophie de maubeuge knew of her benefactors amorous rantipoling lewrie most ardently hoped sophie might keep to herself and from her benefactress but dreading that someday in a snit perhaps or an unguarded moment the mortd christ shat on a biscuit he thought massaging his brow lets please marry the chit off quick as we can damned fetchin she is a sweet willing tit hell of a catch somebody titled an all what am i bid and the worst part of it is i cant caution her about it cant even talk to her bout keepin silent jesus lets hope poor charles was right shes french nunblinkered or no its in the blood the frenchr sposed to understand these things about a man and a maid bout phoebe dear lord phoebe besides the cost of outfitting his new greatcabins not that grand really with the bare minimums of comforts of furnishings which greatcabins he could not use since hed been saddled with half a dozen nonpaying alleating alldrinking passengerslive lumberof purchasing cabin stores wine and such plates and glassware a new seachest partially stocked with all which was needful a new hat with proud goldlace and at least one newpattern goldlaced uniform coat suitable to a commander there was phoebe to lodge and support at gibraltar daft daft daft he told himself yet again turning his head to glance at the helmsman and the compass course and discovering her scent on his coat collar fresh from his very last shore visit of the night before before taking jester to sea at sunrise he inhaled deep in spite of all his guilt his fear and his misgivings savouring her scent his memory of her and her passionate kittenish adoring adieu yet in spite of all he could not help himself could not force himself to let go of her all during jesters time in the docks he slept ashore with her each moment snatched from duty a heavensent joy and admiral hood had given him firm assurances that once his ship was ready jester would be returning to the mediterranean that hood had written a specific request for his future services there was corsica to be taken to confound the french after all royalist sentiments to exploit among the french on the island separatist sentiments among the rather recently annexed italian population led by some fellow named paoli or something like that and dovetailing so neatly with his enchantment with the petite and entrancing phoebe was the fact that she herself was corsican part french part italian mademoiselle phoebe aretino was she knew every inch of the island knew the people who mattered and was well versed in her islands tumultuous affairs besides being the most intoxicating besotting loving amusing exotically wee and clinging yet so fiercely warm and passionate a most cunning and beguiling exciting maddening little minx lewrie sighed taking a surreptitious whiff of his collar again still able to feel her soft lips upon his see her huge waifs eyes as they peered up at him in total devotion daft or not his affections and his soul were torn in twain and he knewfeared ratherthat once home with his dear ones like an antipodal lodestone like a siren song he would grow vexed for the feel of her the taste of her and be just as eager to put to sea to hurry jester back to gibraltar hurry himself back to the arms of his tender young phoebe he saw bosuns mate will cony by the fife rails of the mainmast in jesters waist patiently tutoring some newrecruited landsmen in the identity of the maze of runningrigging belayed on the pins and alan smiled in spite of all his forebodings had it right cony he thought god knows his rogues when he sees em i wager hell be gettin a tremendous laugh tsee us both wriggle when we get back to anglesgreen a blackandwhite kitten now four months oid came skittering on the quarterdeck from aft shoveling a beribboned wine cork between his paws arching leaping and mewing as he pounced and footballed he was turning out to be a horrid disaster that kitten couldnt mouse shied at the sight of a cockroachand jester had more than her fair share of that tribe aboard at present loud noises drove him into hiding in lewries seachest hatbox or behind the books on the shelves above the chart table a pest for attention he was too all hours of the nightwhere he pawed and cried for stroking butting insistently when he did sleep it was under lewries chin abed or curled up in his hat yes he was a perfect disaster but amusing and affectionate for all that which had after much thought suggested his name a french name for a french cat here toulon lewrie bade cheerfully come here toulon with a glad mew toulon bounded to his side in awkward hops to scramble up his coattails and settle on his shoulder for a rub thrusting his little nose into lewries ear clawing at his coat collar and purring with ardour too late to cure him of such sins alan wondered well maybe hell grow out of em afterword even more disheartening for the allies of the first coalition who had been forced to evacuate toulon was the attempted destruction of the french fleet and the naval port facilities on the night of december french troops were already in the town and on the hills to the west overlooking the basin nearly convict labourers were free of their chains and acting like patriots the log and chain boom across the harbour entrance had been closed the spanish however and contemporary accounts refer to thendesultory performance as treacheryof course these are british accounts and they had their noses far out of joint when they wrote themdidnt appear to have tried very hard their work at the arsenals and warehouses didnt go well and damage to the facilities was not as extensive as the fires might have made people believe and instead of scuttling the iris frigate crammed with those thousands of barrels of gunpowder they set fire to her on their hasty way out which caused the tremendous explosion lewrie witnessed which blew the union a british gunboat nearby to atoms sir william sidney smith tried to enter the basin after firing docked ships and do what the spanish had shirked but was driven away by the volume of gunfire he did burn two more french s but they were condemned hulks full of french prisoners of war whom he freed at last as his party retired having done all they could the montreal frigate the other powder hulk blew up with a blast even greater than iris no one is quite sure how she took lighta french patriot some mistake by smiths party or another pyromaniacal spaniard who rather thought hed like to hear something else go boom that night captain sir william sidney smith selected himself for the venture and captain horatio nelson wrote of his failure to do more damage saying lord hood mistook the man there is an old saying great talkers do the least we see though captain smith later distinguished himself in the middle east against french troops ashore the basin and port were not destroyed and the french regained the use of many of their ships thought burned there had been thirtyone ships of the line at toulon some inordinary in docks or being built four were sailed away and only nine of them burned toulon held twentyseven corvettes brigs of war and frigates fifteen were carried off including alceste which the sardinians lost to the french a few years later five were burned and seven left to the republicans some ships on stocks were not burned at all and the shipyards were back in business soon after the worst part of the defeat at toulon though was the loss of civilian lives after the coalition cut and ran breaking their solemn promises to safeguard the royalist sympathisers the fleet did carry off of them but could not find places aboard ships for more at the last as the rearguard troops british spanish and neapolitans broke and ran when french troops rushed forward the thousands of people left behind soldiers and civilians dashed to the quays and the shores they waded out imploring the last boats to save them they were cut down shot down or ruthlessly bayoneted by victorious republican troops some accounts say hundreds others thousands died in the last hours or drowned trying to swim after the boats or out to a ship general dugommier protested it is written though napoleon buonaparte did not as the republican deputies set up their guillotines ending up executing by their enthusiastic accounts a brisk a day toulon paid for its sin in the end it is thought over civilian toulonese lost their lives one way or another men women and children joseph conrad wrote a novel the rover which concerned the fate of the royalists featuring a young girl driven mad by the terror the slaughter the permanent exile of those unfortunate йmigrйs driven overseas to any port that would have them like storm petrels of families and loved ones forever separated by sailing on different ships to disparate corners of the earth if you can find it in the classics section read the tale of poor mad ariette victim of the revolution and of toulon lady emma hamilton indeed could never resist a sailor after he first met her in horatio nelson was perhaps more besotted by emma than most biographers suspector care to admit did he or did he not that early after his stunning victory at the battle of the nile emma threw herself at his feet and he gladly picked her up they remained lovers public or professional opinions bedamned until his death in on victorys quarterdeck at the battle of trafalgar emma hamilton was a sad case she really did think of all those men whod used her then cast her aside as her true longtime friends and mentors and we believe the depiction herein of this deluded lady is correct especially emma hamiltons desire to tag onto the coattails of powerful and influential men and bask in their reflected shared glories by the waywhat charles greville paid for that fetherstonehaugh would not was a baby left in fostercare at neston and never reclaimedby either parent there was a sans culottes in the french navy but she didnt keep that name for long originally the dauphinroyal she was a gun st rate cooler heads prevailed at last the wily politicians who took over the french revolution from the wildeyed radicals and might have been a touch embarrassed by the earlier revolutionaries fervour she became the orient and served as the illfated admiral de brueys flagship at the battle of the nile where she burned and blew up in prompting that horridly sentimental poem the boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled or something like that imagine if you will a proud and noble fortyfourgun frigate of the fledgling united states navy being christened uss tory thumper and picture how quickly one might wish to thump the man who so named her upside the head then get on to something more suitable such as constitution lastly before anyone gets exceeding wroth with the author and wastes postage or toll charges upon irate phone calls or scathing diatribes allow him to plead dramatic license captain william bligh was still at jamaica having just delivered his breadfruit at long last in the indiaman providence there was no way he could have been in london nor at the admiralty to meet our boy lewrie in late january you know this the author more to the point knows this but since mutiny revolution and all were indeed the spirit of the age blighs appearance in the tale neatly foreshadows that which came later aboard cockerel and in france and at toulon there satisfied now besides it was a slow morning for the author too when he wrote that and he couldnt help himself so there is commander alan lewrie master and commander into a proper kings ship husband father lover scared so bad he would not trust his own arse with a fart what will sophie de maubeuge say to caroline in future how will he juggle wife and family on one hand and the stunning phoebe aretino on the other will it last will the kitten ever stop nuzzling his ear or catch a mouse will alan retain the good opinion people seem to have of him at the moment anyway most importantly what sort of adventures and troubles will he get into next we think we know but were not telling yet authors note from alan lewries earlier adventure the rings commission defore diving right into alan lewries latest naval adventure if one may do so without besmirching ones own fine sense of honor by exposing it to such a rogue it might be a good idea to discover just exactly who in the hell this alan lewrie character was of course for those of you with a taste for stirring action and some salacious wenching you may plunge right on to chapter one and elude this brief curriculum vitae but for the more inquisitive reader unfamiliar with the previous accounts about our nautical hero a reader not entirely taken in by splashy dust jackets and titillating blurb copy believe me this chronicler understands your plight you have found this tome and it sounded as though it might contain scads of blood and thunder shivering topsls and timbers as in shiver me timbers mate lots of derringdo and some naughty bits tucked into the odd corner but its a wrench trying to pick up on the middle release of a whole series of nautical adventure in midtack as our protagonist has learned to say at this stage of his career so allow me to condense this young corinthians past for you before getting into all the sex swords and sailing ships not necessarily in that order i look upon it as a public duty after all did c s forester do this for you no you had to wait for the hornblower companion did sherlock holmes ever have a biography or did you have to search for clues in the works themselves alan lewrie was born on epiphany in st martins in the fields parish london his mother elizabeth lewrie passed away soon after this blessed event and he began life a bastard in the parish poorhouse quite appropriately since the sobriquet of you little bastard was said about him by quite a few people in his life rescued from the orphanage and poorhouse ending a promising career of oakumpicking and flaxpounding for no apparent good reason by his true father sir hugo st george willoughby of st james parish st james square unfortunately not the good side knight of the garter excaptain th regiment of foot the kings own member whites almacks hellfire club and the society for the diminution of the spread of venereal diseases there is a long biographical gulf between and for lack of information but since most childhoods are wretchedly uninteresting who bloody cares the american colonies rebel alan lewrie discovers what a goosegirl will do for a shilling and chambermaids and mopsqueezers may do for free if one can only run fast enough to catch them entered into westminster school obviously to get him out of the neighborhood instead of being tutored at home with his halfsister belinda and halfbrother gerald expelled same year for licentious behavior though he did post some decent marks entered eton expelled eton see above entered harrow expelled harrow as above but with the codicil that he was implicated in a plot to blow up the governors coach house in youthful admiration for the gunpowder plot there was no mention in the school records of licentious behavior this time so we must assume that such goingson were not taken as seriously at harrow as at other places in those days nabbed in flagrante delicto with his aforementioned halfsister belinda willoughby for once this incident was not his fault well not totally anyway booted from the bosom so to speak of his family with one hundred guineas a year and told never to show his face in society or the family digs again turned over to an officer of the navy impress service and entered the royal navy as a midshipman in portsmouth january signed aboard hms ariadne rd rate sixtyfour guns capt ezekiel bales seven months atlantic convoy duties during this time he became believe it or not a passably competent midshipman which says volumes for the return of corporal punishment in schools and flogging as a spur to proper naval discipline july ariadne fights a bloody battle with a disguised spanish twodecked ship and upon arrival at antigua in the leeward islands is adjudged too damaged to repair her captain and first officer are courtmartialed for her loss the third officer for cowardice none of this was alan lewries fault either in fact he acquitted himself well under fire on the lower gun deck and won some small fame for his coolness in action though readers of the kings coat remember his behavior differently especially his wish to go below and hide among the rum casks august appointed midshipman into hm sloop parrot lt james kenyon master and commander there followed five months of enjoyable duties wenching and swilling all over the caribbean and atlantic coast january a new personal best of two older ladies in kingston jamaica in two days but during a week on passage for antigua he became second officer when almost everyone senior went down with yellow fever saved the ship from a french privateer brig burning her to the waterline in the process saved a titled royal commissioner and his lady who were their passengers almost had the leg over the lady and came down with yellow fever himself a damned trying week in all februarymarch recovering on antigua then staffserf to rear adm sir onsley matthews met wooed and fell in thrall with the admirals niece miss lucy beauman fought a duel for her honor her family was awfully rich killed his opponent and was posted to sea before he could say jackketch april to presentmidshipman into hm frigate desperate th rate twenty guns comdr tobias treghues one of gods own cuckoos several successful raiding cruises raid on the danish virgin islands many prizes taken battle of the chesapeake siege of yorktown from which he escaped or we wouldnt be following his career any longer would we evacuation of wilmington north carolina november see the french admiral made acting masters mate confirmed in december one might just mention in passing a smallish theft from a captured french prize a trifling sum really of oh some two thousand guineas more ren contres with young ladies of the willing or commercial persuasion just to keep his hand so to speak in and one surprisingly chaste bout of amour with a penniless young loyalist a miss caroline chiswick chaste perhaps because he had served ashore with her two tory soldierbrothers and knew what he could expect if he ever ran into them in a dark alley chaste perhaps because theres damned few places to put the leg over even the most obliging female aboard a man o war or chaste perhaps because he had seen the light become a better person for his service in the navy and really did like her and through her found a new respect for womankind andbut no we have deduced a pattern here and a mans usually true to his nature when the bloods up damme if he aint one more annoyingly minor matter of biographical minutia before we proceed to the flashy stuff and i promise broadsides before you can say jackketch the alleged rape of his halfsister was discovered to be a theatric staged by his father sir hugo to gain unlimited access to a positive shower of guineas from the lewrie side of the family but sir hugo was diddled in return by alans grandmother who obstinately refused to go toesup at the proper moment and alan lewrie ended up smelling like hungary water with two hundred pounds per annum remittance since this last involves so much stupendously boresome legal mustification we hope the reader will appreciate the chronicler cutting that short as he goes bleary pondering the matter himself
