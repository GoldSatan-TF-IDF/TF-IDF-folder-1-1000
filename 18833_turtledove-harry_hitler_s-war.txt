harry turtledove hitlers war july outside lisbon general jose sanjurjo was a short heavyset man in his early sixties he looked from the light plane to the pilot and back again is everything in readiness he asked his tone saying heads would roll if the pilot told him no major juan antonio ansaldo didnt tell him anything not right away ansaldo was pacing back and forth his agitation growing with every stride he watched as sanjurjos aides shoved two large heavy trunks into the airplane those look heavy ansaldo said at last they hold the generals uniforms an aide said as if to a simpleton on the eve of his victorious march into madrid he cant arrive in burgos without uniforms nervously ansaldo lit a cigarette who was he a major to tell spains most seniorand most prestigiousgeneral what to do hed placed himself at the disposal of the spanish statewhich sanjurjo would embody once he flew from portugal to burgos to take charge of the rising against the spanish republic when he flew to burgos if he flew to burgos the city in northcentral spain was a long way from lisbon the plane a twoseater had only so much fuel and only so strong a motor general ansaldo said what is it growled the man people called the lion of the rif because of his victories in spanish morocco viva sanjurjo the generals men shouted viva espana sanjurjo preenedas well as a short heavyset man in his sixties could preen now i know my flag is waving over spain he boomed like a courting grouse when i hear the royal march again i will be ready to die that gave major ansaldo the opening he needed general i dont want you to die before you get to spain before you hear the royal march again what are you talking about sanjurjo demanded sir those trunks your men put aboard what about them theyre my uniforms as my aides told you a man is hardly a man without his uniforms at the moment sanjurjo was wearing a light gray summerweight civilian suit he looked and acted quite manly enough for ansaldo they weigh a lot the pilot gestured look at the pine trees all around the airstrip i need the planes full power to take off i have to make sure i have enough fuel to fly you to burgos i dont want anything to happen to you senor spain needs you too much to take chances general sanjurjo frownednot fearsomely but thoughtfully i cant fly into burgos like this he brushed at the gray linen of his sleeve why not your excellency why not ansaldo asked dont you think the people of burgos would be delightedwould be honoredto give you anything you need arent there any uniforms in burgos god help the rising if thats true god help the rising sanjurjo crossed himself major ansaldo followed suit the general took a gold case from an inside jacket pocket and lit a cigarette of his own he smoked in abrupt savage drags so you think well crash with my uniforms on board do you when youre flying you never know the pilot answered thats why you dont want to take any chances you dont have to sanjurjo grunted he took a couple of more puffs on the aromatic turkish cigarette then ground it out under his heel luis orlando he called get the trunks off the plane his aides stared as if they couldnt believe their ears are you sure your excellency one of them asked of course im sure dammit by the way jose sanjurjo spoke he was always sure and so he probably was spain comes first and spain needs me more than i need my uniforms as the pilot here says there are many uniforms por dios amigos there is only one sanjurjo the general struck a pose the aides didnt argue any more they did what sanjurjo told them to do wrestling the trunks out of the planes narrow fuselage proved harder than stuffing them in had been it took a lot of bad language and help from three other men before they managed it major ansaldo wondered how many kilos hed saved fifty a hundred he didnt know and he never wouldno scale was close by but now he would fly with the kind of load the light plane was made to carry he liked that if your excellency will take the righthand seat he said certainly sanjurjo was as spry as a man of half his age and half his bulk after ansaldo started the motor he ran through the usual flight checks everything looked good he gave the plane all the throttle he could he needed to get up quickly to clear the trees beyond the far edge of the bumpy field when he pulled back on the stick the nose lifted the fixed undercarriage left the ground the bumping stopped the air for the moment was smooth as fine brandy a slow smile spread across general sanjurjos face do you know what this is major he said a miracle thats what to fly like a bird like an angel its only an airplane sir said ansaldo as matteroffact as any pilot worth his pay only an airplane sanjurjos eyebrows leaped and a woman is only a woman it is an airplane that takes me out of exile an airplane that takes me out of portugal an airplane that takes me away from the hisses and sneezes and coughs of portuguese si senor major ansaldo knew how the general felt there if a spaniard and a portuguese spoke slowly and clearly or if they wrote things out they could generally manage to understand each other but portuguese always sounded funnysounded wrong in a spaniards ears the reverse was also bound to be true but the pilot never once thought of that and his important passenger hadnt finished it is an airplane that takes me back to spain back to my countryand spain will be my country once we settle with the republican rabble it iswhat does matthew saya pearl of great price he crossed himself again so did juan antonio ansaldo you have the soul of a poet your excellency he said general sanjurjo smiled like a cat in front of a pitcher of cream ansaldo did too but only to himself a little judicious flattery especially flattery from an unexpected direction never hurt but he also had a serious point to make im glad you chose not to endanger the planeand yourself a more valuable pearlwith those trunks spain needs you well yes sanjurjo agreed complacently who would command the forces of the right the forces of truth against the atheists and communists and liberals in the republic if anything happened to me millan astray i dont think so sir ansaldo exclaimed and that wasnt flattery astray the founder of the spanish foreign legion was a very brave man colonial fighting had cost him an arm and an eye he still led the legion whose war cry was viva la muerte long live death men like that were valuable in the officer corps but who would want such a skeletal fanatic leading a country bueno i dont think so either yes sanjurjo sounded complacent all right and why not when he held the rising in the palm of his hand he couldnt resist throwing out the name of another possible replacement or what about general franco not likely your excellency again major ansaldo meant what he said no one had ever questioned francisco francos courage either even if he wasnt so showy about displaying it as millan astray was but the plump little general was no great leader of men with sanjurjos personality he could stand besidecould at need stand up tomussolini and hitler franco franco had all the warmth all the excitement of a canceled postage stamp no not likely at all general sanjurjo said once i get to burgos the true business of setting spain to rights can begin si senor ansaldo said once more the light plane droned on toward spain toward burgos toward victory toward the birth of a whole new world september munich adolf hitler was not a happy man oh yes he was going to get czechoslovakia the british and french had come here to hand him his hateful neighborwhat an abortion of a country one more crime of versaillesall trussed up on a silver platter ready for the slaughter but for all the fuss the sudeten germans had kicked up inside czechoslovakia fuss orchestrated from the reich to hitler the slavic state wasnt an end in itself only a means to an end the end was dominating europe had that required dropping the sudeten german party hed fed and watered for so long he would have dropped it like a live grenade getting his hands on czechoslovakia would be nice yes what he really wanted though was war he was ready he was convinced the enemy wasnt chamberlain and daladier wouldnt have been so pathetically eager to sell their ally down the river if they were the trouble was they were too damned eager they kept falling all over themselves to make whatever concessions he demanded the more they yielded the less excuse he had to send in the wehrmacht his generals would be relieved if he got what he wanted without fighting he wasnt happy with the halfhearted way so many of them were readying themselves and their units and mussolini while a good fellow had more chin than balls the duce kept insisting italy wasnt ready to take on england and france and wouldnt be for another two or three years dummkopf hitler muttered under his breath the real point the point mussolini didnt get was that england and france werent ready not only did they not want war their factories werent geared up for it and the russians were in even worse shape every day it seemed stalin knocked off a new general or a handful of them when the reds laid on a purge they didnt fool around general sanjurjo got it spain stood foursquare behind germany well actually spain stood about twoandahalfsquare behind germany the communists and anarchists of the republic still hung on to the rest of the battered country but sanjurjo had a proper spanish sense of honor and obligation he would do what he could against his benefactors enemies the time was now the fuhrer could feel it in his bones of all the gifts a great ruler had knowing when to strike was one of the most vital hed shown he had it when he got rid of ernst rohm in the night of long knives and again when he swallowed austria in the anschluss oh all rightthe beerhall putsch hadnt quite worked out but that was fifteen years ago now back in those days he was still learning which end was up he was ready to fight the wehrmacht and the luftwaffe were ready even if some generals tried dragging their feet even if the french and english did declare war when he hit czechoslovakia he was sure they wouldnt do anything much in the west theyd wait theyd ditherand then as soon as hed stomped the czechs into the mud hed turn around and smash them too yes he was ready but tall storknecked chamberlainwith daladier scuttling along in his wake like a squat swarthy little halftrained puppywas also ready ready to hand him czechoslovakia without any fighting at all the british prime minister was so abject about the whole business even the hardbitten fuhrer would have been embarrassed to order the panzers to roll forward and the bombers to take off chamberlain damn his gawky soul gave away so much hitler couldnt very well demand more there was no more to give and so they played out the charade here in munich hitler and mussolini chamberlain and daladier sat down together and calmly arranged for the transfer of the sudetenlandand its mountain barriers and its fortifications second only to those of the maginot linefrom czechoslovakia to germany without those works the czechs hadnt a prayer of being able to fight they knew it too theyd sent a couple of nervous observers to munich to learn their fate the czechs cooled their heels at a distant hotel the fuhrer wouldnt let them attend the conference the soviet union was similarly excluded on with the farce then the fuhrerbau was the national socialists chief office building in munich hitler had taken a major role in its design but it wasnt a full success a hundred yards long and fifty deep it was only three stories high to an uncharitable observer it looked like nothing so much as an overgrown barracks hall nevertheless hitler thought the big bronze eagle over the entryway particularly fine mussolini chamberlain and daladier were already there by the time the fuhrer and the interpreter paul otto schmidt came in so was goring in a fancy white uniformhed motored in with daladier the duce spoke with chamberlain in english and daladier in french he spoke german too after a fashion hitler who knew only his own language envied his fellow dictators linguistic skills he consoled himself by noting how plain the handful of british and french aides in civilian clothes appeared in contrast to his uniformed henchmen and mussolinis hitler led the heads of government into his office the big oblong room had a fireplace at one end with a portrait of bismarck above it lightcolored chairs and a matching sofa faced the fireplace there were no name tagsnot even any pads and pencils for taking notes there was no agenda discussion darted where it would everyone already had a good notion of how things would end up now that we are all here we must decide soon hitler said and smacked one fist into the palm of the other hand but things moved more slowly than he wanted them to the heads of the two leading democracies had to get their views on record the fuhrer supposed that was for domestic consumption it wouldnt change anything here his temper began to fray you know nothing of the dreadful tyranny the czechs exert over the sudeten germans he said loudly nothing i tell you they torture them showing no mercy they expel them by the thousands in panicstricken herds they have even forced the sudeten germans leader konrad henlein to flee from his native land one jump ahead of the gendarmes i shouldnt wonder daladier said dryly joke if you care to but i hitler stopped in surprise at a loud knock on the door whats going on neville chamberlain asked i dont know hitler answered after dr schmidt translated the question i left clear orders that we were not to be disturbed when he gave orders like that he expected them to be obeyed too but even for the fuhrer expectations didnt always match reality the knock came again louder and more insistent than before hitler sprang to his feet and hurried toward the door somebody out there in the hallway was going to regret being born whatever hes selling tell him we dont want any mussolini said in his inimitable german daladier and chamberlain both smiled once the interpreters made them understand the crack hitler didnt hed never had much of a sense of humor and the interruption pushed him towards one of his volcanic eruptions of fury he flung the door open there stood colonel friedrich hossbach his adjutant well hitler growled ominously what is the meaning of thisthis interruption hossbach was a stoic man on the far end of middle age im sorry to bother you mein fuhrer but but what hitler demanded whatever the devil it is it had better be important yes sir i believe it is hossbach took a sheet of flimsy yellow paper from his left breast pocket here is a telegram we have just received you will know herr henlein has had to take refuge in the reich because of czech outrages of course of course the fuhrer said impatiently i was just now talking about his plight as a matter of fact whats going on with him colonel hossbach licked his lips sir he has been shot shot dead i should say the murderer is in custody he is a certain jaroslav stribny a czech sir his passport shows a prague address hitler stared at him in astonishment disbelief and then sudden crazy joy ich bin vom himmel gefallen he blurted ive fallen from heaven was what the words meant literally but what they really conveyed was his utter amazement what shall we do mein fuhrer hossbach asked nervously a moment later it was his turn to be amazed because hitler bussed him on both cheeks like a frenchman leave that to me my dear hossbach he answered oh yes leave that to me he was almost chortling as he turned back to the statesmen and officials and interpreters inside his office hed thought about getting rid of henlein to give himself a casus belli against czechoslovakia hed thought about it yes and put it aside it would have been too raw too unlikely for anyone to swallow but herr jaroslav stribny had just handed him that casus belli in a fancy package with a ribbon around it the reich would have to execute stribny as a murderer hitler understood the need and hed never been shy about disposing of anyone who needed disposing of all the same what he wanted to do was pin a medal on stribnys chest talk about advancing germanys cause what is it fuhrer mussolini asked by the look in your eye it is truly important whatever it is ja hitler said and the pause that followed gave him the chance to pull his thoughts together and figure out how best to use the extraordinary opportunity that had fallen into his lap truly important indeed colonel hossbach brings me word that konrad henlein whom i mentioned only a few minutes ago has been viciously and brutally assassinated assassinated by one jaroslav stribny of prague not content with forcing him out of the sudetenland the czechs followed him into germany and finished him off here dio mio mussolini exclaimed eyes bulging in astonishment dr schmidt translated for chamberlain daladier had his own interpreter the leaders of the two democracies gaped at the fuhrer chamberlain murmured something hitler looked sharply at schmidt he says he can hardly believe it mein fuhrer the translator said well i can hardly believe it either hitler said i can hardly believe the perfidy of the czech government the perfidy of the whole czech race that has brought things to such a pass you can surely see that we in the reich did everything we could to be reasonable to be generous toward czechoslovakia but what thanks do we get murder and i am afraid gentlemen that i see no choice but to avenge the insult with blood edouard daladier frowned hitler almost told him how ridiculous he looked with a few long pathetic strands of hair combed over a vast bald pate this seems too convenient for words daladier said too convenient for you too convenient for your aggression hitler almost told him he hadnt rubbed out henlein for just that reason but while he might have been so frank with mussolini whom he esteemed he felt only contempt for the miserable little frenchman before god and before the spirit of history i had nothing to do with it he declared monsieur daladier is right chamberlain said the advantage you gain from this almost surpasses belief believe whatever you please no hitler hadnt arranged for henleins elimination but he intended to use it oh yes warming to his theme he went on i have said all along that these slavs are not to be trusted i have said all along that they do not deserve nations of their own look what happened to archduke franz ferdinand in those murderous serbian maniacs plunged a continent into war and now the slavs have done it again this need not be neville chamberlain said urgently as a result of this most unfortunate incident i am sure we can extract more concessions from mr masarik and mr mastny the foreign ministry counselor and the czech minister to germany waited to hear what the great powers would decree for their country the british prime minister continued and i do not see how the government of czechoslovakia can fail to ratify whatever agreement we reach no hitler said not a soul can claim i was unwilling to meet you halfway your excellency my thought all along was that czechoslovakia deserved punishment for her arrogance and brutality but i restrained myself i convened this meeting at your request you persuaded me the czechs could be trusted far enough to make it worthwhile in this we were both mistaken he paused to let dr schmidt translate schmidt was an artist keeping a speakers tone as well as his meaning hitlers tone at the moment had iron in it so did the interpreters when he spoke english you could overlook the enormity if you chose chamberlain insisted when turning his words into german schmidt somehow sounded like a fussy old man henlein was after all a citizen of czechoslovakia not of the german reich he was a german hitler thundered loud and fierce enough to make every pair of eyes in the room turn his way he was a german he repeated a little more softly that is the whole point of what we have been discussing all the germans of the sudetenland belong within the reich because the czechs will not allow this and go on persecuting them we see disasters like this latest one i am very sorry your excellency very sorry indeed but as i said blood calls for blood as soon as i leave this office germany will declare war on czechoslovakia may monsieur daladier and i have a few minutes to confer with each other chamberlain asked adding the situation has changed quite profoundly in the past few minutes you understand would they throw czechoslovakia over the side because of what stribny had done if they would hitler was willing to give them as much time as they needed their turn would come next anyhow you may do as you please the fuhrer said i must ask you to step outside to talk though as i said i shall not leave the room without declaring war chamberlain daladier and their flunkies almost fell over one another in their haste to leave as soon as they were gone mussolini asked did you he left the question hanging but hitler knew what he meant nein he said roughly as he shook his head a lock of hair flopped down over one eye impatiently he pushed it back the czechs did it themselves they did it to themselves and they will pay by god they will pay italy still is not truly ready for this struggle the duce warned when the czechs murder the leader of an oppressed minority will you let them get away with it hitler asked in astonishment full of righteous indignation that the untermenschen should dare such a thing he forgot for the moment all his own murders they shouldnt mussolini admitted still england and france and russia russia what good is russia hitler said scornfully she doesnt even border czechoslovakia do you think the poles or the romanians will let her ship soldiers across their territory if she tries well have two new allies like that he snapped his fingers i suppose so mussolini still didnt sound convinced hitler was ready to argue with him all day but didnt get the chance chamberlain and daladier returned to the office both heads of government looked thoroughly grim their aides even grimmer daladier spoke for them i regret to have to say that if germany attacks czechoslovakia the french republic and the united kingdom will honor their commitments to their ally we cannot believe that the murder of monsieur henlein is anything but a trumpedup provocation peace and war then lie entirely in your hands hitler almost screamed wild laughter he wanted war yes but to have the leaders of the democracies ready to fight him because they were sure hed done something of which he was entirely innocentif that wasnt irony what was i must tell you you are making a dreadful mistake he said that czech that stribny murdered herr henlein on his own i had nothing to do with it germany had nothing to do with it henlein left czechoslovakia and entered the reich because he feared for his own safety and now we see he had reason to fear if anyone inspired stribny it was the wicked slavs in prague just as the wicked slavs in belgrade inspired gavrilo princip a generation ago every single word of that was the gospel truth but it fell on deaf ears he could tell as much even while dr schmidt was translating chamberlain and daladier had made up their minds if he told them the sun was shining outside they would call him a liar chamberlain murmured something in english what did he say hitler asked sharply he said and then you wake up mein fuhrer schmidt replied what does that mean its slang sir it means he doesnt believe you donnerwetter hitler could see the allies propaganda mill spewing out endless lies they would shout that he was a murderer that hed got rid of his own henchman to start a war they would make him look bad to all the neutrals in europe and asia and the americas the allies had trounced germany and austriahungary in the propaganda war during the world war now they had a great chance to do it again if you are truly innocent of this crime then do not assume the guilt of plunging the world into battle because of it daladier said this is madness hitler cried if i had ordered henlein killed maybe a guilty conscience would keep me from taking advantage of it but my conscience is clean of this anyhow he added but only to himself he got angrier by the word as he went on konrad henlein must have vengeance the sudeten germans must have vengeance germany to which they were about to return must have vengeance czechoslovakia must be punished if you want to line up behind a pack of skulking cowardly assassins go aheadand be damned to you mein fuhrer goring began no hitler roared he was in full spate now nothing could stop him or even slow him down they want war they can have war they will have war warwar war war he threw open the doors to his office is everything all right mein fuhrer one of the guards asked we could hear you shouting so even the thick oak doors hadnt muffled him well too bad it is war he bellowed colonel hossbach ja mein fuhrer his adjutant said begin case green immediately war with czechoslovakia now yes hitler had what he most wanted handed to him by of all people a czech chapter guns thundered on both sides of the ebro general sanjurjos fascists had modern german and italian pieces guns that could put a shell on an outspread blanket five miles away the republic had a few russian howitzers that werent bad the rest were the artillery pieces the republicans had started the fight with after more than two years of civil war they kept only vestiges of their original riflingand they werent such hot stuff back when they were new crouching in a foxhole west of the ebro chaim weinberg decided he feared his own sides guns more than the fascists when the enemy spaniards or their german advisers opened up at least you had a good notion of what they were shooting at if it wasnt you you could relax but when the republican artillery started shooting you always needed to be on the jump those shells might come down on the fascists heador they might come down on yours you never could tell neither could the poor sorry bastards firing the guns arent you glad we came from the states asked mike carroll another volunteer from the lincoln battalion before chaim could answer somebodys shell burst much too close shrapnel and shards of shattered stone screamed through the air he listened for shrieks but didnt hear any luck nothing but dumb frigging luck arent you carroll persisted chinga tu madre chaim told him he wouldnt have said anything like that even in english before he sailed to spain well he was a new man now that new man needed a shave at the moment he also needed a razor he was scrawny and hungry he was filthy he was lousy but damned if he wasnt new hed never fired a rifle before he got to spain hell hed never even handled a rifle he could fieldstrip his mauser blindfolded now hed started out with a crappy french piece and got this much better german one off a dead nationalist soldier keeping it in cartridges was a bitch but keeping the french rifle in ammo would have been a bitch too logistics was only a bitter joke to the republicans the shelling went on but none of the other rounds burst close enough to make him pucker he lit a cigarette the tobacco was allegedly french it smelled like horseshit it tasted the way he imagined smoldering horseshit would taste too no pasaran mike said and then gimme one of those here chaim handed him the pack mike took a smoke from it he leaned close to chaim to get it going after his first drag he made a face boy thats rotten uhhuh chaim held out his hand palm up reluctantly his buddy returned the cigarettes chaim stuck them back in the breast pocket of his ragged khaki tunic only thing worse than rotten tobaccos no tobacco at all no kidding mike said chaim took a cautious look out of the trench nothing special was going on in the nationalist lines a few hundred yards awayeverybody here talked about meters but they seemed like play money to him the shelling was justshelling a few people on both sides would get maimed or killed and it wouldnt move the war any closer to the end not even a nickels worth no pasaran chaim echoed theyd fucking better not pass not here or were butchers meat he sucked in more smoke hell were dead meat anyway sooner or later i still hope its later though yeah me too mike carroll sounded like boston before he came to spain hed worked in a steel mill somewhere in massachusetts that was what he said anyway a lot of guys had stories that didnt add up chaim didnt get all hot and bothered about it he didnt tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth about himself either the only thing that really mattered was that you hated fascism enough to hop on a boat and try to do something about it amazing thing is the republics still in there kicking chaim said mike nodded general sanjurjo and his pack of reactionary bastards must have thought their foes would fall apart in nothing flat who could have blamed them they had the trained troops and they had mussolini and hitlerwhich meant italian and german materiel and soldierson their side but it didnt pan out that way the brutal farce of noninterference kept the republicans from getting munitions and reinforcements like the rest of the men in the lincoln battalion chaim and mike had to sneak over the border from france dodging patrols every step of the way russia sent arms and advisers though not enough to offset what the fascists fed sanjurjo and the republicans squabbled among themselves did they ever anarchists and trotskyists didnt like admitting that since stalin was paying the piper he could call the tune they also complained that communist units got the best weapons chaim was a party member even if hed left his card in new york city when he sailed most though not all of the foreign volunteersmen from every corner of the earthwere but the spaniards themselves did the bulk of the fighting and dying an airplane buzzed by overhead chaim automatically started to duck german and italian aircraft ruled the skies but this was a republican plane a russian biplane fighter its blunt forward profile made the spaniards call it chato flatnosed it dove to shoot up the nationalists trenches then scooted off to the east bout time those mothers caught it for a change mike said yeah chaim agreed doubtfully but now well get it twice as hard to make up you know the spaniards on both sides thought like that and fought like that it made for a rugged kind of combat mike started to answer before he could a runner came up from the rear yelling war war mike and chaim started laughing like maniacs the fuck ya think were in now chaim said a ladies sewing circle no goddammita big war the runner said the munich giveaway just fell apart a czech murdered some sudeten nazi big shot inside germanythats what hitler says anyway and hes gonna jump on czechoslovakia and england and france cant back down now and if they get in the russians do too holy jesus mike said chaim nodded if the gloves came off in the rest of europe theyd have to come off in spain toowouldnt they no more noninterference hot damn maybe things here just evened up corporal vaclav jezek crouched in a hastily dug trench just in front of troppau if the germans camewhen they camethis was one of the places theyd hit hardest slice through here in the north push through from what had been austria till a few months ago down in the south and you would bite czechoslovakia in half then you could settle with the czechs in bohemia and moraviathe important part of the country as far as vaclav was concernedat your leisure the czechoslovakian general staff wasnt blind or stupid some of the heaviest fortifications in the whole country lay along this stretch of the border if vaclav stood up in the trench he could see them big rounded squarish lumps of reinforced concrete that had good fields of fire from high ground and plugged valleys through which tanks might otherwise charge freely he didnt stand up his khaki uniform and brown bowlshaped helmet offered good camouflage but they werent perfect somewhere on the other side of the border some bastard in a fieldgray uniform and a black coalscuttle helmet would be sweeping the area with heavyduty field glasses vaclav didnt want him marking this position trucks and teams of horses rushed machine guns and cannon and ammunition to the czechoslovak forts not all of them were done yet the government hadnt really got serious about them till the anschluss but with nazi troops in austria czechoslovakia was surrounded on three sides without fortifications it wouldnt last long it might not last long with them but they gave it the bestlikely the onlychance it had maybe the german with the field glasses wouldnt be able to see too much it was cool and overcast with a little mist in the air autumn in central europe sure as hell but some of the sudeten shitheads were bound to be sneaking over the border to tell their cousins on the other side what was going on here if vaclav ran the world he would have shipped them out or shot them to nip that crap in the bud but would the big shots listen to a corporal who drove a taxi in prague before he got called up fat chance the air might be cool and moist but he smelled burning bridges all the same diplomats were going home by plane and train armies that hadnt been mobilized were getting ready for the big plunge the poles damn them were concentrating opposite teschen spelled three different ways depending on whether you were a german a czech or a pole didnt they see they were the next course on hitlers menu if they didnt how stupid were they got a smoke on you corporal asked jan dzurinda one of the soldiers in vaclavs squad sure jezek held out the pack dzurinda took a cigarette then waited expectantly for a light with a small sigh vaclav struck a match dzurinda leaned close and got the cigarette started he took a deep drag then blew out two perfect smoke rings thanks a bunch much obliged any time vaclav said dzurinda puffed away without a care in the world blowing more smoke rings just hearing his voice made corporal jezek worry jan was a slovak not a czech czech and slovak were brother languages but they werent the same czechs and slovaks could tell what you were as soon as you opened your mouth and czechs and slovaks werent the same either czechs thought of slovaks as hicks rubes country bumpkins before the world war slovakia had been in the hungarian half of austriahungary and the hungarians made a point of keeping the slovaks ignorant and down on the farm things had changed since but only so much the czechoslovakian army had something like general officers just one was a slovak if slovaks were rubes to czechs czechs were city slickers to slovaks a lot of slovaks thought the czechs who were twice as numerous ran czechoslovakia for their own benefit they thought slovakia got hind tit and wanted more autonomymaybe outright independencefor it vaclav had no idea whether jan belonged to father hlinkas slovak peoples party the main nationalist outfit hlinka had died six weeks before but another cleric father tiso was heading the party now the nazis had brownshirts the slovak peoples party had hlinka guards if the shooting started how hard would jan dzurinda and thousands more like him fight for czechoslovakia a lot of slovak peoples party men figured berlin would give them what they wanted if prague didnt if you thought that way how loyal would you be toward your nominal country since vaclav didnt know and didnt want to ask straight out he lit a cigarette of his own the harsh smoke relaxed hima little he said at least weve weeded most of the germans out of the army the sudetens damn well werent loyal theyd made that plain enough well sure jan dzurinda said which might mean anything or nothing corporal jezek decided to push a little harder if the slovaks were going to run off or give up first chance they got how could the army hope to defend czechoslovakia the noncom said now we have to run off the buggers on the other side of the frontier eh reckon so dammit dzurinda did sound like a hick he went on anybody tries to shoot me i expect i better nail him first sounds good to me jezek decided he had to be content with that he could have heard plenty worse from a slovak up and down the lines how many worried czech noncoms and lieutenants and captains were hearing worse from slovaks right about now how many who werent hearing worse were being lied to he muttered to himself and lit another cigarette and wished his canteen held something stronger than water forward sergeant ludwig rothe called softly he laughed at himself as the panzer ii crawled toward the start line through the darkness of the wee small hours with all the motors belching and farting around him he could have yelled his head off without giving himself away to the czechs on the other side of the border he rode head and shoulders out of the turret he had to if he wanted to see where he was going they said later models of the panzer ii would boast a cupola with episcopes so the commander could look around without risking his life whenever he did that didnt do him any good all he had was a twoflapped steel hatch in the top of the turret engineers had set up white tapes to guide panzers and personnel carriers to their assigned jumpingoff points the whole third panzer division was on the move hell the whole wehrmacht was on the move near enough oh there were covering forces on the border with france and smaller ones on the polish frontier and inside east prussia but everything that mattered was going to teach the czechs they couldnt mess around with good germans unlucky enough to be stuck inside their lousy country other panzersmore iis and the smaller panzer iswere dim shapes in the night ludwig affectionately patted his machine the panzer ii was a great improvement over the i the drivers voice floated out through the speaking tube kinda hate to leave katscher found this little waitress thereshe doesnt know how to say no jesus fritz rothe said dyou pass shortarm inspection fritz bittenfeld chuckled doesnt hurt when i piss so i guess everythings all right wonderful the panzer commander muttered fritz only laughed the third member of the crewthe radio operator theo kesslersat in the back of the fighting compartment the only way he could see out was through peepholes ludwig wasnt sure whether he couldnt hear the conversation or just ignored it but then he wasnt sure about theo a lot of the time halt the command floated out of the night rothe relayed it to bittenfeld who was driving buttoned up the panzer stopped they were where they were supposed to beunless some czech infiltrator was screwing them over rothe shook his head natural to be nervous before the balloon went up but that was pushing things nothing left to do but wait ludwig pushed back the sleeve of his black panzer coveralls to get a look at the radiumglowing hands on his watch a quarter to four right on time everything was supposed to start at that gave him something else to worry about it would still be almost dark if the clouds overhead lingered it might really be dark and if the clouds lingered the luftwaffe wouldnt be able to do as much as it was supposed to how could you see what to bomb and shoot up if low clouds and fog blotted out the landscape this kind of weather was normal for this time of year ludwig hoped the fellows with the general staffs red stripes on their trousers knew what the hell they were up to if they didnt a lot of good landers would get buried in makeshift graves with only a rifle and a helmet for a headstone as if picking that thought out of his head fritz said the fuhrer knows what hes doing those dirty czechs they deserve everything well give em they cant go murdering people inside germany sure ludwig said he thought the czechs had a lot of nerve bumping off konrad henlein too but he was fretting about how much the wehrmacht would take not what it would dish out again theo didnt say a thing well he didnt have a speaking tube to fritz and hed been wearing his earphones rothe wondered why radio silence was bound to be tighter than fritzs waitress works the only signal that might come was one calling everything off because peace had broken out the panzer commander didnt expect that nobody else did either ludwig looked at his watch again at this rate hed feel as if hed aged a year before things started happening he couldnt even smoke somebody out there would skin him alive if he showed a match and you had to be even more desperate for a butt than he was to light up inside the turret what with all the ammo in there nothing to do but wait and fidget as neared the sky slowly began to get light a few minutes before the hour he thought he heard thunder in the air then he realized it was nothing of the sort it was untold hundreds or thousands of airplane engines all of them roaring toward czechoslovakia fritz heard them too youd have to be deaf not to boy those czech assholes are really gonna catch it he said happily ja ludwig said and let it go at that behind them artillery started bellowing red flares leaped into the skythe go signal without waiting for an order fritz put the panzer ii in gear and started forward other panzers were heading for the borderheading over the bordertoo halfseen german soldiers trotted along with them clutching mausers and hunching low to make themselves smaller targets a shell burst a couple of hundred meters away maybe it was a short round more likely it was the goddamn czechs shooting back dirt and a couple of men flew up into the air poor bastards ludwig thought he wondered what would happen if a or a hit his panzer then he wished he hadnt more shells fell on the germans hed thought the opening bombardment would silence the enemy guns evidently not one shell did hit a little panzer i it slewed sideways and started to burn machinegun ammunition inside started cooking off poppoppop it sounded absurdly cheerful somebody in a khaki uniformalmost brown reallypopped up from a hole in the ground and fired at the germans they were over the border then ludwig traversed the turret and squeezed off a burst of machinegun fire at the czech soldier he didnt know whether he hit the man if he made him duck and stop shooting that would do things inside czechoslovakia didnt look much different from the way they did on the german side of the line the terrain was rugged one reason the czechs didnt want to give back the sudetenland was that the rough ground and the forts theyd built in it gave them their best shield against attack best or not it wouldnt be good enoughludwig hoped the panzer clanked past a house it looked like the ones inside the reich too well why not germans were germans on that side of the frontier or on this one past the house was a forest ludwig thought it seemed wilder than woods in germany would have the czechs probably didnt care for it the way they should or maybe they wanted it all jungly and overgrown a machine gun in there started spraying death at the german infantry when a bullet cracked past ludwigs ear he realized that machine gun could kill him too he ducked reflexively he almost pissed himself the czechs were playing for keeps all right they had more than machine guns in the woods too an antitank gun spat a long tongue of flame a panzer ii just like ludwigs caught fire a perfect smoke ring came out through the commanders hatch ludwig didnt see any of the crew get away do we go into that sergeant fritz asked ludwig understood why he hesitated open country was best for panzers out on the plains and meadows you could see trouble coming but somebodyd forgotten to issue a whole lot of plains and meadows to this part of czechoslovakia yes we do rothe answered our job is to smash through their defensive lines once we do that the rest of the country falls into our lap if they dont blow our balls off first that wasnt fritz it was theo so the radioman was listening after all ludwig would have come down on him for sounding defeatist if he werent so likely to be right into the woods other panzers were pushing forward too things were betteror seemed better anyhowwhen you had company there was of course the saying about misery a bullet struck sparks as it spanged off the panzers hull that left ludwig with a couple of really unpleasant choices if he stayed where he was he was much too likely to get shot but if he ducked down inside the turret and shut the hatch he would have the devils own time seeing where he was going all kinds of bad things were liable to happen to the panzer then he stayed where he was every so often he fired a short burst from his machine gun the other panzer commanders were doing the same thing foot soldiers banged away too with enough lead in the air the czechs would be too busy taking cover and dying to shoot back much he hoped boy did he the panzer ii emerged from the woods onto open ground that had taken a beating from bombs and artillery as soon as it did ludwig wished it hadnt because there sat a panzer i burning like nobodys business the commander had tried to get out of the turret but he hadnt made it something nasty lurked in the next stretch of trees there it is fritz screamed one oclock panzer goddamn czech panzer the czech lt was a light tank as its initials suggested it was still bigger and heavier and better armored than a panzer ii and the bastard carried a mm gun a real cannon that could fire a real he round as well as armorpiercing ammo the panzer iis cm main armament had decent ap rounds but they just werent big enough to carry a useful amount of high explosive one good thing about the panzer iis little gun though it was an automatic weapon firing from tenround magazines ludwig traversed the turret toward the lt all the while wishing for a power assist hed just about brought the gun on target when the czechs fired their ap round chewed a groove in the field a few meters to his left theyd be reloading as fast as they could his x sight brought the target a lot closer the trigger was on the elevating wheel he squeezed off a fourround burst smoke rose from the czech tank hit fritz yelled you hit the son of a bitch do you have to sound so surprised actually ludwig was surprised hed hit the panzer at all the gun was noisy enough to make him glad he was sober come onput the beast back in gear we dont want to hang around in one spot or some other bastardll draw a bead on us he breathed a sigh of relief as the panzer raced toward the cover of the woods he hadnt wanted to go into the first belt but hed discovered being out in the open was dangerous too it was a war for christs sake everything was dangerous he just hoped it would be more dangerous for the czechs bombs started falling on marianske laznemarienbad if you liked the old german name betterat six oclock in the morning peggy druce hadnt gone to bed till three just because you were here to take the waters which smelled like rotten eggs tasted almost as bad and kept you on the pot like you wouldnt believe didnt mean you couldnt do other things too peggyd been playing fiery bridge with an english couple and a young man who might have come from almost anywhere everyone thought she was crazy for coming over from philadelphia with the war clouds thickening by the day even after henlein got shot shed poohpoohed the idea that things would actually go boom we already had one war this century shed said she remembered very precisely because she was squeezing every trick from a small slam in diamonds wasnt that enough to teach the whole world we dont need another one wellno the first explosions might almost have been mistaken for thunder the couple right after that burst much too close to the balmoralosborne hotel de luxe to leave any doubt about what they were they knocked peggy out of bed and onto the floor with a bump and a squawk she said something most unladylike when she scrambled up again because shed cut both feet on shards of glass that hadnt been there a moment before people were yelling and screaming andprobablyjumping up and down peggy threw a robe over her silk peignoir she made as if to rush for the door then caught herself her feet would be raw meat and gore if she tried the only shoes she could grab in a hurry were last nights heels theyd have to do out she wentbut not without her handbag which held passport and cash and travelers checks everybody else in the hall was in the same state of dishabille people dashed for the elevator the lift everyone called it here in the english fashion peggy was almost there when the lights went out shrieks filled the air as darkness descended she turned around and went the other way against the confused tide if the lights werent working the goddamn elevator wouldnt either the stairs werethat way peggy liked to think she looked ten years younger than her fortyfive she hadnt put on weight and peroxide kept her hair about the same color it had always been but in spite of her misplaced optimism the night before she had a coldly practical streak when she was peggy eubank growing up a devil of a long way from the main line her mother told her kid youre eleven going on twentyone if mom had been half as smart as she thought she was she wouldve been twice as smart as she really was but shed hit that nail right on the head and sothe stairs peggy found the door as much by braille as any other way the stairwell wasnt very light either somebody bumped into her and said excusezmoi dont worry about it peggy said and then cest la guerre and wasnt that the sad and sorry truth gray earlymorning light spilled out of the door that led to the lobby three flights of stairs had made peggys feet start to hurt but more broken glass crunched under her soles she would hurt worse if she took off the heels the lobby looked like hell and smelled pretty bad too it reminded her of a butchers shop with a whole bunch of fresh meat some of this meat came in trousers and dresses and nightclothes though stewards and bellhopsthey had different titles here but basically the same jobswere doing what they could to help the wounded one of them was noisily sick on the floor which only made the stink worse and in what looked at first like a scene from a three stooges tworeeler a couple of men near the front desk were punching and kicking each other and poking each other in the eye even with more bombs going off not terribly far away they went at it hammer and tongs but one of them swore in czech the other in guttural german the big war had started and so had their own little private one mon dieu exclaimed a man standing next to peggy his voice said he was the fellow whod bumped her on the stairs cest he broke off at a loss for words its hell on wheels peggy said you understand comprenez yes but what am i to do he spoke good british english i was for two years a prisoner in the last war if the boches come here they will intern me again as an enemy alien i do not wish this at all if the germans came to marianske lazne no when they came the border wasnt more than a long spit to the west peggy had her passport the united states was neutral the nazis would treat her better than that poor frenchmanif they or the czechs didnt blow her to the moon while they were bashing each other over the head right this minute that looked like a pretty big if maybe you can get a train out of town if you hustle she said it could be mademoiselle he said not noticing the ring on her finger herb was still in philadelphia hed been set to join her in paris in a couple of weeks well that wouldnt happen now all kinds of things wouldnt happen and all kinds of worse ones would the man went on will you accompany me this is no moreno longera good place to be he was dead rightno live rightabout that lets go peggy said as soon as she got her first look at a bomb crater she wasnt sure outside was the best place to be marianske lazne sat in a valley with pines and firs all around the hotels and other buildings were mostly austrohungarian leftovers from before the war before the last war she thought they had more architectural gingerbread than the wicked witchs house in the grimm fairy tale right now peggy was trapped in a grim fairy tale of her own some of those buildings had chunks bitten out of them several were burning wounded people bodies and pieces of bodies lay in the streets and everybody who wasnt wounded or blown to bits seemed to be running toward the train stations all kinds of people took the waters here some were ordinary czechs and slovaks some were germans some came from other european countries peggy spotted half a dozen jews in long black coats and widebrimmed black hats if the frenchman beside her didnt want to deal with the germans they really didnt want toand who could blame them there was a shriek in the air getting louder by the moment the frenchman knocked her down and lay flat on top of her she started to scream then more explosions shook marianske lazne and she realized he hadnt gone mad and wasnt trying to assault her right out in the middle of the street artillery he bawled in her ear when you hear that sound for gods sake get down peggy did scream then but on a note different from the one she might have used a moment earlier through the shell bursts she heard more shrieks mens and womens and lord only knew whose something warm and wet and sticky splashed her hand she looked at it it was bloodnot hers or she didnt think so with a little disgusted cry she wiped it off her robe no not hers no more welled out more and more shells landed on and around marianske lazne how many guns did the germans have anyway make it stop she yelled to the frenchman jesus make it stop i wish i could mademoiselle he replied peggy heard guns going off too in the woods around the spas the czechs were making a fight of it anyhow or trying to but marianske lazne was within artillery range of the border as she knew much much too well how long could this little country hold off hitlers armored legions after what seemed forever the bombardment eased peggy raised her head and looked around she wished she hadnt her husband had fought in the great war hed never talked much about what hed done and what hed seen if it was anything like thispeggy understood why not she would spend the rest of her life wishing she could forget what artillery did to the civilians in marianske lazne she remembered one thing herb had said talking to someone else whod seen the elephant artillerythats the killer jesus he wasnt kidding as politely as she could she tapped the frenchman on top of her on the shoulder could you move please youre squashing me he had to weigh close to pounds and there was nothing between her and the sidewalk but two layers of silk i do apologize he said and rolled to one side this isvery bad very very bad but if you hear that sound in the air you must get down at once without hesitation it is your best chance to save yourself god forbid i ever hear it again peggy said the frenchman crossed himself no trains went out no trains came in maybe the germans had bombed the tracks maybe czechoslovakia was using the railroads to haul troops around peggy saw no duncolored czech uniforms in town every so often though the guns in the woods boomed what kind of forts lay between the border and marianske lazne how long would the germans take to break through them two good questions peggy had no good answers the town was full of clinics they werent equipped for carnage like this but they did their best unhurt people did what they could for the wounded peggy carried stretcher after stretcher she got more blood on her robe but hardly noticed the hotels set out the usual massive spread of cold cuts for breakfast she atesomewhere about ten oclock the mist retreated and a wan sun came out airplane motors throbbed overhead peggy looked up shed never seen anything like those ungainly vulturewinged planes before one after another they peeled off in dives it was fascinating to watch but the shrieks they let out as they dove reminded her of incoming artillery she got down as the polite but portly frenchman had said she should people gave her funny looksfor a few seconds till the first bomb went off and the vulturewinged planes started machinegunning the town as they zoomed away half a dozen czech biplane fighters showed up then they looked like last years models next to the vulturewinged jobs with the swastikas on their tails but they shot down two of them peggy wasnt the only one cheering her head off she went on lugging stretchers till her feet started to bleed somebody gave her a pair of flats they were too big but still an improvement she moved more casualties and more and more yet by midafternoon she heard smallarms fire off to the west it kept getting closer she feared she knew what that meant the germans were pushing the czechs back she spotted more of the nazi divebombers now that theyd delivered their terror message they were doing serious work pounding czech positions the hotels kept putting out food it was about all they could do one displayed a sign in several languages we have locked up our germans that was brave it might also have been stupid if the nazis rolled into town they wouldnt be happy when the nazis rolled in peggy feared that evening she got a blanket and a chair and counted herself lucky sleep wouldnt come no matter how exhausted she was she would have looked to play more bridge but fireplace and candles didnt give enough light the electricity stayed off she sat there and listened to the advancing gunfire about midnight czech soldiers fell back through marianske lazne one of them dirty weary harriedpeered into the hotel he shook his head and walked on the czechs didnt try to fight in the town peggy supposed she should have been grateful to them for not causing more civilian casualties she hoped it wouldnt hurt their defense rattling clanking german vehicles entered marianske lazne at czech cuckooclock time peggy went out to look she almost got shot a peremptory wave from a toughlooking blackuniformed man in a tank sent her reeling back into the hotel under new management she thought and finally started to cry luc harcourt didnt like sergeant demange what private in his right mind did like his sergeant demange was little and skinny and tough with a tongue sharper than a bayonet he looked unwontedly serious now as he gathered his squad together without preamble he said the french republic is at war with germany along with the rest of the men luc stared at the sergeant he was just a conscript himself all hed ever wanted to do was serve his time and get out the first thing he found out when he put on the uniform and the adrian helmet was that nobody gave a damn about what he wanted demange paused to light a gitane he even smoked like a tough guy with the cigarette hanging down from the corner of his mouth england is with us he said and the russians have declared war on germany too oh joy paul renouvin said he wasnt a bad guy but hed been at a university somewhere before the draft got him and he liked showing off how much he knew that would matter a lot more if russia bordered germany or even czechoslovakia sergeant demange looked as if he wanted to spit in renouvins eye he contented himself with blowing smoke in the college kids face shut up punk he rasped the point is weve got allies dammit so when we march into germany its not like were marching in all by ourselves we luc wondered we as in france or we as in this squad he wanted to knowit was his neck after all but he didnt ask one way or the other he figured hed find out pretty damn quick and he did we move out in half an hour the sergeant said remember were doing this for the poor goddamn czechs he sounded like a guy telling his girl theyd be doing it for love who cared why theyd be doing it what happens if the boches shoot at us somebody asked well were supposed to be cautious demange said but were supposed to move forward too so we will and well shoot back by god my father did this in luc said red kepi blue tunic red trousersthere are photos at home not color photos of course but you know what the colors were several of the other soldiers nodded so did sergeant demange they were targets thats what he said i did it myself in we wore horizonblue by then not as good as khakihe tapped his sleevebut christ better than red how many times your old man get wounded twice luc answered not without pride sounds about right he was luckier than a lot thats for goddamn sure demange glanced at his watch twenty minutes now if we arent marching at on the dot ill be in trouble and if im in trouble you sorry assholes are in big trouble luc wondered why was so sacred would the war be lost if they started five minutes late as far as czechoslovakia was concerned they were starting three days late the czechs said they were still fighting hard the germans claimed enormous victories somebody was lying maybe two somebodies were the border bulged south below saarbrucken at on the dotsergeant demange and his ilk knew how to get what they wantedfrench soldiers started moving into the bulge a few french guns fired at the german positions ahead a few german guns shot back both sides seemed halfhearted lou had been through much scarier drills fields on the german side of the border lookedsurprisejust like fields on the french side the only way luc could be sure hed crossed into germany was by looking over at a german frontier post abandoned now that lay athwart a twolane macadam road a few hundred meters off to the southeast soldiers from another company poked through the frontier station as if theyd just occupied berlin then without warning something over there went boom sergeant demange hit the dirt for a moment luc thought hed been hurt but then he got up and brushed wheat stubble off himself altogether unselfconscious you hear a noise like that you better get flat he remarked i bet those nazi cocksuckers boobytrapped the station something had blown out part of one wall now the french soldiers over there scurried around like ants in a disturbed hill luc saw one man lying in the roadway even from this distance he would have bet the poor bastard wouldnt get up again lesson number one the sergeant said if it looks like they want you to pick it up they probably do wouldnt be surprised if there are mines in these fields too merde alors luc muttered the very ground under his feet might betray him he tried to walk like a ballerina on tippytoe it didnt work very well in armyissue clodhoppers with a heavy pack on his back feeling foolish he gave up after a few steps a belt of trees lay ahead did germans lurk there sure as hell they did a spatter of rifle fire came from the woods after the first bullet cracked past him luc needed no urging to flatten out prone he fired back his mas slammed against his shoulder in between rounds he dug a scrape for himself with his entrenching tool very cautiously the french advanced they took a few casualties which made them more cautious yet the germans didnt make much of a fight though they melted back toward their fancy westwall it wasnt supposed to be as good as the maginot linenothing was not even the czech fortsbut everybody said it was tough even so when luc finally reached the woods he found several countrymen exclaiming over a dead german the redheaded guy in fieldgray had taken one in the chest he didnt look especially unhappyjust surprised luc wondered if hed killed the boche himself not likely but not impossible either he felt like a warrior and a murderer at the same time chapter it was six in the morning in peking which meant it was yesterday afternoon back in new york city corporal pete mcgill and several of the other marines at the american legation clustered in front of a shortwave set listening to the world series the yankees were up on the cubs two games to none they were leading in game three too joe gordon had already singled with the bases loaded and homered and hoot pearson was cruising along on the mound cubs are history mcgill said happilyhe was from the bronx three straight series for the yanks its gonna be nobodys ever done that before none of the other leathernecks argued with him he would have liked to see them try when the cubs got done losing today or yesterday or whatever the hell day it really was they would have to sweep four to take the championship nobody did that not against the bronx bombers a polack named herman szulcwhich he insisted was pronounced schultz said i bet they wont be as good next year oh yeah wise guy how come mcgill had brickred hair freckles and the temper that went with them and if you affronted his team you affronted him too only stands to reason shit look at gehrig szulc said he didnt even hit this year hes getting old wearing out nah hell be back strong you wait and see mcgill said sheesh a little bit of an off year for one guy and you want to write off the ballclub before the argument could go any further a chinese servant brought in a tray with coffee and sausages and rolls stuffed with this and that for the marines none of it except the coffee was what mcgill would have eaten in the states but it would all be tasty duty at the legation was as sweet as it got shehsheh wang szulc said as the servant set the tray down on a table that meant thank you in chinese mcgill had learned a few phrases too they came in handy every once in a while wang grinned a toothy grin several of his front teeth were gold a twentyfourcarat smile meant you were somebody here eat he saidhe knew bits of english the way the marines knew bits of chinese he waved at the tray hao that meant it was good and it was wonder whats in the sausages somebody said with his mouth full your mother somebody else came back which almost made pete squirt coffee out his nose the missing link szulc suggested that wasnt even so farfetched theyd found prehistoric human bones in these parts that were god only knew how old it also wasnt so farfetched for another reason chinamen would cook and eat damn near everything you could get snake it was supposed to be good for your oneeyed snake you could get dog which was also supposed to make john henry perk up you could get fried grasshoppers mcgill had eaten one once on a bet it wasnt even bad and he picked up five bucks crunching it out went the cubs again a singing commercial came on szulc fiddled with the radio dial what the hell you doing mcgill asked seeing if i can find some news between innings szulc answered check whats up with the war oh okay mcgill said the war was as important as the series back in the states people wouldnt have believed it mcgill was sure of that but back in the states people werent right around the corner from the japanese legation and its garrison of tough bastardsnot as tough as marines mcgill was sure but tough back in the states people were doing their best to forget the japs had bombed the crap out of the panay the december before even though she was flying the american flag japan apologized didnt she she paid an indemnity didnt she that made everything all right didnt it maybe soback in the states not in peking not even close back in the states people forgot the japs had a zillion more soldiers sitting in manchuria manchukuo they called the puppet state there these days if they decided they wanted a war with the usa how long would this garrison last hell back in the states most people didnt know it existed if the balloon goes up with the japs its my ass mcgill thought szulc got a couple of bursts of static then he found the bbc the announcer had a much posher accent than most of the royal marines at the british legation they called themselves leathernecks too and they made damn fine drinking buddies even if they did talk funny vakia continues to offer stout resistance to hitlers aggression the announcer said russian volunteers and aircraft have begun appearing in ruthenia and slovakia both poland and romania deny consenting to their crossing fuck i would too szulc said picking between hitler and stalins gotta be worsen the devil and the deep blue sea shut up already if you want to listen to the news somebody told him that supercivilizedsounding bbc announcer was continuing another day of fierce air raids against prague civilian casualties are said to be very heavy the czechoslovak government has condemned what it calls the barbarous german onslaught against defenseless noncombatants nice war mcgill muttered blasting the crap out of anything that got in your way wasnt anything the marines hadnt heard about and seen before the japs did it all the time here now that their war against china had heated up but you expected better from europeans somehow then again the difference between what you expected and what you got made a pretty good measure of how fucked up the world was czechoslovakia insists that reports of unrest in slovakia are greatly exaggerated uprisings by the socalled hlinka guardthe announcer read the name with fastidious distasteare being suppressed in bratislava radio prague declares and elsewhere in that area cmonput the ballgame back on said a big burly pfc named puccinelli and inevitably called pooch in a second szulc said hell get to the rest of the shit and then well go back pooch muttered to himself but didnt reach for the tuning dial himself france continues its advance into germany german resistance is termed light the bbc newsman said france has occupied the warndt forest and seized the towns of lauterwald and bubingen wherever the hell those are mcgill put in hed never heard of either one of them before that probably meant you could piss across them the limeys voice grew stern for the second night in a row air pirates from spain bombed hendaye and biarritz in southwestern france it is not yet known whether the bombers were flown by native spanish fascists of the sanjurjo junta or by nazis of the condor legion mercenary group in any case french aid to the rival spanish republican government including men munitions aircraft and tanks continues to flood across the pyrenees yeah it floods now after the frogs and the limeys spent years keeping it out max weinstein was a rare duck a pink almost red marine he wasnt real big but he was tough with politics like his he had to be he got into more than his share of brawls and won more than his share too prime minister chamberlain was in manchester today reassuring anxious citizens that despite the long difficult road ahead victory will inevitably herman szulc turned back to the world series the cubs had one out in the seventh they were going down the drain all right the same way the giants had in or wonder whether the japs are listening to the series or the bbc mcgill said it wasnt obvious japan was crazy for baseball on the fourth of july in three days before the fighting between japan and china broke out for reala marine team had played a doubleheader against a squad from the japanese garrison theyd split two games rougher than any john mcgraws orioles played back in the s wonder whether japan will go after russia like she means it if the russians start going at it hot and heavy with hitler szulc said that would be just like the damn japs max said and for once nobody wanted to argue with him japan and russia had been banging heads for a couple of years now up on the border between manchukuo and mongolia most of the official bulletins talked about manchukuan and mongolian soldiers but anybody who knew anything knew better the puppets wouldnt dance that way without their masters pulling the strings hey i hope the japs do go north pete said weinstein gave him a furious look before the champion of the soviet workers and peasants could start screaming mcgill went on if they dont theyll hit the usa and everybody here is fucking dead meat if they do max opened his mouth a moment later he closed it again nobody could say pete was wrong there japan occupied northern china these days she occupied all of peking except the legation quarter if she went to war with the united states the few hundred marines in the garrison wouldnt last long japanese soldiers were little and scrawny their equipment was nothing to write home about but they were rugged sons of bitches and there were swarms of them oh america would eventually kick the snot out of them eventually though was way too late to do anybody here any good sergeant hideki fujita hated manchukuo he hated mongolia even more and getting sent to the border between the japanese puppet state and the one the russians propped up combined the worst of both worlds japan claimed the border between manchukuo and mongolia lay along the halha river the mongolians and russians insisted it belonged a good many kilometers farther east japan and russia had banged heads along manchukuos borders before here and along the amur river and near korea where russian territory dipped down as far as vladivostok the mongolians had found a new game to get on their neighbors nerves they would light grass fires near the frontierwherever the hell it wasand let the prevailing westerlies sweep the flames into manchukuan territory naturally that made the locals come running to the japanese screaming that they should do something when you set up a puppet you had to hold him upright or else he wasnt worth anything not that fujita thought the manchukuans were worth anything but their countryto give it the benefit of the doubthad more timber than anybody knew what to do with it raised lots of rice and wheat and millet too and it drew ever more japanese colonists people who wanted more land and a better chance than theyd ever get in the overcrowded home islands whether the manchukuans did or not real japanese people needed protecting trouble was even if the border lay on the halha the way japan said it did the mongolians and russians still had the better of it the land west of the halha on the mongolian side stood fifty or sixty meters higher than it did over here high ground counted same as always only a couple of days earlier on october the mongolians had fired from the high ground at two dozen japanese surveyors riding through what was plainly japanese territoryif you accepted the japanese view of the frontier anyhow sergeant fujita did of course one of the other men in his little detachment a corporal named masanori kawakami asked excuse me sergeant san but would the mongolians harass us if the russians didnt want them to not bloody likely fujita said with a snort he was short and squat and toughthe kind of noncom whose men hated and feared him but couldnt help respecting him too the mongols cant wipe their raggedy asses unless some russian commissar says they can hai kawakami nodded he was younger than fujita a conscript rather than a career soldier thats what i thought funny they would do it with the war in europe heating up superior private shinjiro hayashi said whats that got to do with anything fujita rumbled ominously he wanted to boot hayashi around but sometimes even a sergeant in the imperial japanese army had to be careful yes hayashi was a conscript with no rights or privileges to speak of yes he was clumsy and foureyed and so deserved thumping more than most of the other soldiers but he was also a university student he talked like a damn professor a guy like that was bound to have connections if he complained sergeant fujita was too likely never to see anything but the dusty mongolian frontier for the rest of his days hayashi smiled now he liked explaining things if the russians really are fighting in czechoslovakiaa name that sounded very strange in japanesewhy would they also want to fight us a man with two enemies at the same time has trouble maybe fujita said with a grudging nod you can see thatbut youre almost as smart as you think you are he wouldnt give any praise without putting a sting in its tail are the dumb foreigners clever enough to see it too i think so sergeant san hayashi knew better than to piss fujita off on purpose lots of countries know the rules of diplomacy and war corporal kawakami pointed west i think i just saw something move sergeantthere about one oclock ill check it out fujita wore binoculars on a leather strap around his neck japanese optics were some of the best in the world hed looked through captured russian field glasses and they were crap pure junk hed also seen fancy german binocularsfrom zeiss no less those were okay but not a sens worth better than his own pair he scanned the plain on this side of the halha yellow dirt yellowishgreen grass the occasional bushthat was about it the steppe rolled on for countless kilometers then he spotted the horseman a mongolian he thought at once he had trouble knowing how he was so sure manchukuan cavalrymen rode the same kind of shaggy little steppe ponies they carried carbines slung on their backs too and wore the same mix of uniforms and native garb then fujita realized why he knew the horseman kept glancing back over his shoulder toward the east if he expected trouble it was from this direction yet he was the only man in sight lets reel him in fujita said hayashi fire two shots in the air two shots yes sergeant san superior private hayashi obeyed without question bang bang the reports rolled across the steppe fujita kept the field glasses on the rider when the fellow heard the gunshots he jerked in the saddle looked around wildly in all directions and started to grab for his weapon then he checked himself two more shots hayashi the sergeant said and well show ourselves if he comes in fine i think he will but if he doesnt we just have to deal with him bang bang the sergeant and the men from his squad stood up he waved he hoped the shots wouldnt draw artillery fire from the other side of the river if the horseman was what fujita thought he was the bastards over there might want to see him dead even if he was on this side of the linenot that they admitted the halha was the line anyway the mongolian looked back toward the other side of the river again too he wore a fur cap with earflaps up right nowthe day was mild after reaching under it to scratch his head he rode slowly toward the japanese soldiers as he got closer he waved his hand to show he was friendly then he must have decided that wasnt enough because he threw down the carbine he shouted something in his own language it sounded like dogs barking to fujita i dont know what the devil youre talking about the japanese sergeant yelled back come ahead anyhow though he gestured emphatically when the mongolian called again it was in a different tongue thats chinese sergeant hayashi said you understand it fujita asked maybe the foureyed guy was good for something after all and hayashi nodded i studied it in school all right talk to him find out whats what whatever hayashi said was only singsong gibberish to fujita but the mongolian understood it he answered eagerly he and hayashi had to go back and forth and round and roundneither was exactly fluent after a bit the senior private turned back to fujita about what we would have guessed sergeant he thought they were going to purge him and he figured hed better bug out while he was still breathing fujita grunted the mongolians are crazy and they caught it from the russians russia had been purging its officer corps for a couple of years now people just disappeared captains colonels generalsit didnt matter and since marshal choibalsans mongolia imitated stalins russia in all things mongol officers started disappearing off the face of the earth too more and more of the ones who feared they might be next fled to manchukuo insteadwhich made choibalsan look for still more new traitors this fellow said something else in his hesitant chinese fujita looked a question to hayashi he saysi think he sayshe can tell us a lot about their dispositions on the far side of the halha hearing that improved fujitas disposition can he well hell get his chance well take him in and hed better sing like a cricket in a cage tell him so hayashi i dont know if i can say that in chinese sergeant san shit tell him well cut his balls off if he doesnt talk that ought to do it hayashi spoke slowly the mongolian officers face didnt show much he was darker than most japanese maybe because he was born that way maybe just because he was weathered which he certainly was left in the oven too long fujita thought scornfully the mongolian did gnaw on his lower lip for a moment before answering he says hell tell us whatever we want to know hayashi reported he says he knew all along hed have to do that all right good you and kawakami take him back to our officers fujita held up a hand wait ask him one thing first ask him if the russians and mongols aim to jump us any time soon hayashi put the question the deserter shook his head he said something hayashi translated no sergeant he says theyre just hoping we leave them alone the russians are almost pissing themselves about whats going on in europe he says ichiban fujita said enthusiastically thats good intelligence if theyre afraid well jump on them maybe nows the time to do it neh senior private hayashi shrugged he wasnt about to argue with a superior he and corporal kawakami just took the mongolian back toward battalion headquarters armorers wheeled bombs toward lieutenant sergei yaroslavskys tupolev sb the medium bomber would hold half a dozen kg bombs or one big hefty kg firework the big bombs were in short supply though yaroslavsky was glad the armorers had enough of the smaller ones to fill up the bomb bay he was a stolid broadfaced blond getting close to thirty hed had a tour against the fascists in spain now he was doing it again flying out of a field near poprad in eastern slovakia officially he was a volunteer aiding the people of democratic czechoslovakia against the nazi invasion and in a way he supposed he had volunteered they would have shot him if hed said no they were shooting lots of officers these days they were jumpy as cats in a rockingchair factory theyd shoot you without any excuse if they felt like it if you gave them one you were dead for sure of course the germans were liable to shoot him too things were simpler and safer in spain back in early the sb could outrun anything the spanish nationalists the condor legion or the italians put in the air it wasnt like that here the messerschmitt was a very nasty piece of work it was faster than both russian flatnosed polikarpovs and biplane czech avias it was a hell of a lot faster than an sb the best recipe for not getting shot down was not getting seen the armorers were czechs when they talked with one another sergei could almost understand them he really could follow ruthenian which was just ukrainian with another name slovak he didnt know about slovak sentries around the airstrip kept slovaks away the squadron was flying out of slovakia but the place wasnt exactly loyal to the country of which it was supposed to be a part clanging noises said the bombardier was closing the bomb bay we ready ivan yaroslavsky called da comrade lieutenant ivan kuchkov replied he was dark and stocky and muscular and hairy people sometimes called him chimp not very often though not after he broke a mans jaw for doing it he had the right slota bombardier needed muscle start them up anastas sergei told the copilot anastas mouradian nodded i will do it his throaty armenian accent grated on yaroslavskys ears damned swarthy bastards from the caucasusbut you couldnt say that not when comrade stalin was a georgian better not even to think it at least the georgians and armenians were christians not muslims like the azerbaijanis and chechens in the officially atheist ussr you werent supposed to think things like that either but while sergei might be a new soviet man he was also and always a russian the two ma radial engines thundered to life the props blurred into invisibility yaroslavsky checked the instruments one after another everything looked good the mechanics were czechs too they were better than any russian mechanics hed ever had they seemed to care more about the work they did five more bombers were also warming up on the airstrip they were going to give the nazis one right in the eye sergei hoped so anyhow more than a week into the war and the germans still hadnt cut czechoslovakia in half lots of the czech army was pulling back into slovakia to keep up the fight hereand to sit on the profascist slovaks down the runway bounced the sb it was made for taking off from grassy fields paved runways were as rare as capitalists inside the soviet union sergei pulled back on the stick the bombers nose came up no more bouncinghe was airborne hed shake again soon enough when they started shooting at him best to enjoy the calm while he could if running didnt help he could shoot back mouradian was in charge of two machine guns in the sbs nose kuchkov had a machinegun blister on the back of the airplane and another in its belly those looked like a good idea bombardiers were rapidly discovering though that you had to be lucky to hit anything with either gun if you werent lucky you might use the dorsal gun to shoot off your own tail at least one intrepid bombardier had already done that if hed lived they would have courtmartialed him and then shot him as things were he saved them the trouble all good mouradian shouted pointing to the instruments he wasnt in the front glasshouse yet with horsepower roaring away to either side you had to yell to make yourself heard i see em sergei nodded lets hope they stay that way the sb was a robust warplane it could take a beating sergei didnt want it to this time around on he flew with his buddies down below bursting shells and bombs told when they entered the combat zone the czechs were still pulling back through the gap between the nazi armies advancing from the north and south if the czechs got enough men and materiel into eastern moravia and slovakia before the germans finally sealed that gap they could keep fighting a while longer when sergei said as much to anastas mouradian the copilotwho also served as gunner and bombaimer and navigatornodded da he said for all the world as if he were a real russian then he added if they dont theyre fucked any russian might have said that too he sure wouldnt have been wrong if he did antiaircraft fire started bursting around the bombers yaroslavsky jinked going up and down to the left and right at random and slowing down and speeding up to keep the german gunners from being able to lead him like a duck when a shell filled the air with nasty black smoke close by it was as if he drove over a big pothole his teeth came together with a click mouradian growled something in what had to be armenian then he came back to words sergei could understand too damn close no kidding the pilot said just then another shell went off even closer to the sb a fragment clanged offor more likely bit throughthe fuselage yaroslavsky checked the controls to the rudder and elevator they answeredno cables cut he yelled into the speaking tube to the bombardier you all right ivan khorosho kuchkov answered a little draftier but no damage get ready sergei told him were almost there they were almost there if mouradians navigating was worth a kopek anyway hed got them where they were supposed to go before the target this time was just outside of brno the biggest factory town in moravia the czechs were still holding out there still holding up the nazis if kilos of high explosive could help them hang on a little longer sergei would deliver the goods that thick cloud of smoke ahead had to be brno who needs navigation sergei thought wryly the germans were bombing the crap out of czechoslovakian civilians thousands and thousands were supposed to be dead in prague brno was catching it too so wheres our target from here yaroslavsky asked southwest comrade pilot mouradian answered from the nosehe was ready to fight now that made sense it was the direction from which the nazis were advancing sergei didnt want his bombs coming down on the czechs heads he spotted something ahead that looked like a division hq aim for those tents he ordered ill bring us in low and straight well get em ivan kuchkov said and maybe they would and maybe they wouldnt but theyd scare the crap out of the nazis if they didnt the bomb bay opened the extra drag slowed the sb and made it sluggish in the air at mouradians shouted command the bombs tumbled free one after another the plane would be livelier with them gone they made up about a tenth of the weight it was carrying and the tupolev bomber would need to be livelier too german fighters jumped the russians just as they were finishing their bombing runs these messerschmitts were terrifying they could have been more maneuverable but they were well armed and fast as the devils godson and diving down on the sbs made them faster yet one of the bombers fell out of the sky by the way it dove the pilot was dead at the controls fire filled the left wing another sb fled east with smoke trailing from one engine maybe it could get down safely in czechheld territory maybe the germans would hack it down first sergei couldnt worry much about the other sbs he had to worry about his own the chimp started blazing away from the dorsal turret tracers snarled past the bomber from behind but ivan made the pull up from the nose mouradian squeezed off a long burst at the lean predatory shape the enemy fighter didnt catch fire or go down but it didnt try another attack either with all the throttle he could use sergei got out of there then he had another bad moment when two czech avias buzzed up in what might have been another attack at the last second they saw he was no nazi and swung away one of the pilots waved from his cockpit yaroslavsky returned the compliment then he had to find the airstrip again mouradian came back to help him between them they figured out where the hell poprad was they got down smoothly enough one other plane from the flight came in a few minutes later sergei could hope some of the rest had landed elsewhere the one that had plummeted to the groundhe shuddered better not to think of such things he had to though because he needed to report to his superiors one of our planes damaged one definitely lost he said they nodded all part of the game as far as they were concerned well keep banging away one of them said till youre expended too sergei thought and made himself nod vaclav jezek dug like a mole what was left of his company was trying to hold the germans out of kopecek a little town six or eight kilometers northeast of olomouc in and of itself kopecek hardly mattered but olomouc did olomouc was the last surviving northern rampart against the nazi flood the czech army was pulling back to the east between olomouc and brno if hitlers bastards closed off that passageway then were fucked jezek though making the dirt fly with his entrenching tool czechoslovakia was probably fucked anyway no scratch probably czechoslovakia was fucked anyway but the stubborn czechs were making germany pay a hell of a high price artillery came down in and around kopecek the nazis were shelling the pilgrimage church it stood on a hill a couple of hundred meters above the plain and made an observation post dangerous to them vaclav would have been surprised if his side didnt have some guns of its own around the church hey corporal got a smoke otakar prsemysl asked everybody bums cigarettes off me jezek grumbled but he gave the private one back just before the shooting started jan dzurinda had scrounged a butt from him vaclav didnt know where dzurinda was now maybe hed got killed when the germans dropped everything and the kitchen sink on the czech lines by the border or maybe hed just bugged out a hell of a lot of slovaks had the miserable rubes didnt think this was their fightor else they thought they were on the wrong side when they wore czech brown tanks somebody shouted everyone who heard that yell grew fearfully alert without tanks the nazis would still be banging their heads against the czech lines but they had them and they had more of them than czechoslovakia did breakthrough machines thats what tanks were a machine gun chattered that was wasted ammo machinegun bullets wouldnt pierce a panzers steel hide tanks could kill you and you couldnt kill the sons of bitches inside them was that fair then vaclav heard the bigger boom of an antitank rifle those fired heavy largecaliber armorpiercing bullets out of a long barrel that gave high muzzle velocity they could get throughsometimes anyhow the rifles weigh a tonne and kicked like a jackass but so what they workedagain sometimes one of the panzers up ahead stopped smoke poured from the engine compartment the twoman crew bailed out vaclav didnt think either nazi in black coveralls made it to shelter too bad he thought yeah toooo bad avias and messerschmitts dueled overhead the german fighters were faster but the czech biplanes seemed more nimble people cheered like maniacs when a spun out of control and went down it was like watching a football match except you counted lives instead of goals score one for our side trouble was not many avias were left the nazis kept pounding the airfields from which they flew the messerschmitts came out of germany of course a few czech air raids on german soil had made hitler and goebbels scream and squeal but the luftwaffe had a big edge there wish the french would push harder take some pressure off us private prsemysl said yeah me too jezek agreed wish for the moon while youre at it he supposed the czechs had to count themselves lucky france had moved at all great some luck no sooner had that gloomy thought gone through his mind than cries of alarm came from the west theyre through theyre through somebody howled which sounded bad then someone else shouted theyre into olomouc get away while you can otakar prsemysl crossed himself that looked like a good idea to vaclav so he did the same thing it couldnt hurt anyhow south and east south and east that was an officers authoritative shout we pull back farther into moravia and keep fighting they havent whipped us yet by god no but how much longer will it be and what good will keeping up the fight do except get more of us killed still corporal jezek had no better ideas the only other choices were surrendering which he couldnt stomach and dying in place which also struck him as unattractive he got out of his foxhole and stumbled through the streets of kopecek to his surprise trucksmostly commandeered civilian jobswaited on the southern edge of town he piled into one of them a moment later he saw otakar and pulled him into it too a moment after that the truck rattled away where are we going prsemysl asked beats me vaclav answered but did you want to stay where we were the other man shook his head this couldnt be worse unless we get bombed of course one more thought jezek could have done without chapter another gray day in munster people in the westphalian town said it was either raining or the church bells were ringing sarah goldman could hear the bells but it was raining anyhow that didnt seem fair of course for sarah the past five years had seemed gray and gloomy and weepy even when the sun did come out since she was only seventeen that seemed like forever she hadnt understood why the nazis decided they had to clamp down on jewsshe and her family werent hurting anybody she still didnt understand not really but the time since hitler took over had been plenty to teach her that people could act like vicious idiots without having any good reason for it her mother had the radio on she was listening to a german station listening to foreign broadcasts was illegal for everybody but ordinary germans who did something like that might escape with a warning if they got caughtthe first time anyway any infraction at all would send jews straight to dachau or buchenwald german storm troops fight today on the outskirts of prague the announcer shouted he had a hoarse braying voice and a strong berlin accent sarah thought he sounded like a prussian jackass which he probably was czech air pirates dropped bombs on a school in dresden murdering seventeen innocent children at play why were children playing during an air raid hanna goldman asked the same question had formed in sarahs mind she wondered how many people thought that way not very many evidently or the announcer couldnt have got away with spewing such nonsense farther east our victorious soldiers advancing from north and south have met in moravia sealing the fate of the czech army and of what was the vicious bandit state of czechoslovakia he trumpeted now we can help the slovaks achieve their national aspirations and whip the bolshevik dogs back to their russian kennel do you hear that sarah her mother called from the kitchen she was trying to make meager bland rations into something worth eating for supper most of the time she did it too ja i hear it sarah answered such rubbish her mother said listening to that crap makes me embarrassed to be a german i know what you mean and sarah did too in spite of everything she still felt like a german why shouldnt she her father had fought in the world war the first world war she supposed you would have to call it now like every other german man his age hed won an iron cross too and he had an amazing scar on his arm where a french bullet had gouged a furrow in his flesh her older brother was such a good football player the aryans didnt want him taken off their team they cared more about winning than about whether saul was circumcised that made nothing but sense to sarah but it had scandalized a lot of people in munster tough men in black uniforms had paid some unofficial visits saul didnt play for the foresters any more but he still thought he was a german too in spite of everything he and samuel goldman were doing their best to prove it today sarah didnt know whether to hope they would fail or succeed the braying announcer didnt say anything about the fighting on the western front he hardly ever did the czechs were giving the war everything they had in them the french and the english didnt seem to have their hearts in it after an almost tearful appeal to buy war bonds the newsman finally went away the radio started playing music again that was a relief music wasmostlyharmless but you never heard jazz any more the government said it was degenerate like modern art if the government didnt like it sarah thought she should she was working on an essay on goethemunsters jewish school naturally taught the german poetswhen the front door opened she put down her pen and dashed downstairs one glance at her fathers face and her brothers told her everything she needed to know they wouldnt take you she blurted bastards saul seemed ready to kick something that wasnt a football he towered over father who looked more sad than angry i had my discharge papers i had my medal i had my wound certificate i had a letter from max lambert who was my captain during the war i had everything he said and we went into wehrkreis headquarters and they wouldnt let us joint the wehrmacht bastards saul said again wehrkreis military district viwas centered on munster it drew in recruits from all over westphalia and from western hanover but it didnt want a couple of jews even if one was a veteran and the other a fine physical specimen sarahs mother came out of the kitchen what did they tell you she asked they told us no thats what theres a law it seems from that says jews cant join up samuel goldman answered one corner of his mouth curled up in a wry smile even so i dont think they expected to see us sticking our heads into the lions mouth we didnt saul said if wed tried to join the ss now in spite of five years of ever harder times in spite of a day of crushing disappointment father started to laugh when he did the rest of the goldmans did too he lit a cigarette german tobacco smelled nastier than it had a couple of years before sarah didnt smoke but father said it tasted worse too fewer imports father blew out a gray cloud in fact im sure they didnt expect anyone like us he said why are you so sure mother asked as she was supposed to why ill tell you why samuel goldmans mouth quirked again but this time it was more grimace than smile because the feldwebel we talked to wasnt even mean to us he just said it was impossible and he kept on saying it and he finally went and got a captain who said the same thing the captain was polite tooturns out he knows max if they had orders about how to deal with jews trying to volunteer they would have screamed at us and called us filthy jewish pigdogs and maybe said wed just volunteered to clean toilets with our tongues saul broke in thats disgusting sarah exclaimed thats why they do it her brother said and then bastards again anyhow they looked at my papers i showed them my scar samuel goldman said i showed them the letter i showed them the iron cross but it was only second class not first he shrugged i was a corporal almost impossible for an enlisted man to get an iron cross first class in the last war the fuhrer did sarah said he was proud of it too he wore it on his left breast pocket all the time father sighed i know but he was one of a handful the feldwebel told me to be sure to hang on to the papers you cant wear the uniform again he said but that stuff may save your bacon anyway then he laughed like a loon because he thought saving a jews bacon was funny what do you think he meant sarah asked well things arent as bad for us because im a veteran father answered even the nazis respect that some not enough but some i cant say im really sorry they did turn you down mother said now i wont have to worry about the two of you off at the ends of the earth with nasty people shooting at you father only sighed plenty of things closer to home to worry about where are we going to find money what will they do to us we should have got out before the war started too late now one of the things i thought was he broke off what sarah asked it before mother could or more likely mother already knew samuel goldman looked at her if your brother and ior even one of usgot into the wehrmacht nobody could say we werent proper germans nobody would do anything to the family because we werent proper germans either he gave mother an ironic nod we might have been safer at the front than here in munster you know mothers mouth twisted dont talk about such things why not its not as if talking about them makes them come true but then father was the one who looked as if hed bitten down on a lemon hitler had spent years talking about all the things he wanted to do to jews he talked about them and talked about them and talked about themand the more he talked the more of them did come true that was why father didnt teach roman history at the university any more jews were forbidden from holding academic positions father still made some money writing articles for the monumental paulywissowa realencyclopadie der klassischen altertumswissenschaft basically a multivolume encyclopedia of everything that was known about ancient greece and rome up to the sixth century ad samuel goldman wasnt the only displaced jewish professor putting cash in his pocket and bread on his table that way if you had an aryan academic friend who would steer things your waywho would sometimes put his name on what youd writtenyou wouldnt get rich but you might get by editors paid by the page too jewish scholars had written some monumental articles because of that scholars of the next generation would have a hard time finding anything more to say about quite a few topics if of course the next generation cared a pfennigs worth about classical antiquity maybe all the aryan scholars would study goths and vandals and vikings instead of greeks and romans but even then sarah knew paulywissowa would help if anything helped anyway from calais alistair walsh could look across the channel and see the white cliffs of dover smudging the northeastern horizon hed been in france before in hed been a private then an unhappy conscript but hed discovered he liked soldiering even if getting shot in the leg meant he spent armistice day flat on his back in a military hospital so here he was again this time with the three stripes and crown of a staff sergeant on his sleeve hed come as far as he was likely to they wouldnt make him an officer even if the sky fell hed got what little education he owned in the army and he had a buzzing welsh accent still staff sergeant wasnt bad it beat the hell out of a lifetime in a factory or a coal mine which he would have had if he hadnt stayed a soldier he could break in new men and he could talk back to lieutenants a lot of whom werent much more than half his age he also had the pleasure of the company of his own kind the british army would have come to pieces without its senior sergeants and was smart enough to know it lying right across the channel from blighty calais had a better notion of what made a proper pub than most foreign places in fact the fellow who ran the green duck was an englishman hed got wounded during the war too and ended up marrying his pretty french nurse and staying behind here since the british expeditionary force crossed the green duck had become the unofficial headquarters for people like alistair men whod been through the mill who wanted a place where they could get a pint or three and sit around and drink them and have a smoke without getting bothered by officers or yapping soldiers if they thought they knew more about what was going on than the general staff didwell sergeants have had such thoughts since the days of caesar if not since those of hammurabi walsh lit a brutus and blew smoke up toward the dim ceiling he turned to the man sitting next to him i tell you joe its not like it was in the last goround too bloody right its not joe collins clotted speech said he came from londons east end he was a wiry little fellow tough as a ratcatching terrier and about as sentimental he held out a hand gimme one o them here you go walsh handed him the packet then leaned close to let him have a light its not i tell you i said the same fing myself collins blew out smoke then whistled respectfully bastards strong as the devil turkish blend thats right if you arent going to taste it why smoke it walsh said knocks the socks off navy cut gold it does collins said i should hope so alistair took a pull at his pint some places on the continent they sold beer by the halfliter which wasnt enough none of that nonsense at the green duck though walsh repeated if you arent going to taste it why smoke it and if you arent going to fight why send the bloody expeditionary force over here politics joe collins turned it into the filthiest word in the world the froggies theyd break out in arseholes if we wasnt here so we bleedin well are sounds right to me alistair agreed but say what you please about the frogs last time around they wanted to have a go at the boche so did we everybody was dead keen to get in there and mix it up not now no not now sufferin jesus the other senior sergeant drained his pint and waved for another one the way those sorry sods are tippytoeing into unlandand they avent moved us up towards the front at all dont i know it alistair said we just sit around soaking up beer and pinching the barmaids bums you try it dearie and youll draw back a bloody stump said the broadshouldered blonde who brought collins his refill the words carried a bit of a french accent the sentiment could have come from any british barmaid from londonderry to dover dont pay him no mind sweeteart joe collins said if i get my mitts on you now youll love every minute of it and then you wake up she retorted away she went with a little extra roll to her hips to show the soldiers what they were missing collins chuckled shed be a andful and a alf she would you might say so but alistair wanted to talk about the war not women they could always come back to women and they probably would for now thoughonly ones who fight like they mean it are the czechsand the germans in czecho too fat lot of good it does the bloody czechs collins said theyd be better off if they lay down for old adolf tell that to the next czech you see walsh said go oni dare you but make sure im there mind on account of i want to watch him wallop the snot out of you and he will too youre a tough bugger joe but these blokes from the middle of europe they bloody well mean it tell me im wrong oh i could lick a czech or a pole collins said but if i turned me back arf a mo ed bloody well pull a knife out of is boot top and give me one right in the kidney they dont fight fair in those parts maybe that was it maybe it was just that central europeans were dreadfully in earnest the one whod plugged henlein and touched off this messhe must have known he wouldnt get away he did it anyhow a generation earlier gavrilo princip and his balkan buddies hadnt counted the cost either i wish theyd move us forward walsh said i dont give a shit about hanging out my washing on the siegfried line but id like to see the goddamn thing careful what you wish foryou may get it collins said not here by god alistair walsh shook his head the frenchies say they did their duty by czecho when they stuck half of one toe into germany and we did ours by the frenchies when we crossed over fight oh no dear his voice rose to a shrill effeminate falsetto joe collins laughed so did the englishman behind the bar the tapman could afford to hed done his bit the last time around and paid enough so that nobody wanted anything else from him now walsh soaked up the beer this was soft duty he knew he shouldnt complain drinking pints in a calais pub when he should have been in a trench brewing tea with hot water from the cooling jacket of his machine gun didnt feel right though somebody in charge knew damn all about what was going on or maybe that somebody knew entirely too well there was a notion more frightening still prague dead ahead ludwig rothes panzer ii approached the capital of czechoslovakia from the east prague was surrounded utterly cut off from any hope of relief if the czechs had any brains they would surrender if they had any brains they would have surrendered a long time ago luftwaffe planes dropped leaflets on the capital along with bombs winds swept some of the leaflets far from the target ludwig had seen a couple of them they showed prague in flames while jewishlooking men labeled france and england played the violin the german caption beneath them read your allies fiddle while prague burns ludwig presumed the czech forest of consonants meant the same thing burn prague did the sour smell of smoke and damp clogged the panzer commanders nostrils there was just enough drizzle to cut down visibilitynot enough to do much against fires prague had been catching it since the war started not much of the place could still be standing how many civilians and soldiers had died in the rain of high explosives ludwig could smell corpses too but the czechs fought on in the ruins perhaps fueled by the courage of despair if you want us come and get us come pay the butchers bill for us they seemed to say and they were making it as expensive as they could fritz bittenfeld drove the panzer past the burntout hulk of a czech t and then past a dead panzer i that had had the turret blown clean off the chassis ludwig winced when he saw that nobodyd really intended the panzer i for anything more than a training vehicle it didnt have the firepower or the armor to fight other tanks if an emergency came along before your bigger machines were ready thoughif that happened you used what you had and hoped for the best and sometimes you got it and sometimes you bought the farm like the two sorry sons of bitches inside that baby panzer ludwig knew too well his own panzer ii was only a small step up its main armament was a good deal better than the panzer is pair of riflecaliber machine guns it carried thicker armor too but the armor wasnt that much thicker the cannon on czech tanks had no trouble piercing it he looked this way that way the other way while he was at it he wished for eyes in the back of his head smashed buildings came closer and closer together as the wehrmacht pushed into pragues suburbs tanks and antitank guns and czech soldiers with molotov cocktails had all kinds of places to hide landsers were supposed to root out such dangers panzers and foot soldiers worked best together each helped protect the other armor was great for disposing of machinegun nests that could hang infantry up for days ground pounders returned the favor by spotting lurking soldiers or guns broadwinged heinkel s and slim dornier bombersflying pencils people called themgave prague one more dose of modern war antiaircraft shells burst all around them not many avias rose to challenge the bombers the little biplanes sure looked as if they came out of the last war but theyd given germanys fancy new s all they wanted and then some the messerschmitts hadnt knocked them out of the sky bombers had finally plastered so many czech airstrips that few avias could get off the ground a czech machine gun up ahead barked ludwig got ready to dive back into the turret anybody who talked about how the slavs were a bunch of untermenschen had never run into czech engineeringor czech infantry for that matter the guys in the brown uniforms knew what they were doing they meant business too then all of a sudden the machine gun fell silent so did all the guns on the czech side little by little german firing also wound down fritzs voice floated out of the speaking tube whats going on beats me ludwig answered stay ready for anything its liable to be some kind of trick dont worry my assholes puckered good and tight the driver said ludwig laughed then he wondered why if you hadnt shit yourself or come close you hadnt really been in combat a czech officer with a flag of truce came out from behind a battered house he was an older man old enough to have started out in the austrohungarian army he walked toward ludwigs panzer probably because it was the closest vehicle with a german cross on it will you take me back to your commanders he called sure as hell his german had a cloyingly sweet vienna accent with slavic palatals under that i will sir but what for ludwig asked i have come to arrange the surrender of prague no matter how sugary his accent the czech sounded infinitely bitter youve murdered enough innocent civilians we cant stand it any more i hope youre satisfied i just want to get out of this in one piece ludwig said the czech looked at him ja you go where they tell you and do what they tell you youre nothing but a little cog in the machinebut its a big machine and its slaughtered us will you give me a ride of course sir if you can clamber on up not much room inside here but you can ride on top of the turret ill take you back to regimental hq and theyll know what to do with youtheo what is it the radioman asked get on the horn with the regiment tell em im bringing back a czech coloneli think hes a colonelwith a surrender offer for prague tell em it looks like weve got a ceasefire up here for the time being too nobody tells me anything theo grumbled sitting there at the back of the fighting compartment he was the last to know all right im telling you now ludwig said he gave the czech officer a hand the man might not be young but he was spryhe didnt really need the help he mighthe undoubtedly didhate everything the german stood for but he stayed polite about it what did the diplomats call that correctthat was the word ludwig held out a pack of cigarettes the czech took one thank you he said again have you also got a blindfold for me the accent that made ludwig think of strudel didnt go well with the cynical question trying to stay polite himself the panzer commander said your men fought well we are still fighting well the czech said proudly this surrender offer is for prague perhaps for bohemia but not for all of czechoslovakia the war goes on in the east ludwig didnt think his superiors would like that he shrugged he was only a sergeant it wasnt his worry from the bowels of the panzer theo said regiment says to bring him in and they say the truce here can hold as far as theyre concerned in the last war we did not have communications like these the czech officer said do all of your panzers have radio sets he sounded casualso casual he made ludwig wary sir id better not talk about that security you know the german said he spoke into the tube that let him talk to the driver back to hq fritz right sergeant the panzer ii turned nimbly and headed back toward the east the czech officer seemed to be taking mental notes if he was coming in to surrender it might not matter ludwig sure hoped it wouldnt fighters dueled over the ebro chaim weinberg watched the new french machines mixing it up with the s now that france and germany were at war the supply spigot to spain finally got turned on the republic had seen more new equipment the past two weeks than in the two years before just because it was new didnt mean it was good a french fighter spun out of control trailing smoke the messerschmitt that downed it sought fresh prey chaim wasnt the only guy from the international brigades who swore in how many tongues did those curses rise hed thoughteverybodyd thoughtenough stuff would come from france to let the republic settle the nationalists hash in nothing flat there was more but there wasnt that much more and sanjurjos bastards still seemed to be getting stuff from germany and italy that shouldnt have happened either england had the biggest navy in the world didnt she and the french had lots of ships too so why werent they doing a better job of closing down sanjurjos supply lines the only answer he could think of was that they didnt give a damn then he stopped worrying about their strategic options a couple of those messerschmitts dove for the deck they werent running from the french planes they were going to shoot up the republican trenches bullets kicked up spurts of dust closer and closer chaim was too far from a dugout to dive into one he folded himself into a ball to make as small a target as he could the roar of the powerful engine and the hammering guns filled his world the was overhead so low that he imagined he felt the wind of its passageor maybe it wasnt his imagination then the plane was gone but even if the wind was imagination he didnt want to unfold he had to will himself into doing it somebody not far away was groaning that got him moving you did for a buddy because you wanted to be sure a buddy would do for you too that big blond guy wasnt an american chaim thought gyula was from hungary gyula spoke several languages including english in every damn one of them he sounded like the guy who played dracula what he said now wasnt in any language chaim knew it sounded impressive as hell though wow he said whats that mean gyula looked at him the hungarian had a mashed footno wonder he was groaning hed be lucky to keep it a horses cock up your ass he said in english for a second chaim thought the other guy was cussing at him then he realized gyula was just answering his question let me bandage you up chaim said he yelled for stretcherbearers in english and spanish his own accent was godawful but people would understand that you better cut my shoe off gyula said dont try to yank it over the wound i kill you if you do that with that damn bela lugosi voice he should have sounded silly he should haveand no doubt he would have if he didnt so obviously mean it clumsily chaim took the bayonet off his rifle at least it had a blade it wasnt one of the damn spears the french liked gyulas boot was falling apart anyway that made things easier chaim winced when he got a good look at the wound the hungarians instep was smashed all to hell yeah hed lose most of the foot if not all of it he saw the same thing as chaim wrapped a puttee around the wound to slow the bleeding he said i can go home now admiral horthy wont draft me mazel tov chaim said dryly hell shoot you instead and not in the foot gyula was close to forty hed fought in the last war and for bela kun in hungarys shortlived communist revolution if he went back to budapest hed be about as welcome as the smallpox right now i wouldnt mind hurts like a motherfucker gyula said got any morphine chaim shook his head sorry wish i did he meant that he could have got nailed as easily as gyula dumb luck one way or the other the stretcherbearers showed up then they were internationals too that was goodor chaim thought so theyd be gentler with gyula as they took him away spaniards faced their own pain with stolid indifferenceand they were even more indifferent when somebody else got hurt away they went they wore red cross smocks and armbands that might keep the nationalists from shooting at them on the other hand it might not this was a rough old war you really didnt want to let the other side capture you no matter which side you were on cautiously chaim straightened up till he could peer over the lip of the trench he wanted to make sure sanjurjos bastards werent swarming forward as soon as he did he ducked down again he wouldnt come up again in the same spot he knew better than that why give the snipers a free shot at you guys who did that ended up with a new hole in the head he took a swig from his water bottle it wasnt water but sour white winehorse piss really but it was less likely to give you the galloping shits than ebro water was hed had dysentery once and was glad hed got over it he sure as hell didnt want it again when he looked again ten or fifteen yards down the trench from the place where hed last popped up he spied two or three nationalists looking out of their trenches a couple of hundred yards away and toward him as he ducked he saw them ducking at the same time theyre scared of me he thought not without pride they even looked like fascist assholes like most of sanjurjos better troops they wore germanstyle helmets but they were scared of a dumb jew from new york city if that wasnt a kick in the nuts he didnt know what would be if you had a rifle in your hands you were dangerous it was as simple as that the thing you had to remember though was that the other son of a bitch was dangerous as long as he had a rifle too vaclav jezek stumbled over the border behind him slovakia was going to hell in a handbasket the germans were breaking in from the west the hungarians not about to miss a chance to seize again what theyd ruled for centuries were breaking in from the south the slovaks were up in armsgermansupplied armsagainst what was left of czechoslovakian authority ingrate bastards jezek thought not that anybody gave a damn about his opinion he didnt know what the poles would do with himto himeither poland was also more or less at war with czechoslovakia by now tesin would be cieszun or however the hell the poles spelled it he doubted whether his own country tried very hard to defend the mining town when a lion jumped you you didnt worry about the jackals the country was rough and broken most of the leaves were off the trees though which made people easier to spot and being off the trees the leaves lay underfoot every time vaclav took a step they crunched underfoot they might as well have shouted here i am but so what he didnt want to sit around in a nazi pow camp till the war ended whatever the poles did to him had to be better than thatdidnt it behind him he could still hear bombs and shells bursting and machine guns going off more czech soldiersthe ones who couldwere stumbling north out of the fighting theyd made the same calculation he had nowwere the lot of them right somebody up ahead shouted something vaclav almost understood it polish and czech were closely relatednot so closely as czech and slovak but stilla word here and there came through even if each of them seemed to carry an extra syllable or two vaclav stood still he thought that was what the pole was telling him to do i give up he shouted back you can intern me the pole came out from behind a tree he wore a greenish uniform not brown like vaclavs not filthy and tattered like vaclavs either or german fieldgray the bayoneted rifle he carried looked extremely businesslike moving slowly and carefully vaclav unslung his own piece and laid it on the ground in front of his feet with a nod the pole advanced on him they tried to talk it was an exercise in near misses and frustration then the polea big blond fellowraised an ironic eyebrow and asked sprechen sie deutsch ja jezek said miserably two slavs having to go back and forth in german gut the pole said jetzt konnen wir wirklich einander verstehen and they could really understand each other now no matter how much vaclav loathed the idea still in german the pole went on give me your name and rank and unit dully vaclav did what will you do with me he asked we have a camp a few kilometers to the north the polish soldier answered did you say you wanted to be interned before ja vaclav said again i thought so but i wasnt sure the pole said well you will be you are not a prisoner of war not here poland and czechoslovakia are not formally at war no you just grabbed jezek said bitterly with a shrug the big man in the green uniform answered so did you czechs after the last war otherwise the coal mines down there would have been ours all along and then you act like your shit doesnt stink oh mine does i know that vaclav said but if you are friends with hitler he will make you sorry better him than stalin and the damned reds the pole retorted you find friends where you can at least the russians did something for us more than france and england did vaclav said what did you expect theyre full of jews the pole said no wonder he liked hitler better than stalin he stooped picked up vaclavs rifle and slung it over his own shoulder then he pointed north the camp is that way get moving corporal jezek shoulders slumped in despair vaclav got moving chapter the night was cool and damp most nights were as october moved toward november willi dernen peered at the frenchmen whod nipped off a few square kilometers of german soil they were warmer than he was theyd started a fire and sat around it from meters he could have potted them easily orders were not to piss them off no matter what if they wanted to sit on their asses as if they hadnt crossed the border they were welcome to if theyd really come loaded for bear willis shiver had nothing to do with the weather he was a blond stolid watchmakers son from breslau all the way over on the other side of the reich he could hardly follow the german they spoke here and the locals had trouble with his accent too but hed been on the westwall since france and england declared war he knew what would have happened had the french put some muscle into a push instead of tiptoeing over the border they would have smashed the westwall as if they were made of cardboard not a landser here thought any differently the westwall was goebbels joke on the democracies on paper and on the radio it was as formidable as the maginot line for real construction gangs were still frantically building forts and obstructions and the westwall didnt have nearly enough troops to man what was already built most of the wehrmacht had gone off to kick czechoslovakias ass what was leftthe french outnumbered somewhere between three and five to one that was the bad news the good news was they didnt seem to know it one of the frenchmen pulled out a concertina and began to play the thin plaintive notes made willi shake his head how could the guys on the other side listen to crap like that horns drums fiddles that was music beside dernen wolfgang storch whispered we ought to plug him just so hell shut up you know trust wolfgang to come up with something like that willi thought he whispered back damn you you almost made me laugh out loud that wouldnt be so good why not storch said probably make the frenchmen piss themselves willi did snort then not because wolfgang was wrong but because he was right willi had come that close to pissing himself when he was part of a firefight right after the french came over the border the guy next to him took one right in the belly the noises klaus madeyou didnt want to remember things like that but you couldnt very well forget them when willi went to sleep he heard klaus shrieking in his nightmares he smelled the other mans blood like hot ironand his shit too one of the frenchmen looked up the guy with the concertina stopped playing all of the men in khaki looked around willi pretended he wasnt there as hard as he could it must have worked because none of the enemy soldiers got to his feet or anything tiny in the distance one of them shrugged a comically french shrug the concertina player started up again lets head back and report in wolfgang said now youre talking you and your stupid jokes it was hard to stay really mad when you were whispering in a tiny voice but willi gave it his best shot we wouldntve got in a jam if you werent such a damn smartass your mother wolfgang answered sweetly both germans drew back as softly as they could the french soldier with the concertina went on playing willi took that as a good sign maybe the frenchmen were using the noise as cover that would be a smart thing to do it would also be an aggressive thing to do the french might be smart theyd shown no sign of aggressiveness all the same willi wanted no part of a nasty surprise all it would take was a sergeant whod been through the mill the last time around willis father was a guy like that when he and his buddies got together and drank some beer theyd start telling stories like any kid willi listened there probably werent a lot of guys his age who hadnt heard stories like that some veterans though didnt care to talk willi hadnt understood that not till klaus got it he did now theyd gone about half a kilometer when a nodoubtaboutit german voice challenged them halt who goes there two german soldiers dernen and storch willi answered he and wolfgang were out in the middle of a field the landser who owned that voice might have beenanywhere give the password the man said sonnenschein willi and wolfgang chorused a frenchman poking around could have picked it up from them but the french didnt do much of that kind of poking pass on the sentry said they did the germans were ready for anything the french didnt seem to be they didnt have to be eitherthey had numbers and the wehrmacht didnt but they acted as if that would go on forever and it wouldnt willi got a glimpse of just how true that was when he and wolfgang finished making their report they ducked out of colonel bauers tent and found themselves in the middle of chaos soldiers were jumping down from trucks whose headlights were cut down to slits by masking tape some of the belching farting monsters there werent trucks at all they were panzers both willi and wolfgang gaped at them willi hadnt seen a panzer up till now in all the time hed spent on the western front he supposed there were a few in case the french decided they were serious about attacking here but he sure hadnt seen any it must be all over in czechoslovakia he said ja wolfgang nodded took longer than it should have too everything takes longer than its supposed to willi said no matter how smart the generals are the bastards on the other side have generals too wolfgang laughed at him generals smart what have you been drinking whatever it is i want some too oh come on you know what i mean if the guys with the red stripes on their trouserswilli meant the general staffdont end up smarter than the generals on the other side were in trouble but everybody knows the generals on the other side are a bunch of jerks wolfgang said so how smart do our fellows need to be before willi could answer more panzers rumbled up shouting sergeants ordered them under such trees as there were not all of them would fit there soldiers spread camouflage netting over the ones that had to stay out in the open not many french reconnaissance planes came over but the wehrmacht didnt believe in taking chances when it didnt have to wolfgang storch pointed back toward the french soldiers theyd been watching hope those assholes dont hear the racket and start wondering whats up dont worry about it willi told him they laughed why not their side was doing things the enemy was sitting around if the french had no stomach for a fight but one came to them anyway burn everything sergeant demange said when we pull back into france we want the germans to remember we were here the cigarette in the corner of his mouth jerked up and down as he spoke one of the guys in luc harcourts squad splashed kerosene against the side of a barn luc grabbed a burning stick from the cookfire and touched it to a wet place he had to jump back or the flames might have got him the barn sent a black plume of smoke into the leaden sky other soldiers were torching the farmhouse near the barn hey sergeant luc called demange eyed him as if he were a chancre on humanitys scrotum but then demange looked at everybody and everything that way what do you want kid he said make it good or else lurked menacingly under the words if were doing everything we can to hurt the boches how come were pulling out not going forward as far as luc could see the whole halfhearted invasion was nothing but a sad unfunny joke now it was ending without even a punch line well we went in to give the czechs a hand oui the sergeant said sure harcourt answered so so now theres no more czechoslovakia so whats the point of hanging around any longer thats how i heard it from the lieutenant so thats what the brass is saying demange looked around to make sure no officers were in earshot satisfied he went on you ask me what the real story is were scared green maybe demange would end up in trouble for defeatism if somebody reported him to the lieutenant more likely hed eat the platoon commander without salt and what he said made an unpleasant amount of sense we havent fought enough to see how tough the nazis really are luc said you know that i know that you think the old men in the fancy kepis know that demange made as if to wipe his ass presumably with the collected wisdom of the french general staff come on get moving the underofficer added i think you just want to stand around and gab instead of working luc liked work no better than anyone else in his right mind even standing around with thirtyodd kilos on his back wasnt his idea of fun but the fire warmed the chilly morning he sighed as he trudged away pretty soon tramping along under all that weight would warm him up too but not so pleasantly every once in a while somebody off in the distance would fire a rifle or squeeze off a burst from a machine gun for the most part though the germans seemed content to let the french leave if they wanted to here and there the retreating french troops passed men warily waiting in foxholes and sandbagged machinegun nests the rear guard would give the boches a hard time if they were inclined to get frisky the soldiers luc could see looked serious about their job they probably thought they were saving the french army from destruction and maybe they were right maybe but it didnt look that way now lucs company marched out of germany at almost exactly the place where theyd gone in a month earlier luc eyed the customs post now wrecked that marked the frontier men had suffered there and for what maybe the important people the people who ran things understood luc had no idea its the capitalists who are making us pull out jacques vallat said hed been drafted out of an army factory in lyon and was as red as sergeant demanges eyes the fools are more afraid of stalin than they are of hitler shut your yap vallat the sergeant said without much heat just keep picking em up and laying em down when you get to be a general then you can talk politics if i get to be a general france has more trouble than she knows what to do with vallat replied you said it i didnt demange might have come out of an auto factory in lyon himself he showed no weariness or even strain by the way he marched he could have tramped across france with no more than some gasoline and an oil change or two luc wished he had that endless effortless endurance he was a lot harder than he had been when he got drafted but he knew he couldnt match the sergeant demange was a professional a mercenary in the service of his own country with a white kepi on his head he wouldnt have been out of place in the foreign legion back in france paul renouvin said funnyit doesnt look any different doesnt feel any different either oh some maybe luc said when i camp tonight i wont have the feeling some bastards watching me from the bushes no huh you dont think the germansll sneak after us paul said merde luc hadnt thought of that hed figured that once the french pulled back from germany the boches would leave them alone why not the germans had pretty much left them alone while they were inside germany were going to pay for this jacques vallat predicted we had our chance and we didnt grab it now theyre done in czechoslovakia where do they go next didnt i tell you once to shut up sergeant demanges voice stayed flat but now it held a certain edge you want to go pissing and moaning go piss and moan to the captain hed throw me in the stockade vallat said with gloomy certainty youd deserve it too demange said running your mouth when you dont know shitbut if youre in the stockade you cant do anything useful tonight you fill up everybodys canteen jacques sigh was martyred everyone took turns at the different fatigue duties that one was more fatiguing than most and the men had already been marching all day not that the day was very long darkness came early and with it rain lucs helmet kept the water off his head and the greatcoat let him stay pretty dry but marching through rain and deepening twilight wasnt his cup of tea but tents and hot food and strong coffee waited for the soldiers whod withdrawn from germany it wasnt as good as ending up in bed with a pretty girlbut what was nobody was shooting at him he had a full belly and he was warm when you were a soldier that seemed better than good enough peggy druce had hot food even if most of it was boiled potatoes and turnips she had coffee the germans insisted it was the same stuff they drank if it was she pitied them nobody was shooting at her shed never thought she would have to worry about thattill the day she did she was a neutral which meant the germans treated her better than the english and french theyd also caught at marianske lazne she got plenty of potatoes and turnips and godawful coffee they had enough to keep body and soul together but not much more and if she were a jew till the war started shed looked down her snub nose at jews if you werent one you did shed taken it for granted the same way shed taken for granted that nothing bad could ever happen to her she was an american she had money she had looks shells didnt care neither did machinegun bullets shed seen things at marianske lazne she wouldnt forget as long as she lived and she wouldnt call the place marienbad any more even if that was easier to say the germans used the old name anew if they did she wouldnt not all of what she wished she could forget came during the bombardment or when she was bandaging wounded afterwards quite a few jews had been stuck in the resort with everybody else the ones who were foreign nationals aimed their passports at the nazis the way youd aim a crucifix at a vampire peggy had no idea whether crucifixes worked in that part of europe some people might but the passports did by their growls the german soldiers and the ss men who followed them into marianske lazne might have been dobermans brought up short by their chains however much they growled though they treated jews who werent from czechoslovakia no worse than any other foreign nationals theyd nabbed jews who were from czechoslovakiapeggy shuddered at the memories jews from czechoslovakia were basically fair game it wasnt so much that the blackshirts kicked some of them around for the fun of it it wasnt even that the soldiers set others to scrubbing sidewalks with toothbrushes no it was the way the germans grinned when they did it peggy had had the misfortune to watch several ss men surround a plump dignified bearded middleaged jew the jew wore ghetto attire black trousers long black coat broadbrimmed black hat in color his clothes matched the nazis uniforms which did him less than no good at all one of the blackshirts grabbed his hat and scaled it he might have been a nasty kid on a schoolyard flinging another boys cap he might have been yes if he and his buddies didnt carry pistols and have the might of a mechanized army behind them a schoolboy could punch another schoolboy in the nose the jew would have been committing suicide if he tried he just stood there hoping theyd go away now that theyd had their sport no such luck a different ss man pulled out a big pair of pinking shears he went to work on the jews beard if he got some cheek or nose or ear while he did his barbering that was part of the fun and the jew just went on standing there the look in his eyes was a million years old it said his ancestors had been through this before again and again it said he hadnt done anything to deserve it but deserving had nothing to do with anything it saidit said father forgive them for they know not what they do yes that was from the new testament but so what after all what was jesus to the romans just another goddamn jew later peggy wondered why she didnt charge the ss bastards i should have she thought bitterly most of the time she was somebody who went ahead first and worried about it later here she only stood and watched maybe horror froze her maybe it was sheer disbelief could this really be happening right here before her eyes here in europe cradle and beacon of civilization here near the middle of the twentieth century it could it was the jew didnt say a word as he was shorn he didnt flinchmuchwhenever the shears drew blood he justlooked at the ss men with those ancient painfilled eyes and that didnt do him any good either when the barber was satisfied with his handiwork he hauled off and slapped the jew hard enough to turn his head around another nazi kicked the man in the ass that got a groan from him and doubled him over enough for now said the ss noncom with the shears ja lets find a fresh kike another blackshirt replied peggy didnt speak a lot of germanher french was much better she understood them though off they went laughing and joking the worst of it was they didnt act like men whod just done something evil and cruel as far as they were concerned this was what theyd come to czechoslovakia to do the same way shed come here to take the waters god help them she thought god help us all but god didnt seem to be listening maybe he was out taking the waters somewhere himself or maybe he was off playing golf in florida he could do whatever he pleased his chosen people didnt look to be so lucky even after the ss men went away peggyd needed all of her nerve to go up to the poor jew theyd abused can i help you shed asked hesitantlyin french thinking more german was the last thing the man would want to hear then hed straightened when she spoke to him she remembered that and the way hed reached up to touch the brim of his hat only to discover it wasnt there where blood running down his face and dripping from one ear didnt the missing hat made him grimace sadly hed answered madame do you truly imagine anyone could help me now his french was gutturally accented but at least as fluent as hers she hadnt answered him what could she have said yes would have been a lie no too bitter to bear shed turned away instead and then poor devil hed tried to comfort her when you are of my folk madame you learn to expect such things now and again hed said again she hadnt answered if he was right that only made things worse if he was wrongbut he wasnt wrong dammit you didnt have to like jewsand peggy didnt not especiallyto know theyd been getting the shitty end of the stick for the past years had they ever got so much of it as the nazis seemed to want to dish out though people here in this camp claimed the luftwaffe made a point of pounding jewish districts in prague and brno and other czech cities others said that was a bunch of hooeynothing but stale propaganda peggy didnt know for sure she hadnt been in any of those places while german bombers flew overhead but she had no doubts at all about which way shed bet one day a uniformed german officialwas there any other kind these daysassembled the interned neutrals and harangued them in his language even though peggy spoke some german she couldnt follow word one the big beefy fellow had an accent shed never heard before and hoped she never heard again he has to come from somewhere near the swiss border a man standing near peggy said to his wife peggy had guessed they were belgians but maybe they were from the frenchspeaking part of switzerland then the official switched to french he had a devil of an accent there too but peggy could understand him he slowed down to speak a language foreign to him now that the fighting is over we are arranging transport to neutral destinations for you all there will be railroad service into romania in the near future as soon as lines through slovakia are repaired quite a few people looked happy romanians bulgarians yugoslavs greeks a lot of wealthy balkans types came up to czechoslovakia for the waters it was the kind of thing their parents would have done in some of those parents would have been citizens of austriahungary even the ones who werent even the ones who hated it would have been cultural satellites of the hapsburg empire that ramshackle state was twenty years dead now carved up like a christmas goose but its influence lingered even though it was gone the nazi official started over one more time in what he fondly imagined to be english peggy raised her hand then waved it question please she called in french yes the german didnt looked pleased at being interrupted suppose we dont want to go to romania it is being arranged that you should go there he replied as if her desires were as distant and unimportant as the canals of mars but i dont want to peggy never liked it when anybody tried to arrange her life for her one reason she loved her husband was that he had sense enough to stay out of her way she went on im an american i want to go up to poland or sweden or norway where its easier to find a ship for the united states if the fuhrer s government has arranged that you should go to romania to romania you will go the german official might have said sunrise tomorrow is at half past seven he would have sounded no more certain about that which only proved hed never had anything to do with peggy druce no she said had he worn a monocle it would have fallen out his eyes opened that wide who do you think you are to challenge the carefully arrangedhe liked that wordplans of the reich im an american citizen peggy said st paul could have sounded no prouder proclaiming that he was a citizen of rome if the germans didnt worry about doughboys coming over therewell over heretheyd forgotten about maybe mr beefy had you are not in america now he reminded her we are obliged to repatriate you as we can we are not obliged to be convenient for you by the way he said it he would drive fifty miles out of his way to be inconvenient for her you wont even let me buy a train ticket for somewhere i want to go you wont even let me spend my own money peggy had trouble believing that people always wanted you to spend your money that had been her experience for as long as shed had money to spend but the nazis nasty smile said he was going to tell her no it also made peggy give back an even nastier smile the bastard had some of the worst teeth shed ever seen you will go where we want you to go when we want you to go there we will tell you how to go this is to prevent espionage you understand we are at war certainement peggy replied if i told you where to go and how to get there you would need to pack for a mighty warm climate you can count on that the german official looked puzzled so did her fellow internees none of the handful of other americans seemed to speak french well enough to understand what shed just told him the europeans most of whom knew french at least as well as she did didnt get the american idiom bound to be just as well romania she threw up her hands if shed wanted to visit romania she would have gone there or shed thought so anyhow now she looked to be on her way whether she wanted to go or not back in the ussr sergei yaroslavsky didnt realize how lucky he was to have got out of czechoslovakia in one piece till he found out how many aircrews and bombers hadnt the nazis had far better planes and far more of them than theyd shown in spain even trying to learn what had happened to the fellows you didnt see at the airstrip near kamenetspodolsk was risky ask too many questions or the wrong questions or even the right questions of the wrong people and youd end up in a camp over the past couple of years generalsmarshalshad disappeared or been shot for treason after show trials the nkvd wouldnt blink at gobbling up a junior officer the fascists could kill you so could your own side with the fascists it wasnt personal you were just an enemy to your own side you were a traitor theyd put you over a slow fire and make you suffer most of what sergei knew about the missing crews he knew because of anastas mouradian sergei still didnt like people from the caucasus for beans but they had their uses in a soviet union dominated by russians and by jews yaroslavsky added to himself the southern peoples had to stick together to survive much less get ahead they had their own builtin underground so to speak and so the copilot knew to whom he could talk and how much he could say he had reasonable confidence what he said wouldnt go past the person he said it to and armenians and georgians and such folk were like jews theyknew things you never could tell how they knew but they did one bomber had crashlanded in poland the pilot saved his crew though the poles interned them had the story ended there sergei would have been glad to hear it if your plane had battle damage or mechanical failure you just hoped you could walk away from the landing but things took an ugly turn in a low voice mouradian said the families and shook his head sergei needed no more than that to understand what was going on camps he asked dismally sure he knew the answer da anastas mouradian looked faintly pained that the pilot even needed to say the word to russians armenians and georgians seemed sneaky subtle devious bastards you never could trust them till now sergei had never wondered how he might seem to anastas like a dim backwoods bumpkin he wouldnt have been surprised he wasnt surprised to hear the aircrews families had been seized either if you didnt come back to the rodina the motherlandthe nkvd would figure you didnt want to battle damage mechanical failure the secret police wouldnt give a rats ass about any of that theyd scent treason whether it was there or not and everybody knew treason was contagious whether the bomber crew caught it from their families or spread it to them the families would have to be cauterized nkvd men got paid to think like that ordinary soviet citizens had to if they wanted to staywell not safenobody was safebut somewhere close anyhow bozhemoi sergei muttered youre sure mouradians dark bushy eyebrows leapt reproachfully if i say something happened it happened his voice went hard and flat yob tvoyu mat he addedliterally i fuck your mother as always tone and emphasis were everything when you said something like that said another way it would have started a fight but he meant something more like i shit you not all right all right i believe you yaroslavsky said it justgets to you sometimes you know nichevo anastas answered everybody in the ussr russian or not used and understood that word what can you do or it cant be helped fit too many soviet scenarios as it had in the days of the tsars somebody once said russian peasants ran on cabbage vodka and nichevo at a pinch sergei supposed you could do without cabbage as he had before mouradian looked around again his voice dropped again you dont want to tell this to the chimp he used to drink with the bombardier on the plane that went down he drank with everybody sergei said sure as hell ivan kuchkov ran on vodka just keep quiet he may find out about it anyway but better he doesnt find out from you anastas mouradian said right sergei nodded if ivan found out his drinking buddy was interned and the mans family off to the gulag hed want to break somethingor somebody hed get drunk which wouldnt make him any cheerier and hed babble about where he got the news all of that could easily add up to trouble maybe changing the subject was a good idea hear anything about when well start flying again not supposed to be too long the copilot said but who knows what that means right yaroslavsky repeated like old russia the new ussr always ran late fiveyear plans were trying to drag the soviet union into a consciousness of time like that in the west clocks sprouted everywhere like toadstools but with a language where the verb to be had no present tense how far could the apparatchiks go with their changes sergei thanked the god in whom he wasnt supposed to believe that that was somebody elses worry he just had to follow orders and not think too much he was sure he could manage that a corporal in the groundcrew came over to him sir captain kuznetsov wants to see you right away im coming yaroslavsky couldnt suppress a nasty twinge of fear did he say why he asked was he bound for siberia did kuznetsov get a command to take him out and shoot him sometimes following your own orders and not thinking too much wouldnt save you sometimes nothing would but the corporal shook his head no sir only that he wants to see you i serve the soviet union sergei hurried off toward the captains tent anastas mouradian nodded to him as he went something glinted in the armenians dark eyes sympathy anastas was no fool he knew all the things that could happen he knew they could happen to him too the corporal by contrast was too dumb and too stolid ever to get in trouble when sergei ducked into the tent he was relieved to see no uniformed strangers standing next to captain kuznetsov who sat at a rickety table doing paperwork by the light of a kerosene lamp kuznetsov looked up and set down his pen ah yaroslavsky his tone could have meant anythingor nothing sergei saluted reporting as ordered sir if he was going down hed go down with style not that that would do him any goddamn good either da kuznetsov said again with nothing special in his voice then he went on make sure you and your airplane are ready to fly out of here first thing tomorrow morning yes sir sergei couldnt keep the relief from his voice an order that was a real order uh sirwhere are we flying to to drisa northwest of polotsk captain kuznetsov answered its right near the polish and lithuanian bordersand its about as close to east prussia as we can get while we stay in the rodina i see yaroslavsky wondered if he did will we be flying against germany again then sir we have no orders for that at the present time his superior said he didnt go on to say whether he thought it was likely or unlikely sergei didnt presume to press him either if you gave an opinion that turned out to be wrong somebody would make you pay for it if you kept your mouth shut no one could pin anything on you along with the rest of the sbs in the squadron except for one grounded by bad hydraulics sergeis flew out at first light the next morning ivan kuchkov was badly hung over yaroslavsky wouldnt have wanted to fly like that not with the two big engines throbbing and growling away nothing the bombardier could do about it though not unless he wanted to try his luck with the stockadeor more likely the nkvd if kuchkov complained the engines thrum kept anybody else from hearing him russia scrolled along below the bomber farmland and forest and swamp with here and there a town looking all but lost in the vastness of the landscape puddles in the pripet marshes reflected the gray sky mouradian minded the map and made sure the bomber didnt stray too far west and end up in polish airspace sergei wasnt afraid of what the poles would do to him they flew nothing close to the deadly german messerschmitts but what his own superiors would do to him for screwing up didnt bear thinking about drisas in byelorussia yes mouradian asked yes sergei agreed the armenian sighed theyll talk like the devils uncle then russians didnt have any trouble following byelorussian russians could follow ukrainian which differed more from their language and of course byelorussians and ukrainians had to understand russian but anastas mouradian had learned it in school he spoke well and understood standard russian well its cousins though werent open books to him the way they were to sergei north of the pripet marshes patches of snow started showing up on the ground it would be colder here sergei suspected he would spend a lot of time in his flight suit leather and fleece that could keep out the cold at meters could do the same against even the russian winter he landed the sb on a dirt strip outside of drisaan unprepossessing place if ever there was one his teeth clicked together when the plane touched down the runway was anything but smooth he didnt bite his tongue though and the sb was built to take it as he brought the bomber to a stop he wondered how much it would have to take and how soon chapter another gray damp chilly day in munster sarah goldman sat in the rickety bleachers at a soccer pitch and watched her brother break away from the back who was trying to guard him both teams were made up of nothing but jews saul was so much better than anyone else on the field it wasnt even funny the goalkeeper ran out to try to cut down his angle saul got his toe under the ball lofted it just over the fellows luckless reaching hands and watched it bounce once and roll into the net goal sarah shouted exultantly her mother and father clapped their hands that made it with only about ten minutes left in the second half sauls team had the game in the bag but he only shrugged as if embarrassed at what hed done he probably was this was his second goal of the match and hed assisted on two others the soccer couldnt be much fun when you outclassed friends and foes alike saul might have made a professional in another year or two it didnt seem hed ever get the chance now sarah supposed she ought to count herself lucky the jews got any chance to play at all yes these bleachers might fall down in a stiff breeze yes she was sitting on a blanket because shed end up with splinters in her tukhus if she didnt yes the pitch was bumpy and looked as if it were mown by goats this had to be the most miserable place to play for kilometers around which was of course the only reason the jews got to use it sarah pictured a plump blond uniformed athletic commissioner laughing till his jowls wobbled as he gave the two jewish teams permission to play here maybe he thought a match here would be worse than no match at all were the teams involved full of aryans he might have been right ever since though jews had had to take whatever scraps of comfort and pleasure they could find even a soccer match on a horrible excuse for a pitch was better than none it gave people an excuse to get out of the house an excuse to get together and see one another and gab yes a couple of policemen were also watching the game and the little crowd in the stands what could you do about that nothing as sarah knew too well if you were a jew in the reich somebody was going to keep an eye on you she leaned over to her father and asked what do they think were going to do roll up the chalk lines and carry them home in our handbags and pockets samuel goldman shrugged maybe they do maybe they think we can turn the lines into bombs or something and use them to blow up nsdap headquarters would you blow up nazi headquarters if you could sarah asked of course not fathers reply was too loud and too quick the national socialists have done wonderful things for the reich theyve made germany wake up deutschland erwache was a favorite nazi slogan as father spoke his eyes told sarah shed been foolish after a moments thought she knew just how too father couldnt hope to give her a straight answer not where anyone else could hear him talking yes the only people in earshot were other jews but did that mean they wouldnt betray one of their own fat chance sarah thought bitterly if ratting on fellow jews would give them a moments advantage plenty of people would do it in a heartbeat sarah hoped she would never stoop to anything as vile as that she hoped so yes but she admitted to herself that she wasnt sure times kept getting harder and harder if not for fathers gentile friends who gave him articles to write she didnt know what the family would have done mercifully the match ended the teams lined up and shook hands with each other players tousled one anothers sweaty hair the goalkeeper on the other side mimed chipping the ball the way saul had then threw up his hands in mockor maybe not mockdespair the sparse crowd came down onto the pitch practically everybody there was related to one player or another you were great saul sarah made herself sound enthusiastic even if she knew her brother wouldnt be and he wasnt big deal he said these guys try but i feel like a grownup playing against kindergarten kids he sighed any soccer is better than nonei guess he didnt sound sure not even close if the foresters would let you come back sarah began saul cut her off with a sharp chopping motion of his right hand the foresters would theyd take me back like that he snapped his fingers but if the ss says nowhat are you going to do his wave took in the sorry excuse for a pitch the fumbling opponents and the paltry crowd youre going to play in matches like thisfor as long as they let you anyhow why would they stop you sarah asked why her brother snorted ill tell you why theyre liable to realize were having fun in spite of everything thats why and if they do saul made that chopping motion again oh sarah left it right there sauls words had a horrible feeling of probability to them the nazis ruined things for jews just to be ruining them that was how they had fun and since they had the gestapo and the ordinary police and the wehrmacht on their side they could have fun any way they wanted one of sauls teammates called to him the older man thumped the hero of the match on the back and handed him a bottle of beer saul swigged from it he made a face even the beers gone downhill since the war started he said it tastes likelousy beer what did he almost say horse piss goebbels piss whatever it was it didnt come out as father had driven home to them again and again you couldnt get in trouble for what you didnt say nobody could inform on you for what you were thinking that might save your life or it might not if the nazis decided to do something to the jews or to a particular jew theyd just go ahead and do it they didnt need any excuses the way they would have in a country where laws counted for more than the fuhrer s will on the other hand if a jew was dumb enough to give them an excuse theyd grab it in a heartbeat sarah often wondered what she would do if hitler or himmler or goring or heydrich or one of those people came to munster if she had a chanceif she had a rifleif she knew how to use a rifleif pigs had wings even if she did exactly what she dreamt of doing what kind of revenge would the nazis take would more than three or four jews be left alive in the reich a day after a jewish girl shot somebody like that odds were against it too bad the whole folk were a hostage in small groups people started walking off toward their houses no bus or trolley line ran close to this pitchwhat a surprise buses had almost disappeared since the war started anyhow whatever fuel germany had went to the wehrmacht and the luftwaffe and the kriegsmarine the only private cars that still got gasoline belonged to doctors well walking a couple of kilometers was supposed to be good for you saul didnt seem to fret about it but sarah was tired by the time she got home put together more exercise than she was used to and tight wartime rationsall the tighter because she was a jewand she felt as if she were walking uphill both ways there wasnt much hot water either saul complained loudest about thatafter ninety minutes of running up and down the pitch he needed hot water most or he thought he did anyhow staring at his grassand mudstained soccer togs mother only sighed those wouldnt come clean in cold water either staring glumly at black bread and cabbage and potatoes on her supper plate sarah asked what are we going to do if we get through this alive were ahead of the game her father said eyeing his supper with similar distaste sarah started to cry shed wanted reassurance but all shed got was something she had no trouble seeing herself a runner brought sergeant hideki fujitas squad the news radio berlin says russia bombed east prussia last night the man reported he stumbled a little over russia and prussia but fujita followed him the sergeant had studied a map east prussia was the part of germany the reds could reach most easily fujita glanced west toward the halha river and the high ground on the far side he would have been happy had only mongol troops prowled there but without a doubt russians were peering at the japanese positions through field glasses and rangefinders were they listening to some incomprehensible soviet broadcast telling them that kilometers off to the west their vast country had just given another punch in the european war if they were what did they propose to do about it would they send more men out to this distant frontier to strengthen their mongolian puppets or would they think the fight against germanywhich was after all much closer to their heartlandcounted for more than this distant skirmish any intercepts fujita asked the runner the russians were tough bastardsat least for westernersbut they had horrible radio security half the time theyd send in plain language what they should have encoded but this time the lance corporal shook his head not that i heard about anyhow he answered all right fujita said any gossip about what well do on account of this news not that i heard about sergeant san the runner repeated too bad fujita made himself shrug one way or another well find out sooner or later whatever japan did the sergeant suspected it wouldnt happen at once fall and winter werent the best time for campaigning up here as if to prove as much the wind swung around to blow out of the west the next morning and carried choking clouds of yellowbrown dust from the mongolian heartland with it it blew hard for three days dust from mongolia blew all the way down to peking and beyond so close to the source the storm was appalling when the sky finally cleared when the sun no longer seemed to shine through billowing smoke the whole landscape had changed dunes had shifted some had grown others disappeared dust buried the scraggly patches of steppe grass captain hasegawa the company commander shook his head after coming by to survey the outpost can you imagine living your whole life in country like this turn your back on it and half of it blows away the mere thought was enough to make sergeant fujita shudder sir as far as im concerned the mongols are welcome to it then he corrected himself before hasegawa could well theyre welcome to all of it that doesnt belong to manchukuo anyhow hai to that much and not a centimeter more captain hasegawa said fujita let out a small sigh of reliefhe wasnt in trouble anyhow hasegawa looked out over the altered countryside at least the russians will have as much trouble seeing what were up to as we do with them yes sir fujita didnt care to argue even if he wasnt one hundred percent convinced oh the captain was rightthe russians wouldnt be able to operate as usual during dust storms either but what about the mongols themselves the japanese in this miserable place were probably lucky the natives hadnt sneaked through the dust and slit all their throats you heard the russians are really going after the germans captain hasegawa asked oh yes sir fujita said the runner got here the day before the storm started all right the company commander said well you can bet well take advantage of that wed have to be idiots not to and so officers are idiots all the time fujita didnt say that sergeants might take it for granted but somebody with more gold and less red on his collar tabs wouldnt fujita rubbed at his eyes which still felt gritty his teeth crunched every time he closed his mouth he found something safe whatever they want us to do well do it you know you can count on that sir of course well do it if we disobey the orders theyll kill us and our families back in the home islands will be disgraced sergeant fujita knew exactly how things worked for common soldiers and noncommissioned officers the army was a cruel harsh brutal place officers didnt have it so badbut they necessarily looked the other way while noncoms kept privates in line many japanese soldiers began coming up toward the front a few days later sergeant fujita would rather have seen them move up during the dust storm too pointing in the direction of the high ground on the other side of the halha he complained the russians can watch everything we do for now captain hasegawa said once we get moving well take their observation posts away from them neh yes sir fujita said the only thing he could he wished he were as confident as the company commanderand presumably the high command but the japanese and the russians had been banging heads on the border between manchukuo and mongolia for a while now the red army had more airplanes more armor and more artilleryand had had the better of the skirmishes why should anything change now as if plucking that thought out of his head captain hasegawa said the roundeyed barbarians will worry more about the germans than they do about us this is our neighborhood they look towards europe they cant help it since fujita had had pretty much the same notionand since hasegawa was his superiorhe couldnt very well disagree all he could do was hope it was trueand hope his own side brought in enough force to win once the serious fighting started artillery did come forward along with the foot soldiers so did sleek modern monoplane fighters sitting on the ground they looked as if they ought to sweep the soviet biplanes from the sky armored cars and a few tanks also rattled up to the front line fujita was glad to see them and wished he were seeing more of them this might be the back of beyond for the russians but they had plenty of tanks here dont worry about it captain hasegawa told him when he cautiously expressed misgivings this isnt the only place where well be facing off against the russians well put our tanks where we need them most and where would that be fujita wondered but a moments thought gave him the answer if japanese armor would strike anywhere it would strike at the transsiberian railroad back before the russojapanese war the tsar had been able to ship troops down through manchuria the soviets couldnt do that any more japan controlled the railroads in what was now manchukuo but just on the other side of the border the railroad was stalins key to defending vladivostok and the rest of eastern siberia break the line take it away from the reds and the port and the whole vast country would fall into japanese hands like a ripe persimmon the russians werent blind they could see that too they would fight as hard as they could to protect the transsiberian railroad but the russian heartland lay thousands of kilometers off to the west japan lay right across the sea that bore her name the amur separated manchukuo from the ussr the yalu divided chosenkorea to old peoplefrom stalins ramshackle asiatic empire logistics then were all on japans side so the big fight would be there along the border between japans mainland possessions and soviet siberia this mongol business was only a sideshow it would never be anything but a sideshowthat was how it looked to sergeant fujita anyhow he sighed were stuck here neh yes i think we are captain hasegawa sent him a shrewd look why would you rather be on the amur yes sir i would fujita didnt beat around the bush what happens there really means something thisthis is nothing but a bunch of crap please excuse me for saying so sir but its true he waited for a reprimand or maybe even a slap in the face you werent supposed to complain about your assignment oh you could grouse with your buddies but to a superior you were supposed to pretend everything was fine well things werent fine and dammit the company commander asked all fujita did was tell the truth of course sometimes that was the most dangerous thing you could do even more dangerous than charging a russian machinegun nest we do need men here we cant let the russians and mongols steal whats ours hasegawa said but i admit i wish i werent one of them too he shrugged somebody has to do it though and it looks like were the ones sergeant fujita sighed one more time a martyrs sigh yes sir joaquin delgadillo watched italian tanks clank toward the front the crews looked impressive in their black coveralls delgadillo didnt let the stylish uniforms fool him the italians looked much less impressive in full retreat and hed seen that move more often than he cared to remember mussolinis soldiers didnt want to be in spain they cared nothing for marshal sanjurjos war and they fought like it too if the reds who fought for the republic didnt run away the italians would the condor legion nowthe condor legion was different joaquin delgadillo didnt like germans he didnt see how you could to him as to any spaniard with a working set of cojones germans were technicians not warriors they made no bones about why theyd come to spain to learn what they needed to know for the upcoming european war now that war wasnt upcoming it was here but the armored forces and machinegun units in the condor legion had never got a name for cutting and running the way the italians had maybe courage wasnt what kept them in the field maybe it was just professional selfrespect whatever it was you had to admire it this might not have been the germans fight but they performed as if it were now the germans in spain had the same enemies as the ones back in germany communists freethinkers republicans liberals of every stripe and they and the italians and marshal sanjurjo were doing everything they could to crush the enemy here before the aid flooding in from france and england let the red republic seize the initiative those italian tanks kept rattling forward vinaroz on the eastern coast lay a few kilometers to the north sanjurjos men had already taken the town once when they cut the republic in half now an enemy drive down from catalonia one backed by french armor and aircraft had recaptured it what do you think delgadillo asked his sergeant can we get it back miguel carrasquel shrugged thats what our orders are he answered which meant well keep trying till were all dead or till the orders changeand dont expect the orders to change carrasquel had bad teeth and was missing half his left ear his grin then looked most unpleasant whats the matter prettyboy dont want to get messed up joaquin didnt think he was especially handsome but the sergeant called anybody who hadnt been wounded prettyboy you didnt want to get mad about it carrasquel was a good man with a knife machinegun bullets spanged off the italian tanks and tankettes the commanders in the impressive black coveralls ducked down behind the shelter of their armor one or two of them waited too long and got hit before they could the armored fighting vehicles clattered forward anyhow joaquin nodded to himself he didnt mind people ducking when the enemy shot at them he did it himselfwho didnt as long as you carried on regardless you earned your pay tanks were magnets for machinegun fire hed seen that before fewer bullets fought the nationalist foot soldiers who loped along with the mechanical monsters since joaquin was one of those soldiers he approved of that one bullet hitting you was one too many most of the men up ahead didnt wear uniforms at all not what he thought of as uniforms anyhow they had on overalls instead as if they were factory workers that made them catalan communists or anarchists up till the war started they had been factory workers the ones still alive after two and a half years of fighting knew their business as well as any other veterans clang that cry of metal against tortured metal wasnt a machinegun bullet that was an ap shell from a cannon striking home sure as the devil a tankette came to an abrupt halt smoke and then fire poured from it ammunition inside started cooking off joaquin didnt think either italian got out tanks somebody pointed ahead the mans voice wasnt panicked but it wasnt far removed either more often than not the nationalists had had tanks and the republicans hadnt with aid flooding over the pyrenees from france the miserable reds were getting more of their own these machines were french all right by the look of them theyd been around since the last war but they had turrets and treads and cannon and enough steel to keep out smallarms fire if they werent exactly swiftwell so what one of them fired at an italian tank clang there was that horrible belllike sound again the italian machines armor wasnt thick enough to hold out an armorpiercing round somebody got out of an escape hatch in the turret before the tank brewed up it didnt do him much gooda burst from a machine gun cut him down before hed run ten meters tanks on both sides stopped to fire at foes then got moving again to make themselves harder to hit the italian tankettes kept on moving and shooting they mounted only machine guns and werent dangerous to real tanks they could do horrible things to infantry though as the tanks slowed so did the rest of the nationalist advance joaquin flopped onto his belly behind a pile of rubble that had been a stone barn every so often he rose up enough to fire then he crawled somewhere else before squeezing off another round no sniper would draw an easy bead on him veterans learned things like that the guys who didntdidnt get to be veterans sergeant carrasquel crouched behind a fence not far away delgadillo waited for the sergeant to order him forward again but the squad leader stayed where he was firing every now and then he kept his mouth shut maybe hed decided the attack wouldnt get much farther no matter what joaquin delgadillo sure felt that way the republicans had been tough even while outnumbered and outgunned this push plainly aimed to take back as much as possible from them while they still were it also seemed designed to get a lot of nationalist soldiers killed mortar bombs started whispering down around joaquin and sergeant carrasquel both men dug like moles joaquin hated mortars the republicans had been using a russian model for a long time now they also had french tubes and those were just as good or maybe even better somebody yowled like a wildcat which meant a jagged steel fragment had bitten him joaquin hoped it was no one he knew you always hated to hear a buddy get it that reminded you how easily you might stop something yourself ave maria joaquin whispered as he went through the hail mary in latin his left hand found the rosary in his tunic pocket keep me safe he thought let marshal sanjurjo win but please god keep me safe the north sea in november was nowhere a skipper wanted to go it was even less pleasant in a uboat than it would have been in a larger surface warship lieutenant julius lemp guided u north and east he had to get around the british isles to take up his assigned position in the midatlantic he liked everything about his boat except the way it rolled and pitched in the heavy seas type vii uboats made everything that had come before them seem like childrens toys by comparison they had outstanding range they could make seventeen knots on the surface and eight submerged and could go eighteen hours at four knots underwater during the last war the british mined the northern reaches of the north sea trying to bottle up the uboats with hundreds and hundreds of kilometers between scotland and norway they couldnt sew things up tight there the way they did in the channel but they could make life difficult and they did they were supposed to be trying the same thing this time around lemp had orders to sink any minelayers he spotted odds against spying any were long it was a big ocean and he couldnt see very much of it even with the zeiss binoculars hanging around his neck but his superiors were thorough they wouldnt have got those wide gold stripes on their sleeves if they werent gray clouds scudded low overhead driven by a strong west wind in clear weather lemp would have scanned sky as well as sea with his binoculars one thing had changed from the last war airplanes were much more dangerous than they had been they could carry bigger bombs and carry them farther and they all had radio sets so they could guide enemy warships to a uboats path in this weather though a plane would have a devil of a time spotting the u lemp thought a pilot would have to be nuts even to take off but he also thought pilots were nuts maybe it evened out about the most interesting thing he saw on his watch was a puffin that landed on the conning tower for a moment with its plump dignified body and the big beak in bright crayon colors the bird looked as if a talented but strange child had drawn it it also looked confused as if wondering how this convenient little island had popped up in the middle of the sea then it noticed julius lempand then it was flying away again as fast as it could i dont like puffin stew lemp said the wind blew his words away chances were the puffin wouldnt have believed him anyway birds didnt live to grow old by trusting people at on the dot ensign klaus hammersteins shoes clanged on the iron rungs of the ladder leading up to the top of the conning tower i relieve you sir the youngster said formally and then anything i need to know dont talk to puffins lemp replied deadpan hammersteins left eyebrowthe sardonic onerose a few millimeters hadnt really planned tosir he took a deep breath and his expression cleared nice to get up here isnt it dont remind me im going the other way with a sigh lemp descended into the bowels of the u when the sun shone brightly when the sky was blue when the sea was smooth you could easily think that coming off watch and going back into the iron coffin that let you do your job was like going from heaven to hell with winter on its way in the north sea the change wasnt that bad but it sure wasnt good bowelsjulius lemp wished he hadnt thought of that particular word because it fit much too well uboats filled with every stench in the world they might have been a distillery for bad smells high on the list was the reek from the heads toilets that worked without putting the boat at risk of flooding were something german engineering wasalmost up to no uboat had ever been lost because of a malfunctioning headwhich didnt make the toilets a nice place to be around unwashed bodies musty clothes and stale food added to the reek uboats carried enough drinking water water for washing was a luxury they didnt bother with seawater and saltwater soap were supposed to make up the lack as with the heads theory ran several lengths in front of performance bilgewater added a swampy smell as old as the seaas old as boats anyhow when you first came down into it the combination was enough to knock you for a loop after a while you stopped smelling ityour brain blanked it out but when youd been breathing fresh salt air the change was like getting a garbage can thrown in your face the sailors looked as if they might have been demons from hell too the orange light bulbs didnt help more to it than those though a uboat skipper couldnt insist on spit and polish the way officers in ordinary warships did the men were too cramped together hereand uboat crewmen were commonly harder cases than sailors in surface ships too a lot of them started beards as soon as they left port shaving with saltwater soap was no fun even if it were these guys were a raffish lot they enjoyed flouting regulations lemp couldnt very well ream them out for it not when he was sprouting strawberryblond face fungus himself offduty men looked up from a game of skat nobody jumped to his feet and saluted if you sprang to attention on a uboat you were liable to coldcock yourself on an overhead pipe in that uboats were like panzers being a shrimp helped he hadnt been below long when a shout floated down from the conning tower ship ho ship off the starboard bow that sent him scrambling up the ladder again he wanted to see the ship for himself nohe needed to see it for himself if it was a warship he would sink it if he could no german surface units were in these waters but if it was a freighterlife got complicated then belgium and holland norway and denmark and sweden were neutrals sinking a freighter bound for one of them could land the reich in hot water freighters shaping a course for england though were fair game up into the fresh air again where away klaus he asked there sir hammerstein pointed a smoke smudge ja lemp saw it too well have to get closer see what it is they could do that the us diesel engines gave off less smoke than did ships burning fuel oil or coal and the graypainted uboat sat low in the water making it hard to spot julius lemp called down the hatch change course to i say again jawohl changing course to the helmsman answered and the u swung almost due north lemp and hammerstein both raised their binoculars waiting for the ship to come up over the horizon lemp didnt forget the rest of the seascape and the sky you could get caught with your pants down if you concentrated too much on your prey that was how you turned into prey yourself every so often when the skipper lowered his field glasses for a moment he looked over at ensign hammerstein the pup hadnt forgotten to look other places besides dead ahead either good thats no freighter sir hammerstein said after a while damn right it isnt lemp agreed the silhouette while tiny was too sleek too well raked to haul anything so mundane as barley or iron ore easier to mistake a thoroughbred for a cart horse than a freighter for adestroyer i think or maybe a minelayer i want one of those the ensign said the bastards are dangerous too right they are lemp replied admirals sneered at minesbut admirals didnt have to face them sailors who did had a healthy respect for them mines were worse than a nuisancethey were a scourge and they were an economical scourge because they murdered ships without endangering the murderersmost of the time but not today lemp set a hand on hammersteins shoulder lets go below the u stalked the enemy warship at periscope depth that slowed the approach but no help for it if the ship spotted the uboat she could get awayor fight back in a surface action the u was doomed her deck guns were for shooting up freighters and shooting down airplanes not for taking on anything with real weaponry it is a minelayer by god lemp said the silhouette matched the one in janes fighting ships how thoughtful of the english to help destroy themselves the enemy vessel went about her business without the slightest suspicion the u was anywhere in the neighborhood that was just how lemp liked it it might as well have been a training run he sneaked to within a kilometer at his orders the torpedomen readied three fish in the forward tubes the enemy ship filled the periscopes field of view fighter pilots from spain said you had to get close to make sure of a hit the same held true under the sea first torpedo los lemp called clang whoosh second torpedo los clang whoosh third torpedo los clang whoosh under two minutes to the target the minelayer showed sudden urgent smokesomeone aboard her must have spotted the wakes but you couldnt do much not in that little bit of time and lemp had aimed one of the torpedoes on the assumption that the enemy vessel would speed up boom hit lemp shouted exultantly the us crew cheered then a much bigger boom followed the exploding torpedo must have touched off the mines the enemy ship carried the minelayer went up in a fireballand the uboat might have been under the worst depthcharge attack in the world it staggered in the water light bulbs blew from bow to stern plunging the boat into darkness several leaks started with matteroffact competence the crew went to work setting things to rights torches flashed on sailors began stopping the leaks lemp ordered u to the surface if there were survivors hed pick them up he didnt expect trouble anyhow and he didnt get any bodies floated in the chilly water he saw no british sailors still alive with that stunning blast he was hardly surprised a little disappointed maybe but not surprised the minelayer had already gone to the bottom resume our previous course he told the helmsman well celebrate properly when were clear resuming previous course the petty officer grinned schnapps was against regulationswhich didnt mean people wouldnt get a knock after a triumph like this harry turtledove hitlers war these days the british expeditionary force was mechanized that meant staff sergeant alistair walsh got to ride a lorry from calais to this piddlepot hole in the ground somewhere right next to the belgian border then he jumped down out of the lorryand he was back in the mud again twenty years unwound as if they had never been if anything this was worse than what hed known in hed fought through the spring and summer then and got wounded early in fall guys whod been through the mill talked about how miserable trenches got when it was cold and wet guys whod been through the mill always talked this time they were right he squelched when he walked so did everybody else people screamed keep your feet dry the same way they screamed always wear a rubber not too many people listenedand wasnt that a surprise the first cases of trench foot meant rockets went up from the people with red stripes on their caps walsh remembered a trick hed heard about in the last war rub your feet with vaseline thick as you can he told the men in his company do your damnedest to keep your socks dry but greasings better than nothing only one man came down with trench foot and he didnt follow instructions good job sergeant said captain ted peters thank you sir walsh answered he was old enough to be the company commanders father but he would have had to start mighty young some of these buggers havent got the sense god gave a frenchman or a belgian peters scratched at his skinny little mustache walsh didnt think much of the modern fashion if he was going to grow hair on his upper lip he wanted a proper mustache not one that looked put on with a burnt match but he couldnt deny that the captain was a clever bloke peters went on you know why we havent crossed the border and taken up positions where we might do some good belgians havent invited us in like walsh answered thats right theyre neutral dont you know the way captain peters rolled his eyes told what he thought of that they think theyll offend the boches if they get ready to defend themselves much good that kind of thing did them in maybe hed been born in maybe not too either way he was right the germans jumped them then theyll jump them again hitlers a bigger liar than the damned kaiser ever was walsh said too bloody right he is captain peters agreed you can see that i can too so why cant king leopold because hes a bleeding idiotsir walsh suggested like one of those ostriches with its head in the sand hes got his head up his arse peters said walsh goggled he hadnt thought the captain talked like that thinks the french are as bad as the germans thinks we are for christs sake what can you expect from a wog walsh said as far as he was concerned wogs started on the far side of the channel the french were wogs on his side which meant he cut them some slack the belgians werent and he didnt he had genuine respect for the bastards in the fieldgray uniforms and the coalscuttle helmets the germans fought hard and in the last war theyd fought as clean as anyone else what more could you want from the enemy patiently captain peters answered the question hed meant as rhetorical i would expect an ounce of sense if the balloon goes upno when it goes upwere going to have to rush forward to reach the positions we should already have so will the french that will give the germans extra time to advance and consolidate time they simply shouldnt have what can we do about it sir walsh said damn all the company commander replied which was about what the sergeant had expected leopold wont listen to reason maybe something ought to happen to himan accident like walsh said not cricket i know butgot to be some belgians what can add two and two right youd think so but if we try something like that and muck it up what happens then this time peters answered his own question we throw leopold into hitlers arms thats what if the belgians line up with germany were buggered for fair sergeant walsh only grunted he didnt worry about belgian soldiers who in his right mind would but a belgium leaning toward hitler gave the germans a red carpet for invading france as soon as he called up a map in his mind he saw as much wed best not muck it up then he said peters lit a cigarette then he offered walsh the packet which an officer didnt have to do walsh took a coffin nail and sketched a salute peters cheeks hollowed as he sucked in smoke dont get your hopes up for anything like that sergeant he said not bloody likely no matter how much sense it makes the belgies like leopold same as we like our king thats what hes there forto be liked edwards gone walsh pointed out now captain peters grunted you like to argue dont you he said but a chuckle told the sergeant he wasnt really angry if you could arrange for leopold to fall in love with a popsy could i have a couple of months leave to set it up sir why would you need so bloody long well sir ive got to try out the popsies dont i to see which one hed like best walsh answered innocently that won him a snort from the company commander sorry walsh he looked east across the belgian frontier im not at all sure weve got two months once upon a time us marines swaggered through the streets of peking people got out of the way for them they had to be careful nowadays though they still counted for more than the chinese did but when japanese soldiers came through the leathernecks had to be the ones who stepped aside orders said so pete mcgill hated the orders even though he understood the need for them one marine could wipe the floor with one japanese soldier four or five marines could lick four or five japanese soldiers the little men were plenty tough but they were little and a platoon of japanese soldiers could beat and stomp four or five marines if they found any excuse to do it they had once or twice us military authorities protested when it happened the japs ignored the protests as far as they were concerned peking was theirs now all the other foreign troops stayed there on sufferance so now the idea was not to give them any excuses hell of a note corporal mcgill complained he and some of his buddies had just come out of the yu hua tai the restaurant of rich and fine viands he was full of shrimp and scallops the specialties of the house or he would have complained more but he was also full of kao liang which was brewed from millet and strong as the devil some people said the chinese also threw in pigeon droppings to give it extra body damn straight herman szulc knew what pete was talking about the big polack had taken aboard even more kao liang than he had szulc got mean when he drank too ought to bust those little cocksucking monkeys right in the chops just to show em they cant get away with shit like that aint supposed to pooch puccinelli said he always did exactly what he was told and worried about everything else later that made him a damn good marine had the orders been to jump on the japs with both feet he would have since they were to go easy he obeyed againand he would do his damnedest to make sure everybody else followed along szulc scowled at him i dont got no orders not to bust you in the chops well you can try pooch answered without orders he didnt back away from anything or anybody cut the crap both of you mcgill said he didnt want to have to break up a brawl between his pals he didnt want to get sucked into one either what do you say we go get our ashes hauled now youre talking puccinelli was always ready for that herman szulc didnt say no what marine would have peking was pussy paradise there were lots of whorehouses they were cheap most of the girls were pretty and all of them were versatile the only drawback was it was mighty easy to come down venereal flunk a shortarm inspection and the corps landed on you like a ton of bricks with money in his pocket and kao liang in his veins pete wasnt inclined to worry about thatnot now anyway even a marine corporal was a rich man in peking he knew damn well the restaurant of rich and fine viands had overcharged him and his pals as much as the chinamen thought they could get away with he didnt caretoo much the chow was good and it was still damn cheap whorehouses worked the same way you could get whatever you wanted and it wouldnt cost you half of what youd pay in honolulu or san diego the chinese put down less well so what the marines came out of hsi la hutungan alleyway wider than mcgills wingspan but not by a whole lotand out onto morrison street somebodyd told mcgill that the chinese name for the street was main street of the well of the princes palace but it was morrison street to all the foreigners in peking iron sheeting covered the well these days but people still shoved it out of the way and drew up water every now and then some of the royal marines said morrison had been a writer for the times of london and hed lived at number nowadays an italian firm occupied the building chinese on foot chinese on bicycles plump chinese riding in rickshaws pulled by gaunt chinese older chinese women hobbling along on what they called lotus feet chinese inevitably selling things chinese spitting and blowing their noses chinese scrambling out of the waychinese leaping from the street onto the rickety sidewalkschinese bowing low oh fuck puccinelli said here come those goddamn slanteyed mothers chinese were slanteyed too but pooch wasnt talking about them up morrison street came a long column of japanese soldiers they marched in formation a bayoneted rifle on each tough little mans right shoulder when a noncom spotted a chinaman who failed to show proper respect four japs jumped out of the line grabbed the offender and kicked him and beat him with rifle butts they left him groaning and bloody and hustled back into place nod to the slanty bastards mcgill said he met a japanese sergeants eye and nodded equal to equal the jap gazed back his gaze showed nothing for a moment but then he nodded back hed won the exchangepete had acknowledged him first the other marines also nodded to the japanese troops they got a few nods in return most of the japs just ignored them nobody gave them a hard time as far as pete was concerned that would do fine when the tail of the column got out of earshot szulc said been a lot of the little monkeys going through town lately yeah mcgill nodded i hear theyre mostly getting on trains and heading north they gonna finally get off the pot with the russians szulc said talk about deserving each other no marine in peking felt anything better than grudging respect for the japanese and pete had never run into a polack who had anything good to say about russians who cares that aint our worry any which way we were gonna get laid remember puccinelli kept his mind firmly on what matteredor in the gutter depending on how you looked at things number good time the joyhouse said in english it had a bigger sign in chinese pete would have bet that was dirtier the chinese had no idea what shame was as far as he could see marines the madam exclaimed meal tickets was what it sounded like sure as hell they would have to pay more for this than the locals did too make you happy the middleaged woman went on make me rich she probably meant her cut of the wages of sin looked pretty nice she wore brocaded silk gold gleamed around her neck and on her fingers and ears jewels sparkled in her hair show us the girls that was szulc who also didnt believe in dicking around when it came to dicking around yes yes yes the madam was all smiles pete mcgill heard the ching of a cash register in her agreement well what the hell did you expect when you went to a whorehouse this gal had blond sisters back in the states hed dealt with his share of them all the same it did take a little of the edge off he got the edge back when he picked his girl she reminded him of a siamese cat except her eyes werent blue he paid the madam and took the girl upstairs his being large and hairy didnt faze her she wasnt just in from the countryside then shed seen roundeyes before she didnt know any english though oh well mcgill thought he could show her what he wanted he couldand he did the way she gasped and squeezed him inside at the end made him think he brought her off too of course whores were part actresses if they made the john think he was a prize stud hed shell out more and pete did give her an extra dollar saying dont tell the old bitch downstairs she hugged him and kissed him and made the fat silver coin disappear even though she was naked pete didnt see exactly where it went into her lacquered hair or he shrugged it wasnt his worry szulc was sitting in the waiting room when he got down there puccinelli took longer coming back twice he said proudly you went off in your pants the first time mcgill gibed not likely pooch said you shoulda heard that broad squeal thank you thank you drink the madam said herman szulc looked ready but pete shook his head and steered his buddies out you dont wanna have any fun szulc complained i dont wanna get drugged and rolled mcgill answered i may be dumb but i aint that dumb if i was a regular there i might chance it but not when its my first time in the joint lets go some place where they do know us and drink there pooch said now youre talking szulc said it sounded good to pete too when they got back to the barracks they were drunk as lords the next morning mcgill repented of his sins coffee and aspirins blunted down the whimwhams without stopping them pete felt so rotten he almost forgot about the long column of japanese troops hed seen the night before almost but not quite he reported to captain horner his company commander horner heard him out then nodded uh huh the officer said thoughtfully you think they were going to head north well i dont know for sure sir mcgill replied if i was a betting man though thats how id lay my money if you were a betting man horner snorted youd bet on how many raindrops landed in a pail in twenty minutes he had a tidewater accent thick enough to slice a hell of a lot of marines and especially marine officers had a drawl and captain horner knew him damn well one good thing sir mcgill said the captain raised a blond eyebrow pete went on if the japs are heading north like that they aint gonna jump on us right away you hope horner said pete nodded the company co was right he sure as hell did hope interned officially vaclav jezek was classed as a displaced person it wasnt quite the same as being a pow the poles were treating all the czechs whod got over the bordersoldiers and civilians men women and childrenthe same way yeah they were treating them all the same way all right they were treating them all like dogs barbed wire fenced off the czechs encampment from the rest of poland poles with rifles and sandbagged machinegun nests made sure the czechs didnt come through the wire the dps lived under canvas despite rain and cold they ate polish army rations that was what the poles claimed anyhow if it was true vaclav pitied polish soldiers most of the polish guards treated the czech menand especially the soldierslike animals in the zoo quite a few of them were friendly to the czech womenwhat a surprise and some of the women gave their all too for better food or more food or whatever else they happened to need a few of the guards turned out to be human beings in spite of being polesthat was how jezek saw it anyhow though he wasnt an unbiased observer he could talk to them in bits of czech and polish and in dammit german we dont want you people here one of the decent guards said you embarrass us why vaclav said all we did was get out alive after the fucking nazis went and jumped us but poland and germany are friends the polish soldier said thats why we dont want you here friends with germany god help you jezek said is the pig friends with the farmer till hes a ham he is the polehis name was leszekpointed east germany keeps the russians away better hitler than stalin any day better anybody than hitler vaclav said stubbornly anybody better the devil than hitler leszek crossed himself stalin is the devil he turns churches into stables and brothels and half the reds who run russia are kikes hitler knows what to do about them by god we ought to give ours whatfor too if we dont theyll steal the country out from under us vaclav didnt care about jews one way or the other he just said if you end up in bed with the nazis youll get it as bad as the jews do youre only mad because the germans beat you leszek said sure and poland never lost a war the czech retorted even if leszek wasnt a bad guy that reminder was more than he could stomach he stomped off vaclav wondered if hed come back with his buddies to do some real stomping but leszek didnt which only proved he had an even temper a few days later a czechspeaking polish officer addressed the displaced persons he used czech words all right but he pronounced them like a pole with the accent always on the nexttolast syllable not at the beginning of a word where to czech ears it belonged a czechoslovak governmentinexile has been formed in paris he said its leaders say they will care for anyone who comes to them i am looking for volunteers at the moment never volunteer any soldier knew that ancient basic rule vaclavs hand shot up all the same anything had to be better than this and what would the poles do to czech soldiers who didnt volunteer ship them back over the border into german hands then it would be a pow cage for the rest of the warif it wasnt a bullet in the back of the neck several other men also raised their hands and a few women as well the rest stood where they were without doing anything the polish officers lips thinned he must have expected a bigger response when he saw he wouldnt get one he said all right take whatever you have and meet me by the east gate in fifteen minutes he strode away his polished boots gleaming vaclav didnt need fifteen minutes to gather his belongings the poles had relieved him of his rifle and ammunition and helmet and entrenching tool hed eaten the iron rations hed carried about all that was left in his pack were a blanket a spare pair of socks a housewife for quick repairshed never make a tailorsome bandages and his bayonet which the poles hadnt wanted it made a perfectly good eating knife a couple of czechs who hadnt raised a hand joined the men and women who had they must have decided as vaclav had that anything beat this the polish officer led a squad of riflemen come with me he told the czechs make sure you come with me if you try to run off i promise you will never do another foolish thing again off they went at a brisk military march some of the czechs werent young and couldnt keep up grudgingly the polish officer slowed down for them he might have laid on a truck or two he might have but he hadnt they marched for eight or ten kilometers it didnt faze vaclav hed done far worse with far more on his back other interned soldiers also managed easily but some of the civilians looked ready to fall over dead by the time they got to a shabby little railroad depot sitting there in the middle of nowhere half an hour later a train chugged up from out of the west get aboard the officer said butits going east one of the women complained ano the pole nodded he said that in perfectly proper czech in his own language yes was tak paris is that way the woman pointed in the direction from which the train had come so is germany the officer reminded her the womans face fell the pole went on the train will take you to romania there are supposed to be arrangements to transport you from there to france if there arent he shrugged vaclav had no trouble understanding that if there werent it was the romanians worry and the czechs it wouldnt be the poles not any more he wasnt the only one to figure that out three or four people balked and refused to get on the train the woman who thought they would cross germany to get to france was one of them she wasnt badlooking but vaclav felt better about boarding after she didnt want to if someone stupid wanted to stay leaving looked like a better plan the conductor spoke no czech only polish and german those were enough one car seemed reserved for the dps no dining car for you the conductor told them we bring you food his scowl said they werent paying customers so they didnt deserve anything good jezek sighed he didnt suppose theyd let him starve and they didnt cabbage and potatoes with little bits of sausage wasnt his idea of a feast but it wasnt so bad as it might have been it was better than hed got in the displaced persons camp krakow tarnow przemysl lwow kolomyja and then the romanian border polish and czech were close cousins most czechs and a lot of poles knew enough german to get by romanian was something else again the romanian customs men who knew another language spoke french that must have made them very cultured it didnt help vaclav one damn bit an older man in his compartment translated for himand for several other people i told them who we are and why were going through their country the czech reported what do they say vaclav asked they know about us they know theyre supposed to let us in the older man replied i dont think theyre very happy about it though they want to be rid of us everybody does vaclav said bitterly the older man didnt contradict him he wished the fellow would have romanian stewards replaced the poles romanian cooks must have done the same thing because the next meal the dps got was a bowl of cornmeal mush mamaliga said the man who dished out the food cest bon he says its good said the czech who spoke french he could say whatever he wanted that didnt make it true the mamaliga did fill vaclavs stomach though when he finished the bowl he felt as if hed swallowed a medicine ball vaclav could look out the window as the train rolled through romania neither he nor any other czech was allowed to step out onto the platform at stops though romanian soldiers with rifles made sure they stayed inside their car lenin could have been sealed in no tighter when he crossed germany to join the russian revolution were in quarantine said the older man who spoke french how come what did we do vaclav said we loved our country we still do the other man answered the poles and romanians dont want to make hitler angrythe romanians worry about hungary too because most of the people in northwestern romania are magyars so theyll get rid of us and theyll try to pretend were not here while theyre doing it he proved exactly right even when the train reached constanta the port on the black sea vaclav and his fellow dps had precious little freedom they were herded from their car to a waiting bus no one was allowed close enough to speak to them they might really have been diseased the corporals first glimpse of the sea left him underwhelmed it was flat and oilylooking it didnt smell especially good either and the greek freighter that would take them to france was a ruststreaked scow italys in the war vaclav said as he clumped up the gangplank what if they bomb us then we sink the older man answered with a veterans cynicismhe must have fought in the world war he went on but i dont think they will greece is neutral the italians want albania they wont make her neighbor angry by going after greek ships you hope vaclav said showing off his own cynicism dont you the other man returned vaclav could only nod sailors shouted unintelligibly the freighters engine groaned to life coal smoke belched from her stacks longshoremen on the wharf cast off mooring lines the ship shuddered as she backed clear a couple of romanian officials stood there watching to make sure none of the czechs jumped overboard and tried to swim ashore maybe they thought the dps would be so stupid france was worth going to romania only a romanian could want to live here land receded the ship rocked on the waves the air smelled of salt and faintly of garbage vaclav didnt care he was out of his cage he was going toward something it might be only a bullet in the ribs when he got back into action he knew that next to god only knew how long inside the displacedpersons camp even a bullet in the ribs didnt look so bad ludwig rothe attacked his panzer iis maybach engine with a wrench as far as he was concerned the engine could have been stronger could have been hell should have been horsepower just wasnt enough to shove nine tonnes of steel as fast as the panzer ought to go trying to do the job made the engine wear out faster than it would have otherwise not far away another panzer crew was working on a captured czech lt that was a tonne and a half heavier than a panzer ii and had only a horsepower motor its gun made it formidable though rothe had seen that in czechoslovakia he wished the germans could have taken the skoda works undamaged instead of bombing them into rubble but then he shrugged inside his black coveralls what could you do aschendorf was all the way on the other side of germany from czechoslovakia the dutch frontier lay only a few kilometers to the west camouflage netting hid both german and captured panzers from the air theyd moved into position at night with only blackout lights to keep them from running into one another or running off the road nobodyd told ludwig what the high command had in mind but nobodyd ever called frau rothes boy a dummkopf either he didnt figure the panzers were massing on the border with holland to drive around looking at tulips he called over to the sergeant who commanded the lt hey willi got a butt on you oh i might willi maass patted his pockets and came up with a pack ludwig ambled over willi gave him a cigarette and then a light he lit one himself a moment later he was a big brown bear of a man dark and hairy with some of a bears stubborn ferocity too after he blew out smoke he asked so when does the balloon go up whenever the fuhrer wants ludwig answered the cigarette was crappy he didnt think it was all tobacco imports had gone down the toilet since the war started during the last war england had squeezed hard enough to make people starve things were nowhere near so bad now not yet anyway the papers were full of stories about how good the war bread was compared to what it was like the last time around it was black and chewy but it did still taste as if it was mostly made from grain if it was a lot better than the last wars version that must have been really dreadful well sure willi said but whenll that be ludwig looked around it was camouflage netting and dummy buildings as far as the eye could see cant sit too long he said well start feeling like moles in holes if they leave us here for weeks at a time besides camouflage or no camouflage pretty soon the french and the english will figure out somethings going on or do you think im wrong not me the other sergeant said i think you hit the nail right on the head id just as soon get going too i feel like mossll start growing on my panzer if we wait around much longer ill tell you something else makes me think were going to get rolling pretty damn quick ludwig said willi maass made a questioning noise rothe explained i saw waffenss units coming in yesterday those guys are like stormcrowsthey dont show up till somethings about to pop well youve got that right willi said they both smoked for a while and let it rest right there you never could tell who was listening ludwig didnt know what to think about the waffenss it looked like himmlers effort to horn in on the wehrmacht not many men in the army liked that idea rothe knew damn well he didnt on the other hand the guys with the ss runes on their right collar tabs had fought like mad bastards in czechoslovakia if there was trouble they were nice to have around itll be interesting maass offered interesting yeah ludwig stubbed out his cigarette under his boot i better get back to work willi maass laughed nice to know youre eager about it ah fuck youand your shitty cigarette ludwig said laughing he and maass both headed back to their panzers captain gerhard elsner came by a few minutes later he eyed the exposed motor and rothes grubby hands can you be ready to move tomorrow at the company commander asked sir i can be ready to move in twenty minutes ludwig answered proudly ive got ammo ive got gas my driver and radioman are here let me slap the louvers down button her up and we go thats what i want to hear elsner said hed been a noncom in the last war and wore the iron cross second class unless it rains or snows between now and then were going to give them what for at well be there ludwig promised itll still be dark or close no darker for us than for them captain elsner said well be ready well know where were going and what were up to they wont ja ludwig hoped it would make a difference everybody got a good supper one more sign things would start any minute the panzer commander stuffed himself after this it would be whatever he could get his hands on iron rations and horsemeat and whatever he could steal from houses and shops he shrugged holland was supposed to be rich if he hadnt starved in czechoslovakia he wouldnt over there either nobodyd bothered to tell him why germany needed to invade its smaller neighbor he didnt worry about it why should he he was just a sergeant when the officers pointed him in some direction and said go he went an attack dog would have done the same thing that was what he was the fuhrer s attack dog he lay down to sleep by his panzer so did fritz bittenfeld and theo hossbach but fritz wasnt all that interested in sleeping he kept going on about what dutch women would be like and belgian women and french women theo didnt say anything he hardly ever did except when he had to fritz wouldnt shut up though finally ludwig said you cant screw them all i can try the driver said valiantly ludwig laughed next thing he knew captain elsner was shaking him awake what seemed like a million engines throbbed overhead the luftwaffe flying west to soften up whatever the dutchmen had set up to try to slow the attack he was gnawing on black bread and sausage when his panzer rolled outat on the dot artillery thundered all around him the noise was terrific he wouldnt have wanted to be a greenuniformed dutch soldier with all that coming down on his head no indeed he was on the right sidethe one giving the pounding not the poor sons of bitches taking it chapter two and a half weeks before christmas as hansulrich rudel scrambled into the pilots seat of his ju he was damn glad the campaign in the west was finally getting started his squadron commander didnt like him if the major had had the chance he would have shipped rudel off to operational reconnaissance training but not even an officer with an ice cube for a heart like the squadron co wanted to be a man short when the big fight started and so hansulrich a milk drinker a ministers son a newminted twentytwoyearold second lieutenant looked out through the stukas armored windshield you ready albert he asked the rear gunner and radioman you bet herr leutnant sergeant albert dieselhorsts voice came back tinnily through the speaking tube dieselhorst was at least ten years older than rudel he drank all kinds of things but milk wasnt any of them groundcrew men in khaki overalls fitted a crank into the socket on the port side of each ju they looked at their wristwatches either theyd synchronized them or someone gave an order hansulrich couldnt hear through the thick glass and metal shielding the cockpit they all yanked the cranks at the same instant hansulrich stabbed the starter button with his forefinger at the same time thanks to one or the other or both the big twelvecylinder junkers jumo engine thundered to life at once it put out horsepower the squadron flew brandnew jubs which had almost twice the power of the older slower a model a lot of units were still using fuelgood oil pressuregood rudel methodically went down the list he gave the groundcrew man a thumbsup the fellow grinned and returned it hansulrich looked around all the props were spinning sergeant dieselhorst said everybody goes today even the guys who have to flap their arms to take off ja rudel said laughing he was damned if he would have let any minor mechanical flaw ground him on this day of days one by one the big monoplanes with the inverted gull wings taxied down the dirt runway and took off finding west was simple all they had to do was fly away from the rising sun holland lay only a few minutes away hansulrich had a kg bomb under the stukas belly and a pair of kg bombs on each wing the squadron was supposed to go after concentrations of dutch infantry and artillery he thought they could do that orange triangle he muttered to himself that was the emblem dutch fighters used on fuselage and wings a lot of them painted the rudder orange too the ju wasnt the fastest or most graceful plane especially when weighted down with almost half a tonne of bombs he had to hope the mes would keep most of the enemy aircraft away boom a black puff of smoke appeared in the sky below and in front of his plane the stuka staggered in the air like a car driving over a fat pothole they know were here albert dieselhorst said dryly they only think they do hansulrich said we havent started showing them yet looking down from meters he watched smoke rise from artillery bursts he could see panzers moving forward they were tiny like tin toys but when they fired their guns fire belched out no tin toy could match that no dutch panzers met the german machines either the dutch didnt have them or didnt know how to deploy them hansulrich wondered why not holland was a rich country it hadnt even had its economy wrecked in the last war why wouldnt it pony up the cash to defend itself properly weak decadent probably full of jews rudel thought always trying to do things on the cheap ill bet theyre sorry now when its too late the dutch did have some field gunss or sclose enough to the frontier to help their infantry resist the german onslaught that was where the stukas came in the squadron leader put a wing over and dove on the gun positions one after another the rest of the jus followed acceleration shoved hansulrich against the back of his armored seat he hoped sergeant dieselhorst was well strapped inthat same acceleration would be trying to tear him out of his rearfacing seat hansulrich spotted three or four gun pits close together he steered toward them as his altimeter unwound you had to be careful to pull up in spain a whole flight of stukas had smashed into the ground because they didnt start to come out of their dives till too late there was an automatic gadget that was supposed to make you pull up hansulrich had quietly disconnected it he wanted to stay in control himself not trust his life to a bunch of cams and cogs as he dove the winddriven sirens on his mainwheel legs screamed even inside the cockpit the noise was unearthly during training hed heard it from the ground coupled with the engines roar it sounded as if a pack of demons and the hounds of hell were stooping on the target he watched the dutch artillerymen scatter like ants from a kicked anthill they werent cowards not in any ordinary sense of the word the poor bastards were just up against something theyd never known never imagined before rudel had wanted to run too that day on the training field and nobody had bombed him he yanked the switch that loosed the bombs then pulled back on the stick for all he was worth the stukas airframe groaned as it went from dive to climb but the plane was built to take it his own vision went red for a few seconds that was the danger point the dive bomber could pull more gs than the pilot could but color came back to the world clarity came back to hansulrichs thoughts for a little while there all hed remembered was that he had to hang on to the stick he gathered himself you good back there albert hell of a roller coaster herr leutnant dieselhorst answered you blew that battery to kingdom come too i saw the bombs go off right on target good good rudel said i thought i aimed them right but im pulling up by the time they go off youd better be sergeant dieselhorst said they both laughed why not laughing came easy when the war was going well and then tracers flamed past the cockpit dieselhorsts machine gun chattered a dutch fokker fighterlike the ju a monoplane with landing wheels that didnt retractzoomed past much too close for comfort the enemy pilot sent rudel an obscene gesture as the fokker flew off gott im himmel hansulrich said where the devil did he come from beats me the rear gunner answered i thought our fighter pilots were supposed to keep that kind of scheisse from happening theory is wonderful rudel said sergeant dieselhorst laughed again but shakily the stuka flew back toward the reich for more fuel and more bombs hansulrich spotted a column of trucks and buses heading east toward the fighting the trucks were painted the grayish green of dutch army uniforms a convoy bringing troops and supplies to the fronthad to be hansulrich dove again not so steeply this time his thumb rested on the firing button atop the stick he had two forwardfiring machine guns mounted in his wings the ju seemed to stagger in the air as his bullets stitched through the convoy a bus ran into a truck the bus caught fire another bus rolled off the road and into a ditch soldiers bailed out of their vehicles and ran like hell it was almost like going after partridges with a shotgun almost some of the dutch soldiers didnt run very far they unslung their rifles and started shooting at the stuka as it roared away infantrymen didnt have much of a chance against aircraft but no denying the balls on these guys and damned if a bullet from somewhere didnt clang through the stukas tail assembly a few meters farther forward my armor would have stopped it hansulrich thought thats what its there for reassuring to remember you had eight millimeters of steel at your back five millimeters under you and four millimeters to either side it wouldnt keep everything out but it beat the hell out of not having any soldiers fired green flares that was the german recognition signal they didnt want their own stukas shooting them up hansulrich waggled his wings to show hed seen he bounced in on a dirt strip a few kilometers inside the german border groundcrew men and armorers cared for the stuka hansulrich rolled back the canopy so he could stand up and stretch youve got a couple of bullet holes sir a groundcrew man reported i know i got hit at least once rudel answered anything leaking all my gauges are good and the controls answer no leaks the man assured him well then ill worry about it later he said mach schnell bitte weve got a war to fight and no time to waste five minutes later he was airborne again one of the things alistair walsh had forgotten about war was what a bloody ballsup it made of traffic or maybe things had been different in by the time he got to the front then all the civilians had run off either that or theyd got killed anyhow they werent around to get in the way things were different now the dutch and the belgians hadnt expected the nazis to jump on them sergeant walsh didnt know why they hadnthis opinion was that they were a pack of goddamn foolsbut they hadnt now that the shells were bursting and the bombs came whistling down half of the locals decided they really wanted to go to some place where things like that didnt happen and so they did whatever small respect walsh had acquired for the belgian army during the last goround dissolved like his stomach lining in the presence of cheap whiskey he didnt particularly expect the brussels sprouts to fight he knew damn well the germans would fight and hoped the french would too about all other foreigners he remained deeply pessimistic but couldnt they at least act like traffic police on the evidence no now that the balloon had gone up the belgians werent threatening to shoot at anybody who crossed their sacred border the british expeditionary force the french seventh army to its left and the french first army to its right were moving into belgium to take up positions to throw back the germans they should have done that sooner but king leopold kept saying no so they were doing it now or they were trying to when lorries and tanks and long columns of khakiclad men on foot headed east and when mad swarms of autos and horsecarts and donkey carts and handcarts and terrified men women and children on foot headed west and when they all ran headlong into one another nobody went anywhere the lorries and tanks tried to push forward drivers screamed in english which mostly didnt help not many englishmen knew enough french to do them any goodif french would have done them any good which wasnt obvious if belgian troops had channeled the refugees down a few roads and left the rest open for the soldiers who were trying to save their miserable country for the second time in a generation too much to hope for plainly were not going to make our stage line today are we sir walsh asked before the first day was very old too bloody right were not his company commander agreed planes flew off toward the east that at least was reassuring till now the raf had left the germans alone the luftwaffe had also left the bef alone but walsh didnt think about what that meant he got his first lesson a little past noon the day was chilly but only partly cloudy the sun had risen late and would set early it hung low in the sky a bit west of south the english soldiers were trying to fight their way through yet another clot of refugees these people were gabbling in flemish or possibly dutch whichever it was it sounded enough like german to raise sergeant walshs hackles dont they know weve got to get up there so we can fight he demanded of nobody in particular or possibly of god his soldiers werent listening they were too busy yelling and swearing at the frightened people in front of them as for godwhen walsh heard the rumble in the sky he thought at first it was more raf planes going over the poor damn refugees knew better that sound scattered them faster than all the yelling and swearing the british troops had done that timbre wasnt quite the same as the one walsh had heard before and those sharknosed planes with the kinked wings had never come out of british factories they dove almost vertically like hawks after rabbits and as they dove they also screamed the sound alone was plenty to make the sergeant want to piss himself get down he screamed hit the dirt get he followed his own order just in the nick of time blast picked him up and flung him around he did piss himself then but realized it only later a lorry caught by a bomb turned into a fireball men and pieces of men flew through the air a marching boot thudded down six inches in front of walshs nose it still had a foot in it he stared then retched hed seen such things twenty years earlier but hed done his damnedest to block them out of his mind ever since more bombs went off among the refugees and the marching troops shrieks rang out through and even over the stunning crump s of explosives wounded soldiers screamed for medics and stretcherbearers wounded civilians simply screamed the nasty divebombers roared away toward the east the direction from which theyd come alistair walsh was just getting to his feet when more planes flew in from that direction at first he thought they were raf fighters returning from strikes against the nazistheir lines werent so aggressively unfamiliar as those of the previous attackers but then fire spurted from their wings and from their propeller hubs they were shooting atshooting upthe british column and the poor damned hapless refugees down walsh yelled again and fit action to word when a bullet struck flesh it made a wet slapping noise he remembered that from the last time around however much he wished he didnt german airplanes had strafed trenches in it hadnt seemed nearly so horrid or dangerous then for one thing hed been a fool of a kid twenty years earlier for another the german air force like the kaisers army had been on the ropes and for one more he wasnt in a trench now more screaming engines made him grab his entrenching tool to see what he could do about digging in then a few people started cheering as if theyd lost their minds suspecting they had he warily looked up british hurricane fighters were mixing it up with the bastards with the hooked crosses on their tails walsh started cheering too a hurricane went into a flat spin and slammed into the ground maybe half a mile away a black greasy column of smoke marked the pilots pyre then trailing smoke and flames one of the german fighters crashed into a stand of trees even closer to where walsh lay he yelled like a man possessed so the germans could die that cloud of smoke broader and lower than the one rising from the hurricane was the first proof of it hed seen in this war another hurricane also smoking but not so badly limped off to the west out of the fight sergeant walsh hoped the pilot managed to put it down safely or at least to bail out if he couldnt land it to his vast relief the german fighters seemed to have had enough like the divebombers before them they flew back toward the vaterland he tried standing up again as he did he noticed he wasnt the only bloke emerging from a halfdug scrape the other chaps in khaki werent so bloody stupid if the buggers on the other side started banging away at you of course youd do what you could to keep from getting ventilated but the advancing column had stuck its dick in the meat grinder one tank lay on its side blown off its tracks by a bomb that burst right next to it several trucks burned others werent going anywhere soon not with from one to four flat tires or with bullets through the engine blockor with dead or wounded drivers what bombs and machinegun bullets had done to the foot soldiers was even worse and as for that mob of refugees a woman who might have been pretty if she werent dirty and exhausted and terrified screamed in dutch or flemish she wasnt woundednot as far as walsh could see anyhow she was just half crazy maybe more than half because of everything that had happened to her walsh had a devil of a time blaming her a few days ago shed been a shopkeepers wife or a secretary or something else safe and comfortable then the roof fell in on her lifeliterally odds were now she had nothing but the clothes on her back and whatever was in the cute little handbag she carried how long before shed start selling herself for a chunk of black bread or a mess of fried potatoes how many more just like her were there thousands tens of thousands all over holland and belgium and luxembourg and eastern france and their husbands and their brats andoh bloody hell bloody hell walsh muttered under his breath still civilians werent his worry except when they got in the way and kept him from getting to where he needed to be to do his job sorting out his soldiers and keeping them moving damn well was captain ted peters came over to him the young officer looked as if hed just walked into a haymaker this was his introduction to combat after all combat meet captain peters peters this is combat walsh shook his head he had to be punchy himself or his brain wouldnt be whirling like that well sergeant im afraid youre the new platoon commander peters said lieutenant gunston stopped a large fragment of bomb casing with his belly gutted him like a sucking pig christ walsh said a bit of a rum go im afraid peters said which would do for an understatement till a bigger one came down the pike he did his best to ignore the ammunition cooking off in burning vehicles the cries of wounded men and women and kids and animals and the stenches of burning paint and burning rubber and burning flesh and fear and shit when the company commander didnt say anything more walsh did i should say so weve got ourselves all smashed up and we havent even set eyes on a goddamn german i did captain peters answered not without pride one of those divebombers was so low when he pulled up that i could see him through the glass of his cockpit and i got a good look at his rear gunner the bastard almost punctured me after the plane pulled out of its dive what are we going to do when we have to fight them face to face sir walsh asked how the devil can we when it looks like theyve got more airplanes than we do we shot down one of their fighters after all the officer said im sure well do better with practice too rightsir sergeant walsh said tightly he wasnt sure of any such thing englands chosen method of fighting seemed to be stumbling from one disaster to the next till she figured out how to beat the set of foes who had been beating her it worked the last time around only because the usa stuck its oar in the water things were moving faster now much faster wouldcouldmuddling through work at all captain peters had no doubts or if he did he didnt let them show which was the mark of a good officer walsh didnt let the privates and corporals he led see his doubts eitheror he hoped like hell he didnt anyhow all we can do is go on peters said we have to clear these civilians out of the way and take up our assigned positions well have the french and the belgians fighting along with us the boches will end up sorry they ever started this waryou mark my words rightsir alistair walsh said again no he didnt believe a word of it but you also couldnt let your superiors see your doubts you couldnt evenor maybe you especially couldntlet yourself see them sergeant ludwig rothe spotted a truck out somewhere close to a kilometer away he raised his field glasses to his eyes the last thing he wanted to do was shoot up his own side by mistake but the magnified image showed it was a french model and bound to be full of dutchmen panzer halt he yelled into the speaking tube jawohl halting fritz bittenfeld answered the panzer ii jerked to a stop rothe peered through the tzf sighting telescope it was only two and a half powerdownright anemic after the binoculars but it let him draw a bead with the mm cannon he wouldnt have opened up on enemy armor from farther out than meters the panzers main armament wouldnt penetrate serious protection from farther out than that it would chew up softskinned vehicles as far as it could reach though the trigger was on the elevating handwheel to the left of the gun ludwig fired a threeround burst the dutch truck stopped as if it had run into a stone wall smoke poured out from under the hood rothe fired another burst which emptied the magazine he slapped in another tenround clip the other guys mighthell they diduse bigger rounds in their main armament but he could shoot a lot quicker than they could sometimes that made all the difference in the world sometimes it didnt matter a pfennigs worth not far away another panzer ii burned like billybedamned it had stopped a mm shell fired over open sights at pointblank range none of the crew had got out that was no surprisehitting a panzer ii with a was like swatting a mosquito with a table the dutch artillerymen whod fought the gun were dead now which didnt do that panzer crew one goddamn bit of good can we get going again sergeant fritz asked pointedly a halted panzer was a panzer waiting to stop something wait a second ludwig looked through the tzf again yes the dutch truck was definitely laid up go ahead he said as soon as he gave permission the panzer seemed to bound forward the flat dutch plains made ideal panzer country but the buildings and trees up ahead made equally ideal places to hide antitank guns even if the dutch had taken a big punch at the start of the fight they were still in there swinging ludwig felt a tap on the back of his left leg he ducked down into the turret was ist los he asked the radio operator bridge up ahead theo hossbach answered weve got paratroops holding it the dutchmen are giving them a hard time i bet they are rothe said they hadnt been ready for soldiers jumping out of jus and taking bridges and airports away from them well who would have been nobody in the last war fought like that hell in the last war even pilots didnt wear parachutes as far as ludwig was concerned that meant everybody whod got into an airplane during the last war was out of his goddamn mind the panzer commander brought his mind back to the business at hand up ahead huh which map square c theo told him c ludwig repeated and the radioman nodded rothe unfolded the map so he could see where he wasor where he thought he was anyhow wrestling with the map inside the cramped turret made him feel like a onearmed paper hanger with the hives at last though he got it open well jesus christ were in c now tell em were on our way will do theo shouted into the microphone that connected the panzer to the platoon company regiment and division commanders everybody could tell ludwig what to do half the time everybody seemed to be trying to tell him at once but all german panzers came with radios so they could work together that hadnt been true of the czechs the wehrmacht was using captured czech panzersthe more the merrier before they went into german service technicians installed radio sets in the machines that lacked them machinegun bullets clattered off the panzer iis steel flank ludwig did some shouting of his own to fritz through the speaking tube got you sergeant the driver yelled back the panzer swung a little south of west that damned dutch machine gun kept banging away ludwig wondered why a panzer ii had less armor than it should havehed seen as much one hit with any kind of cannon shell and you bought yourself a plot but by god the beast did carry enough steel to keep out machinegun bullets and every round the silly dutchmen wasted on the panzer ii was a round they werent shooting at the foot soldiers they could really hurt most of the time rothe would have stuck his head out so he could see what was going on right this minute that looked like a bad idea yeah just a little he thought with a wry chuckle he had four vision ports in the turret two on the left one on the right and one at the back the bullets were spanging off the left side of the turret so there it was the machine guns muzzle spat flame from the front of an apple orchard ludwig traversed the turret he fired back at the enemy gun the dutch crew manning it had run for cover by the time his weapons bore on it theyd seen danger coming and got out of there that meant theyd harass somebody else pretty soon but he didnt know what he could do about it thats got to be the bridge sergeant fritzs voice came back through the speaking tube it does with the turret swung to the left rothe couldnt see much of what the driver was talking about he brought it back to face straight ahead again sure enough there was a bridge and the people around it were shooting at the people on it and right by it the soldiers hanging on to the bridge wore fieldgray the bastards attacking them were in dutch graygreen with leaves off the trees and grass going yellow neither uniform offered a whole hell of a lot of camouflage the dutch soldiers were too busy trying to drive the paratroopers off the bridge so they could blow it to pay much attention to advancing panzersseveral other machines had come with ludwigs one of them was a great honking panzer iiia fifteenandahalftonne monster with two machine guns and a mm cannon that could fire a useful highexplosive shell it could and it did three or four rounds from that cannon put two dutch guns out of action gott im himmel i wish we had one of those ludwig knew he sounded jealous he didnt care he wished the wehrmacht had more of the big panzers too they could do things his lighter machine couldntand they could take punishment that would turn the panzer ii into scrap metalor into a bonfire he opened up with his machine gun the dutch soldiers scattered they hadnt looked for an attack from the rear well too damn bad they also seemed less willing than the czechs had been to hold in place till they got killed say what you would about the czechs they had balls three or four hes swooped down on the dutch troops next to jus the henschel biplanes looked like last weekshell last warsnews that didnt mean they couldnt do the job they shot up the dutchmen and dropped bombs on their heads the bombs werent big onesjus could carry a lot morebut the henschels put them right on the money jus had sirens to make them sound even scarier than they were the hes didnt but when they dove they might have been firing gods machine guns ludwig had heard that just the right engine rpms on those babies could make them as demoralizing as all getout a lot of what you heard was bullshit not this he forgot whod told him but the guy had the straight goods he stood up in the turret to get a better look around a dutchman fired a couple of wild rifle shots at him he gunned the enemy soldier down with his mg two more dutch soldiers dropped their weapons and raised their hands ludwig almost killed them in cold blood at the last second he caught himself he pointed brusquely toward the rear keeping their hands high over their heads they stumbled off into captivityif they didnt run into some other triggerhappy german soldier before anybody took charge of them not my worry rothe thought he was glad he hadnt squeezed the trigger theyd fought fair and so had he sometimes in the heat of battle you did things you wished you hadnt later this time ludwig didntquite his panzer stopped at the eastern end of the bridge a paratrooper waved to him good to see you by god the fellow called it was getting a little hairy here his helmet fit his head more closely than the standard wehrmacht model he wore a coverall over his tunic along with rubber knee and elbow pads and he wasnt kidding several of his buddies lay sprawled or twisted in death a medic tended to a wounded trooper other groaning men waited for whatever he could do for them can we cross the bridge ludwig asked ja the paratrooper answered we pulled the wires on the demolition charges before the dutchmen could set them off and weve cleared the mines on the roadway and chucked them in the river i think we got em all thanks a bunch ludwig wished the paratrooper hadnt added the last few words the son of a bitch only laughed at him he bent down and shouted into the speaking tube take us across fritz will do the driver said whats on the other side more dutchmen with guns ludwig told him what the hell do you expect how about some gals with big tits yeah how about that rothe said dryly he wished he had a control that would let him pour ice water on fritz the driver was the horniest guy hed ever run into the worst part was he did get laid a lot ludwig knew that if he used a noholdsbarred approach like that all hed get was his face slapped the panzer ii rumbled forward fritz did have the sense to take the bridge slowly if the paratroopers had missed a surprise or two hed have a chance to stop or to go around it ludwig gave the roadway a onceover too they didnt blow up so he and fritz didnt miss anything important they went past not only dead german paratroopers but also quite a few dead dutchmen some of them were in what looked like police uniforms no they hadnt looked for soldiers to fall out of the sky so far behind their front these must have been second or maybe third line defenders whoever they were theyd fought hard it hadnt done them any good though as soon as ludwig heard a machine gun rattle to malignant life he ducked down into the turret again but the dutch had put up a better fight on the east side of the bridge than they did here maybe losing it had broken their spirit or maybe they simply didnt have what they needed for a proper defense here a car with half a dozen dutch officers screamed up the road toward the bridgeand toward the panzer arent you going to blast those shitheads fritz demanded lets see what they do first ludwig answered they stopped right in front of the panzer one of the officers started shouting at ludwig in dutch he understood maybe one word in five he thought they were telling him to turn around and drive the nazis away that was pretty goddamn funny sorry friend he said we are the nazis and youre prisoners as of now he might not have known dutch but the dutch officers understood german the looks on their faces when they realized that panzer wasnt theirsyou should let us go said the one whod yelled in dutch beforehe spoke good german too we made an honest mistake in your dreams pal ludwig said sweetly the panzers machine gun and cannon were mighty persuasive you dernen arno baatz had a voice as effortlessly penetrating as a dentists drill yes corporal willi dernen did his best to sound meek and mild he didnt want trouble from a lousy unteroffizier not now not when they were about to give the poilus the big one right in the teeth guys promoted to noncom went off to a special school for a while willi didnt know what went on there but he figured it was where they turned you into a son of a bitch if you werent one already baatz glared at him there in the gloom of earliest dawn have you got your full ammunition supply yes corporal willi repeatedtruthfully only a dope didnt bring along as many rounds and as many rations as he could and frau dernen hadnt raised any dopes had he been lying baatz would have had to feel him up to prove it you still couldnt see anything more than ten centimeters from the end of your nose that didnt bother willi a frenchman who could see you was a frenchman who could blow your brains out muttering the corporal stomped off to harass somebody else beside willi wolfgang storch chuckled almost silently awful arnos on the rag early today isnt he what was that storch baatz snapped his ears stuck out like jug handles maybe that was what made them so sharp nothing corporal wolfgang said baatz went right on muttering but he didnt come back he might have heard but he hadnt understood just like a corporal willi thought before willi could say that out loud and get a laugh from storch hundredsno thousandsof german guns opened up everywhere from the north sea to the swiss border they hurled death and devastation at the enemies of the reich through the thunder willi heard the steadier rumble of aircraft engines overhead their takeoffs must have been timed so theyd cross the border just when the artillery bombardment opened right now the damned frenchies would be thinking hell had opened up on earth and they wouldnt be so far wrong lieutenant neustadt blew his whistle he looked so young it almost seemed a boys plaything when he did but his voice more bass than baritone gave that the lie forward now we get to see france for ourselves the french had seen little bits of germany willi aimed to do more than that he wanted to goosestep through paris in a victory parade his greatgrandfather had done it after the francoprussian war his father never stopped complaining that he hadnt got the chance willi wanted it there was the place just on the german side of the border where the french troops had camped when he and wolfgang spied on them there was the crossing point the germans had boobytrapped when they pulled back after the real war against czechoslovakia started now willi needed to look back over his shoulder to see it that meant that had to mean he was in france if you stood on the other guys soil you were winning the last time around the allies never did drive germany all the way out of france and belgium things fell apart on the home front before they could and here the wehrmacht was again a rifle boomed up ahead a french machine gun opened up its fire noticeably slower than a german mgs somebody not too far from willi fell over and grabbed at his leg he yelped and kiyied like a dog hit by a car medic the shout went up from half a dozen throats keep moving arno baatz yelled even if theyve mined the fields keep moving even if theyve mined the fields willi thought he suddenly didnt want to move at all corporal baatz had a way of encouraging his men all right lieutenant neustadts whistle shrilled we need to go forward he called victory lies ahead paris too that made a pretty good antidote to baatzs minefields french shells screamed innot many but enough to send men and pieces of men flying willis father had talked about the goddamn french s in the last war here they were again and just as horrific if you were on the receiving end in the last war germany couldnt do much about them now stukas swooped down on the french batteries underwing sirens wailing like damned souls bombs going off were much louder than shells the french artillery quieted down in a hurry willi trotted past a gun pit a few minutes later he looked at what was left of the and its crew gulping he wished he hadnt more rifle fire came from behind a stone fence the landsers moved to outflank the defenders even before corporal baatz started yelling commands willi plopped down in a shell hole and banged away at the poilus by the fence after a few minutes one of them waved something white neustadt shouted to them in french willi didnt speak a word of it the french soldiers stood up with their hands high in their long greatcoats and crested helmets they looked as if theyd come from the last war the lieutenant jerked his thumb toward the east nodding babbling with gratitude for not getting shot out of hand the poilus stumbled away into captivity theyll have watches theyll have cash wolfgang said discontentedly now the rearechelon assholesll clean em out dont get your bowels in an uproar willi saidhe was less inclined to grumble than his friend you think theyre the only froggies well catch wellno storch admitted but maybe they had extragood stuff well never find out up ahead a panzer i was burning something heavier than a machine gun had hit the little panzer and knocked it out one crewman in black coveralls lay dead a few meters away the otherthe driverhadnt made it all the way out he was on fire too willi gulped again the stink reminded him of a pork roast forgotten in the oven but other panzers kept pushing forward they shot up or ran over french machinegun nests that made life a lot easier for the foot soldiers who followed in their wake willi didnt mind not facing machine guns not even a little bit more frenchmen surrendered as hed predicted willi got himself a small wad of francs and a watch with a case that looked like gold there were corpses to plunder too if you had the stomach for it dead men and pieces of dead menwilli was astonished at how fast he got used to them or developed a knack for not thinking about them definitely better not to wonder whether this crumpled chunk of shredded meat had played the concertina or that one always puked when he got plowed some people didnt care he went past one body that had a finger on the left hand neatly sliced off presumably so the slicer could get at a ring willi hoped he wouldnt do anything like that he also hoped he wouldnt end up a body lying there for someone else to frisk it could happen not all the poilus were ready to give up the french fought from foxholes and trenches they fought from behind fences and from farmhouses they didnt fight with the coordination of the german war machine but they fought they reminded willi of a guy who got staggered in a barroom brawl but swung back instead of falling over why didnt they fall over dammit life would have been so much simplerto say nothing of easierif they had more s screamed in the wehrmacht troops did some screaming of their own one of the first things you learned in training was to flatten out when you got shelled willi tried to get flatter than a hedgehog squashed on the autobahn the lieutenants down somebody yelled willi looked around without raising his head sure as hell there was lieutenant neustadt both hands clapped to his belly and a godawful shriek coming out of his mouth stretcherbearers ran up and lugged him away willi swore under his breath that didnt look good we have to keep going sandwiched between neustadt and corporal baatz sergeant lutz pieck hadnt shown much personality up till now all of a sudden the platoon was his personality or not keep going they didtill they ran up against four french machine guns with interlocking fields of fire you couldnt advance against those not unless youd written your suicide note willi took his entrenching tool and started digging a hole sergeant pieck sent a runner back before long a mortar team came up the men started dropping bombs on the machine gun nests they silenced three of them the soldiers stalked the fourth and put it out of action with grenades one machine gunner came out with his hands up corporal baatz shot him in the face he fell over and never twitched again willi knew he might have done the same thing you couldnt use one of those murder mills and then expect to give up as if youd got caught playing bridge pieck looked as if he wanted to say something about it but what could he say only the last trump would bring the frenchman back to life and arno baatz was a mean bastard who didnt listen to anybody pieck pointed west instead forward he commanded and forward they went chapter luc harcourt had thought he knew what war was all about hed been in some skirmishes hed fired his rifle and hed come under fire artillery had gone off not too far from him hed had to worry about mines now he discovered hed been a virgin trying to figure out how to play with himself hed played at war so had the germans well playtime was over the bastards on the other side meant it if he wanted to go on breathing he had to mean it too shells bursting all around him had announced the new dispensation this wasnt just a little harassing fire this was a storm of steel the kind of thing men his fathers age talked about the noise alone was enough to make you shrieknot only the thunderous bursts but also the horrible screams and wails of fragments knifing through the air before long the screams and wails of the wounded added to the chaos and he had to deal with things his old mand never needed to worry about divebombers howled down out of the sky if bursting artillery shells were terrifying bombs were ten times worse shells could carry only so much explosive otherwise theyd blow up before they got out of the gun barrel artillerymen disliked such misfortunes the only limit to a bombs size though was whether a plane could get off the ground carrying it german fighters strafed french positions as soon as the bombers went away luc wondered where the devil the french fighters were he didnt see any before long he realized hed shat himself somewhere during the bombardment he tore off his drawers and threw them away he wondered if he would ever be able to face his buddies then he wondered how many of them had fouled themselves too he didnt have long to worry about it somebody yelled tanks if that wasnt panic in the other soldiers voicewell why not hed never seen a german tankor for that matter a french onein the earlier skirmishes hed never seen divebombers then either he hadnt missed the divebombers one bit he didnt miss the tanks either better to hope they would miss him here they came all right snorting black monsters spitting fire from the guns in their turrets german soldiers in fieldgray loped along between them a shell from a french field gun hit a german tank it spun sideways and stopped flame and greasy black smoke burst from it a soldier scrambled out of an escape hatch his black coveralls on fire a burst of machinegun fire cut him down before he could find somewhere to hide but the rest of the tanks kept coming the machine gun fired at one of them bullets struck sparks from its armor but that was all then the tank fired at the french machine gun it fell silent luc drew a bead on one of the german foot soldiers he fired the man went down dead wounded just scared shitless luc knew too well how easy that was he never found out he did realize hed have to fall back if he wanted to stay alive the nazis were going to overrun this forward position no matter what back in the last war he would have had trenches to retreat through theyd made positions kilometers deep this one wasnt no one had taken the war or the germans seriously enough to set up defenses in depth oh farther back well out of artillery range the maginot line was there to make sure no german advance got too far that might end up making france happy it didnt do a goddamn thing for luc almost the first thing he saw when he scrambled out of the trench and fell back to the southwest was somebody elses waddedup underwear just for a minute that made him feel much better then a tanks machine gun stitched up the grass all around his feet none of the bullets bit him but he damn near damn nearcrapped himself again over here sergeant demange shouted we can still hold them off hold them off whatever the noncom was smoking luc didnt think it came in gauloises or gitanes but staying with somebody who had an idea about what to do next seemed better than running at random luc trotted toward demange who seemed in charge of a solid position anchored by a farmhouse jesus luc said huddling in the kitchen none of the windows had any glass in them he didnt know why bombs and shells hadnt flattened the farmhouse luckhad to be fuck jesus sergeant demange said fuck the boches fuck everybody especially our dumbshit generals what did the generals do luc asked trying to catch his breath rien demange snarled with savage scorn not a goddamn fucking thing they let us sit here with our thumbs up our asses till the germans were ready to hit us and now the germans are and were ready tooready to take it on the chin weve got to fight hard for the sake of the international working class that was valentin laclos one of the several communists in the company sergeant demange withered him with a glare fuck the international working class and fuck you too laclos if stalin was on hitlers side youd screech that we ought to lay down and open our legs for the boches you cant even fart till moscow tells you its okay luc admired the noncoms seamless contempt for the world demange despised everything and everybody chances were he even hated himself if you had to ride herd on a bunch of snotnosed soldiers how could you do anything else more german artillery started landing around the farmhouse as luc had seen the windows had already blown out or rather in broken glass glinted on the floor a shell fragment struck a stone wall and whined away what do we do sergeant luc asked fight dammit demange answered not for the international whatever the hell fight because theyll kill you for sure if you dont not necessarily luc thought if he threw down his rifle and threw up his hands maybe he could sit out the rest of the war in a pow camp plenty of frenchmen had done it the last time around theyd had a thin time thoughliterally black bread and turnips and cabbage and not enough of any of themthe germans themselves were starving they had precious little to spare for prisoners and there was no guarantee that surrendering meant becoming a pow hed heard french veterans talk about that if you had the time if you had the men maybe youd take captives back for interrogation if you didnt it was their hard luck that was all he had no reason to believe the boches acted any differently hed already seen you could kill somebody without hating him in the least one of the other guys in the farmhouse looked out a window our sides falling back again sergeant he reported sergeant demange muttered to himself wed better do the same he said unhappily if we get surrounded and cut off were liable to have to see if those nazi cocksuckersll let us give up i dont like the odds his thoughts came uncomfortably close to lucs once the sergeant made up his mind he wasted no time he divided the soldiers crowding the farmhouse into two groups one he sent out the other stayed behind in the strongpoint to give covering fire luc got put in the second group he couldnt even complain because sergeant demange headed it while their buddies got away they fired out the windows a few bullets came back but only a few germans arent here in numbers thats something anyhow demange said slapping a new clip onto his fusil mas and lighting a fresh gitane from the one that had burnt down almost to his lips he spat out the tiny butt and stuck the new smoke in his mouth then he pointed to the westfacing doorway all right lets get out of here they trotted away out in the open luc felt horribly naked a shell could slice him to dogmeat out here somebody yelled he almost shat himself one more time then he realized the shout came in french not german his asshole unpuckered his heart came down out of his throat our guys demange said laconically the soldier whod shouted stood in a halfway decent trench line he and his pals had a couple of hotchkiss machine guns and better yet a mm antitank gun in a sandbagged revetment the gun had two rings painted on the barrel kill brags luc hoped so as long as the divebombers dont come were fine somebody said where are our divebombers luc asked plaintively nobody answered him that cannon did knock out a german tank at better than meters the machine guns settled the poor bastards who tried to bail out of it even so luc wondered again where the french panzers were the next one he saw in this whole war would be the first and he wondered if blasting the one tank would bring a storm of vengeance down on everybody here to his vast relief it didnt night came early that would slow down the germanshe hoped after dark a runner jumped down into the trench the french soldiers nearly killed him before they realized he was on their side he brought orders fall back once more why sergeant demange growled weve got em stopped here yes but theyve broken through on both sides of us if we dont retreat now we wont get the chance later the runner replied merde said the sergeant then he said something so foul it made shit sound like an endearment and then he said something he must have thought filthier yet all right god damn it to hell and gone we will retreat the engine thundered to life the big prop spun then blurred into invisibility the ju throbbed alles gut sergeant dieselhorst shouted through the speaking tube alles gut albert hansulrich rudel said after studying the gauges you couldnt trust them with everything the way the plane sounded the way it feltthose counted too they could warn of trouble the gauges didnt know about yet but everything did seem good this morning groundcrew men pulled the chocks away from his wheels a sergeant waved that he was cleared to take off he pulled back on the stick the divebomber sprang forward over the yellow dying grass the field was almost as smooth as concrete the dutchmen had done a devil of a job of keeping everything neat now germany could take advantage of it up went the stukas sharklike nose rudel climbed as fast as he could the sooner everybody got into formation the sooner everybody could go do his job targetrotterdam the squadron commanders voice crackled in his earphones the dutch there think they can go on eating herring and drinking beer while the war stays at the front theyve got the wrong idea though in this war the front is everywhere hansulrich grinned you hear that dieselhorst no sir what did he say in this war the front is everywhere the pilot quoted the squadron co with savage relish his numbertwo wasnt so impressed not everywhere do they think the tommies and the ivans are going to bomb berlin dont be silly rudel said though a tiny icicle of doubt slithered up his back the czechs had there just before they quit but that was only a last thumb of the nose a defiant fleabite it wasnt as if they did any real damage one stuka had to pull out of the formation with engine trouble the rest droned on the vibration filled every particle of hansulrichs being everything from his skin to his teeth to his spine to his balls it wasnt as much fun as getting laid but it was as compelling bfs loped along with the bombers to hold enemy fighters at bay four days into the assault on holland the air opposition wasnt what it had been the dutch didnt have many planes left while english and french fighters didnt seem to be operating this far forward hansulrich didnt miss them a bit the ju was terrific at smashing up ground targets but even the czech avia biplanes had shot down too many dive bombers for faster more heavily armed fighters stukas were sitting ducks he could see where the front lay by the artillery bursts and by where the smoke was rising general staff officers with red lampassen down the outside seams of their trousers scribed neat lines on maps and imagined they knew what war was all about even up here buzzing along at meters rudel could see and smell what war was doing to holland better to holland than to the reich he thought as soon as they crossed the front dutch aa opened up on them all the stuka pilots started jinking without waiting for orders a little faster a little slower a little to the left or right up a little down a littleanything to keep from giving the gunners an easy target the neat formation suffered with luck the planes wouldnt but one of them trailing smoke turned back toward the east that didnt look good hansulrich hoped the pilot and rear gunner came through all right next to that getting the ju down in one piece was small potatoes a near miss made his own bus stagger in the sky like a man missing the last step on a flight of stairs shrapnel clanged against the left wing everything went on working danke gott rudel murmured his father the minister would have come up with a fancy prayer but that did the job alles gut dieselhorst asked again alles gut hansulrich said firmly holland wasnt a big country there lay rotterdam on both banks of the new maas it was a big shipping town with the most important quays on the north side of the river most of the city including the central square was on the north bank too theres the square were supposed to hit the squadron leader said follow me down the underside of his wings flashed in the sun as he aimed his ju at rotterdams heart like an arrow one after another the planes he led peeled off after him acceleration shoved hansulrich against the back of his armored seat facing the other way albert dieselhorst experienced dives very differently he always thought the stuka was trying to tear the straps off him and pitch him out over his machine gun and through the window behind him no antiaircraft fire here the dutch must not have thought germany would attack the towns didnt they pay attention to what happened in czechoslovakia if they didnt too bad for them rudel yanked the bomb release lever suddenly the ju was lighter and more aerodynamic he pulled back on the stick to come out of the dive the stukas he saw werent the only planes working rotterdam over high above them dosflying pencils to friend and foe alikeand hes sent bombs raining down on the port they couldnt put them just where they wanted them the way a ju could but all that high explosive was bound to blow somebody to hell and gone alles gut dieselhorst asked one more time sure looks good he addedhe was the one who could see what the bombs had done couldnt be better hansulrich answered and flew back toward the airstrip from which hed taken off sergeant alistair walsh was where he was supposed to be on the dyle in central belgium the whole bef was on the line of the dylethe whole bef less what the germans had blown skyhigh if what had happened to the rest of the force was anything like what had happened to walshs unit the bef was missing more than it should have been one of the soldiers in walshs platoon waved to him whats up puffin walsh asked everybody hung that name on charlie casperhe was short and round and had a big red nose he also had news bloody goddamn dutchmen just tossed in the sponge whered you hear that walsh demanded in angry disbelief bloody goddamn wireless but they cant walsh said though he knew too well that they could he went on protesting they just started fightingwhatfive days ago we all just started five days ago except for a few useless rounds aimed at german planes he had yet to fire a shot and now theyve bloody well stopped puffin casper said bunch of damn rotters said the germans bombed the hell out of that damn rotter place and they couldnt take any more of that so they went bellyup something seemed to have gone missing there whatever puffin had heard he hadnt got it straight but if the big news was rightand walsh had no reason to doubt it waswhat difference did the details make not bloody much as casper would have said walsh looked north so theyll hit us from that way and from the east he said just what we need frenchiesll help us puffin said well maybe walsh didnt argue not right out loud casper was only a kid if he had confidence in the french army more power to him he might even end up right the french seventh army which was in place north of the befon the far side of the scheldtwas supposed to be big and strong maybe it was or maybe the bef would have to go it alone back in british forces seemed to have done that when the kaisers army hit them with one haymaker after another that the french would have said the same about the british had never come to walshs notice if it had he would have called the man boldor rashenough to give him such news a goddamn liar artillery rumbled off to the east some of those were belgian guns firing at the advancing germans and some of them were german making sure the bastards in fieldgray kept on advancing the gunfire was getting louder which meant it was getting closer to the dyle sooner or laterprobably soonerwalsh figured he would make the germans acquaintance again an officer came up to him for a second he thought the man was british then he saw the funny rank badges a belgian he realized ordinary belgian soldiers looked like frenchmen mostly because of the adrian helmets they wore but officers had britishstyle uniforms where is your command post the belgian asked in accented but understandable english why do you want to knowsir the british sergeant knew he sounded suspicious but he couldnt help himself the dutch had just thrown in the towel what if the bloody belgies were about to do the same thing their king hadnt wanted to let any allies in till the very last instantwhich was liable to be too late but this fellow said the better to arrange cooperation between your forces and mine you are a sergeant is it not so what do you think youre doing asking me questions was what he meant walsh didnt think he could get in much trouble for slowing up a wog but he didnt want to find out the hard way he was wrong he pointed north go that way oh three hundred yards and youll see the regimental tent yards the belgian officer scratched his head yes sir alistair walsh felt like scratching his too then he figured out what had to be wrong stupid foreigners with their idiot measures uh three hundred meters close enough the belgian nodded ah thank you off he went happy as a ram in clover what do you want to bet theyre the next ones out puffin casper said dolefully wouldnt be surprised walsh agreed theyll tear a nasty hole in our lines if they do bugger off though theyll care a lot about that they will puffin said more belgian soldiers came back over the dyle some of them still looked ready to fight they were just blokes doing their jobs others had done all the work they aimed to do for a while they slipped back toward the rear first chance they saw still others were walking wounded some of them seemed angry others seemed weary and in pain as they no doubt were still others might have been relieved theyd fought theyd got hurt and they were still alive nobody could expect them to do anything more englishmen would have reacted the same way the idea that foreigners could act just like ordinary people never failed to surprise walsh and then with the throb of airplane engines overhead the only foreigners he cared about were the germans he ran for the closest trench and jumped in these werent divebombers anyway they stayed high overhead and let their bombs rain down on the general area of their targets the whistles as the bombs fell werent quite so bad as the screaming sirens on those vulturewinged diving bastards they sure as hell werent good though when the bombs burst it seemed as if a million of them were going off at once blast threw walsh around blast could kill all by itself without fragments it could tear lungs to shreds without leaving a mark on a body walsh had already seen that he wished he hadnt chosen this exact moment to remember it engines of a different note made him look up fighters were tearing into the bomber formations he let out a whoop somebody else sprawled in the trench said blimey there really is an raf the soldier sounded astonished walsh didnt blame him he hadnt seen many british planes himself but they were there now two broadwinged bombers tumbled out of the air wrapped in smoke and fire parachutes sprouted in the sky walsh waited for the british pilotshe assumed they were his countrymen though they might have been frenchto machinegun the descending german airmen but they didnt he wondered why not not sporting were he hanging helpless from a silk halfbubble he didnt suppose he would have wanted a german blazing away at him blimey the other soldier said again that buggers going to come down right on our eads e is he didnt quite but he landed no more than fifty yards away walsh aimed his rifle at him give up right now you fucking bastard he bawled the german paid no attention to him the fellow sprawled on the ground clutching his ankle and howling like a dog with its tail caught under a rocking chair the parachute flapped and billowed like a live thing threatening to drag him away easiest prisoner i ever took walsh said if he hasnt broken that im a belgian myself but do you want to go out there and get im the other british soldier asked what if more bombers come over urr said walsh who hadnt thought of that letting the german flyers countrymen blow him to pieces was a distinctly unattractive notion but so was listening to him when walsh said so the other man replied then shoot im or if you dont care to i will no walsh said if he were lying there with a broken ankle he would want a german to take him prisoner and he thought there was a pretty good chance some german would the bastards in fieldgray fought hard theyd fought hard even when they knew the game was up in they mostly fought fair though of what army could you say more that made up his mind for him he scrambled out of his hole and trotted toward the downed luftwaffe man the german saw his rifle and held up his hands he gabbled something in his own language if that wasnt i give up walsh really was a belgian he pointed to the pistol on the flyers belt throw that damn thing away and make it snappy he said ja ja maybe the german understood a little english even if he didnt seem to speak any or maybe the sergeants gestures made sense to him walsh kept his finger on the trigger while the man disarmed himself if he turned out to be a fanatic hed be a dead fanatic pretty damn quick but he didnt he tossed the little automaticsmaller and neater than the enfield revolver that was the british standard in this war to say nothing of the last gorounds mankilling brute of a webley and scott into the bushes all right walsh knelt beside him and pointed to the trench from which hed come im going to take you back there he got the germans arm around his shoulder grunting as he rose he went on this may hurt a bit the airman hopped awkwardly on one leg he tried not to let his other foot touch the ground at all sure as the devil that ankle was ruined well hed done worse to plenty of dutchmen and belgians and englishmen give me a hand with this bugger walsh called unenthusiastically the other british soldier did once in the hole the flyer reached inside his coverall he came closer to dying than he probably realized but he came out with zigaretten he said proffering the packet thanks walsh took one so did the other soldier who gave him a light they both took a drag bloody hell walsh said tastes like hay and barge scrapings if this was what the germans were smoking no wonder the bastards acted mean he gave the luftwaffe man a navy cut people said they were strong god only knew they were cheap but the new prisoners eyes went wide when he puffed on it danke schon sehr gut he said he reverently smoked it all the way down to the end it probably had more real tobacco in it than he usually got in a week stretcherbearers took him off to the rear if he got more proper cigarettes odds were he was glad enough to go christmas was right around the corner but peggy druce found berlin a singularly joyless place she supposed she should count her blessings if she werent from the neutral usa she would have been interned not just inconvenienced all the same so many shops were empty hardly any cars rolled down the street even the trolleys operated on a wartime schedule which meant you took a long time to get anywhere the city was blacked out at night as far as peggy could tell the whole damn country was blacked out at night maybe all of europe was blacked out peggy tried to imagine paris dark at night the picture didnt want to form the city of light was bound to be as shrouded as any other european capital after what the germans did to prague and marianske lazne and the rest of czechoslovakia they wouldnt leave paris alone she supposed it was a genuine military target but the idea of bombs falling on it made her almost physically ill she walked past a restaurant not far from the hotel where theyd put her up she hadnt the slightest desire to go inside like everyone else in germany she had a ration card even in a restaurant she had to spend points on what she ate whatever she got most of it would be cabbage and potatoes and black bread fats of any sortbutter cheese lardwere hard to come by milk and codliver oil were reserved almost exclusively for children and nursing and pregnant women a man with a white mustache walked past her he tipped his hat as he went by his wool suit had seen better years but he couldnt do much about that the germans had ration points for clothes too if you bought a topcoat that was about it for the year peggy didnt have all the clothes she wanted either most of what shed brought to czechoslovakia was still there or maybe more likely it was on some german womans back these days a team of horses drew an antiaircraft gun down the street the horses might have come straight out of the civil war the fieldgray uniforms on the soldiers were modern though as for the gun it might have appeared from the future she didnt think shed ever seen a piece of hardware that looked more lethal newsboys held up papers full of headlines about german triumphs people walked past without buying if the berliners were enthusiastic about the war they hid it well english and french air pirates bombard german towns a boy shouted many innocent women and children murdered read about the latest enemy atrocities peggy almost stopped at the street corner to argue with him only the thought that her husband would have told her she was crazy made her keep her mouth shut she admired herbs common sense most of the time without wanting to imitate it and shed seen the fun the nazis had knocking czechoslovakia flat if they were on the receiving end for a change if this wasnt all just propaganda and nonsense boy did they ever deserve it but the kid wasnt to blame for that he was only doing his job the ones who were to blame were hitler and goebbels and goring and himmler and she couldnt very well tell them where to head in if she took it out on the newsboy what would happen to her neutral or not american or not she didnt want a visit from the gestapo because she looked as shabby as everybody else the berliners assumed she was a german too theyd nod and say guten morgen she could manage that she understood german tolerably well but she spoke french much better when people here expected much more than good morning from her she stumbled badly she hated that she also hated being so dowdy shed made a life of standing out from the crowd no one would ever have noticed her if she didnt make a point of getting noticed if she disliked anything it was invisibility a few minutes later ambling along on a day as gray and gloomy as her mood she found a way to get noticed she walked past a place whose window said rothsteins butchers shop it wasnt bigger or fancier or more run down than the shops to either side a secondhand bookstore to the left a place that sold wickerwork purses and baskets to the right the wickerwork place was busywicker unlike leather didnt eat up ration points rothsteins however had a large sign taped in the window german people dont buy from dirty jews next thing peggy knew she was walking through the door maybe a demon took hold of her only when the bell over the door jangled did she realize what shed done and shed been so proud of herself for wanting to steer clear of the gestapo well so much for that behind the counter rothstein looked astonished you arent one of my regulars he blurted you arent even he stopped but jewish hung in the air anyway youre right im not give me a chicken leg please peggy had enough german for that she could boil the leg on the hot plate in her room it would make a better lunchmaybe lunch and supperthan she was likely to get in the hotel restaurant or a cafe not much good food left for civilians in berlin moving like a man in a dream rothstein weighed the leg he was unmistakably a jew with a long nose and dark curly hair it comes to gramsalmost a weeks ration for meat he said if you like i will bone it so it costs you fewer points bitte peggy said deftly he did now it is only grams i need coupons for so much and two reichsmarks fifty as he spoke he wrapped the chicken inwhat elsebutcher paper sixty cents american money more or less that was a hell of a lot for a leg peggy paid without blinking she also handed over the swastikamarked ration coupons those were part of the game too rothstein gave her a meticulously written receipt danke schon he told her you are very brave you are also very foolish i hope not peggy said auf wiedersehen till i see you again it meant literally she wondered if she was brave enoughor foolish enoughto come back she got out fast but not fast enough somebodyd squealed on her two blackshirts were trotting up the street toward rothsteins what kind of dummkopf do you think you are one of them roared how dare you go into that damned jews place let me see your papers the other one yelled immediately sure peggy took out her american passport and brandished it like a priest turning a crucifix on a couple of vampires the ss men recoiled almost the way vampires would have too oh one of them said disgustedly all right we cant give you what you deserve for buying there but we can make the jew sorry for selling to you and we will the other added gloating anticipation in his voice he didnt know i was an american if peggy sounded appalled it was because she was he knew you werent one of his regular kikes hell pay all right the ss men stormed into the butchers shop a moment later rothstein cried out in pain peggy burst into tears dammit you couldnt win here harry turtledove hitlers war people were saying the maginot line would save france people were saying it would have to save france luc harcourt didnt give a damn about what people were saying all he knew was he was getting sick of being marched backward and forward and inside out hed been bombed and shelled and shot at in the retreat from the german frontier hed been bombed in the encampment behind the maginot line where raw reinforcements filled out the regiment fortunately those little billetsdoux had fallen from planes flying high above not from the boches nasty divebombers they landed all around the camp but hardly any on it now he and his surviving buddies and the strangers in their clean uniforms whod just joined them were moving up toward the front again this time from what sergeant demange said theyd end up in southern belgium if we get there in one piece luc thought that wasnt obvious hell whether theyd get there at all wasnt obvious theyd started out from the transit camp in trucks luc hadnt much cared for thatas if his opinion mattered a sous worth but if german planes shot up your truck wouldnt you roast like a pork loin in the oven of course you wouldand your meat would end up smelling like burnt pork too no german planes harried the trucks that didnt mean they carried luc and his comrades very far toward the front german bombers had done their worst to the roads leading north and east if a truck couldnt get through if it sank to the axles when it tried to use the muddy fields instead of the cratered roads if all that happenedand it didyou got out and you damn well walked here we are back in sergeant demange said the cigarette in the corner of his mouth twitching as he talked this isnt so bad sarge luc said back then you wore horizonblue now youre in khaki oh shut up smartass once they get muddy all uniforms are the same color demange said the only thing you know about a guy in clean new clothes is that he doesnt come up to the front much so you cant trust him ahead the rumble of artillery got steadily louder the frenchmen were heading its wayand it was heading theirs and behind them came a rumble of engines something had got past the unholy mess the nazis had made of the roads move to one side damn you someone yelled when luc saw french tanks he was only too glad to stand aside and let them go by the officer whod shouted a tall colonel with a small mustache and a big nose stood very straight in the cupola of the lead machine the french tanks were larger and had smoother lines than the german machines luc had already seen too closely by the determined look on the colonels face he didnt want to stop till he got to berlin hes a fishing pole isnt he luc remarked two fishing poles sergeant demange answered that was what luc thought he heard anyway deux galles but demange went on colonel de gaulle knows more about tanks than anybody else on our side i think is that who he is luc had heard of de gaulle though he hadnt known him by sight the tall officer did indeed advocate tanks so tirelesslyand tiresomelythat he infuriated his superiors did you serve under him last time nah wish i would have sergeant demange spat out a tiny butt and ground it into the mud with his boot he lit another gitane then continued if i remember straight he got wounded and captured early on last time around and sat out most of the war in a pow camp lucky stiff muttered somebody in back of luc he almost turned around to find out who let his mouth run ahead of his brain like that a tiny bit louder and sergeant demange would have heard it in which case god help whoever it was on second thought luc didnt want to know if he didnt the ferocious little sergeant couldnt squeeze it out of him the last tank growled past none of the other commanders looked to be within ten centimeters of colonel de gaulle maybe that was just as well for them they couldnt have much room inside the turret when they needed to duck down and fight lucs company stopped at a field kitchen as daylight leached from the sky a cook with a double chincooks never went hungryshoveled potatoes and cabbage and stewed pork into his mess tin he stared at his supper with resigned dismay which side are we on anyway funny guy the cook said ive only heard that one five times in the past halfhour you dont want it you can go hungry you think i give a rats ass luc prodded a pale piece of pork with a forefinger i thought thats what this was the cook swore at him in earnest then washed down with vin extremely ordinaire the stew wasnt bad luc smoked a cigarette then wrapped himself in a blanket inside what had been somebodys house till a bomb blew out most of one wall his buddies had a makeshift brazier going a bucket half full of hot coals hung from a scrapmetal tripod so it didnt set the floor on fire it gave off less heat than luc wished it would but it was better than nothing he slept like a hibernating animal not only were nights endlessly long but hed never been so worn in his life some of the guys in his company fell asleep while they marchedand they kept going too he envied themhe didnt seem able to do that himself some time in the middle of the night a hard hand shook him awake he groped for his belt knife sergeant demanges lowvoiced chuckle stopped him take it easy the noncom said if i wanted you dead youd be holding a lily by now but no go out and stand watch for a couple of hours do i have to luc asked around a yawn damn right you do suppose german parachutists came down out of the sky what would we do without a warning at night luc didnt believe it but the fritzes had done all kinds of nasty things with parachutists maybe theyd make a night attack behind the french line and no maybe about what sergeant demange would do if luc gave him any more lip with a martyred sigh luc got out of the blanket and put on his boots and his helmet he was already wearing everything else including his greatcoat his breath smoked inside the battered house it smoked more when he stepped outside the night was mostly clear stars glittered frigidly in a sky blacker than dried blood carolers would have loved a night like this right now luc would have bet nobody in europe loved anybody else the war hadnt gone to bed off to the northeast the thunder of artillery went on he could see flashes against the horizon ours or theirs he wondered after a moment he decided it was probably both just ahead lay towns whose names brought back thunderous memories of the last wars early days charleroi and a little farther east namur the germans were swarming this way again like fieldgray ants towards an enticing picnic feast theyd fallen short of paris the last time around either they would again or luc didnt want to think about or he didnt want to think about anything he wanted to go back to sleep or to fall asleep out here fear of the boches didnt hold him back fear of sergeant demange did after what seemed like forever but probably wasnt another soldier stumbled out of the house go back to sleep he said ive got it a moment later he added damn sergeant demange anyway under his breath sure luc said he went back inside wondering whether demange ever slept on all the evidence he seemed a piece of wellmade machinery rather than a man maybe he ran on cigarette smoke and coffee come to think of it maybe i do too luc found the blanket hed so sorrowfully abandoned he took off boots and helmet and lay down again the blanket didnt seem to do a thing to get him any warmer he wondered if hed lie there till dawn finally came next thing he knew he was asleep wake up you bum you snore i do not luc answered automatically even before his eyes opened twenty minutes later with some kind of mush and strong coffee inside him he was marching again refugees from namur and charleroi crowded the road some of them cheered the soldiers in their odd walloon french others swore at them if we werent in the way between the germans and your damned country theyd leave us alone as far as im concerned hitlers welcome to belgium sergeant demange retorted and you cocksuckers deserve him too now get the hell out of our way before we open up on you he would have done it not only that he would have laughed while he did it the belgians must have figured that out because they tumbled off the road with haste that would have been funny if this were a film and not the ruination of their lives then more belgian soldiers started falling back past the oncoming french you can have a taste of those bastards a walloon said a couple of flemings added something to that but luc didnt know what it was if they hadnt worn belgian uniform he would have shot them their language sounded too goddamn much like german charleroi had got the bejesus knocked out of it in the first war luc supposed it must have been rebuilt since but it had got pounded again some of the wrecked buildings were still smoking the nazis had just worked it over then half a rag doll lay in the gutter at another time it might have been poignant enough to move luc to tears but hed seen men who looked like that he glanced at the doll and marched on out beyond charleroi some of colonel de gaulles tanks were firing at the enemy german shells landed around them without waiting for orders luc yanked the entrenching tool off his belt and started digging in if sergeant demange didnt like it hed say so a look out of the corner of lucs eyes told him the noncom was digging too nodding to himself luc made the dirt fly some french king a long time ago said paris is worth a mass vaclav jezek had learned that in history class as far as he was concerned paris was mostly a mess by steamer from constanta to marseille dodging italian subs and seaplanes by train from marseille to paris by taxicab to the czech embassy which served as headquarters for the government in exile by taxi again to a camp outside paris the camp held about a regiments worth of czechoslovakian soldiers mostly czechs with a sprinkling of antifascist slovaks and ruthenians hardly anyone had his own weapon the french wasted little time passing out rifles they were eager to get all their friends into the fight against hitlers legions next to none of them spoke any czech though they did the same thing as the pole whod interned vaclav they used german it workedmost czechs knew at least some and could translate for the ones who didnt but speaking the enemys language with your friends was humiliating and infuriating the germans seemed to know where the camp was their bombers visited it every so often this wasnt the first time vaclav had had to sprint for a trenchfar from it the bombers also visited paris on the radio the germans claimed to be hitting only military targets that would have been funny if it didnt make jezek want to cry three days before christmas his platoon jammed itself into a bus a generation earlier buses had hauled french troops from paris to the warsaving battle of the marne some of the machines the czechoslovak regiment used looked to be of vintage close to it was cold outside it didnt stay cold inside the bus for long not when it was full of twice as many men as it was supposed to carry everybody lit a cigarette inside of seconds the smoke made vaclavs eyes sting he didnt care he was smoking furiously himself gauloises packed a heftier jolt than the miserable excuses for tobacco hed got since he was interned the driver a middleaged frenchman chainsmoked with his passengers a patch covered his left eye but didnt hide all the damage a bullet or shell fragment had done to his face he seemed to manage all right with one eye at least as far as driving went whatever springs the bus might have had once upon a time had long since gone to the big coachwork shop in the sky vaclav felt every pothole every rock i wonder if well have any kidneys left by the time we get wherever were going he said to the soldier sitting next tohalf on top ofhim why worry the other man replied his dark curly hair and hooked nose said he was a jew vaclav normally had little use for jews but he supposed you could count on them to fight the nazis this fellow went on if weve still got em when we get there the germansll blow em out of us right vaclav eyed him maybe you werent so smart if you supposed something like that if you dont think we can beat them why did you sign up for this you gotta try the jewish soldier paused to light a gitane he spoke czech like a bigcity man if he wasnt from prague vaclav didnt know anything after sucking in smoke he added damn poles dont like jews any better than the germans do i guess not vaclav hadnt thought of that it was nothing hed ever needed to worry about so how about you goy that wasnt czech or german but vaclav had no trouble working out what it meant how come youre here how come you arent yelling heil hitler who do you think you are asking me questions like that after a moment vaclav tried to shrug inside the crowded bus it wasnt easy fuck hitler he said simply thatll do the jew nodded im david who the hell are you vaclav jezek laughed like everybody else almost david started singing the christmas song about good king wenceslaus he knew all the words vaclav must have looked flabbergasted because the jew started to laugh ive been hearing it ever since i was born david said hell i must have heard it while i was still inside my mom id better know it i guess vaclav hadnt thought about that either if you were a jew you had your own stuff but everybody elses stuff had to land on you too whether you wanted it or not if that wasnt weird what was after a few seconds somebody else started singing about good king wenceslaus it was that season of the year a moment later the czech carol filled the bus like cigarette smoke well i see what you mean vaclav said david nodded again bet your ass its always like this the driver didnt speak any czech to him the carol was just noise he didnt need long to get sick of it he yelled something in french not enough of the czech soldiers spoke enough french for it to do any good then the driver screamed shut up you fucking pigdogs auf deutsch maybe hed learned it in a prison camp or something that got peoples attentionmaybe not in a good way but it did ah your mother david said first in czech then in yiddish vaclav realized things were starting to go wrong when a gendarmeor maybe he was a military policemanwaved the bus onto a detour the new road was narrow and twisty the driver started swearing so did the czech soldiers as they slid from side to side then the side road petered outor maybe there was a crater up ahead heraus the driver said as the bus door wheezed open what do we do now vaclav asked what else david said we walk walk they did vaclav had lost his conditioning after getting interned tramping along with a fortykilo pack on his back wasnt his idea of a good time the road seemed uphill both ways despite spatters of sleet he soon started sweating he threw down a cigarette butt and heard it hiss to extinction in an icy puddle that sparked a thought they say smoking is bad for your wind screw em david replied he had another cigarette in his mouth airplane motors droned high overhead bombs whistled down out of the clouds they fell at random across the french countryside the low ceiling grounded the german stukas vaclav didnt miss themthose bastards could put one right on top of an outhouse if they saw you walk in there to take a crap his platoon of course wasnt the only unit on the march he sometimes wondered if there was anybody in france who wasnt they went past a bunch of frenchmen whod got hit by one of those randomly falling bombsa kilo job or maybe a it wasnt pretty if the swine that went through a meatpacking plant wore uniforms they would have looked a lot like this about halfway through czech medics did what they could to help their french counterparts you had to hope the french would have done the same for a czech outfit the rest of the platoon went around the blood and the moans and the shattered bodies vaclav didnt look closely at them hed already seen more death and devastation than he ever wanted to remember and now youre volunteering to be part of it again he asked himself you could have sat tight in that internment camp it wasnt exciting but nobody was out to blow your balls off either his shrug made the straps on that heavy pack dig into his shoulders too late to worry about it now hed been bored in the camp maybe hed been stupid to leave but if everybody sat tight if nobody tried to stop hitler wouldnt the little bastard with the ugly mustache end up telling the world what to do it looked that way to vaclav he glanced over at david slogging along beside him david had his own reasons to hate the nazis all right most of the time czech and jew would have been wary around each other not here the germans had brought them together a miracle of sorts or maybe just proof of the old saying the enemy of my enemy is my friend bombs turned a roadside meadow into a lunar landscape cattle lay sprawled like soldiers they werent bloated and stinking some of them still moved and lowed piteously so theyd gone down in this latest bombardment part of the weight vaclav carried was rations all the same fresh meat david got the words out before he could the platoon commander was a freshfaced lieutenant named svabinsky maybe he could have kept the soldiers from running into the field maybe not but he didnt even try beefsteaks he said happily and pulled the bayonet off his belt they werent exactly beefsteaks no butcher worth half his pay would have given them such a fancy name they were chunks of meat haggled off the carcasses by hungrily enthusiastic amateurs toasted over a roaring fire vaclavs had a charred crust and a bloody interior he didnt care the gobbet was big enough to make his belly shut up what else mattered in the field he rolled himself in a blanket and lay down by the fire lieutenant svabinsky made sure people fed it through the night some time in the middle of the long cold darkness the blaring of car horns woke vaclav people shouted in french and frenchaccented german and even once or twice in czech road damage might have stopped the buses but the french army had cobbled together this swarm of automobiles to bring the czechoslovakian soldiers up to the front as vaclav stumbled towards one of themthey showed no lights of coursehe laughed through a yawn the french were in a fix the same way his own country had been but they were trying to muddle through he couldnt imagine the efficient germans coming up with a mad arrangement like this he piled into a car as soon as it was packed the driver took off vaclav hoped the fellow knew where he was going he must have even staying on the road couldnt have been easy but the frenchman did it vaclav dozed off again jerking awake whenever the car hit a pothole somebody outside said something in a language that sounded like german vaclavs eyes flew open morning twilight let him see a soldier in a frenchlooking uniform what came out of the mans mouth still sounded like german a belgian vaclav realized are we in belgium already the soldier turned out to speak french too that helped the driver though not vaclav the czech was glad to have a little light the road was worse than ever and wound through rugged heavily wooded country what is this place vaclav asked in german they call it the ardennes the driver answered in the same tongue why do they want us here vaclav said youd have to be crazy to try and push an attack through terrain like this with a magnificent gallic shrug the driver said with people like the germans who can tell somebody yelled and waved the frenchman hit the brakes the cara battered old citroenlurched to a stop you get out here getting out was harder than squeezing in had been vaclav stretched and twisted to work the kinks out of his back he wished he had some coffee youse is the czechs what the french officer spoke sounded more like bad polish than czech but vaclav couldbarelyfollow it the frenchman went on come these waysi will shove you into positions he was trying anyhow and maybe the czechs did need to be shoved into positions artillery growled up ahead it wasnt too close but it was there maybe the germans were crazy or maybe this was a feint with the main force up in the north the way it looked his shrug wasnt so fancy as the drivers but it would do he didnt have to decide whether the nazis were making a big push here or a little one all he had to do was go where people told him and shoot at anybody and anything decked out in german fieldgray he wasnt the only czech soldier yawning as a ragged column formed he figured he could just about manage what they needed from him stille nacht heilige nacht hansulrich rudel sang along with the rest of the flyers and groundcrew men at the forward base in holland they had a tree brought west from germany and decorated with gingerbread men and candles and tinsel and ornaments made from scrap metal by mechanics in between patch jobs and other repairs on the stukas hansulrich had heard that carol and all the others since before the day he first knew what the words meant with his father a churchman it couldnt very well have been any different but at his fathers house and at his fathers church the songs hadnt seemed to mean so much people sang them because theyd always sung them sang them without thinking about what the words really said things were different here you dont know what life is worth till you lay it on the line rudel thought everybody here knew this christmas might be his last that made it count for ever so much more than it had back in peacetime one of the other pilots raised a glass of schnapps absent friends he said and knocked back the shot absent friends the luftwaffe men chorused most of them had something strong to hand too hansulrich didnt a groundcrew man clucked at him shouldnt drink toasts in water its unlucky not water rudel replied with dignity but his eggnog was unfortified close enough too damn close the other pilot raised his glass again and heres to close enough and too damn close as long as the bastards miss amen hansulrich drank to that too even if it was with plain eggnog off in the distance guns boomed the ceiling was too low to let planes take off and land but the war went on one of the groundcrew men a graying wrinkled fellow with only three fingers on his left hand said wasnt like this the first christmas in the last war ive heard about the truce franz hansulrich said was it really as big a thing as people sayour landsers playing football with the tommies and all that i know people who watched the games franz answered i know one guy who played i didnt see em myselfmy regiment was opposite the frenchmen we didnt play football with them but we did come up out of the trenches and meet in nomansland damned if we didnt we traded cigarettes and rations and stuff you could drink and we all said what a bunch of assholes our officers wereno offense sir everybody laughed rudel made sure his laughter was louder than anyone elses you couldnt let the men think you were a stuffed shirt even if you weremaybe especially if you were hansulrich knew he was at least by most peoples standards he shrugged he had his fathers stern lutheran god and he had the fuhrer whom he saw as gods instrument on earth and he had his stuka which was his own instrument on earth as long as he had them he didnt need to worry about anything else or so he thought till bombs started walking toward the hut where he and his countrymen were celebrating christmas the weather might be lousy here but it was good enough farther west to let planes take off and the english or french were paying a call they were bombing blind of course up there above the clouds let it fall and its bound to come down on somebodys head that had to be what they were thinking and they were right the luftwaffe did the same thing when the weather was bad as it so often was at this season hansulrich didnt want to be the first one running for a trench he also didnt want to wait too long and go skyhigh in case the bombardiers got lucky the line between courage and foolhardiness could be a fine one franz took the bull by the horns im never going to go up for the goddamn ritterkreuz he said and dashed out the door where one man went others could follow without losing pride a zigzag trench ran only a few meters outside the hut for such occasions as these as hansulrich jumped down into ithis boots squelched in mudhe tried to imagine winning the knights cross to the iron cross himself hed got an iron cross second class a week before an early christmas present his co called it but you could win an iron cross second class just by staying alive at the front for a couple of weeksoh not quite but it seemed that way franz had the ribbon for one no doubt from the last war back then the iron cross second class was almost the only medal an enlisted man could win hitler had an iron cross first class which made him an exceptional hero because hed never even reached sergeant and then hansulrich stopped worrying about hitlers iron cross or anything else but living through the next few minutes the enemy planes up there were bombing blind but they couldnt have done better on a sunny clear summers day they might not have done so well because highaltitude bombing was turning out to be one of the big disappointments of the war it was neither as accurate nor as terrifying and intimidating as the experts had claimed it would be which didnt mean winding up on the wrong end of it was any fun now rudel got a taste of what he gave the foe the earth shook under him like a blancmange the noise was impossible overwhelming blast did its best to tear his lungs out from the inside after the longest six or eight minutes of hansulrichs life the bombers droned away der herr gott im himmel he said then he said it again louder because he couldnt hear himself the first time he stuck his head up and looked over the lip of the trench the hut still stood but it leaned drunkenly its windows were blown outor more likely in bomb craters turned the landscape into a miniature verdun something a few hundred meters away was burning enthusiasticallya truck hansulrich saw sergeant dieselhorst stuck his head up a few meters from hansulrich i wouldnt mind not doing that again the rear gunner remarked and then apropos of nothing that presently surrounded him merry christmas merry christmas rudel echoed automatically where were you you werent singing carolsi know that i should hope not the noncom said if you want to waste your time that way go ahead but i was doing something more important i was sleeping by god he pointed to some trees not far away i was happy as a clam under there but then the goddamn bombs started coming down he sounded irate in a particular way hansulrich nodded because he felt that same indignation when he went out and dropped a fat one on a french truck column that was business but when the sons of bitches on the other side tried to blow him to the moon it felt like dirty pool how dare they do such a thing didnt they know the fuhrer and the reich were going to win any which way why were they working so hard in what was bound to be a forlorn hope and why were they coming so close to killing him that was the real question i wonder if weve got any fighters up there somebody said if we do those allied shitheadsll be sorry in a hurry hansulrich nodded hed listened to me pilots going on about what sitting ducks british and french bombers were they couldnt run they couldnt hide and they couldnt fight back he would have liked that better if his stuka werent in the same boat no matter how scary it seemed to the troops on the ground it couldnt get out of its own way if the messerschmitts didnt keep enemy fighters away from them jus would tumble out of the sky as often as the western allies bombers did we ought to pay those damned sky pirates back someone else said lifting a phrase popular in german papers dieselhorsts snort put paid to that in case it hadnt the sergeant went on how we cant take off even if the weather didnt stink some of that load came down on the airstrip theyre going to have to flatten it out again before we can use it we might as well drink and play skat because we arent flying for a while a sergeant feeling his oats could sound more authoritative than any major ever hatched sergeants mysteriously mystically knew things officers could command but they didnt have that amazing certainty anybody think more of those fuckers are coming asked a groundcrew man in greasy muddy coveralls by his tone he wanted somebody like dieselhorst to pat him on the head and say something like no dont worry about it youre safe now but no one said anything of the kind hansulrich realized he wouldnt have minded some reassurance either when the silence had stretched for a bit the groundcrew man swore again maybe that made him feel a little better anyhow rudel didnt usually grant himself even that safety valve though some of the close calls hed had on missions made him slip every now and then he always felt bad about it afterwards but coming out with something ripe made him feel better when he did it he climbed out of the trench and brushed mud and dirt off of himself we might as well go back he said the best way to get even with the enemy is to have a good time when the luftwaffe men went back inside their shelter they found that blast and wind had blown out most of the candles on the christmas tree a pilot with a cigarette lighter got them going again he flicked the lighter closed and put it in his pocket god only knows how long ill be able to get fuel for it he said then its back to matchesas long as we have matches he wore an iron cross first class nobody could accuse him of being a coward or a defeatistbut he sounded like one hansulrich wanted to take him aside and talk some sense into him but when he tried to do that the people he was talking to had a way of getting angry instead of appreciating his advice he didnt like it which didnt mean he hadnt noticed it he kept his mouth shut caroling some more would have been nice but nobody seemed to want to that made a certain amount of sense if you were listening for airplane engines you didnt want to be noisy yourself rudel missed the music all the same sergeant dieselhorst had come in with the rest of them he was drinking schnapps soon enough he was laughing and joking with the rest of the men hansulrich wished he could fit in so easilyor at all chapter achilly wind whipped snow through the air almost horizontally a good coal stove heated the officers barracks outside of drisa all the same anastas mouradian shivered ill never be warm again he said in his deliberate russian never not till july and the five minutes of summer they have here sergei yaroslavsky and the other men in the barracks were all russians they hooted at the effete southerner theyd all seen plenty of weather worse than this hell we could fly in this if we had to sergei said and we might too somebody else added is it five oclock yet after a glance at his watch sergei said a couple of minutes till good the other flyer said turn on the radio lets hear the news mouradian was closest to the set he clicked it on it made scratchy flatulent noises as it warmed up there were better radiosyaroslavsky had seen and heard that in czechoslovakia he didnt say anything about it things werent so bad as they had been during the purges the year before but a careless word could still make you disappear or you could disappear for no reason plenty of people had comrades the news the announcer said in the west the capitalists and fascists continue to murder one another he gave a summary of the days fightingor rather the claims and counterclaims about the days fighting finishing plainly by the lies and contradictions on display neither side in this struggle of reactionary decadence is to be believed may the devils grandmother eat them all up another pilot said the sentiment was unexceptionable the way the man put it wasnt russians talked about the devil and his relations all the time when the soviet union was aggressively atheist thoughsuch talk could land you in trouble if someone who didnt like you reported it anything could land you in trouble sergeid just been thinking about that in the far east japanese imperialists continue to encroach on the territory of the fraternal socialist mongolian peoples republic the announcer said the foreign commissar comrade litvinov has stated that such incursions cannot and will not be tolerated indefinitely wonder if thats where we go next mouradian said sergei had wondered the same thing when he was ordered to fly their sb out of the ukraine but theyd ended up at the other end of the ussr instead about as far from the trouble in mongolia as they could get and there might have been reasons for that because the next words out of the newsreaders mouth were the semifascist smiglyridz regime in poland has once more rejected the soviet unions just and equitable demands for an adjustment of the border in the northeast the poles still cling to their illgotten and illegal gains from the war they waged against the ussr in the early s everybody leaned toward the radio in portentous tones the announcer went on comrade stalin has spoken with grave concern of the way the polish regime mistreats the ethnic byelorussians in the area in question how long the peaceloving soviet people can tolerate these continued provocations only time will tell he went on to talk about the overfulfillment of the norms for the current fiveyear plan yaroslavsky listened to all that with half an ear it didnt directly affect him the other did when stalin said he didnt like the way somebody did something that somebody was commonly very sorry very soon and hardly anything could make a country sorrier faster than flight after flight of sb bombers i didnt think wed go sergei said if the poles yelled to the nazis for help that would put german troops right on our border and he didnt say and that wouldnt be so good most of the men in the barracks had served in czechoslovakia they knew what rough customers the hitlerites were anastas mouradian picked up where he left off if the nazis get bogged down against england and france theyll be too busy to do anything about what goes on here several flyers nodded sergei was one of them it looked that way to him too he would have said it if his crewmate hadnt soldiers are moving up toward the border so the pilot who said that let his voice trail off he wasnt a general and he wasnt a prophet you didnt want to come out with anything that might be remembered too well we arent going to fly right this minute another officer said and produced a bottle of vodka despite what sergei had said before he was obviously right the bottle went round pretty soon another one followed it one more after that and they wouldnt have been able to walk or see let alone fly the red air force ran on vodka as surely as it ran on aviation gasoline they got their orders the next day sergei still felt the drinking bout like the other flyers lieutenant colonel borisov summoned to his office he did his best not to show it we are going to liberate our byelorussian brethren from the yoke of the polish semifascist regime the squadron commander declared marshal smiglyridz has refused to be reasonable and democratic and so we must persuade him hes refused to do what we want and so we must pound the shit out of him sergei had no trouble translating communist jargon into what went on in the real world by the knowing grunts that came from several other men neither did anyone else red army units will enter the territory to be liberated at tomorrow morning borisov declared his eyes were catgreen but set on a slant like so many russians he likely had some tatar in the woodpile your assignment will be to strike at polish troops and to bomb the rail junction at glubookoje to prevent the smiglyridz regime from bringing up reinforcements questions what if the weather doesnt let us fly comrade lieutenant colonel sergei asked then we will stay on the ground borisov answered but our superiors do not believe that is likely what exactly did he mean there did higherups in the red army and red air force have reliable forecasts of good weather or would the sbs take off no matter how rotten the weather was yaroslavsky suspected the latter with aircooled engines the bombers wouldnt freeze up the way they might with liquid cooling and theyd had skis installed instead of landing wheels so they could deal with snow pretty well even so sergei suspected a plan somewhere said air support will be laid on at such and such a time in such and such places with so many bombers and so many escorting fighters bad weather plans like that didnt worry about such mundane details come what might the air support would be laid on other questions borisov asked his tone said he didnt really want any more but anastas mouradian raised his hand anyway frowning borisov nodded at him what do we do if the nazis come in on the poles side comrade lieutenant colonel mouradian asked several people inhaled sharply that was a question with teeth all right borisov didnt look happy the hope and expectation are that this will not occur yes sir mouradian said and he waited the contest of wills was silent the squadron commander didnt want to say anything else mouradian didnt want to come right out and ask but what if it does that silence stretched tighter and tighter finally it snapped so did borisov we are at war with germany if german troops or aircraft operate against us we are to prosecute the war against them is that clear yes sir thank you sir mouradian said it was clear to sergei too he didnt like it poland and romania had been the ussrs shield against fascist germany if the poles scream for help to their western neighbor that shield was gone stalin never would have made demands on poland if the germans werent up to their eyebrows in war on their other frontier but if they werent quite up to their eyebrows sergei had faced messerschmitts and german antiaircraft guns in czechoslovakia he didnt relish doing it again of course the next time anyone set over him gave a damn about his opinion would be the first maybe the high command did know something sergei was sure stranger things had happened though he couldnt think of one offhand the day was cold but it was bright and sunny the sb was fueled up and bombed up and ready to go sergei and mouradian and ivan kuchkov climbed in groundcrew men spun the bombers props the engines roared to life sergei ran his checks all the instruments looked good the sb slid down the snow airstrip sergei pulled back on the stick the nose went up the airplane left the ground anastas mouradian cranked up the landing gear the skis retracted almost as neatly as wheels snow down below made navigation a challenge it would have been harder yet if artillery bursts hadnt shown the way tanks and soldiers were swathed in white but cast long shadows across the even whiter snow there was the border and there were the soviet troops crossing it to liberate the fraternal peaceloving people who lived just to the west and there were the polish oppressors more soldiers in white with shadows stretching over the snow antiaircraft guns opened up on the sbs after facing german fire sergei didnt think much of this he saw a good concentration of troops and trucks ahead there was the railroad line too if he plastered the neighborhood he could do what lieutenant colonel borisov wanted done ready ivan he bawled into the speaking tube ready sir the noncom answered khorosho mouradian will tell you when to drop sergei said anastas was down in the bottom front of the sbs glasshouse cockpit peering through the bombsight now he shouted and the stick of bombs tumbled from the planes belly as always the sb immediately got peppier and more maneuverable yaroslavsky took advantage of that by getting out of there as fast as he could hed seen a couple of gullwinged pzl fighters in the neighborhood they werent supposed to be anywhere near as dangerous as mes but any fighter was dangerous if you happened to be a bomber other sbs were also hitting that concentration the poles down there had to be catching hell well if they wouldnt give the soviet union what it was rightfully entitled to this was what they got back to the airstrip he flew he found it much to his relief the skicarrying landing gear descended getting down was an adventure but at last the sb slid to a stop groundcrew men wearing white snow smocks over greatcoats rushed forward to refuel the plane and bomb it up again howd it go one of them called his breath smoking in the frosty air routine sergei answered just routine happy new year peggy druce said as the clock struck twelve its oh boy she raised a glass of what was supposed to be scotch the stuff tasted more like oven cleaner in wartime berlin you took what you could get and you were damn glad you got anything a handful of other people sat drinking in the hotel restaurant they were split about fiftyfifty between neutrals stuck in berlin and germans who felt like tying one on even if the world seemed to be going to hell in a handbasket some of the germans were civilians others in uniform the other way to tell them apart was that the military men were drinking harder the radio blared out war news everything was going well in the westif you believed the announcer anyhow soon a battle of annihilation will sweep the french and english out of belgium which they invaded with flagrant disregard for international law the fellow declared he had a high shrill unpleasant voice peggy thought so anyhow it put her in mind of screechy chalk on a blackboard then he started screaming about what the evil communists in russia were doing to poland it is a jewishbolshevist conspiracy to terrorize small nations he said what about czechoslovakia peggy wondered what about holland what about luxembourg what about belgium asking questions like that was pointless here even if the gestapo didnt haul you away and start pulling out your toenails the germans wouldnt get it they thought anything they did was okay because they did it if the other guy did the same thing he was a dirty rotten nogoodnik and then the newsman came out with something peggy hadnt heard before because of the magnitude of the unprovoked invasion marshal smiglyridz has asked the fuhrer for aid against the bolsheviks foreign minister von ribbentrop has stated that that aid will be forthcoming we are already at war with the soviet union now we have the chance to teach the reds and the jews the lesson they deserve peggy looked around nobody she could see looked excited about teaching the russians a lesson one of the soldiers a major old enough to have fought in the last war knocked back half a tumblers worth of something put his head on his folded arms and fell asleep at his table the goodtime girl whod been with him stalked away in disgust another soldier stood up and raised a glass on high heres to the twofront war he yelled his buddies dragged him down they spoke in low urgent voices he didnt want to listen when they couldnt make him shut up they hauled him out into the cold pitchblack blackout night peggy wondered if it was already too late for him was somebody in there taking notes she wouldnt have been surprised people said there was at least one informer in every crowd peggy didnt always believe what people said but it seemed likely here music started coming out of the radio saccharinesweet it was as annoying as the newscaster jazz was one more thing the nazis wouldnt put up with degenerate negro music they called it no matter what they called it what they made themselves was sappy and boring a naval officer came up to the table where peggy was drinking by herself may i join you he asked sure peggy held up her left hand so the diamonds in her wedding ring sparkled dont expect too much thats all he smiled his long weathered face didnt seem to have room for amusement but it turned out to thank you for the warning i may need it less than you think though he set down his drink and showed off the thin gold band on the fourth finger of his own left hand if i ask your name will you think i am trying to seduce you probably peggy answered which startled a laugh out of him she gave him her name even so and asked his i am friedrich reinbergera korvettenkapitan as you see he brushed the three gold stripes on one cuff with the other hand then he switched languages lieutenant commander you would say in english okay peggy was feeling ornery so she asked wheres your wife lieutenant commander in dachau not far from munich with the kinder reinberger nodded peggy noddedhe sounded like a bavarian i was called here to report oncertain things when my destroyer came into port maria i think believes yet i am at sea he finished his drink and waved for another one the blond girl who came over to get his glass wore a black gown cut down to there in front and even lower in back and slit up to there down below reinberger followed her with his eyes as she sashayed back to the bar he didnt slobber or anything but he did watch peggy couldnt very well blame him it was a hell of a dress if she were ten years youngerhell five years youngershe would have wanted it herself the girl brought back a new drink by then peggy was ready for a refill too that gave the german naval officer another chance to eye the girls strut he made the most of it when peggy got the fresh drink reinberger raised his glass to he said to peggy echoed and drank with him if hed said something like to our victory in she wouldnt have she was damned if she wanted to see the nazis win but toasting the year was harmless enough what is an american doing in germany in the middle of a war reinberger asked peggy looked him in the eye she was tempted to spit in his eye but he didnt seem like a bad guy still she didnt sugarcoat the truth i was in czechoslovakia when you people invaded it oh he shrugged if the czechs were more ah reasonable it might not have come to that but they thought england and france would save them and so another shrug dachau peggy wasnt drunk but she felt a buzz her wits worked slower than she wished they did it wasnt a big city or anything but shed heard of it before how come after a moment she remembered dachau isnt that where they she didnt know how to go on yes that is where they korvettenkapitan reinberger didnt finish it either he did say every nation has in it people who are not trusted by the government we keep them there from some of the whispers peggy had heard the ss did more to people in dachau than just keep them there but she couldnt prove that probably the only way to prove it was to end up on the inside she had a magpie curiosity but she didnt want to know that badly where in the united states do you live reinberger asked it wasnt the smoothest change of subject peggy had ever seen but it also could have been worse philadelphia she answered homesickness rose up inside her like a great choking cloud she had to look down at the tabletop and blink several times while tears stung her eyes i know something of the porti visited before the last war and again three no four years ago now but all i know of the city is that it is large third biggest in the country peggy agreed not without pride and we dont lock people up there even if they arent trusted by the government and we never would not unless they were niggers or japs or something the music on the radio got a little less syrupy than it had been do you care to dance reinberger asked she gave him a crooked grin sure you wouldnt rather ask the bargirl youve got a better chance with her i be nothe shook his headi am not looking for that not now how do i expect maria to stay for me if i do not stay for her a lot of germans had trouble with sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander meeting one who didnt made up peggys mind for her okay she said he danced well enough he stayed with the beat and he led firmly if he lacked the inspiration the sense of fun that separated really good dancers from people who were just all rightthen he did that was all he held peggy tight without trying to mash himself against her or grope her he wascorrect a diplomat would have called it thank you she said when the music stopped that was nice ja he nodded and thank you also as they went back to the table he added much better than shooting up russian ships in the baltic well gee theres a compliment peggy exclaimed lieutenant commander reinberger laughed he waved for another drink peggy nodded to show she wanted one too the barmaid in the startling outfit fluttered her fingers to show she saw peggy asked thats what you were doing before you got leave shooting up russian ships ja reinberger said the baltic in winter is perfectly filthy too storms fog waves iceand always maybe a uboat waits to give you a present anyone who enjoys combat a dummkopf is hitler did peggy said incautiously she wondered if she would find out more about what went on in dachau than she ever wanted to know your big mouth she told herself not for the first time the barmaid came back with the fresh drinks then she almost fell out of that dress as she bent over to give reinberger his he noticed she wanted him to notice but he didnt do anything or say anything about it she looked annoyed as she walked away from everything i know the fuhrer is braver than most men reinberger said that was the straight nazi line from everything peggyd heard it also happened to be true which was discouraging did the russians shoot back she asked they tried wallowing freighters with popguns have not much chance against warships reinberger answered they are brave enough themselves no matter what the radio says so he didnt think much of dr goebbels endless propaganda barrage that was interesting no matter how brave you are though you must have the tools to do the job no sooner were the words out of his mouth than airraid sirens started wailing the headwaiter shouted the basement is our bomb shelter everyone go to the basement at once have the english and french begun to bomb berlin then reinberger asked as people headed for the door not even once not since ive been here peggy answered do you suppose its the russians the german naval officer looked almost comically surprised i never dreamt they could he answered starting down the stairs not impossible i suppose but it didnt once cross my mind somewhere not far away bombs crump ed outside peggy knew that hateful terrifying sound much too well even though it was new years eveno new years day nowsome people hadnt gone dancing into grumpy sleepylooking men in bathrobes over pajamas and women in housecoats over nightgowns joined the more alert crowd from the party a mustachioed man who spoke german with a bela lugosi accent said they told me this could not happen whoever they were more bomb bursts said they didnt know what they were talking about a woman added goring said you could call him meyer if the enemy ever bombed berlin crump crump boom as far as peggy could see the fat luftwaffe boss had just saddled himself with a jewishsounding name as far as she could see he deserved it he deserved worse but he wasnt likely to get it people didnt get what they deserved often enough boom that one sounded as if it came down right on top of the hotel the lights in the cellar flickered and went out people screamed on notes ranging from bass to shrill soprano the germans and their friends sounded an awful lot like the international crowd at marianske lazne when you dropped bombs on them people were all pretty much alike peggy would have been perfectly happy never to have learned that lesson everyone cheered when after about half a minute the lights came on again a few minutes later sirens shrilled the allclear happy new year lieutenant commander reinberger said dryly hey were alive peggy answered anybody wants to know what i think that makes it happy enough when joaquin delgadillo joined the nationalist army in spain he didnt do it to meet general sanjurjo he did it because he couldnt stand the spanish republic he probably would have done it even if someone as dull and cautious as general franco commanded his side that didnt mean he wasnt delighted to get a glimpse of sanjurjo the story was that the generals airplane had almost crashed coming from portugal to spain when the revolt against the republic broke out people said sanjurjo didnt want to leave all his fancy clothes behind so what if they would have weighed down the plane a real man a real spaniard didnt worry about things like that still joaquin was willing to admit it was probably good that the pilot had worried about them the youngster had seen too many men on both sides throw away their lives for no good reason the republicans were bastards but no denying they were brave bastards and his own side didnt put up with cowards not even for a minute now general sanjurjo stood on a low swell of ground and pointed south he wasnt any too impressive to look at he was old and short and squat and dumpy but he had a good voice and he had some of the same gifts germans said hitler did while he was talking you believed him more than two hundred years ago britain stole part of our fatherland from us sanjurjo said ever since gibraltar has been a thorn in spains side now it is full of communists and fellow travelers people who ran away there so they wouldnt get what was coming to them general sanjurjo laughed a very unpleasant laugh well theyre going to get it whether they want it or not and you soldados de espana youre going to give it to them will you stop before you reach complete victory no joaquin shouted with everyone else in the detachment will you teach england a lesson the likes of which she hasnt had for hundreds of years yes the men yelled with italy and germany and god on our side can anyone hold us back no joaquin shouted once more then strike general sanjurjo cried strike hard for spain as if on cueand it probably wasspanish guns opened up on gibraltars border defenses motors thrummed overhead as german and italian bombers flew off to pound what the british insisted was one of their crown colonies down inside gibraltar antiaircraft guns filled the air with puffs of black smoke other guns fired back at the spanish artillery how many ships did the royal navy have inside the harbor they were vulnerable to air attackno doubt about it but they could put out impressive firepower till the bombers silenced them joaquin knew what shells screaming in meant he didnt wait for orders before he hit the dirt and started digging the british shells landed several hundred meters away but why take chances he wasnt the only guy who started scraping a foxhole out of the hard grayishbrown ground either anyone whod ever seen any action knew what to do come on get up get moving sergeant carrasquel shouted plenty of people did without even thinking a good sergeant was one you feared worse than enemy fire joaquin stayed right where he was then carrasquel kicked him in the ass you too delgadillo you think the pope gave you a dispensation however much joaquin wished his holiness would do exactly that he couldnt very well claim it was true running all hunched overas if that did a pesetas worth of goodhe hurried toward the border along with spaniards in mustardyellow khaki he also saw other troops wearing gray uniforms germans maybe they were from the condor legion the force of volunteers doing what they could for the spanish nationalists or maybe they were wehrmacht regulars the nazis and the nationalists had the same enemies these days after all putting gibraltar out of action would hurt england all over the mediterranean but that wasnt why seeing those big fair men in fieldgray so heartened joaquin delgadilloand no doubt most of the other nationalist troopers who recognized them spaniards on both sides were amateurs at war the honest ones on both sides knew and admitted as much left to their own devices they probably would have made a hash of the attack on gibraltar the british whatever else you could say about them werent amateurs and neither were the germans if they were involved in this it would go the way it was supposed to that didnt mean joaquin couldnt get blown to catsmeat he knew as much but he could hope he wouldnt get blown to catsmeat for no reason at all the way he might with only spaniards running the show shells made freighttrain noises overhead some of the trains sounded enormous and some of the shells when they burst were enormous the ground shook under joaquins feet great gouts of earth fountained skyward and not just of earth he saw a man legs pumping as if he were still running rise fifty or a hundred meters into the air and then plunge earthward again naval guns somebody shouted as if explaining a thing somehow made it less fearful did the british have battleships tied up at gibraltar were the guns now firing on the advancing spaniards and germans designed to fight off battleships trying to batter their way into the harbor joaquin neither knew nor cared he knew only that whether designed for the job or not those guns were terrifyingly good at murdering infantrymen up ahead machine guns started their deadly chatter joaquin dove for cover and started digging in again if you wanted to stay alive in the vicinity of machine guns you had to do that artillery was supposed to have taken out the british murder mills joaquin laughed bitterly they told you that before every attack they lied every goddamn time and you were supposed to go on believing them sure you were rumble of engines rattle of tracksthe condor legion and the italians had tanks these were german machines even if they carried spanish markings good joaquin thought the germans handled their tanks as if they were fighting for their own country the italians handled theirs as if theyd been given a job they didnt want to do the least sign of trouble and they found an excuse for not going forward clangboom that was the sound of an antitank round slaughtering a tank joaquin raised his head a few centimeters sure as hell one of the german machines was ablaze sending up orange flames and a tall column of greasy black smoke if god was kind the british round had killed the men in the tank right away if he wasnt theyd burned like a roast when the slut who was supposed to be watching it got drunk and forgot it was on the fire another tank hit a mine this one didnt catch fire but it did throw a track slewing sideways and stopping in a horribly vulnerable position if the attack suppressed the guns that could reach it the men inside might yet live joaquin liked those oddsabout as little as he liked his own forward an officer shouted his whistle squealed delgadillo looked around again he didnt see the man giving the orders if the bastard didnt have the guts to stand up himself who would stand up for him then sergeant carrasquel rasped come on you lazy puto you think im going to do this all by myself he ran forward the british machine guns didnt cut him down right away joaquin knew why too only the good died young joaquin thought of himself as good but he knew the sergeant wouldnt agree he also knew carrasquel would hound him if alive and haunt him if dead so he got up and loped after the noncom crack crack any bullet you heard like that came much too close to your one and only irreplaceable carcass when you heard a bunch of them you were mighty damn lucky if you didnt get ventilated tanks were good for taking out machinegun nests even the concrete positions the british had built near the border gibraltar wasnt very big if you could get past the frontier defenses you could go ahead and overrun the placecouldnt you down by the harbor or maybe in it something blew up with a fullthroated roar that staggered joaquin maybe it was an ammunition dump or maybe a cruiser whatever it was it wouldnt trouble the spaniards any more more guns poured deadly fire down on them joaquin hit the dirt again he didnt care if sergeant carrasquel pitched a fit what kind of defenses did england have here anyway a cannon or machine gun on every square centimeter of ground and more buried to pop up and spew death he wouldnt have been surprised this had to be more than general sanjurjo expected stukas peeled off one by one and bombed enemy positions one of the divebombers didnt rise into the sky again it added its funeral pyre to the rest of the stinking choking smoke in the air nobody was using gas but sometimes it hardly seemed to matter someone not far from joaquin started shrieking for his mother that only made him dig harder more bullets snarled past him the english seemed to have all the ammunition in the world as he dug he realized he had yet to see his first british soldier chapter alistair walsh was alive and breathing and somewhere in france he heartily approved of the first two the last wasnt so good he couldnt remember just when the bef got driven back over the border they gabbled away in french in the western part of belgium so he couldnt tell by any shift in language but this was france all right and the germans were still doing their damnedest to break through they hadnt managed yet walsh remembered the black days in the spring and early summer of when whole british regimentschrist divisionsgot swallowed up in the kaisers last offensive this was worse then storm troops with submachine guns had spearheaded the german attacks they were right bastards but they went at the speed of shanks mare like everybody else in the great war nowadays the nazis had tanks they sliced through infantry like a hot knife through lard the bef and the french had tanks too officers swore on a stack of biblesand swore profanelythat they had as many tanks as the germans maybe more they sounded as if they knew what they were talking about but whether they did or not they never seemed to have enough of them at the places were it counted and so the bastards in fieldgrayfunny how the mere sight of that color and the beetling shape of that helmet could put your wind upkept carving slices out of the allies forcing them to retreat if they didnt want to get cut off and surrounded the nazis made it over the dyle in rubber boats machine guns knocked out the first boats but german tanks and antiaircraft guns on the far side of the river silenced the machine guns as soon as the germans won a bridgehead they ran pontoon bridges over the dyle and got their tanks across things went downhill from there hey puffin walsh said got a fag on you sure sergeant puffin casper looked like hell his greatcoat was filthy and torn his tin hat sat at an anything but jaunty angle on his head he hadnt shaved since god only knew when and he hadnt bathed since a while before that walsh couldnt very well gig himhe was no lovelier and no cleaner himself and hed smoked his last cigarette an hour earlier he took a couple from the packet puffin held out thanks he said and cupped his hands in front of his mouth to get one lit in spite of the cold nasty wind it wasnt raining right this minute and it wasnt snowing either dirty gray clouds clotted the sky before long it would be doing one or the other or maybe it would split the difference with sleet which was worse than rain or snow somebody not far away started cussing the vile words held no special heat as they might have if the swearer had mashed his thumb with a spanner no his fury was cold and disgusted walsh knew what that meant hed just heard bad news if everyone around him was lucky hed found out his fiancee was having it on with the corner greengrocer if not whats buggered up now walsh asked knowing was better than not knowinghe supposed bloody belgies have packed it in came the reply king leopolds asking hitler for an armistice what they cant do that under other circumstances the outrage in walshs voice would have set him laughing true the allies had agreements not to seek separate peaces but it wasnt as if the dutch hadnt already done it and it wasnt as if everybody didnt already know leopold was a weak reed and halfway toward liking the germans either all the same the news was a jolt a corner of belgium had stayed free all through the last war the belgian army had stayed in the field all through the last war too now the whole country was spreading its legs for the germans after three weeks i know they cant said the soldier with the news sods are doing it anyway and wherever theyre holding the line the nazis can pour right on through christ walsh hadnt thought of that sweet suffering jesus christ sweet suffering jesus christ had had a birthday not long before not that anyone let it get in the way of the serious business of slaughter walsh found a real question to ask what are we doing about it chamberlains deplored it the wireless said the other soldier answered oh thatll set adolfs mustache quivering that will deplored it has he bleeding hell walsh could have gone on for some time but what was the point chamberlain had survived two votes of confidence since the war broke out by a diminishing margin one more might sink him that wouldnt have broken walshs heart he also feared it wouldnt have much effect on the way the bef was fighting a british machine gun up ahead started barking a moment later another joined in oh bleeding hell walsh muttered again hed hoped things would stay quiet for a while the weather was bad enough to have made any push in the last war bog down in mud and slush but there were many more paved roads for wheels to use now while tracks could force a way where even men on foot had trouble going to his glad surprise he heard engines coming up from the southwest matildas somebody yelled the british tanks waltzed up to the line a few minutes later waltz was about all they could do they made eight miles an hour on roads and were slower off they had thick armorgerman antitank shells mostly bounced off of them but they carried only a single riflecaliber machine gun walsh would have wished for french machines that had some hope of keeping up with german panzersand of knocking them out in a standup fight still and all any tanks were better than none if panzers came after you and you couldnt hope to fight them what choice did you have but to fall back walsh waved to the tank commanders who rode head and shoulders out of their cramped turrets give em hell he shouted thats what were here for a tank commander answered in elegant oxbridgian tones walshs own accent was decidedly below the salt after mixing with men of every class in the last war and since he could make sense of all kinds of accents from received pronunciation to cockney to broad yorkshire to scots burr they reminded him the whole country was in the fight the matildas rattled forward walsh dug his foxhole deeper and wider and built up the earthwork in front of it he also looked around to decide where hed go if he had to get out in a hurry you didnt want to have to worry about that at the last minute he who hesitated then was lost a cannon barkedone of the germans mm antitank guns they were small and light enough to keep up with advancing troops a split second later the shell whanged off a matilda the british tanks machine gun never hesitated walsh grinned sure as hell matildas were tough old gals but then a bigger gun boomed this time the noise of the impact was whang blam that matilda brewed up so did another one a moment later hitlers boys had an mm antiaircraft gun in their thoroughness theyd also seen fit to stock it with armorpiercing ammunition walsh didnt think a tank in the world could keep out an mm shell puffin knew that report for what it was too bad luck theyve got an here he said too fucking right it is walsh agreed he wondered if the german monster had taken out the tank commander with the posh accent he hoped not for whatever that was worth another matilda went up in flames the rest of them started pulling back they couldnt even escape in a hurry whang blam another gout of flame another column of smokeanother pyre and here came the german infantry they loped forward in loose order diving for cover whenever somebody fired at them they shot back from their bellies they had machine guns their aircooled models were lighter and easier to lug along than most of the weapons the british used panzers the shout rang out from half a dozen throats at once the german machines were a hell of a lot faster than the poor matildas most of their commanders also drove standing up in the turret walsh drew a bead on one he pressed the trigger the rifle bucked against his shoulder the german threw up his hands then slumped over sideways it was a panzer iif the commander was wounded or dead the driver couldnt man the guns well he could but then he couldnt drive the machine turned around almost in its own length and got out of there others came on so did the foot soldiers they shepherded bullets thudded into the mud in front of walsh none got through all the same the neighborhood wasnt healthy any more walsh scrambled out of his hole and ran for the stone fence hed spotted not far away out in the open he felt worse than nakedhe felt like a snail with its shell pulled off bullets cracked past him and stitched the mud near his feet with a gasp not far from a wail he threw himself down behind the fence then he popped up and fired at the germans four men threw themselves flat because of one bullet they were out in the open too and knew how vulnerable they were walsh shot at one of them the man twisted grabbing his leg sorry pal walsh said most of the time you didnt see the enemy you hit here hed done it twice in a few minutes instead of making him proud it just made him hope the germans wouldnt do the same thing to him huddling in a slit trench with halffrozen mud on the bottom wasnt what hansulrich rudel had had in mind when the war started that didnt mean he wasnt doing it his squadrons latest airstrip lay a few kilometers west of oostende on the strait of dover you could damn near spit from belgium to england here and you could damn near spit from england to belgium the raf had come over every night since belgium threw in the towel night bombing wasnt very accurate but you didnt want to stay in your nice cozy sleeping bag when the bombs whistled down a couple of intrepid souls had tried it one of them was in the hospital the other dead fragments from a big one that hit much too close whined past overhead those miserable pigdogs hansulrich said around a yawn he was amazed at how little sleep he could get by with we ought to bomb them for a change keep them up all night how do you know we arent somebody else said there in the chilly darkness rudel couldnt tell who it was wed hear about it on the radio if we were he answered they wouldnt keep something like that quiettheyd brag about it er hat recht another luftwaffe man said the rest of the shivering germans must have thought hansulrich was right too because nobody contradicted him the reich boasted about what it did to its enemies and why not they deserved what they got for presuming to oppose it and here we really could do it hansulrich said musingly hed spent the war plastering positions on the continent that needed doing of course but if the english thought they could send bombers out from their island without getting any attention in return they had to be out of their minds another big bomb burst nearby the english were either good or lucky itll be a mess come morning someone said dolefully that proved all too true the runways were cratered one ju was a writeoff in spite of the revetments in which the bombers hid another had taken enough damage to keep it out of the air for a while a snorting steamroller and a pickandshovel crew started setting the strip to rights hansulrich fumed the day was bright and clearperfect flying weather no matter how cold it wasbut here he sat stuck on the ground damn the english anyway without the steamroller setting things straight would have taken even longer than it did three days went by before the strip was flyable again the british bombers came over by night twice more but their aim wasnt so good the airstrip came away unscathed when the fourth morning also promised good weather the squadron commander summoned his pilots and said wir fahren gegen england he paused for a moment then went on no im not throwing a song title at you we are going to go against england he eyed rudel maybe someone from the high command was in the trench with you a few nights ago because i got the order yesterday yes sir hansulrich said he hoped the tune from wir fahren gegen england wouldnt get stuck in his head it was catchy there are airfields near ramsgate major bleyle continued we are to hit them and the aircraft that use them the english need to learn they cant play these games with us and with our stukas we can put our bombs where they do the most good the pilots nodded a divebomber was ever so much more precise than some machine flying five kilometers up in the middle of the night on the other hand a bomber five kilometers up was almost impossible to find and even harder to shoot down once found a ju by contrast was a lowflying lumbering brute the only way to make it more visible would be to paint it bright red will we have escorts hansulrich asked ja bleyle said well have some s with us they should hold off the english fighters hansulrich nodded satisfied the messerschmitts had done the job on the continent why wouldnt they over england too an hour and a half later he was in the air sergeant dieselhorst sat in the rearfacing seat behind him if the s failed the sergeants machine gun could help keep the raf away as usual the s put hansulrich in mind of sharks they were made for one purpose and one only to go out and kill things their leader waggled his wings at the jus the messerschmitts formed up around the divebombers they droned on toward the english coast plainly visible through the stukas armorglass windshield a short flight less than half an hour even cruising rudel watched his instruments everything was green the maintenance men did a hell of a job his thoughts leaped ahead to what needed doing when he reached the target he could see ramsgate not far ahead the airstrips the stukas were supposed to hit lay a little west and south of the town the german air fleet would swing in that direction and and british fighters jumped them hurricanes with redwhiteandblue roundels mixed it up with the messerschmitts the luftwaffe had already seen that hurricanes were at least as good as anything the french flew were they as good as s if they werent they came unpleasantly close while some of them engaged the german fighters others bored in on the jus one divebomber after another fell out of the sky hoarse shouts of fear and alarm dinned in hansulrichs earphones so did the shrieks of the dying mother someone wailed im burning mother rudel switched frequencies in a hurry it didnt help much sergeant dieselhorst fired at something a couple of bullets had hit hansulrichs stuka but only a couple he feared that was nothing but luck he also feared the germans had made a mistake with this attack on the continent bombing targets close to their own lines they could generally count on an advantage in numbers damaged planes didnt have far to go to get back to friendly territory here the deep blue sea lay between the raiders and friends only it wasnt blue it was grayish green and looked cold drop your bombs anywhere the squadron commanders voice cut through the din on the radio drop them and get away this is too hot for us hansulrich wouldnt have argued with that he pulled the bombrelease lever ramsgate lay below if hundreds of kilos of explosives came down on civilians heads instead of on the airstrip for which they were intendedwell too bad wasnt it the rafs fault for interfering with the planned operation a british fighter flew right in front of him a biplane a gloster gladiator it looked outdated but the czech avias had proved even planes like that could be dangerous he fired at it the gladiator far more agile than his stuka spun away when the pilot saw his tracers even though rudel mashed the throttle against the instrument panel he knew he wasnt home freenowhere near a hurricane could still catch him from behind for that matter so could a gladiator the ju was built for muscle not for speed hed never felt the lack so much before anything on our tail albert he called through the speaking tube not right now thank god dieselhorst answered which also summed up the way hansulrich felt he looked around for more stukas and for messerschmitts of course they wouldnt go back in the neat formation theyd used to approach england theyd be all over the sky all the same he saw far fewer german planes than he should have when fighters came after them in swarms jus were alarmingly vulnerable the s had held their own against the hurricanes he was sure theyd more than held their own against the gladiators even that came with a price though if a hurricane fighter bailed out of a shotup fighter he landed among friends he could fly again as soon as he got another plane a messerschmitt pilot who bailed out over england was out of the war for good even if he came down unhurt there was the belgian coast ahead the raf seemed content to have broken things up on their own ground they werent pursuing hard hansulrich eased back on the throttle hed never dreamt he could be so proud of nothing more than making it home from a mission in one piece airraid sirens woke sarah goldman out of a sound sleep she needed a moment or more than a moment to realize what they were munster had tested them a few times before the war started and a few more afterwards but the luminous hands on the clock by her bed said it was two in the morning only a maniac would test the sirens at a time like this sarah didnt doubt that a lot of the nazis running munster were maniacs but they werent the kind of maniacs whod do something like this which meant ice ran through her when she realized what it meant this wasnt a drill this was a real air raid she threw off the covers which made her realize how cold it was inside the house throwing a robe over her flannel nightgown she ran for the stairs she bumped into somebody in the dark the grunt made her realize it was her brother where do we go saul what do we do find someplace low i guess he answered what else can we do were jews we cant go to any of the regular sheltersthey wont let us in somehow sarah had forgotten that she couldnt imagine why it wasnt as if regulations didnt spell it out the aryans in charge of things in the reich made no bones about how they felt if they saved their own kind and watched jews get blown to ground round they would go out and have a beer afterwards to celebrate sarah didnt think all the goyim in munster felt that way life would have been impossible in that case it wasnt nowit was just difficult as she hurried down the stairs she realized she might have to change her mind about that if a bomb hit them and they werent in a proper shelter life would be impossible come on saul said under the diningroom table will it hold up if the house comes down on it sarah asked doubtfully no but its the best chance weve got he said she decided he was right their mother and father crowded under there with them samuel and hanna goldman took the outside places when saul tried to protest his father spoke two harsh words shut up the gentle classical scholar never talked like that the frontline soldier of half a lifetime ago might have though and saul did shut up which would do for a miracle till a bigger one came along airplane engines droned overhead antiaircraft guns began to thunder will they shoot them down sarah said theyll try her father answered not a vote of confidence through the roar of the guns sarah heard other noiseshigh shrill swelling whistles the flat harsh crump s that followed made the guns seem whispers beside them the windows rattled the whole house shook is this what an earthquake feels like she wondered but how could she tell shed never been in an earthquake we need to put maskingtape squares on our windows samuel goldman said his voice eerily calm will that keep them from breaking hanna asked no but it will help keep them from spraying glass all over the inside of the house if something comes down close to usi hope he said after what might have been twenty minutes or twenty years the bombs stopped falling the airplane engines went away the guns kept banging for several minutes more shrapnel pattered down on the roof like hail at last silence fell well that wasnt too bad sarah said she was so glad to be alive so glad it was over she straightened up too fast and banged her head on the bottom of the table that was the only hurt any of the goldmans took it wasnt too good either her father said i dont remember any raids that bad in the last war neither do i her mother said a siren screamedthat was a fire engine heading somewhere the goldmans made their slow careful way to the front door and looked out munster was black as a tombexcept for two or three orange glows on the skyline one of them only a few blocks away by the sound the fire engine was going there it couldnt go very fast not unless it wanted to plow into something this is terrible sarah said the enemy never did anything like this before why would they start now saul nudged her the enemy is running germany he whispered so why did you try to join the wehrmacht then she whispered back he turned away without answering she knew what the answer was her brother and her father still wanted to be germans but the nazis wouldnt let them if her father heard the whispers he didnt show it lets go back to bed he said we might as well try anyhow we cant do anything else here except thank god we came through in one piece her mother said her father didnt answer hed always been less religious than her motherand even sarah wondered whether god had his eyes on the jews in germany these days she went upstairs doubting shed be able to fall asleep again but she did she came down to breakfast black bread and ersatz coffee that tasted like and probably was burnt barley her father was reading the newspaper air pirates slaughter innocent civilians the headline screamed the british claim its retaliation for something our planes did over there her father said dr goebbels says thats a bunch of filthy lies of course of course sarah echoed in both what they said and how they said it they sounded perfectly loyal a message got passed even so just for a moment samuel goldmans eyes glinted behind his spectacles then he raised the newspaper hiding his face sarah felt herself smiling she was still cold shed just discovered she was in danger of getting blasted off the face of the earth in spite of everything though she was happy she wondered why ludwig rothe swore as he guddled around deep in the bowels of his panzer iis engine hold that flashlight higher theo he said i cant see what the hell im doing here carburetor again sergeant hossbach asked moving the flashlight not quite enough no its the damn fuel pump im sure of it weve boiled the carb out so often we could boil coffee in it if rothe sounded disgusted it was only because he was damned engine still keeps missing im going to fix that pump or steal a new one somewhere or go back to the maybach works and bend a wrench on somebodys head sounds good to me sergeant fritz bittenfeld said after pausing to light a cigarette the driver went on why the devil cant they make an engine that does what its supposed to for gods sake part of the reason was overstrain the engine only put out horsepower that wasnt much when it was trying to haul nine tonnes around rothe was not inclined to feel charitable especially not right after he cut his hand on a sharp metal edge in the engine compartment why ill tell you why because theyre back there and safe thats why he snarled they dont have to worry about what happens when things go wrong we do hold that goddamn light higher theo sorry theo said and still didnt move the light enough he made a good radioman radio waves suited himthey were out there in the ether and you couldnt see them when it came to things more closely connected to planet earth he wasnt so great somehow ludwig got the fuel pump out anyway six or eight panzers had halted here somewhere near the border between belgium and france their crews worked on them aided by a couple of mechanics a few hundred meters away two batteries of s sent death and destruction across kilometers toward the british and french troops battling to slow the germans down as he tore the fuel pump apart he wished his panzer could carry a gun like the ones artillerymen used a gun like that and youd have yourself a land dreadnought the mm on the panzer ii was a doorknocker by comparison and not much of a doorknocker at that even panzer iiis carried only a mm pieceand they were still rare birds enemy panzers didnt have much more some of the french machines mounted mm guns but the french and the british didnt seem to know how to make a fist they used their panzers in penny packets individually their machines were at least a match for anything the reich made but if germany had swarms of panzers at the schwerpunkt and the enemy didnt the german drive would go forward and so matters had proved up till now would the low countries have fallen in less than a month otherwise foot soldiers came forward through the little motor park at first ludwig paid little attention then his eyes snapped from the legend on their cuff bands leibstandarte adolf hitler to the ss runes on their collar tabs here was something out of the ordinary hed heard that some ss men were going to the front alongside wehrmacht troops but hed never seen any before and wasnt the lah these fellows all of them big and fair carried submachine guns and looked either nervous or extremely alert they were almost out of artillery range of the enemy so rothe thought they were being sillytill he saw the middleaged man in their midst he kicked theo in the ankle achtung he hissed and stiffened to attention himself are you out of your mind the radioman saidnobody paid attention to paradeground formalities in the field achtung ludwig repeated he jerked his chin toward the gaggle of ss men and their charge hossbachs eyes followed that gesture at attention or not rothe almost burst out laughing at the way they nearly bugged out of theos head fritz was gaping too well hellwho wouldnt hitler came over to the panzer ii automatically ludwig saluted the other crewmen echoed the gesture a beat later the fuhrer returned the salutes is everything all right here he asked up close his voice was even more resonant even larger than life than it was over a microphone in a stadium or on the radio yyes sir ludwig managed just routine repairs well be at em again soon he felt dizzy half drunk talking to adolf hitler he would remember this day for the rest of his life even if he lived to having seen what happened to frontline fighters here and in czechoslovakia he knew how unlikely that was he knew but he didnt dwell on it he tried not to anyhow your fuel pump giving you trouble the fuhrer asked theos eyes bugged out all over again ludwig rothes did the same thing this time how the devil did you know that sir he blurted one of the big ss men guarding hitler growled like an angry rottweiler but the fuhrer only chuckled i get reports i read them i remember them he answered thats the most common failing on the panzer ii i have had a few things to say to the maybach people about it an improved model is now in production good very good ludwig wondered what had happened to the people responsible for the current piece of junk maybe he was better off not knowing we will use it to go on to victory hitler continued a lock of hair flopped down over his forehead he brushed it back with a gesture so automatic he must have used it thousands of times we will he insisted victory may be coming a little more slowly than some of the poison dwarfs back in berlin believe but it is no less sure on account of that several of the lah bodyguards growled this time wehrmacht men called the waffenss asphalt soldiers but ludwig wouldnt have wanted to mess with any of these guys im sure of it mein fuhrer he said not because that was the thing to say but because he really believed it maybe hitler sensed as much or maybe once the fuhrer got rolling he was no easier to stop than a river victory is sure he thundered as he might have on the radio and the mad mongrels and traitors who tried to stop the reich from gaining it have got what they deserved oh yes that they have his eyes blazed the only trouble was ludwig didnt know what he was talking about sir the sergeant said one of the leibstandarte men murmured warningly the fellow wore what would have been a majors shoulder straps if he were in the wehrmacht but the ss had its own weird set of ranks major or whatever the hell he was the fuhrer ignored him some of those pigdogsfancy aristocrats and even a few military men im sorry to saythought they could run the country better than i am doing it well the ones who are left alive are seeing how they like the arrangements at dachau mein fuhrer the ss officer said urgently ja jens ja hitler soundedindulgent he turned back to the panzer crew do not gossip about this bitte we have not said anything in the papers or on the radio we do not want the enemy to know there is even so much as a mustard seeds worth of dissension in the reich you are good fellowsi can see that im sure you wont blab of course not mein fuhrer ludwig said quickly fritz and theo also stammered out reassurances rothe had never imagined he would end up knowing a state secret by the way that officer was looking at him the waffenss man thought he would be better off dead thats what i thought hitler said he caught the officers eye again dont give them any troubleyou hear me they said theyd keep quiet and i expect they meant it unless youre sureand i mean surethey didnt leave them alone jawohl mein fuhrer the lah man said the look he gave rothe and the other panzer men shouted that he still wanted to dispose of them but he didnt look as if he had the nerve to go against hitlers direct order who in his right mind would all right hitler nodded to ludwig then to his driver and radioman i hope you stay safe my friends i know its warm work but it needs doing fight hard he nodded again then stumped away his retinue all around him der herr gott im himmel fritz whispered somebody pinch me i think im dreaming theo said also in a low voice that amounted to about the same thing hessomething ludwig heard the awe in his own voice he tried to imagine why anyone would move against the fuhrer true the war wasnt won yet but germany was still moving forward and a lot faster than she had the last time around what was wrong with that plainly the traitors had paid for their folly dachaurothes shiver had nothing to do with the weather if half what hed heard was true the plotters whod got killed outright might have been the lucky ones chapter luc harcourt was alive that was all he knew all he cared about hed seen more war than he ever wanted to meet hed smelled blood and pus and death and his own shit in his pants nobodyd ever ragged him about that he knew damn well he wasnt the only one this ruined barn was a good place to grab a cigarette what was left of the walls kept a german sniper from drawing a bead on him and punching his ticket he sucked in harsh smoke held it as long as he could and finally let it out again man he said and paused for another drag i never wanted a smoke this much when i was a civilian not even after a fuck sergeant demange had a cigarette between his lips too but then he always did not even then luc said then i like it yeah surebut of course but theres a difference between liking a smoke and really needing one you know what i mean when the bastards are trying to kill you a cigarettes all youve got well not quite demange shook his canteen so it sloshed what do you have in here pinard luc answered the cheap nasty red wine was nonregulation but it was also less likely than water from god knew where to give you the runs you couldnt very well get lit on a liter of pinard either how about you sergeant what do you have calvados demange said proudly thatll put hair on your balls by god boy will it ever luc said the apple brandy of northern france was liquid dynamite he hoped the sergeant would offer to share but demange didnt demange was for demange first last and always luc didnt resent it the way he might have from someone more hypocritical about it paul renouvin said calvados cest rien he didnt look like a college man any more he was as scrawny and filthy and ragged and unshaven as any of the other soldiers in the barn but he still knew how to get under demanges skin the sergeant jerked as if all of his lice had bitten him at once nothing is it asshole well what the devil have you got thats better whatever it is it better be good or ill whale the living shit out of you renouvin was ten centimeters taller and a good bit heavier luc would have bet on demange every time paul caressed his canteen as if it were a beautiful womans bare tit me ive got scotch he murmured why you lying prick demange said scotch my left one where would a noaccount cocksucker like you get scotch off a dead tommy officer renouvin answered calmly good stuff too tell me another one you think i was born yesterday you think i fell off the turnip truck the sergeant pointed to the canteen give me a taste of that right now too if it isnt scotch ill tear your ears off and shove em down your throat but what if it is renouvin asked rage made demange reckless if it isfat chanceyou can have all my applejack you heard him boys paul said luc and the other poilus nodded why not this was the best sport theyd had in a while luc forgot about the cold and the dirt and the fear he forgot about the battery of s banging away not far from the barn even if they were liable to bring german artillery down on everybodys head before too long he watched renouvin open the canteen and pour a little of the contents into the screwon cap with elaborate ceremony renouvin passed the cap to demange here you go sergeant salut if youre trying to get me to drink piss youll fucking diei promise you that demange said suspiciously he sniffed at the cap before he drank from it luc watched his face but those ratlike features gave nothing away like a man moving in a dream the sergeant sipped he didnt say anything for more than a minute he just sat there motionless even the perpetual cigarette in the corner of his mouth forgotten then without any particular rancor he said you son of a bitch he flipped the cap to renouvin who put it back on the canteen and demange handed him his own canteen here choke on it well all choke on itand then on the scotch hows that paul said he swigged from the calvados then passed it along luc thought that was mighty smartnot universitysmart maybe but soldiersmart for sure a man who had both scotch and applejack was a man who made his buddies jealous a man who shared them made friends for lifeor at least till one of the other guys got his hands on something nice two big knocks of good strong booze shelter from the winter weather a soldiers life could be simple sometimes a few tiny pleasures and everything seemed wonderful the next morning replacements came up to the front luc eyed them with mingled suspicion and contempt they were too pale too neat too plump they carried too much equipment their uniforms werent dirty and torn their noncoms hardly knew how to swear poor darlings someone jeered someone forgot to lock the nursery and look where they ended up a shell burst half a kilometer away some of the new fish flinched that made luc want to start laughing they have to come closer than that to hurt you he said dont worrythey will a lieutenant as young and unweathered as his troops pointed an angry finger at him where is your superior soldier he snapped i guess im himsir sergeant demange said the usual gitane bobbing in the corner of his mouth as he spoke what do you need he was grimy and unshaven he looked as if hed killed better men than that baby lieutenantand he had the officer had the rank but demange had the presence luc watched the lieutenants bravado leak out through the soles of his boots tell that man to be more respectful he managed but his voice lacked conviction sure demange said and then to luc be more respectful you hear sorry sergeant luc went along with the charade there you go sir demange said to the lieutenant you happy now plainly the lieutenant wasnt just as plainly being unhappy wouldnt do him one goddamn bit of good demanges attitude and graying stubble said hed fought in the first war while the lieutenant hadnt done much fighting in this one yet his tongue slid across the hairline mustache that darkened the skin just above his upper lip but he didnt say anything more he just kept on walking more german shells came in maybe the boches were probing for that battery of s whatever they were doing those rising screams in the air said this salvo was trouble hit the dirt luc yelled he was already flat by the time the words came out several other veterans shouted the same thingalso from their bellies bam he felt as if a squad of paris flics were beating on him with their nightsticks blast picked him up and slammed him back down again oof he saidhe came down on a rock that would bruise his belly and just missed knocking the wind out of him jagged fragments whined overhead several of them spanged off the barns stone wall one drew a bloody line across the back of lucs hand what he said then was worse than oof more shells landed a couple of hundred meters away and then more farther off still luc opened and closed his hands a couple of times all his fingers workedno tendons cut only a scratch as these things went it still hurt like blazes though cautiously he raised his head when he did he forgot about his own little wound one or two of the german shells had come down right bymaybe even amongthe raw troops they didnt know anything about flattening out you could scream at them but they needed a few seconds to get what you were saying and a few more to figure out what they should do all of which added up to a few fatal seconds too long some of the soldiers were still standing more were on the ground nowmen and pieces of men the air was thick with the stink of blood as it might have been after explosions in a slaughterhouse this wasnt quite that this was explosions that produced a slaughterhouse a soldier stared stupidly at the spouting stump of his arm not three meters from him the kid lieutenant stood there with his face white and twisted into a rictus of horror merde luc muttered he scrambled to his feet and ran over to the maimed kid a leather bootlace did duty for a tourniquet the spout became a tiny trickle and the soldier came out of shock and started to shriek luc dug the morphine syrette out of the fellows wound kit and jabbed him with it the drug hit hard and fast the soldiers eyes closed and he passed out luc thought he would live if he hadnt bled too much unlike most battlefield wounds the amputation was almost as neat as if a surgeon had done it the poor lieutenant still hadnt unfrozen some of his men were helping the veterans help their buddies but he stood rooted to the spot you all right sir luc heard the rough sympathy in his own voice this wasnt the first freezeup hed seen it was a bad one though he tried again louder this time you all right i the officer shook himself like a dog coming out of cold water then violently he crossed himself and then he bent over and was sick spitting and coughing he choked out i regret to say i am not all right at all well this is pretty bad luc held out his canteen here rinse your mouth get rid of the taste merci the lieutenant did as he handed the canteen back to luc he suddenly looked horrified and took off for the closest bushes at a dead run he just realize he shat himself sergeant demange asked dryly thats my guess luc said hes not the first he wont be the last either demange said ive done it in both wars christ knows you oui if the sergeant hadnt admitted it luc wouldnt have either but since he hadluc knew that was a big brotherhood sure as hell it probably included more than half the people whod ever come under machinegun or artillery fire more than half the people whod ever been up to the front in other words wars a bitch and a poxed bitch to boot demange agreed luc found himself nodding snow flew as near horizontally as made no difference the wind howled out of the north anastas mouradian looked out the window of the flimsy hut by the airstrip and shuddered i wish i were back in armenia he said in his accented russian we have civilized weather down there another officer swigged from a bottle of vodka and then set it down they werent going to fly todaywhy not drink shit this isnt so bad that was too much for sergei yaroslavsky the devils grandmother its not bozhemoi man where dyou come from strelkachunya the other man answered where the hell is that about a thousand kilometers north of irkutsk a thousand kilometersnorth of irkutsk sergei echoed then he said bozehmoi again irkutsk lay next to lake baikal in the heart of siberia go north from there and youd just get colder he hadnt imagined such a thing was possible which only went to show your imagination reached so far and no further he made as if to doff his fur cap all right pal if you come from there this isnt so badfor you but why would anybody want to go there in the first place mouradian asked that struck sergei as a damn good question too and the siberian flyerhis name was bogdan koroteyevhad an answer for it my people are trappers if youre going to do that you have to go where the animals live through the roaring wind sergei heard or thought he heard a low rumble in the distance is that guns he asked or bombs going off the siberian had put away enough vodka so he didnt much care damn poles are stubborn bastards he shoved the bottle across the rickety table want a slug sure sergei poured some liquid fire down his throat damn poles things in northeastern poland werent going as well as they might have the radio and the newspapers didnt say that but anyone with a gram of sense could read between the lines the red army kept attacking the same places over and over again every attack sounded like a victory if they were victories though why werent the glorious and peaceloving soldiers of the soviet union advancing instead of spinning their wheels not that wheels wanted to spin in weather like this supplies moved forward on sledgeswhen they moved forward at all bombers and fighters had long since traded conventional landing gear for ski undercarriages men wore skis or snowshoes whenever they went outside one of the flyers wound up a phonograph and put on a record it was debussy sergei relaxed nobody listened to chopin or mozart or beethoven any more nobody dared listening to music by a composer from a country at war with the ussr might be enough to make the nkvd question your loyalty who could say for sure why people disappeared who wanted to take a chance and find out but debussy a frenchman was safe enough more explosions these not so distant the windows in the hut rattled those are bombs mouradian said the weather somewhere off to the west is good enough to let airplanes get up fuck em koroteyev said theyre trying to rattle our cage thats all they cant find anything to hit so they drop things anywhere and hope theyll do some good fat chance he belched and lit a cigarette even when you can see it hitting what you aim at isnt easy sergei said turn on the radio somebody mouradian said its just about time for the news the flyer closest to the set clicked on the knob the dial lit up half a minute lateronce the tubes warmed upmusic started blaring out of the speaker it wasnt quite the top of the hour the march wasnt to sergeis taste but you could put up with anything for a couple of minutes here is the news the announcer said moo koroteyev added irreverently chuckles ran through the hut the announcers accent said he came from the middle reaches of the volga he turned a lot of a sounds into o s it really did make him sound as if he ought to be out in a field chewing his cud but what he had to say grabbed everybodys attention spreading their vicious campaign of terror ever more widely the reactionary polish junta under the thuggish leadership of marshal smiglyridz bombed both minsk and zhitomir yesterday casualties are reported heavy because neither city was prepared for such treachery and murder numbers of innocent schoolchildren are among the slain one of the pilots swore violently he spoke russian with a ukrainian accent so that some of his g s turned into h s sergei wondered if he was from zhitomir or had family there general secretary stalin has vowed vengeance against the evil polish regime the announcer went on our bombers have targeted warsaw for retaliation our bombers taking off from where sergei wondered he would have bet piles of rubles that nobody could fly from anywhere near minsk maybe things were better farther south down toward the ukraine he supposed they must have been or the poles couldnt have struck at it in this blizzard they must have been bombing by dead reckoningand damned lucky to bootto hit minsk at all then the man reading the news said observers in minsk report that some of the planes striking the capital of the byelorussian soviet socialist republic were german heinkels and dorniers and so we see that the hitlerites are indeed supporting their semifascist stooges in warsaw they too shall suffer the righteous wrath of the workers and people of the soviet union several flyers sitting around the table nodded sergei started to do the same thing then he caught himself how the devil could observers in minsk identify the bombers overhead minsk wasnt far from here it had to be as socked in as this miserable airstrip was sergei opened his mouth to say something about that before he could anastas mouradian caught his eye ever so slightlysergei didnt think any of the other flyers noticed ithis copilot shook his head the newsman continued giving more reports of the poles atrocities and then going on to talk about the war news from western europe sergei ended up keeping quiet mouradian was bound to be right if the authorities told lies and you pointed it out who would get in trouble the authorities or you asking the question was the same as answering it did the rest of the flyers see that the newsman was full of crap when he talked about minsk or didnt they even notice were they so used to believing everything they heard on the radio that they couldnt do anything else then something else occurred to sergei he grabbed the vodka bottle and took a good swig from it but not even vodka could drown the subversive thought if that newsman was lying about the weather in minsk what else was he lying about had the poles really bombed the city at all had the germans joined them how much of what he said about the war in the west was true was anything he said true anything at all how could you know how could you even begin to guess oh some things were bound to be true because what point would there be to lying about them but others had the top ranks of the soviet military really been as full of traitors and wreckers as the recent purges left people believing if they hadnt even with the fresh slug of vodka coursing through him on top of everything else hed drunk sergei recognized a dangerous thought when he tripped over one you couldnt say anything like that not unless you wanted to find out exactly what kind of weather siberia had or would they just shoot you if they realized you realized they didnt always tell the truth he wouldnt have been surprised what could be more dangerous to the people who ran things anastas watched him from across the table did the armenian know what he was thinking did mouradian think the same things too then sergei stopped worrying about himself because the russian newsman went on since german planes were used in the terror bombings of peaceful soviet cities justice demands that we also retaliate against the fascist hitlerite swine this being so red air force bombers have struck at the prussian city of konigsberg damage to the enemies of the people is reported to be extremely heavy they richly deserve the devastation visited upon them bozhemoi whispered somebody down the table from sergei it sounded too reverent to be conventional cursing nobody reprimanded the flyer thoughnot after that news no matter what sergei had been thinking he didnt doubt this for a moment the ussr wouldnt claim to have bombed germany if it hadnt really done it and if the ussr bombed germanyin that case the war against hitler had just gone from the back burner to the front maybe those were heinkels and dorniers up there inaccurately bombing the airstrip maybe germans in fieldgray would join poles in greenish brown although the poles like the soviets had the sense to wear white camouflage smocks in the wintertime maybe hitler and smiglyridz would show the world what the ussr already knew theyd been in bed with each other all along a different announcer exhorted his listeners to buy war bonds help make farmers and workers safe from the threat of fascism he boomed subscribe to the latest war bond program sergei already bought war bonds so did everyone else in the red air force and army and navy contributions came out of their pay before they ever set eyes on it losing the money didnt hurt nearly so much that way as it would have if sergeid had to dig into his own pockets as long as the nazis stay busy in the west well do fine against them koroteyev said several men nodded sergei was one of them then anastas mouradian said sure we willjust like we did in the last war silence slammed down around the table germany had been busy against france and england and belgium in everybody knew that and everybody also knew the kaisers armies had smashed the tsars again and again if not for one disaster after another on the front the revolution might never have started much less succeeded the siberian looked at anastas one of these days youll open your mouth so wide youll fall right in no doubt comrade mouradian replied if it can happen to the whole country why cant it happen to me that only brought more silence people stared at the armenian then quickly looked away they might have been gaping at a car wreck how much have you drunk sergei asked sometimes you could get out of trouble by blaming it all on the vodka hed done that himself a time or three his copilot gave the question his usual seriousif not soberconsideration either too much or not enough mouradian said at last and its not too much so he grabbed the vodka bottle raised it and tilted his head back sergei reached out and grabbed it away from him to each according to his needs he said and got rid of what was left with the air of a man performing a conjuring trick the siberian produced another bottle loud applause greeted it the drinking went on with any luck at all by this time tomorrow nobody would remember what one mouthy armenian was going on about some of the men in hideki fujitas squad were from hokkaido the northern island was notorious for winter weather that blew straight down from siberia fujita had been through some rotten winters himself before they shipped him off to the border between manchukuo and mongolia or he thought he had anyhow now he had to admit that what hed known about winter was about the same as what an elevenyearold knew about love the kid could imagine he understood what was what and a jackass could suppose it was a nightingale too that didnt make it sound like one when it opened its mouth though fujita wore a fur capthe earflaps at the moment down he wore a thick heavily lined furcollared greatcoat it was doublebreasted to make it harder for drafts to sneak in he had stout gray felt mittens and kneehigh felt boots with leather uppers he had on two pairs of wool socks and two pairs of long woolen underwear he was freezing his ass off just the same you had to go out on patrol freezing or not if you didnt the russians or the mongols would make you sorry the russians were used to cold weatherlike what hokkaido got this stuff blew down from siberia the mongols were used to it too and the mongols were as sneaky and as dangerous as so many poisonous snakes they could slither through openings where you didnt think there were any sergeant fujita looked at his watch if it hadnt frozen and quit moving he still had more than an hour out here before his relief came zakennayo he muttered that felt like forever at last though a superior private named suzuki found him out in the middle of the blowing snow suzuki wore as much winter gear as fujita and a white camouflage smock on top of it all he looked miserably cold just the same but cold or not he said the magic words i relieve you sergeant good fujita said the howling wind grabbed the world and tried to swirl it away whats going on back at the camp somebody from regimental headquarters is there suzuki said oh yeah automatic suspicion filled fujitas voice like any veteran noncom he distrusted any break with routine he had his reasons too what does the guy want are we going to have to try and attack the mongols and the russians again theyve got more tanks and better artillery than we do and they hold the high ground none of that would matter a sens worth if the powers that be in mukden or in tokyo decided to send the guys at the pointy end of the bayonet into action once more fujita knew it only too well and superior private suzuki only shrugged i cant tell you anything about that sergeant he answered the guy got there just when i was starting out here id better go find out then fujita said try to stay warm if you want to build up a wall of snow to keep the wind from blowing straight through you nobody will say boo maybe i will suzuki said its pretty bad is it ever fujita headed back toward the tents that housed his company halfway there he tried to get a cigarette going he soon gave it up as a bad job he had plenty of practice lighting up in a strong wind but this one defeated him getting under canvas did let him light a match he gratefully sucked in smoke then he said suzuki was going on that somebody from regimental hq showed up here thats right sergeant san one of the privates in the tent said people say were pulling out of here what the company fujita asked i wont be sorryill say that weve been bumping noses with the mongols and the russians too damn long not just the companythe whole regiment maybe everybody on this whole front the private answered thats what people are saying anyhow the disclaimer let him off the hook in case the rumors he dished out proved nothing but a bunch of moonshine the regiment the whole front that was so much more than sergeant fujita had expected he needed a minute to take it all in if we leave where do we go next back to japan if youre going to wish wish for the moon he thought im very sorry sergeant san but i dont know the privatenakayama his name wassounded not only sorry but apprehensive privates got knocked around when sergeants wanted to know things and they didnt have the answers handy had fujita been in a bad mood he might have hit nakayama a couple of times to make himself feel better but the sheer scope of what was going on left him more awed than angry and walloping a private because of rumors wasnt exactly fairwhich wouldnt have stopped fujita if he really felt like doing it im sure the captain will tell me in the morning he said yes sergeant san of course he will nakayama said quickly he and the other privates in the tent let out almost identical sighs of relief sergeant fujita affected not to notice them hed been a private himself once upon a time he remembered what looking up at a sergeantogre was like discipline would suffer if this bunch of conscripts realized that though in the gloom none of them could see him smile sure enough captain hasegawa summoned fujita and the companys other senior noncoms first thing in the morning without preamble the company commander said we are leaving the mongolian frontier region and redeploying to eastern manchukuo where will the redeployment take us sir sergeant fujita asked if it was to mukdenthe capitalor harbin or some other big city that wasnt so bad it was a lot better than staying stuck on the edge of mongolia and what isnt fujita thought unfortunately that had an answer if the regiment got shipped up to the amur frontier with russia it just traded one miserable spot for another im afraid i dont know the answer to that the company commander said no one has told me not yet even if i did know i wouldnt tell you till we were well away from the border the same reason applies in both cases security we dont want to take the chance that the mongols or the russians would seize you and squeeze you no matter how honorable you wanted to be you might not manage to kill yourself in time i understand sir please excuse my stupidity fujita bowed his head in embarrassment not far from shame captain hasegawa didnt come down on him as hard as he expected its all right sergeant the officer said the courier who brought me the news also had to explain the facts of life to me you might say make sure you have your men ready to move out when i give the word thats all yes sir i will sir thank you sir fujita bowed again this time gratefully the company commander hadnt made him lose facehad in fact gone out of his way to let fujita keep it you had to repay that kind of consideration with loyalty the order to abandon the position theyd defended for so long came that afternoon retreat often meant a loss of face too not for fujita not this time he was only obeying the orders he got from his superiors but wouldnt japan itself be embarrassed if it abandoned land to which it had asserted a claim theyll probably say it was manchukuos claim not ours superior private hayashi predicted as the company marched through the drifted snow toward regimental headquarters that way we arent responsible for it makes sense fujita said having an educated man in the squad came in handy now and then of course without japan there would have been no such country as manchukuo but that didnt have much to do with anything blaming the hapless chinese and manchus was much easier than blaming the mother country and if the emperor of manchukuo didnt like it too bad trucks waited at the headquarters seeing them made sergeant fujita realize how serious japan was about getting its men away from this stretch of the border japan wasnt a motorized country like germany or the united states it had to save its vehicles for really important things if getting out of western manchuria was this important away rumbled the trucks north and a little east hailar fujita said even before his own machine set out weve got to be going to hailar that miserable mongolian town was one of the two railheads closest to the disputed areas the other arshaan lay to the southeast maps showed roads across this endless steppe they were at best dirt tracks at this time of year with snow deep on the ground whether you were on the road was often a matter of opinion the truck carrying fujita and his squad rumbled past another one that had overturned maybe the driver had tried to corner too fast maybe hed run into a ditch he would end up in trouble any which way much the biggest and most modern building in hailar was the railway depot a few natives in sheepskin coats stared at the trucks that could go almost anywhere far faster than any horse ever foaled what did they think watching the modern world roll through their ancient town actually what they thought hardly mattered the modern world was here whether they liked it or not a train that would go east stopped at the depotstopped a little past it in fact because snow and ice on the rails meant the brakes didnt grab as well as they would have most of the time some soldiers were already aboard and had come this far west before starting east again fujitas unit left the cars packed as tight as tinned fishthe only way the army seemed to know how to travel well the sergeant thought we wont be cold any more each car had its own stove and so many men stuffed the cars the stoves might prove afterthoughts body heat would be plenty to keep everybody warm slowly the train started to roll again fujita still didnt know where he was going he shruggedbeing a sergeant he had room to do that what difference did it make hed get there whether he knew or not then hed dowhatever needed doing chapter eleven chaim weinberg shivered in a trench the war on the ebro seemed to have frozen solid the whole spanish civil war seemed to have frozen solid the soviet union wasnt sending aid to the republic any morestalin was using the planes and tanks and guns himself after the broader war broke out a surge of aid had come from france and england whod ignored the republican cause before now with the low countries conquered and france herself invaded they were ignoring it again the only good news was hitler and mussolini were also ignoring general sanjurjos spanish fascists with the royal navy and the french actually paying attention to the mediterranean the reactionaries would have had a devil of a time getting anything through anyway and so both sides were running on momentum usingand using upwhat theyd had before the great powers forgot about them before long one side or the other would run out the side that still had something would winunless seeing their proxies in trouble prodded rich sponsors into action again meanwhilemeanwhile weinberg lit a cigarette it was a gitane part of the bounty that had flowed in from france it was a damn sight better than native spanish smokes which tasted of straw and lots of other things besides tobacco chaim still longed for an american cigarette with a lucky or a chesterfield you didnt feel as if youd swallowed a welders torch every time you inhaled he smoked the gitane down to a tiny butt then stuck that in a leather pouch he wore on his belt next to his wound dressing hed got used to saving dogends when tobacco was even scarcer than it was now wrap half a dozen of them and you had yourself another cigarette he would never have stooped so low in the states but things were different here nobodyd been trying to kill him in the states for instance hed made a crude periscope two handsized chunks from a broken mirror mounted on opposite ends of a stick seven years of bad luck getting shot was bad luck he hadnt broken this mirror himself but he would have without even blinking if hed needed to he stuck it up over the lip of the trench to see what the enemy was up to smoke rose here and there from the fascists trenches nobody was shelling them the artillery on both sides stayed quiet but cold struck impartially there were fires in the international brigades position too a khakiclad fascist soldier came head and shoulders out of his hole for a moment he wasnt a sniperhe was dumping a honey bucket one good thing about the cold no flies right now the spaniard ducked down again before a republican sharpshooter could fire at him chaim didnt think it was sporting to shoot a man who was easing himself or getting rid of slops but bastards on both sides had rifles with telescopic sights they thought they werent earning their pay if they didnt use them and so every now and then men got shot at their most defenseless not far away mike carroll was cleaning his rifle the french had used lebels by the million in the last war theyd been oldfashioned then and they were obsolete nowwhich didnt mean you still couldnt kill people with them how many different kinds of rifles how many different kinds of ammunition did the republicans use too goddamn manychaim knew that carroll paused spot anything interesting he asked sure weinberg answered naked blond broad taking a sunbath out in front of the fascist line big tits pretty facewhat more could you want natural blonde too either that or she peroxides her bush the other american started to put down the rifle and grab for the periscope just too late he caught himself fuck you you lying asshole he said you had me going yeah well shes a hell of a lot better than whats really there weinberg told him about the guy with the bucket whole wars full of shit carroll said sanjurjos guys youeverything and nobody gives a shit about us you just notice chaim lit another gitane mike carroll looked like a puppy hoping for table scraps chaim handed him the pack he took one with a nod of thanks and lit it with a zippo he fueled the lighter with keroseneregular lighter fluid was impossible to come by on either side of the line here maybe we ought to go up to france carroll said moodily more fascistsworse fasciststo kill there good luck chaim said mike winced he had about as much chance of getting up to france without authorization as he did of sprouting wings and flying there political officers behind the international brigades lines checked everybodys papers if you didnt have orders to pull you out you were in trouble even if you got past the commissars plenty of other republican officials in towns and on trains would want to know where you were going and who said you were supposed to go there if they didnt like your answers they would either shoot you or chuck you into a spanish jail not many things were worse than frontline combat but a spanish jail was one of them all of a sudden the states dont look so bad you know mike said with a grin that was supposed to mean he was half kidding anyway maybe theyll let you repatriate chaim said sometimes the internationals wanted nothing but willing fighters sometimes they figured you had to be willing or you wouldnt have volunteered it all depended on the officer on how the fighting was goingsometimes people said on the phases of the moon ah fuck it mike said the usual comment of every line soldier in every war since the beginning of time im just blowing off steam you know what i mean sure chaim said and he did too it wasnt as if hed never pissed and moaned since he got here all i wish is people would remember us we were a big deal till the rest of europe blew up who gives a shit about spain now stalins forgotten all about it that was a dangerous thing to say the international brigades toed moscows line but a love of truth was part of what had led chaim to spain he wouldnt give it up even here mike carroll had a tobacco pouch on his belt too he stuck the remains of the gitane into it well so has hitler he answered thats not so bad you know who remembers chaim said he waited till carroll raised a questioning eyebrow us and the spaniards thats who its not just fucking politics and games and shit for us it really matters do you want that fat prick over therechaim pointed toward the fascists linesrunning this whole goddamn country hed never talked that way in new york city back home hed always had the feeling his mother was listening and would wash his mouth out with soap but everybody swore on the battlefield by now chaim could cuss in english yiddish spanish catalan german french and russian talk without swear words seemed as bland as food without salt and pepper if i wanted that id be over there myself mike carroll said the italians and germans who fought on sanjurjos side had no choice but for them only a handful of foreignersmostly english and irishmenhad joined the enemy men from all over the world opposed the fascists if that didnt say something before chaim could decide what would be true if that didnt say something a rifle bullet cracked between him and carroll both of them hit the dirt weve been standing up and waving our arms too damn much mike said ruefully they got a sniper to take a shot at us yeah chaim hadnt quite pissed himself but hed come mighty close well so had the bullet good thing hes a shitty sniper a good marksman would have hit one of them maybe this guy couldnt decide which one to aim at spaniards mike carrolls shrug punctuated thatbut didnt expose him to any more rifle fire theyre brave as all getoutthe guys on both sides but his voice trailed away chaim knew what he was talking about yeah but he said making the word sound like a complete sentence it might as well have been spaniards didnt keep proper lookout they didnt like digging trenches they didnt bother cleaning their weapons unless somebody screamed at themand a lot of the time not then either their logistics were a joke food and ammunition came to the front when they felt like it that was how things looked anyhow their hospitals were almost as bad as their jails but they were brave point them at an objective and theyd take it or die trying tell them they had to hold a strongpoint and it wasno pasaran you were embarrassed to falter or fall back because you knew they wouldnt if only they would pull themselves together dont hold your breath mike said when chaim suggested that then the other american asked do you think we can nail that sniper there was a serious suggestion worth a try chaim said hell make this whole stretch of trench dangerous unless we do get rid of him how do you want to work it we ought to call a sharpshooter of our own carroll said chaim gave him the horse laugh republican snipers were few far between and none too good the other americans ears turned red okay okay which of us do you think is a better shot i am chaim answered without false modesty let me find a position where i can look out without getting drilled then you hold up a cap on a stick and ill see what i can see ill do it wave when youre ready mike said yeah chaim worked his way fifty yards down the trench some bushesbrown and leafless in the winter coldoffered cover there cautiously he peered out through them nobody fired at him he brought his rifle up over the top and rested it on the dirt then carefully keeping his hand below the level of the parapet he signaled to his buddy up went the cap a shot rang out mike not only jerked the cap down but also let out a scream chaim saw where the sniper fired from but the fascist ducked away before he could plug him nowwas the maricon dumb enough to shoot from the same position twice in a row everybody knew you shouldnt but some boys did anyhow only one way to find out move a little and pop up again chaim called as softly as he could mike did he even put the cap on the stick sideways this time so it would look different chaim peered down his rifle barrel he had the range he had windage he had a target yeah the guy on the other side was greedy and stupid all right he showed one shoulder and his head and that was all chaim needed he pressed the trigger not too hard red mist exploded from the enemy sniper as he slumped back into his trench you get him carroll asked uhhuh dont have to worry about that for a while anyway chaim might have been talking about delousing or killing a rat hed got rid of a nuisancethat was all well now the nuisance wouldnt get rid of him nothing else counted he lit another gitane it was a fine bright morning in western belgiumcolder than an outhouse in east prussia in february but sunny and clear the sun came up a little earlier than it had a month earlier at the end of december chances were spring would get here eventually no time real soon but eventually breath smoking in the chilly sunrise air hansulrich rudel walked to the squadron commanders hut to see what was up something would be he was sure of that this time of year days with decent flying weather were too few and far between to waste other stuka pilots nodded to him he nodded back he didnt have a lot of buddies here not likely a milk drinker would not when most of the flyers preferred brandy and loose women but he kept going out and doing his job and coming back that won him respect if no great liking cigarette smoke blued the air inside the hut hansulrich didnt like that either but complaining was hopeless he tried not to breathe deeply were going to bomb england again major bleyle announced that got everyones attention as he must have known it would he went on theyve been hitting our citiesmiserable air pirates what can we do but pay them back we will strike at dover and folkestone and canterbury just on the other side of the channel questions hands flew up rudels among them the squadron commander pointed to somebody elsehe didnt much like hansulrich either but the other pilot said about what rudel would have how are we going to come back in one piece stukas are sitting ducks for english fighters well have an escort bleyle said we had an escort the last time too the pilot pointed out some of the enemy planes kept the s busy and the rest came after us well have a better escort this time the squadron commander answered not just s but s too the pilots all paused thoughtfully bfs were brand new if half what people said was so they were formidable no doubt about it the big twoengined fighters mounted two mm cannon and four machine guns in the nose plus another rearfacing machine gun on a mount like the one in the stuka if all that firepower hit an enemy aircraft the poor devil would go down and therell be heinkels and dorniers overhead major bleyle added the enemy wont be able to concentrate on us the way he did before were going to knock eastern england flat lets see how they like it one by one the stuka pilots nodded most of them had seen enough to know war wasnt always as easy as they wished it would be theyd signed up to take whatever happened the bad along with the good hansulrich suspected things would turn out to be harder than the squadron co made them sound by the thoughtful looks on the other mens faces so did they but if the people set over you told you to try what else could you do he took the word to sergeant dieselhorst the gunner and radioman shrugged oh well he said maybe shell have engine trouble we can hope anyway it wont be that bad rudel said no i suppose notsir dieselhorst spoiled it by adding itll be worse the stuka had no engine trouble some groundcrew mans head would have rolled if it did the mechanics and armorers gassed it up and bombed it up it roared down the runway and lumbered into the air with the others bfs and s took station around the divebombers the s zerstorers they called them destroyerscertainly looked formidable with all that firepower in the nose they packed a mean punch idly hansulrich wondered how maneuverable they were he laughed his own ju dodged like a rock there was the north sea there ahead lay england the popular song dinned in his head he was going up against england if the enemy bombed the reich the luftwaffe would repay blood with blood murder with murder he saw shipsboatswhatever they wereon the sea did they belong to the kriegsmarine or the royal navy were they radioing a warning to the english mainland now was that how the raf had been so quick to attack the stukas the last time they raided southeastern england rudel shrugged not his worry though he did think hed mention it if he happened to remember after he got back to belgium if i get back to belgium he did his best to stifle that thought you didnt want to go into battle with your head full of doubts and worries he was no more eager to go into this battle than any of his squadron mates the ju was terrific when it enjoyed air superiority when it didnt several s seemed to leap out ahead of the pack following their path with his eyes hansulrich spied another plane out ahead of the oncoming german air armada tracers from the messerschmitts blazed toward the stranger which dove and spun down toward the ocean it wasnt a fighter they charged after it and sent it smoking into the water someone in the squadron voiced on the radio what hansulrich was thinking nowdid he get word out before we shot him down well find out somebody else said in sepulchral tones and they did english fighter planes rose to meet them biplane gladiators monoplane hurricanes and a handful of new sleek spitfires the raf fighters bored in on the luftwaffe bombers they wanted no more to do with the escorts than they had to the s and s couldnt hurt their country bombers could what was going on higher in the sky where the heinkels and dorniers had escorts of their own rudel couldnt check he was too busy trying to stay alive even a gladiator could be dangerous sergeant dieselhorst fired a burst get anything hansulrich asked nah the rear gunner answered hell bother somebody else though that suited the pilot fine cannon fire from a nearby me knocked down a hurricane a moment later another hurricane bored in on the twoengined german fighter that combat didnt last long the hurricane easily outturned the got on its tail shot it up and shot it down hansulrich saw he was over some kind of city he thought it was dover but it might have been folkestone or any other english port it lay by the seahe could tell that much and he could tell it was time to unload the frightfulness hed brought across the ocean he yanked the bombrelease lever the stuka suddenly felt lighter and nimbler now we get the devil out of here dieselhorsts voice came brassy through the speaking tube now we get out of here hansulrich agreed no point in lingering the stuka sure wasnt agile enough to dogfight against a british fighter a broadwinged he afire from the nose back plunged into the north sea just off the coast from the town that was probably dover an enormous cloud of steam and smoke rose a couple of thousand kilos worth of bombs going off when the spade hit hansulrich hadnt seen any parachutes four men dead then you know what happens next dont you dieselhorst said whats that rudel asked he looked every which way he didnt see any indians which was what luftwaffe pilots called enemy planes that let him ease back on the throttle a little the continent loomed ahead hed probably make it to the airstrip they come over tonight or tomorrow night and bomb the crap out of some of our towns dieselhorst said where does it end with our last two guys coming out of the ruins and going after their last guy with a club thats not for us to worry about thats for the fuhrer but hansulrich couldnt leave it there as long as weve got two guys and theyve got one as long as our two get their one we win and were going to right oh yes sir the gunner answered nobody could or wanted to imagine germany losing two wars in a row losing one had been bad enough but when hansulrich put down at the belgian airstrip he waited and waited hoping against hope that more stukas would come home safe a few had returned before him a few more straggled in afterwards but so many were lost over england or the north seathe squadron would need a new co among other reinforcements hansulrich hoped the reich would have two men with clubs coming out of the ruins not just one every night the panzers in sergeant ludwig rothes platoon reassembledor they tried to anyhow by now rothes crew was the most experienced one left in the platoon neither he nor his driver nor his radioman had got badly hurt given how thinskinned panzer iis were that was something close to miraculous rothe had commanded the platoon on and off on the drive across the low countries and into france lieutenants and their panzers were no more invulnerable to flying shells than anybody else but the platoon had an officer in charge of it again a second lieutenant named maximilian priller he was dark and curlyhaired he had a whippedcreaminyourcoffee strudelontheside viennese accent before the anschluss hed served in the austrian army like a lot of german soldiers rothe looked down his nose at austrians as fighting men he had nothing bad to say about lieutenant priller though no matter how priller talked he knew what to do with panzers our next stop is coucylechateau priller pointed the place out on a map he unfolded on his knees his german sounded funny in ludwigs ears but he spoke fluent french well not our next stopwhere we go through next its only about five kilometers ahead we ought to drive the enemy out by the middle of the morning questions anybody do we soften them up with artillery first or do we break through with the panzers another sergeant asked with the panzers that way weve got surprise working for us priller cocked an eyebrow we see who gets the surpriseus or them the four sergeants who commanded the other panzers in the platoon all chuckled ludwig among them it was laugh or scream one maybe the french troops in front of the germans would panic and flee on the other hand maybe theyd be waiting with panzers of their own minefields antitank guns all the things that made life in the panzer force sointeresting weve bent them back a long way max priller said if we break through here we drive the sword into their heart we want them all disordered then we can race them to paris better than even money we win paris ludwig and a couple of the other sergeants said together back in the middle ages knights went on quests for the holy grail in the twentieth century paris was the holy grail for germany the kaisers army had come so close armchair generals kept talking about von klucks turn if he hadnt made it or if the russians hadnt caused so much trouble off in the east russia was making trouble again the wehrmacht had done well here or ludwig thought it had in a month it had knocked holland belgium and luxembourg out of the fight the radio said german bombers were giving england hell to pay back the british terror raids on german cities maybe this attack would have gone smoother in better weather only god could know something like that though tell your men priller said we go at it would still be dark somebodyd get a surprise all right well what could you do rothe went back to his panzer fritz was toasting some bacon hed liberated from a farmhouse theo was swapping tubes in and out of the radio trying to figure out which one was bad fritz looked up from the little cookfire its going to be bad he said i can see it on your face how bad is it we hit the town up ahead at ludwig answered bluntly theo paused with a tube in each hand he looked down at them muttering rothe guessed he was remembering which one hed just pulled and which was about to go in fritz stared up from the sizzling slab of bacon fuck he said i know ludwig said what can you do though he pointed to the bacon is that done let me have some if it is off in the distance some guns opened up french s ludwig thought recognizing the reports the damned things dated back to before the turn of the century theyd been the great workhorses of the french artillery during the last war ludwigs father swore whenever he talked about them they could fire obscenely fast this time around german s outranged them that did you no good if you ended up on the wrong end of things though these shells came down a good distance away fritz cut the bacon into three pieces well maybe well surprise them he said they dont seem to know where were athere you go sergeant danke ludwig blew on his share then took a bite it tasted about the same as bacon would have back home he might have had it boiled there but he might not too he gulped yeah maybe we will he said and bit into the bacon again theo stared at the orange glow inside the tube hed just swapped in that does it he said now well be able to hear all the stupid orders well get from the shitheads back of the linesand from lieutenant priller too his faith in those set over him had well limits ludwig suspected theo didnt have much use for him either he also suspectedno he was surehe wouldnt lose any sleep about it the french s quieted down had somebody given them a target or were they shooting at some jumpy officers imagination ludwig laughed he had no use for french higherups why did he think the men who ran the wehrmacht had a better handle on what they were doing because were in france and the damned frenchmen arent in germany he answered himself and maybe that meant something and maybe it didnt theyd all find out some time not long after he slept by the panzer ii so did the driver and the radioman if shelling came close they could dive under the panzer the treads and the armored body would keep out anything this side of a direct hit lieutenant priller came along at half past four to make sure they were alert and ready to go we can do it he said were going to do it too have we got any coffee ludwig asked plaintively and damned if they didnt it wasnt the ersatz that came with army rations mixed with burnt barley and chicory it came from the real bean no doubt taken from the french it was dark and mean and strong ludwig dumped sugar into it so he could choke it down sure as hell it pried his eyelids open as they had in the runup to the strike against czechoslovakia engineers had set out white tapes here to guide the panzers forward without showing a light rothe cupped a hand behind his ear trying to hear if the french up ahead had any idea they were coming he couldnt tell fritz had the engine throttled back but its low rumble still drowned out the little sounds he was looking for nobody was shooting at the germans as they moved up to the start line anyhow ludwig glanced down at the radiumglowing dial on his watch a couple of hours later he checked again he laughed at himself time stretched like a rubber band when you were waiting for the balloon to go up when it did go up it went all at once one second quiet above the engine noise the next german artillery crashed behind the panzers german machine guns stuttered to life spitting fire to either side lets go rothe yelled through the din the engine grew deeper and louder it had to work like a bastard to shove all that armored weight around a couple of french hotchkiss machine guns returned fire but not for long the panzers and assault teams with submachine guns and grenades silenced them standing head and shoulders out of the turret ludwig whooped the last thing he wanted was tracers probing toward him the germans had jumped off just before earliest dawn as day broke the french landscape seemed to stretch out ever farther before them rothe fired a few machinegun bursts at soldiers in khaki if they were here they were bound to be enemies he was at the spearpoint of the fieldgray forces pressing down from the northeast bam a french antitank gun belched flame the mm round missed the panzer ii a good thinga hit would have turned it into blazing scrap metal rothe almost shit himself even so more to the point he traversed the turret and fired several short bursts at the gun seeing bullets spark off its steel shielding he gave it a few rounds from the mm cannon those got through french artillerymen tumbled like ninepins there you go fritz shouted theo tending to his radio in the bowels of the panzer ii couldnt see a damned thing but one stubborn frenchman fired the gun again the mm shot snarled past a few meters over ludwigs head he shot back with the panzers main armament and he gave an order you didnt hear every day in armored warfare charge run that gun down jawohl fritz said the panzer iis engine snarled the stubborn french soldier was still alive behind the riddled shield trying to serve the gun by himself seeing the panzer bearing down on him he finally turned and fled ludwig shot him in the back with the machine gun a guy like that was too dangerous to leave alive crunch the panzer clattered over the antitank gun for a nasty moment ludwig feared the panzer would flip over but it didnt when he looked back over his shoulder he saw the new kink in the guns barrel nobody would use that one against the reich any more which was the point here and there infantrymen with rifles fired at the panzers trying to pick off their commanders every once in a while they managed to do it too but the panzers had a whole slew of advantages they were on the move their commanders could duck behind armor and they carried a machine gun and a light cannon against a boltaction rifle staying on the move was the biggest edge even if you didnt take out an infantryman you left him behind in a matter of seconds sooner or later your own foot soldiers could deal with him in the meanwhile the panzers charged ahead flowing around enemy hell in the rear but coucylechateau was too big and too strong to go around some of the soldiers ludwig shot at in the outskirts wore lighter khaki and steel derbies in place of darker uniforms and domed helms with vestigial crests englishmen they didnt like machinegun bursts any better than the french or ludwig come to that a machine gun chattered from the middle of an apple orchard the gun moved ludwig realized it was mounted on some sort of tank he gulped wondering if the enemy machines cannon was taking dead aim at his panzer not nearly enough steel separated him from the slings and arrows of outrageous gunners but he realized little by little that the other panzer didnt carry a cannon all it had was that machine gunit might as well have been a german panzer i it waddled out of the apple grove it didnt seem able to do anything but waddlea man running fast would have had no trouble outdistancing it he fired three quick rounds from the mm gun two of them hit the turret but they didnt come close to punching through the matilda might be slow it might have a laughable armamenteven a panzer i sported a pair of machine guns not a singleton but it was damned hard to wreck it was if you tried to kill the crew anyway if you crippled it thoughludwig fired the mm at the matildas tracks and road wheels before long the ungainly thing slewed sideways and stopped ludwigs panzer clanked past it now it was nothing but a wellarmored machinegun position the infantry could deal with that medievallooking ramparts surrounded coucylechateau the hilltop chateau that gave the town its name had had chunks bitten out of it probably in the last war mortar bombs from the chateau started falling among the german panzers half wrecked or not the place had poilus or tommies in it theo ludwig said let the artillery know theyre firing from the ruin right the radioman answered which might have meant anything heor somebodymust have done it because s started knocking more pieces off the chateau then a flight of stukas screamed down on it their bombs did what guns could only dream about the enemy mortars fell silent more stukas worked over coucylechateau one of them got shot down and crashed into the town turning itself into a bomb the rest roared away the onslaught stunned the defenders with narrow winding streets coucylechateau might have been a nasty place to try to take but some of the garrison fled west and south while the rest couldnt surrender fast enough breakthrough ludwig didnt know but he had hopes chapter twelve january the north atlantic a uboat the combination was not made in heaven as lieutenant julius lemp knew only too well oh he could take the u down below periscope depth and shed escape the fearsome waves topside the only trouble was down below periscope depth shed be about as useful to the war effort as if she were a fiveyearolds toy in a berlin bathtub a fiveyearold splashing around couldnt whip up a worse storm in that tiny tub than god was kicking up out here on the broad ocean one tenmeter wave after another rolled down on the u because she was so much smaller and had so much less freeboard than a surface warship it was like taking one soggy right to the chin after another lemp tied himself to the rail atop the conning tower so an extrabig wave wouldnt sweep him out to sea he wore oilskins of course he knew hed get soaked anyhow this way it would take a little longer though he wondered why hed bothered bringing the binoculars with him so much spray and stray water splashed the lenses he might as well have peered through a couple of full beer steins you had to try all the same why else did they send you out in filthy weather like this another wave smashed over the bow it splashed past the mm deck gun and crashed into the conning tower lemp got himself a faceful of ocean fuck he said spitting salt water he would have made a bigger fuss had it been the first time or even the fifth he looked at the binoculars they were good and wet now ironically that might make them easier to look through than when theyd just been spraysplashed he raised them to his eyes and swept the horizon with a hunters intent patience he or one of the other watchstanders did this as long as there was enough daylight to see by at night he did take the boat down twentyfive or thirty meters so the men could cook a little and could rest without getting pitched out of their cramped bunks and hammocks something glided past him on the wind a petrel on the prowl for fish not ships stormy weather didnt bother the bird lemp wished he could say the same the uboats bow sank down into a trough that meant the following wave would be worse than usual and it was if not for the fasteningand for his holding on to the rail for dear lifeit would have swept him into the atlantic would he have drowned before he froze that was the only question there he wanted to ride on top of a crest not get buried by one eventually the u did that gave him those extra ten meters from which to look around he didnt expect to see anything but the scudding gray clouds that had kept him company ever since leaving germany his watch would be up pretty soon then he could descend into the uboats crowded stinking pressure hull dry off and change into his other slightly less soaked uniform when you didnt expect to see something you probably wouldnt even if it was there lemp almost missed the smoke trail to the northwest his hands were smarter than his head they snapped back of themselves and gave him another look at it without even noticing hed done it he stopped shivering he stopped caring he was wet clean through he pulled out the plug on the speaking tube that let him talk to the helmsman and the engine room change course to he ordered all ahead full hollow and brassy the answer came back changing course to skipper you found something i sure did lemp said as the diesels building throb told him their crew had got the command too now we have to see what it is and whether we can run it down he thought they had a decent chance not many freighters could match the us surface speed and he could get mighty close before the ship spotted his exhaust diesel fuel burned much cleaner than heavy oil to say nothing of coal the uboats low sharkish silhouette shouldnt be easy to pick up either the other side of the coin was he couldnt make seventeen knots in seas like this now that the u had turned away from taking the swells bowon she got slapped in the port side instead british corvettesuboat hunterswere said to roll on wet grass the u was doing the same thing as long as she straightened up every time lemp couldnt complain his stomach could and did he was a good sailor but he seldom faced a challenge like this he gulped hoping lunch would stay down if he was going to sink that ship he had to get ahead of her before submerging to wait for her to reach him where he lay in wait a uboats greatest weakness was that it was slower submerged than its quarry was on the surface he ordered another course change swinging closer to due north the ship was making a very respectable turn of speed in turn that argued she was big and important a ship england particularly wouldnt want to see lost when the uboat rose to the crest of another wave lemp got a good look at the enemy vessel he whistled softly though he couldnt even hear himself through the howling wind she had to be tons if she was a gram a qship he muttered under his breath in the last war england had put disguised guns on several merchantmen they looked like ordinary freighterstill an unwary uboat skipper approached them on the surface confident of an easy kill several such skippers had paid with their boatsand with their lives lemp shook his head not me by god not me the enemy wasnt zigzagging she didnt know he was around then good he thought imagining what cm guns could do to his hull and the u was overhauling her he smiled wolfishly yes shed get a nasty surprise before long he went below no time to change now after the hunt would have to do hed kept his sausage and noodles down on the conning tower he almost lost them for a second time leaving the cold pure ocean air for the stinks and smokes of the pressure hull his eyes also needed a moment to adjust from gray daylight to the dim orange lamps the uboat used take her down to periscope depth peter he said periscope depth aye aye skipper the helmsman said dive warnings hooted air hissed out of buoyancy tanks water gurgled in to take its place the u could dive like an otter when she had to the crew practiced all the time if a destroyer or an airplane came after you you had to disappear in a hurry or youd disappear forever lemp raised the periscope the instrument wasnt perfect it got out of alignment and the upper lens took even more splashes and spray than his binoculars did but the periscope didnt need to be perfect this time here came the merchant cruiser fat and happy as if she had the world by the tail course all ahead one third lemp ordered and the batteries that powered the u underwater sent her toward her prey the target was making about ten knots the torpedoes could do better than thirty if the range was down tohe peered through the periscope again meters he needed to launchnow fire one he snapped and then fire two and then fire three whamwhoosh one after another the fish leaped away from the uboat all three gone skipper the torpedomen reported ja lemp agreed absently in these waves he couldnt watch the wakes as well as he would have liked on the other hand the merchant cruiser would have a harder time seeing them coming too at the very last moment she started to turn away the very last moment proved much too late the first torpedo caught her up near the bow the dull boom filled the u the soldiers whooped and cheered somebody pounded lemp on the back discipline on a submarine wasnt the same as it was on a surface shipnowhere close the skipper kept his eyes on the periscope so he never knew who it was a few seconds later another bigger boom echoed through the water the second torpedo hit the enemy ship just aft of amidships that does it lemp spoke with quiet satisfaction we broke her back shes going down fast he waited for the impact of the third torpedo but it didnt come that one must have missed he was annoyed he hated to miss but the two hits were plenty to sink the merchant cruiser and that after all was the point of the exercise he wouldnt be too hard on himself a lot of boats out a lot of heads bobbing in the water as the ship slid under the survivors wouldnt last long not in seas like this lemp wondered if hed sunk a troopship bringing soldiers from canada to england that would be an even stronger blow against the enemy than hed thought he struck he also wondered if shed got out an sos if destroyers say were hurrying this way on a rescue mission he didnt want to hang around any longer than he had to surface he said lets skedaddle weve done our job here peggy druce finally had her bags packed in a couple of hours she would head for the train station the train would take her out of germany and into neutral denmark in copenhagen she would get on a lovely american liner the athenia before too long shed be in new york two hours by train from philadelphia a million billion miles from a europe that had lost its mind somebody knocked on the door a hotel flunky she thought as soon as she saw the uniform she realized the man wasnt from the hotel it wasnt a military uniform but civilians in the third reich liked playing dressup too this guy unless she was wrong came from the foreign ministry and this guy unless she was very very wrong was trouble with a capital t you are miss uh margaret druce he asked in pretty good english missus peggy corrected automatically just as automatically she flashed her ring please to excuse me and please to let me introduce myself i am konrad hoppe of the subbureau for the supervision of interned neutrals he didnt click his heels but he gave her a stiff little bow something youd never see in the states as he straightened he went on you were formerly scheduled to leave germany today and to return to america in the near future amazing how something as simple as an adverb could be scarier than the bombs that had rained down on berlin at new years what do you mean formerly peggy demanded doing her goddamnedest not to show how frightened she was ah herr hoppe nodded more to himself than to her then you will not have heard any news this morning whats that got to do with anything dont play riddles if you dont mind if youve got something to say come out and say it already very well mrs druce this time hoppe got it right and this time he really did click his heels i regret that i must be the one to inform you that the athenia went down in the north atlantic yesterday bound for copenhagen from new york city loss of life is reported to be heavy went down numbly peggy entered the words they sounded innocuous almost antiseptic little by little her wits started working what do you mean went down went down how did a uboat torpedo her that was the likeliest way she could think of for a ship to go down in the middle of the north atlantic in wartime they cant do that shes a neutral shes an american they could do that they could do anything they damn well pleased sometimes as an american herself she had trouble remembering that in spite of all the horrors shed seen maybe that made her a fool maybe it left her one of the last sane people on this poor benighted continent konrad hoppe dutiful employee of the subbureau for the supervision of interned neutrals looked pained so the bbc claims but this is one more lie from a nation of liars the government of the reich has denied any involvement in the sinking of the athenia if it was not an accident the british torpedoed or bombed it themselves to stir up hatred against germany in america thats the nuttiest thing i ever heard in my life peggy exclaimed it is not hoppe insisted for the british it would make perfect sense but why would the reich sink an american ocean liner do you not think we learned our lessons on the folly of this in the last war peggy opened her mouth then she closed it again she didnt know what to say she couldnt imagine england doing anything so filthy but she also had trouble believing hitler wanted to antagonize the usa wouldnt he be cutting his own throat if he did he might be nuts but he wasnt stupid he wasnt that stupid anyhow or peggy didnt think so maybe your guy just made a mistake she said after a few seconds of thought have you ever crossed the atlantic in january i have and its rough seas and nasty weather all the way our submarine captains do not make such errors the foreign ministry official said stiffly it is impossible and if you find the atlantic in january so unappetizing why did you book passage on the athenia to get the hell out of your stinking country but if peggy said something like that some guys who wore different uniformsthose of the ss saywere liable to have some sharp questions for her or pointed ones or hot ones to get away from the war she did say a couple of heartbeats slower than she might have i am afraid this is not possible for you at the moment hoppe said cant i go to denmark anyway peggy yelped the lights were on in neutral denmark denmark had never heard of rationing except as something other people suffered much more to the point denmark was a civilized country once upon a time peggy would have said the same thing about germany no more no more i am very sorry konrad hoppe didnt sound sorry if anything he sounded coldly amused he got to tell foreigners no and the foreign ministry paid him to do it if that wasnt heaven for the nasty little man peggy would have been amazed a small chilly smile on his lips hoppe went on that also for you is not possible how come she wouldnt give up without a fight ive got the train ticket ive got the danish visa why cant i use em it is not the policy of the reich to permit departures unless the return journey to the foreigners home may be completed without delay hoppe droned why thedickens not she wanted to say something hotter than that but feared it would do her more harm than good i am not obligated to discuss the reichs policies with those affected by them i am obliged only to communicate them to you hoppe said primly fuck you charlie peggy didnt say that either a few years earlier she would have maybe she was finally growing up she rolled her eyes she didnt think herb would believe it that made her roll them again god only knew whenor ifshed see her husband again she tried a different tack okay youre not obligated could you do it because you want to or because itd be a civilized kind of thing to do yes shed throw that in hoppes face and his sallow cheeks did turn red russians got ticked off if you called them uncultured germans were almost as bad a lot of them had an inferiority complex about france and england and oddly that had got worse since hitler took over it was as if the nazis were uneasily aware of what a bunch of bastards they were and embarrassed when somebody called them on it i believe hoppes voice trailed away a little muscle under one eye twitched the only visible sign of what had to be a struggle inside him human being against nazi functionary peggy knew which way she would have bet but she would have lost because the foreign ministry official went on i believe it is to keep people from blaming the reich for disrupted schedules when those are not of our making who sank the athenia peggy wondered again but hoppe would only deny it one more time if she threw it in his face if goebbels was saying the british had done it that was holy writ inside the third reich hoppe probably believed it himself even if it seemed like obvious horse manure to peggy well suppose i sign a pledge that says i wont be offended peggy proposed if i badmouth you in the papers or anything you can haul it out and tell people what a liar i am he shook his head no that is not good you would claim you signed the document under duress we have experience with others who prove ungrateful after going beyond our borders and why do you suppose that is peggy knew goddamn well why it was konrad hoppe seemed not to have the faintest idea that he didntthat so many like him didntwas one measure of modernday germanys damnation i really wouldnt peggy said honest cross my heart and hope to die she would have promised anything and done damn near anything to escape the reich if hed propositioned her she wouldnt have loosened his teeth for him she wouldnt have come across but still i am sorry i have not the discretion to permit this now hoppe did sound as if he might mean it anyhow who does peggy asked ribbentrop herr von ribbentrop may have the authority konrad hoppe stressed the aristocratic von which the nazi foreign minister as peggy understood it had bought he may i say hes the head of the foreign ministry right peggy said if he doesnt who does for crying out loud above the foreign ministerabove everyoneis always the fuhrer hoppe pointed out the obvious oh my aching back peggy burst out how am i supposed to get hitler to pay attention to my case theres a war on i am afraid i can offer on that score no suggestions the nazi bureaucrat answered if you will excuse me he bowed once more and walked out without waiting to see whether peggy would excuse him or not she thought about getting on the train for denmark even if the foreign ministry said she couldnt she not only thought about it she headed for the station she presented her ticket then she had to present her passport the conductorhe wasnt quite a conductor but a more prominent kind of official with a uniform a us major general would have enviedchecked her name against a list as soon as he did that she knew her goose was cooked damn teutonic thoroughness anyway his toploftiness looked up from the sheet of paper i am sorry but for you travel is verboten he said its not fair its not right she squawked the railroad official shrugged i am sorry i can about that nothing do i do not the orders give i only carry them out right peggy said tightly what am i supposed to do now go back to your hotel the man replied wait for german victory it will soon come then i have no doubt you will be able where you please to travel although since you are here in the reich at this worldhistorical time why would you anywhere else care to go peggy could have told him she came that close that closeto doing it in the end she held her tongue yeah maybe she really and truly was growing up or maybeand more likelythe gestapo could scare the bejesus out of an immature person too vaclav jezek loved his new antitank rifle the damn thing was long and heavy it kicked like a mule the round it fired was as big as his thumb despite that it wouldnt penetrate all the armor on a firstrate german panzer but against side or rear panels it had a good chance of punching through then it would do something nasty to the men inside the metal monster or maybe to the engine he didnt like the way hed got his hands on the antitank rifle the frenchman who had lugged it around lost the top of his head to a bullet or shell fragment he wasnt pretty when vaclav found him hed bled all over the weapon too now though you could hardly see the stains somebody moved in the bushes a few hundred meters ahead jezek swung the rifle in that direction it shot nice and flat out to a kilometer and more what you could see you could hit and what you could hitusing the antitank rifle against a mere soldier was like killing a flea by dropping a house on it vaclav didnt care he wanted germans dead and he wasnt fussy about how they got that way czechs and frenchmen and a few englishmen were all intermingled here they shouldnt have been but the latest german drive had thrown the defenders in the ardennes into confusion jezek had seen that in czechoslovakia to his sorrow after a panzer thrust pierced the line you were trying to hold you had to scramble like a madman to piece together a new one farther back and the germans were still pushing forward and shelling you and bombing you anybody have more clips for the antitank rifle he called in czech he could have said the same thing in german but it probably would have got him shot he didnt speak french or english but one of the french noncoms assigned as liaison to the czechs translated for vaclav the mans czech was none too good but he spoke french fine and a couple of soldiers coughed up the fat clips vaclav needed thanks he said as he stowed them in a sack on his beltthey were too big for standard ammunition pouches any time pal i bet ive hated the nazis longer than you have the sergeant said he had a slight guttural accent curly auburn hair and a formidable plow of a nose another jew theyre fucking everywhere jezek thought the guy named david was back of the lines with a bullet through his leg right now hed get better whether the line would wasnt so obvious i wouldnt be surprised vaclav said aloud this fellow wouldnt duck out of the fight the way the damned slovaks did anyhow german s started tearing up the landscape a few hundred meters off to the south nobody in vaclavs bunch even flinched that wasnt close enough to worry about the noncom said maybe therell be some cows down and we can get ourselves fresh beef or pork the words came out of vaclavs mouth before he thought about them he didnt faze the noncom in french uniform ive eaten it the guy said beats the crap out of going hungry yeah well what doesnt jezek replied they never got the chance to see if the germans had done some worthwhile butchery for a change stukas screamed down from a treacherously clear sky down several soldiers yelled the same thing at the same time vaclav and the jewish sergeant were two of them they both fit action to word vaclav was already tearing at the muddy ground with his entrenching tool when the first bombs hit nearby blast jumped on him with hobnailed boots fragments of bomb casing screeched malevolently through the air he kept on impersonating a mole stukas came in bigger waves than this sure as hell more of them wailed down on him and his buddies hed heard they had sirens mounted on their landing gear to make them sound even scarier than they would have otherwise as far as he was concerned that was overdoing it the damn things were scary enough anyhow the sergeant lay on his back firing up at them with his rifle that took guts but it was bound to be a waste of ammo how could you hit something that was going kilometers an hour people were shrieking and wailing in a godawful babel of languages medics ran here and there slapping on bandages and lugging wounded soldiers away on stretchers the medics wore red cross armbands and smocks some of them had painted red crosses in white circles on either side of their helmets every so often they got shot anyway german medics wore the same kind of outfits vaclav had never aimed at one of them on purpose still he was sure they stopped bullets too a french officer shouted something it might as well have been in japanese for all the sense it made to vaclav the redheaded jew just like judas jezek thoughttranslated weve got to get back over the semoy theyre going to blow the bridges pretty soon he says to help stop the germans they think that will vaclav didnt believe it for a minute the nazis were too good with pontoon bridges and rubber boats and parachutists and what have you thats what he says after a moment the sergeant added do you want to get stuck here wellno vaclav admittedthe only answer that question could have a crackle of machinegun fire made him hit the dirt again here came an obsolete but nasty little panzer i spitting bullets from both guns in the turret no french tanks anywhere close by of course they were like policemennever around when you needed them but a panzer i wasnt so goddamn tough vaclav had heard they were originally intended as nothing more than training vehicles they got thrown into combat when hitler jumped czechoslovakia even their frontal armor was only thirteen millimeters thick that kept out smallarms fire anything more he worked the bolt and chambered a round he wasnt shooting at a stuka the little german tank made a fine target the tank commander who was also the gunner sat right between the machine guns as always the antitank rifle kicked like a son of a bitch hed have a nasty bruise on his shoulder he didnt care though not when the panzer is machine guns suddenly fell silent good shot the jewish sergeant yelled the tank drove on but so what the driver couldnt shoot while he was driving and the allied soldiers on this side of the semoy couldnt stop the nazis vaclav thanked god no german bombers struck while he was tramping over the bridge he would have thanked god a lot more had he done worse to the enemy sooner in a world where you didnt get many big favors you needed to be properly grateful for the small ones come on this way the engineer called in a low urgent voice willi dernen assumed he was an engineer anyhow it was the middle of the night and as black as the jew suss heart outside the man went on the pontoon bridge is right here it has rope rails so hang on to those and so help me god you assholes well drown the first fucking dummkopf who lights a cigarette before hes half a kilometer away from it who would be that stupid willi wondered but the question answered itself a dummkopf would that was who like every other outfit in the world the wehrmacht had its share and then some a jerk who decided he needed a smoke right now would damn well light up and so what if he gave the game away to some watching frenchman willis feet thudded on planks he reached out and found the rope it guided him across the semoy the bridge swayed under his weight and that of his comrades almost as if he were on the deck of a boat you heard the man corporal baatz said loudly no smoking the engineer spoke in a deadly whisper whoever you are bigmouth shut the fuck up snickers ran through baatzs squad one of them was willis he was only an ordinary landser he didnt have the rank to tell awful arno where to head in the engineer sure didor acted as if he did which was every bit as good baatz didnt let out another peep even to protest somebody up ahead said careful youre coming to the end of the bridge maybe fifteen seconds later he said it again and then again to let the troops gauge where he was willi almost tripped anyhow when the planking gave way to mud second platoon form up on me that was lieutenant georg gross whod taken neustadts place after the former platoon commander bought his plot gross seemed like a pretty good guy even if he didnt ride herd on arno baatz hard enough to suit willi to an officer baatz probably looked like a pretty good noncom that only showed officers werent as smart as they thought they were somebody stepped on willis foot ouch he saidquietly watch it he added sorry the other soldier said and then willi wolfgang willi chuckled well thats one way to find each other in the dark listen to me men lieutenant gross said listen to me dammit the objective is charlevillemezieres southwest of here the way he pronounced the towns name said he spoke french as neustadt had before him much good it had done the other platoon leader gross went on weve got about ten kilometers of marching to do before we get there maybe twelve well go through the bois des hazellesthe hazelwoodfor part of the way it should give us some cover depends wolfgang storch muttered how many goddamn frenchies are in it now questions gross asked nobody said anything loud enough for him to hear it wolfgangs question was a good one but the lieutenant wouldnt be able to answer it theyd have to find out the hard way odds were southwestwilli looked up into the sky but clouds covered it and told him nothing he hoped it didnt start to snow while they were marching that would be all they needed wouldnt it willi might not know southwest from artichokes but a soft click and a slight rasp said lieutenant gross was opening his pocket compass this way he said confidently follow me like the fellow at the end of the pontoon bridge he spoke up every so often to let his men know where he was willi tramped along trying not to think he wished he were back in breslau and home in bed or even wrapped in a blanket in some shell hole it was cold and getting colder marching warmed but only so much some people did light up once they got far enough away from the bridge the smell of harsh french tobacco filled the frosty air almost everybody smoked looted gauloises or gitanes in preference to the junos and privats and other german brands that came up along with the rations the cigarettes the wehrmacht got were supposed to be better than what civilians smoked back home that only went to show better wasnt the same as good ten or twelve kilometers a couple of easy hours in the daylight in black night feeling his way along stumbling or falling every so often getting thwacked by branches that he couldnt see in the hazelwood willi didnt have much fun he also didnt go very fast neither did anyone else and there were frenchmen in the bois des hazelles willi and his pals had to be coming to the end of itthe sky was starting to go from black to charcoal gray in the southeastwhen someone called out qui va un ami lieutenant gross said ami meant friend willi had picked that up from surrendering frenchmen nowwould it do the trick it didnt the poilu gave forth with a fresh challenge one willi didnt get maybe he wanted a password whatever he wanted gross didnt have it the shooting started a moment later the froggies damn them had a machine gun right there it spat fire in the darkness tracers stabbed out at the oncoming germans they were scary as hell willi flopped down on his belly and crawled forward like a slug he didnt want to get a centimeter higher off the ground than he had to as he crawled he realized that those tracers werent doing the guys at the hotchkiss gun any favors every time the machine gunners opened up they guided their enemies toward them and it wasnt really light enough for them to see what they were aiming at so willi yanked the fuse cord on a potatomasher grenade he flung it toward the machine gunners who had no idea he was there but the grenade hit a branch or something because it didnt burst where he wanted it to the frenchmen serving the gun yelled but they didnt scream he froze if they spotted him he was sausage meatand it was getting lighter something off to one side distracted them they turned the hotchkiss in that direction and started banging away they nailed somebody too that shriek sounded bad but while they were busy over there willi slithered behind ahazeltree he pulled another grenade off his belt he threw this one sidearm not the way they taught you in basic but he wanted to keep it low so it didnt bounce off anything then he flattened out again if this one didnt do the job though he had the bad feeling flattening out wouldnt be enough to save his young ass bang he got screams this time then it was forward as fast as he could scramble he had no idea how badly hurt the frenchmen were he had to finish them before they or their buddies got that machine gun going again they were down they were thrashing not worried about the hotchkiss at all he shot them to make sure they didnt worry about anything else again he was putting a fresh clip on his mauser when a shape loomed up out of the morning twilight he started to give it the bayonet but checked himself when he recognized the familiar shape of a stahlhelm with a dry chuckle corporal baatz said i wouldve plugged you before you could drive that home lets go after the frenchmen willi answered and left it right there he didnt think baatz could have got him if hed followed through and he was half sorry he hadnt maybe more than half sorry more machine gunsand poilus with rifles grenades mortars and all the other usual nastinesscrowded the hazelwood methodically the germans cleaned them out and pressed on toward charlevillemezieres panzers drew tracks across the snow on the flat open country south and east of the woods pillars of smoke rising to the cloudy sky marked the pyres of a couple that would go no farther but the runners were the ones that mattered the french tried to make a stand in front of the town cannon and machinegun fire from the german army sent them tumbling back in retreat willi looked around there was wolfgang his bayonet had blood on itnot arno baatzs but somebodys all right wheres the lieutenant willi asked him down i bet he loses his arm wolfgang answered the fucking hotchkiss got him just before somebody did for it that was me willi said yeah well it needed doing storch paused to light up then he said sergeant pieck caught one right through the foot too that means awful arnos got a sectionmaybe the platoon till they give us a new officer jesus christ i knew i should have stuck him willi explained how hed almost bayoneted baatz by the french machine gun his buddy was good for even more reasons why he should have than hed thought of for himself willi pulled a pack of gauloises out of his pocket but the familiar winged helmet shielded no more cigarettes let me bum a butt off you what a useless creature you are first you didnt scrag the corporal and now you steal my smokes wolfgang gave him his own pack willi did have a match he got the cigarette going the two landsers tramped on the poles had a good medium bomber the pzl p could carry more than twice the bomb load of a tupolev sb fortunately for the red army and air force the poles didnt have a hell of a lot of them whenever the enemy found a chance he did his best to strike at the airstrips the red air force used sergei yaroslavsky took those raids for granted the poles made them at high altitude and they got out of soviet airspace in a hurry an occasional bomb gave the groundcrew some work to do repairing a runway more often than not the bombs missed by hundreds of meters or even by kilometers nothing to get excited about then things changed sergei was barely awake when antiaircraft guns around the airstrip started banging away at sunrise he tumbled out of his cot wondering if the gunners had the galloping jimjams they didnt bombs crashed down on the runways and on the bombers near them not all the bombers were in revetments the way they should have been it hadnt seemed worth the trouble those arent elks somebody yelledthat was the ps nickname those are motherfucking stukas bozhemoi yaroslavsky shouted a bombardier said something electric about the way the devils grandmother had buggered up the antiaircraft guns satan and his relatives might be as out of fashion as god but people hadnt forgotten about them either sergei threw himself flat in the snow that was all he could do now one after another the fascist divebombers stooped on the airstrip like falcons after pigeons pigeons could at least try to get away to mix the metaphor the bombers on the ground were sitting ducks and while the pilots of those jus might be goddamn nazi bastards they were also more than competent professionals one after another they released their bombs fired a burst from their forward machine guns pulled out of their dives and zoomed off to the northwest they might almost have performed an aerial ballet the germans had a word for that kind of ballet they would a totentanz a dance of death here they were dishing it out the soviets had no choice but to take it machinegun bullets thudded into the snowbank much too close to sergei little white powdery puffs shot up into the air at the impacts if a round hit him a little red fountain might join the white he burrowed into the drift burrowing wouldnt do him a kopeks worth of good but he did it anyway fear and instinct drove harder than reason not all the explosions came from german bombs the sbs had been gassed up and bombed up before long they would have taken off and punished the semifascist poles well behind the semifascist poles loomed the fascist germans and no matter how virtuous the soviets might be they were getting hammered this morning ever so cautiously sergei stuck up his head the stukas were gone which didnt make the airstrip a safe place an sb a couple of hundred meters away was burning like the inside of a blast furnace ammunition for the planes guns cooked off with a cheerful popping noise spraying bullets every which way and then one of the bombsor maybe all of the bombsblew what had been a fire turned into a fireball stunned half deafened sergei burrowed into the snow again something large and hot smashed down well behind himthe explosion had thrown it a long long way he could tell it was hot because even his afflicted ears made out the hiss of steam coming off it as the snow put it out another tupolev bomber blew up not quite so spectacularlyor maybe it was just farther away several more were on fire one hadnt burned but was broken in half behind the bomb bay intact sbs were the exception not the rule whatever punishment the poles were going to get would have to come from some other airstrip today sergei made himself stand up he looked around to see what he could do that might help other dazed survivors were also emerging from the snow like hares coming out of their burrows steaming patches here and there marked big chunks of wreckage and bloody patches here and there marked dead and wounded men what looked like a chunk of aileron had decapitated the best mechanic at the airstrip sergei swore but nobody could do anything for that poor son of a bitch now the fellows who thrashed and writhed still had hope some of them did anyhow stooping beside a groundcrew man who groaned as he clutched a shattered ankle sergei wondered what kind of hope the man had if he didnt bleed to death or die of gangrene or septicemia hed survive the bomber pilot was no doctor but he didnt see how the groundcrew man would keep that foot what kind of life did a cripple have you should have wondered about that sooner he thought but pilots seldom got crippled if anything went wrong in the air or if your plane got shot down you were likely to buy the whole plot not part of one nobody in the ussr bought or sold or owned land but soviet flyers talked the same way as their western counterparts after doing what he could to bandage the groundcrew man and telling a few reassuring lies sergei looked northwest once more after the longgone stukas in czechoslovakia hed seen the germans were good now he saw how good they could be with the advantage of surprise how smart were we to get into a war with people like this he wondered chapter thirteen samuel goldman passed several sheets of closely written paper to the visitor here you are friedrich he said his tone an odd mixture of cringing and pride everything that can be known about xenophanes is here sarah goldman listened from the kitchen as her father and the other professor of ancient history talked friedrich lauterbach had studied under her father he still felt kindly toward himthis article for paulywissowa was a case in point when it saw print it would go under lauterbachs name he after all was an aryan but he paid samuel goldman for the work and the family badly needed the money now he said thank you very much i will type it myself tonight so no secretary finds out about ourarrangement whatever you need to be safe sarahs father said take a look at it now if you care to i have been very thorough he was proud of that too yes he really might as well have been a germanexcept the damned germans wouldnt let him im sure its fine samuel who knows your work better than i do after all lauterbach paused for a moment herelet me give you this as he always did he sounded embarrassed about having to do business this way another pause followed a longer one sarah had to strain to hear her fathers next words for his voice dropped almost to a whisper but this is too much this is much too much twice as much as i could have expected for im giving you what i can lauterbach said there wont be any more im afraid not from me i got my callup papers yesterday thats why i have to do my typing in a hurry oh samuel goldman said and then stay safe i would be with you if i could you did what you had to do the last time around the younger man said i know thatyou could hardly walk when i studied with you that isnt whats keeping me out now sarahs father said pointedly and i know that lauterbach answered i think itsunfortunate but what can i do about it i am only one man and not a very brave one as long as you dont tell the tommies and the poilus they wont know sarahs father said with a wry chuckle if i could fool them so can you youll do fine im sure of it that makes one of us lauterbach said with a dry laugh of his own id better go im afraid true sarahs father agreed if they can prove youre friends with a jew that may be more dangerous than going up to the front if things were different lauterbach sighed but they arent and they arent likely to be still youve got a pretty daughter three or four footsteps took him to the door it closed behind him he was sarah remembered single did he mean she shrugged what he meant didnt matter because things werent different and they sure werent likely to be he was dead right about that she went out into the front room her father stood there holding the banknotes with the eagles and swastikas even the money proclaimed that things werent going to be different samuel goldman looked up you were listening he asked ja sarah nodded wasnt i supposed to its all right he grimaced i dont know what well do for cash when this runs out though isnt there anyone else who will let you write for him sarah asked maybe her father lookedand soundeddubious the others have always been more nervous about it than friedrichand who can blame them his mouth twisted they never paid as well either but we do what we can not what we want to eh ja sarah said again what else was there to say she did her best to find something saul brings in a little money as a laborer it wasnt quite as if her father said as a pimp but it was close he went on he has a brain he should use it he should have the chance to use it or he should be a soldier hed make a better one than friedrich lauterbach and you can bet on that he doesnt mind so much honest papa he doesnt sarah knew she was right about that her big brother had always exulted in his strength on the soccer pitch working with his body instead of his brain didnt humiliate him the way it would have their father why god decided to give me a water buffalo for a son only he knows samuel goldman said and let it go at that the other worry was that even though the goldmans had money they couldnt buy much nobody in wartime germany could buy a great deal but jews suffered worse than ordinary germans they could buy only from shops run by their fellow jews and those shops always had less to sell than others food got worse and worse sarahs mother was a good cook but disguise could go only so far noodles flavored with nasty cheese didnt make much of a supper sarah picked at hers so did her father saul shoveled in everything in front of him and looked around to see what else he could get you can have mine if you want sarah said im not really hungry the last part of that wasnt true but she didnt feel like eating the mess in front of her thanks saul said as sarah passed him her plate her mother gave her a dirty look hanna goldman wanted everybody to eat a lot all the time maybe the noodles and cheese could have been worse but they could have been a lot better too as far as sarah was concerned saul was welcome to them if he wanted them so much and he did by the way he glanced up after he made them disappear he could have put away another couple of helpings but there were no more he sighed and said the coffee will be ersatz wont it aber naturlich mother answered burnt barley with a little chicory if were lucky some luck father said oh well saul shrugged his broad shoulders the army isnt getting much better how do you know that samuel goldman always looked for evidence in better times sarah had admired that now she wondered whether it made any difference at all evidence what did the nazis care about that but they had the guns and the goons with those they made evidence of their own what could you do if youd lived by reason your whole life long but reason suddenly didnt count any more could you do anything at all or were you just supposed to lie down and die that was what the nazis wanted german jews to do that the nazis wanted it was the best reason not to do it as far as sarah was concerned she wished her family had got out of germany while escape was still possible but her father clung too fiercely to his germanness to see the need he could see it now easy enough when it was too late instead of explaining how he knew saul said maybe the british will send planes over tonight how can you sound so cheerful about it sarah asked him theyre liable to blow us up with jews having to shelter in their homes enemy bombers were more likely to blow them up than anybody else her brother only shrugged again they havent yet and the more nazis they send to the devil the better ill like it if i had a gun saul samuel goldman said sharply that will be enough of that should i turn the other cheek saul retorted i dont see what for im no christian they keep reminding me of that in case im not smart enough to figure it out for myself theyre no christians either father said pagans barbarians he looked disgusted and theyre proud of it too a roman noble talking about wandering ostrogoths could have packed no more scorn into his voice he would have silenced sarah saul still felt like locking horns what about the german christians he said their preachers wear nazi uniforms even the catholics have swastikas in their churches the students at their universities give the nazi salute his right arm shot out they can call themselves whatever they want the name is not the thing father insisted trying to make you believe it isthats only one more lie maybe so saul said but we both tried to join the wehrmacht anyway didnt we and if theyd only let us wed be braying heil hitler like all the other donkeys in the reich wouldnt we samuel goldman opened his mouth then closed it again at last he said i have no answer for that because we would if theyd let us be germans germans we would have been since they make us into something else he left the table sooner than he might have no one else had much to say after that either british bombers didnt visit munster they didnt drop anything close by either especially in nighttime quiet the sound of bombs going off carried a long long way saul went off to work early the next morning father looked lost bewildered he had nothing to donothing that would yield a reichsmark anyway he started to fill his pipe then thought better of it the tobacco ration was miserably small what he got smelled like burning overshoes too sarah went out shopping with her mother when she was small she remembered shed really enjoyed that when she was small they could walk into any shop in munster and buy whatever they wanted shopkeepers fawned on them as they fawned on any other customers everything changed after the nazis took over brownshirts stuck big signsgermans dont buy from jewson the windows of jewishowned stores and jews were no longer welcome in shops run by aryans some of the german shopkeepers seemed embarrassed about it they did what they had to do to get along no more others thoughothers gloated those were the scary ones only a handful of shops jews could go into were left now the ward just made things worsenot only for jews but for everybody and the british air raids added to the burden of fear the people across the streetaryansnever stopped complaining about how their favorite bakery was gone like someone yanked a tooth its not there any more frau breisach would grumble she didnt know when she was well off of course she doesntshes an aryan sarah thought the one bakery in munster that jews could still use was way over on the far side of town it wasnt open very often and didnt have much when it was but when the choice lay between not much and nothing at allyou went over to the far side of town they had a little wire basket with wheels sarah pulled it along behind her it felt like nothing now on the way back it would be heavier she hoped it would anyhow sometimes the bakery didnt open or it was sold out or i wont think about any of that sarah told herself fiercely a gang of laborers was repairing a bomb crater in the middle of the street and there was saul as deft with a shovel as father was with greek irregular verbs he turned the nazi slogan on its head he drew joy through strength the gang overseer was a wizened little man in his forties the left sleeve of his shirt was pinnedup and empty maimed in the war sarah thought maimed in the last war she amended how many would get maimed in this one too manythat seemed sure maimed or not he carried a swagger stick in his right hand he also had a foul mouth and didnt care if women heard him use it work harder you lazy prick he yelled and lightly swatted a laborer on the behind ja ja the fellow muttered and went on working the same way he had before that didnt make the overseer any happier and you too you fucking kike he bellowed when he hit saul in the back with the swagger stick it was no tap the whack echoed like a gunshot sarah thought it would have knocked her over it barely staggered her big brother saul goldman responded with what had to be instinct as he might have on the soccer pitch hed been hit he had a weapon in his hands he used it the flat of the shovel blade crashed into the side of the overseers head the man went down as if hed stopped an artillery shell his skull was all caved in and bloody sarah and her mother let out identical shrieks of horroranyone could see that the overseer would never get up again saul stared at the man hed killed he stared at his mother and his sisterall that in maybe a second and a half then he threw down the gorespattered shovel it clattered on the cobbles he turned and ran as if a million demons were at his heels after him one of the other laborers shouted chasing a jew was more fun than fixing a bomb crater any day of the week the gang pounded after saul some of them still brandishing their spades sarah and her mother looked at each other each mirroring the others anguish as if on cue they both burst into tears a french private first class wore a little brown hash mark on his sleeve to distinguish him from an ordinary private luc harcourt was less than delighted when the indestructible sergeant demange told him hed been promoted idve had more fun getting the clap he said demanges gitane twitched as he chuckled think of it as congratulations for living this long he said luc did suddenly being a private first class looked a lot better he said so adding after all the shit ive gone through to get this ill be a general by the time the war finally ends france is in trouble yes i hope to christ france isnt in that much trouble demange said kiss my ass luc said the sergeant only laughed luc had earned the right to swear at him he did remember that he had to pick his spots with care anyway sew that stupid thing on sergeant demange told him you could be leading a squad at five minutes notice hell a couple of lucky german shell bursts and you could be leading a platoon he wasnt kidding luc had seen how fast casualties could chew a unit to pieces he and demange were two of not very many men whod been with the company since before the german blow fell on the low countries the rest were replacements or replacements of replacements or sometimes luc didnt want to command a squad much less a platoon all he wanted to do was hunker down tight live through the war and get on with his life not that anyone from sergeant demange on up cared what he wanted of course see i told you france was in trouble the veteran underofficer said and you will be too if you dont get cracking right luc knew better than to argue somewhere in his pack he had a little housewife with needle and thread he dug it out and sewed on the hash mark he would never put a seamstress out of business hed sewn up a couple of rips in his uniform his stitches were large and dark and ugly like the ones that held together the pieces of the frankenstein monster in the american film french s threw shells at the germans on the other side of the aisne lucs company was dug in a couple of kilometers west of soissons the town had taken a beating in the francoprussian war and again in the great war now it was catching hell one more time luc had come through it on the way to this position bombs and shells had wrecked the cathedral bits of thirteenthcentury stained glass lay shattered in the streets a priest stood by the ruins with tears running down his face luc had no tears left for people let alone things machine guns started stuttering up by the river french or german luc wondered cocking his head to one side to hear better both he thought that wasnt so good sergeant demange must have decided the same thing are those shitheads trying to force a crossing he growled theyd better not get over thats all ive got to say lets move luc grabbed his rifle he liked the idea of germans on the south bank of the aisne no better than demange as they hurried up toward the riverbank they gathered as many other soldiers as they could damned if that hash mark on lucs sleeve didnt make ordinary privates follow him without arguing or asking a lot of questions i could get used to this he thought there was smoke on the river not the ordinary war smoke of burning houses and vehicles but a thick chemical haze the germans used to mask what they were doing on the other side out of the smoke came black rubber boats paddled by fieldgray soldiers in coalscuttle helmets sure as the devil the boches were trying to get over french machine guns stammered out death again a german dropped his paddle and slumped down in his raft then another one got hit and another the raft slewed sideways it was probably leaking too german machine guns across the aisne shot back trying to silence the french fire they put out more rounds per minute than the ones the french used but they couldnt knock them out of action luc flopped down behind some bushes and started shooting at the germans in their rafts it wasnt fairthey couldnt shoot back that bothered him till a couple of machinegun bullets cracked past maybe half a meter above his head they cured any chivalrous notions he might have had two or three rubber rafts actually made it to the south bank of the aisne the unhurt germans in them jumped up and tried to set up some kind of bridgehead with all that french firepower concentrated on them they never had a chance inside of a few minutes they were all dead or wounded assholesll have to do better than that sergeant demange said a fresh cigarette in his mouth and a fresh clip on his rifle what else have they got behind that smoke luc asked well know in a few minutes demange answered sending up smoke signals of his own looks like its blowing away he and luc and the rest of the french defenders waited then he said one thing more fuck me the germans had lined up a couple of dozen tankspanzer iis and captured czech machineson the north bank of the aisne their cannon all pointed toward the french positions across the river from them to lucs frightened eyes it seemed as if every single one of those cannon pointed straight at him every single one of them seemed to open up at the same time too pouring shells and more machinegun bullets down on the french defenders luc hugged the ground his rifle was useless against those steel monsters the machine gunners fired back at the german armor he watched tracers fly across the aisne and ricochets harmlessly spark off the tanks armored carapaces one by one the french machine guns fell silent luc didnt think the gunners were lying low waiting to massacre the next wave of german rubber boats he thought they were dead those cannon werent all pointing at him after all they were pointing at the guns that could do the german assault troops the most harm that second wave of boats splashed into the river even while the cannonading went on the boches hadnt silenced everything on the south bank here and there riflemen and even a machine gun or two opened up on the soldiers who paddled like men possessed but now the french didnt have enough firepower to keep the rubber boats from beaching on the near bank luc raised up a little to shoot at the men leaping out of the boats as soon as he did a machine gun from one of the tanks on the far bank started banging away at him he had to flatten out again if he wanted to stay alive some of the german assault troops carried submachine guns with big drum magazines french doctrine scorned submachine guns they fired pistol ammunition and they were worthless out past a couple of hundred meters inside that range though they were uncommonly murderous they threw around a hell of a lot of lead even if they didnt get you they made you stay down so you couldnt shoot back and the damned boches had brought along real machine guns too hearing that malevolent crackle at such close range made lucs asshole pucker he had to bear down tight on his bladder to keep from wetting himself back sergeant demanges raspy voice penetrated the din weve got to get out of here form a line somewhere else how luc asked which seemed to him the very best of good questions even through the rattle of the german machine guns he heard the underofficer laugh carefully sonny carefully unless you aim to get your dick shot off even thinking of that made luc want to clutch at himself he crawled away from the riverbank doing his best to keep the bushes between himself and the boches only a few random bullets came his way the germans didnt seem to know he was there news good enough to make an atheist thank god he flopped down again behind the crest of a small swell of ground that shielded him from the enemy sergeant demange lay a few meters away still puffing on a cigarette butt what do we do luc said how do we throw them back into the river if we can bring a lot of tanks forward in a hurry that might turn the trick demange stubbed out the cigarette in the dirt but what are the odds eh luc mournfully considered them not good he said the germans always have plenty of tanks where they need them the most how come we cant do the same thing because their high command doesnt fight with its head up its ass demange answered he rose up to shoot at somebody heading upslope toward them a wild scream said hed hit what he aimed at too chambering a new round he went on they know its the twentieth century damn them how come we dont have any divebombers plastering the shit out of them right now having cowered under more stukas than he cared to remember luc said i dont know and i wish i did how come we dont if we were fighting the kaisers army wed wallop the snot out of it demange replied its the curse of winningyou get ready to do the same damn thing over again the germans lost so they figured theyd better try something new now were on the receiving end lucky us luc said in hollow tones ever so cautiously he too peered back the way hed come the lines on that dark helmet moving through dead grass were unmistakable he fired the boche scrambled for cover luc fired again the german went down with a howl he wasnt dead but he wasnt dangerous any more either that would do good job demange said but we wont stop them all by ourselves i wonder if anybody will this side of paris peking in summer was hot and dusty during the winter it was colder than a witchs tit how cold was that marines whod been in chicago said it was that cold pete mcgill could compare it to his native new york city hed known some cold weather there but peking bottomed out worse and peking would have felt cold even if it were in the nineties as long as the marines stayed close to the american legation they were okay but if they strayed very far into the city japanese soldiers were much too likely to whale the crap out of them like any other marine mcgill was convinced he was a better fighting man than some little scrawny bucktoothed bowlegged jap he was convinced he could take two or three japs come to that but when the odds got steeper still even john henry the steeldriving man would have found himself in deep water the odds did get steeper too peking was crawling with japs these days some of them kept order in the city the japanese way to keep order was to shoot first and not ask questions later since nationalist and communist guerrillas and freelance bandits all afflicted peking and the surrounding area that wild wild east style had its points but even more japanese soldiers were getting leave in peking and then climbing onto trains and heading out of town pete would have liked it if the bastards never came back but that was bound to be too much to hope for they werent going back to japanat least they werent heading southeast toward tangku or tsingtao the ports from which they sailed for home no most of them were going northeast on some of the new lines their people had built up into manchukuo that made mcgill gloat i wouldnt have believed it he said one day in the ncos club but the sorry sons of bitches are heading somewhere coldern this serves em right sure as hell another corporal agreed pete emptied his glass hey danny he called bring me another beer chopchop right boss the chinese bartender said the beer came from tsingtao it was pretty damn good the germans had run the place before the great war and theyd built a brewery there hitler was a bastard yeah but the squareheads knew what was what with beer the brewery was under new management these days of course but some of the old magic remained when the beer came pete tipped danny a nickel to a chinaman a nickel was a big deal danny bowed almost double he folded one palm over the other fist which was what the chinese did instead of saluting a sergeant named larry koenig came and sat down with pete he ordered a beer too danny brought it over to him koenig lit a cigarette and offered pete the packhe was a good guy thanks mcgill said he took one and leaned close for a light raising his mug koenig said mud in your eye same to you pete answered the salute with one of his own they both drank after sucking foam off his upper lip pete lifted his mug again and said heres to all the japs getting the hell out of peking hey ill drink to that but youll be bluern your dress uniform if you hold your breath and wait for it to happen koenig said yeah i know itd be nice though wouldnt it pete said they sure are moving a lot of guys through heremoving a lot of guys out of here theyll keep peking garrisoned though you bet hell i would in their shoes koenig looked at his mug in mild surprise as if wondering how it had emptied without his noticing he waved to danny for a refill as he waited he went on they hang on here what are the chinese gonna do about it not much not so i can see yeah man yeah looks the same way to me pete said with peking in their hands the japanese could spill south and west all over the place theyd done that for a while after overrunning the place now the flow was going in the other direction what do they need so many troops up in manchukuo for beats me koenig paused while danny set the beer on the table in front of him a lot of marines didnt like to talk with chinamen hovering around them pete didnt know whether danny was a spy or not he didnt much care either he didnt know enough himself to make what he said worth anything to anybody but if the sergeant wanted to be tightassed about it he could after danny hustled back behind the bar to build somebody a highball koenig resumed gotta be the russians ive figured it every different way i could and thats what it comes out to every goddamn time you really think so pete said thatd be one hell of a scrap damn russians have shit closer to home than siberia to worry about koenig said if it was me i wouldnt have started fucking with the polacks when they knew that was liable to bring hitler down on their necks yeah old adolfs bad news all right pete agreed me i wonder how much the russians really do know these days theyve been killing off generals like its going out of style maybe we ought to try that i dont know about the corps but itd sure as hell work wonders for the army and the navy koenig said pete snorted then he giggled then he guffawed he wasnt sure it was a good idea but he was damn sure it was funny i can see the fbi guys coming up to their desks youcome with us and out theyd go and bang plenty of em nobodyd miss koenig said aint it the truth pete nodded and you know what else i bet there hasnt been an army since julius caesars day where the noncoms didnt think itd go better if some officers got it in the neck most of the time wed be right too like any sergeant worth his salt koenig was sure he knew better than the guys set over him since pete mcgill felt the same way he didnt argue koenig waved for a fresh beer before continuing so if the japs and the reds bang heads which way do you bet my moneys on the white men yeah everybody said the same thing about the time you were born too and look how that turned out mcgill said anybody who came to peking got his nose rubbed in that lesson you couldnt come here without paying attention to what had happened in the russojapanese war sergeant koenig turned red he waited till danny gave him his new seidel then said you think the little yellow bastards can take em he paid no more attention to the barman than pete would have i dunno theyve sure got more combat experience than the russians do hell theyve got more combat experience than just about anybody mcgill answered and its way past the back of beyond for the russians and theyre fighting somewhere else and their armys fucked up so yeah i guess maybe i figure the japsll win i got a sawbuck says youre full of it koenig declared as far as pete was concerned the problems with the marine corps started with sergeants not officers that attitude would probably change the day he got his own third stripe but he had it now taking a sergeant down a peg would be a pleasureand so would winning ten bucks youre on he said koenig stuck out his hand pete took it the clasp turned into a trial of strength that ended up a push they both opened and closed their hands several times after they let go pete started to laugh whats so funny sergeant koenig asked we just made a bet on whos gonna win a war that hasnt started yet mcgill answered how dumb will we look if it turns out the japsre up to something else instead dumb enough i guess koenig said what you never looked dumb before not the past ten minutes anyway pete said which drew a laugh from the other noncom he went on i tell you i wish the japs would get the hell out of peking and stay out town was a lot more fun when the chinamen were still hanging on to it you got that right koenig nodded in what might have been approval see you aint as dumb as you look heh im not as dumb as you look either pete retorted they were off duty he could sass a sergeant if he felt like it and he didit wasnt a pleasure he got often enough wise guy koenig said and then something in chinese that sounded like a cat with its tail caught under a rocking chair behind the bar danny jumped a foot wow whats that mean pete asked impressed in spite of himself cant tell you koenig answered if i said it in english youd have to try and murder me give it to me again pete urged sounds like its worth knowing koenig repeated it pete tried to echo him he got the tones wrong the first couple of times he could hear that but he had trouble fixing it danny held his head in his hands pete finally said it the right way which made the bartender even more unhappy whats it mean danny pete called danny wouldnt tell him either that made him like his new toy even better chapter fourteen when alistair walsh saw a road sign saying how many kilometers it was to paris he knew things werent in good shape the whole point to the war was keeping the nazis away from paris the same as it had been with the kaisers army the last time around theyd done it the last timedone it twice in fact in and then again in he wasnt so sure they could now the bef stumbled back and stumbled back people were starting to talk about the miracle on the marne in well they were getting too damn close to the marne again and they sure could use another miracle he yawned what he could use was sleep one of the things nobody talked about was how wearing modern war was you were fighting or you were marching or they were shelling you or bombing you or you were trying to promote something to eat what you werent doing was resting he wasnt the only one frazzled almost to death even though february remained chilly exhausted soldiers curled up like animals by the side of the road some slept in greatcoats some wrapped in blankets some as they were regardless of the cold you had to look closely to see their chests rising and falling to make sure they werent corpses exhausted civilians also slept by the roadside singly and in family groups they hadnt done any shooting other than that they had as much right to be weary as the soldiers one poor woman must have been a restless sleeper shed kicked off her blanket and thrashed around so her legs and backside were out in the biting breeze walsh got an eyeful as he trudged along one of the tommies with him chuckled what were fighting for right the fellow said ive seen plenty worse walsh allowed if i lay down beside her though i bet id cork off before i could try getting her knickers down blimey me too the other soldiers face split in an enormous yawn dont know how i put one foot in front of the other any more behind them german artillery thundered to life walsh jerked a thumb over his shoulder thats how too right it is got a fag on you sarge walsh listened for screams in the air that would warn of incoming shells aimed their way hearing none he reached into a tunic pocket and pulled out a packet of gitanes here got these off a dead frenchman nasty things but better than nothing id smoke whatever youve got and thank you for it im plumb out and im all the tommy held out his arm in front of him and made his hand tremble know what you mean ive run dry myself a couple of times walsh proffered the french cigarettes take two or three then id be much obliged if you dont mind the soldier stuck one in his mouth and stashed the other two in a breast pocket of his grimy battledress he struck a match and inhaled cor he said in tones of deep respect like smoking a bleeding blowtorch aint it walsh had also lit a gitane after blowing out smoke he coughed like a man in the last stages of consumption whats that you say he inquired the other soldier laughed he took a second more cautious drag damn froggies like em this way dont they i expect so theyd make em different if they didnt walsh said fuck the tommy shook his head we ought to be on adolfs side bugger that mate walsh said germans shot me once and its not for lack of trying they havent done it again yeah the french are a bad lot but those bastards in fieldgray are worse take an even strain sergeant i was only joking like but then the soldier added they make damn good soldiers though they make damn good dead soldiers walsh said he also had a healthy regard for german military talent hed never met an english soldier whod fought the squareheads who didnt to him that only made germans more dangerous it didnt mean he wanted to switch sides he pointed to the town ahead is that senlis he probably butchered the pronunciation but he didnt care i think so the soldier to whom hed given a smoke also seemed glad to change the subject at its core senlis had what looked like really ancient walls with towers the spires of a cathedral poked up from inside them walsh remembered that the germans had burned the town and shot the mayor and several leading citizens in the damage had been made good in the quartercentury since all the same he didnt want to fight alongside people who did things like that he also wasnt eager to fight against them willing yes but not eager they were too bloody good at what they did in front of those old old wallswould they go back to roman daysan english captain with half a companys worth of men was nabbing stragglers you and you he called to walsh and the tommy to whom hed given some gitanes you think we can hold this town eh the other soldier didnt say anything it wasnt quite what the articles of war called mute insolence but it wasnt far removed either sergeant walsh said we can try sir he didnt agree with the officer but he did admit the possibility that was plenty fall in with me then the both of you the captain said if the hun tries to take this place well give him what he deserves and send him off with his tail between his legs what how many years had it been since walsh heard anybody call germans huns more than he could remember the captain was about his age so hed probably done time here in the last war most of the civilians had cleared out of senlis which meant they were causing traffic headaches somewhere south and west of here soldiers could pick and choose the empty houses they tried to defend walsh went through his but didnt find anything worth eating or drinking too bad he thought he had three privates with him they were all yorkshire farm boys and spoke with an accent he had to work to follow his might have sounded just as strange to them but that was their lookout they understood him well enough to keep watch at all the windowsand to give him a tin of m amp v he felt better after wolfing down the meatandvegetable stew senlis got a couple of hours respite before the germans turned their attention to it then artillery walked up to the town walsh crouched down with the three privates they were jim and jock and improbably alonzo the house theyd taken over was made of stone it would stop fragments unless it was unlucky enough to take a direct hit wheres our guns alonzo complained goons it came out when he said it however it came out it was a damn good question the germans always seemed to put their guns where they needed them the alliessometimes did stukas screamed down out of the sky one after another crouching huddled under the kitchen table walsh cursed the vulturewinged monsters and their sirens he also cursed the raf both for not shooting them down and for not having anything like them several windows in the french house were already broken the ones that werent blew in now leaving small snowdrifts of glass spears on the floor walsh swore some more resignedly sure as hell hed end up cutting his hand or his leg on them somebody was yelling for a medic somebody else was screaming for his mother one of the yorkshire lads crossed himself alistair walsh was no catholic but he understood the gesture nobody but a desperately hurt man made noises like that before long the screaming stopped walsh hoped the wounded man got morphine more likely the poor bugger passed out or just died up lads the sergeant told the privates i expect well have company before long wont get no clotted cream from me jock said chambering a round in his enfield with a snick of the bolt sure enough here came the germans they moved up in little stuttering runs from one bit of cover to the next some of them had leaves and branches fixed to their helmets with bands cut from old inner tubes no no one could say they werent skilled at their murderous trade a bren gun opened up a couple of houses away from walshs he liked the british armys new light machine gun a lot it really was lightyou could pick it up and shoot from the hip if you had to and it was aircooled no need to worry about pouring water or that failing piss into the metal cooling jacket around the barrel best of all it worked reliably what more could you want it made the germans hit the deck they started shooting at the house where it lurked when they did the muzzle flashes from their mausers gave the british infantrymen good targets walsh fired and reloaded then ducked down and crawled to another window to fire again something bit him through the knee of his battledress bloody glass he muttered the bren gun barked again german medics in red cross smocks ran up to recover casualties walsh didnt shoot at them fair was fair the germans mostly didnt shoot at british medics a lull followed the germans seemed surprised anyone was fighting hard to save senlis since walsh had been surprised when the captain made a fight for the place how could he blame them what happens now sergeant alonzo asked they could shell us some more they could call in the stukas again or the tanks walsh said none of the three yorkshiremen seemed to want to hear that walsh went on or they could decide were a tough nut and try to go around us instead of pushing through thatd be good alonzo said jack and jock both nodded after a moment so did alistair walsh after sarah goldmans father tied his necktie every morning he pinned his iron cross second class onto the breast pocket of his jacket samuel goldman wanted to remind the nazi thugs and gestapo goons who came to scream at him that hed done his duty for the faterland in the last war and would have done it again this time if only theyd let him maybe the eisenkreuz did some good the goldmans remained in their home the nazis hadnt hauled the rest of them off to dachau or buchenwald even if saul had killed a member of the master race the nazis hadnt caught sarahs big brother either saul had fled the labor gangand after that he might have fallen off the face of the earth sarah had no idea what hed done whatever it was she admired it tremendously the policemen with the swastika armbands also had no idea what hed done it drove them crazy no sir samuel goldman told a foulmouthed gestapo officer he has not telephoned us you would know if he had nicht wahr you must be tapping our telephone line you bet your scrawny ass we are jew the secret policeman said but he could be talking to some other lousy kike whos passing you coded messages it is not so sir sarahs father kept his temper better than she dreamt of being able to do maybe he had a deeper understanding of what was at stake in this game or maybe he was just blessed with a disposition more even than hers ought to take you all out and give you a noodle the officer growled i beg your pardon somehow samuel goldman still managed to keep the dignity a professor of ancient history and classics should have the gestapo officer jumped up and walked around behind him he put the tip of his outthrust index finger against the back of samuel goldmans neck bang he said and then a noodle i see sarahs father replied as coolly as if the man had explained how a new phonograph operated think youve got nerve do you the gestapo man growled you know what happens to assholes with nerve they scream as loud as anybody else once we get to work on em maybe louder on account of we dont fuckin like tough guys sarah and her mother listened from the kitchen doing their best to keep quiet so they didnt remind the goon they were there her mothers face went pale as skimmed milk sarahs own face was probably the same color but she couldnt see herself out in the front room her father stayed calm nerve not a bit of it he answered its slang we didnt use in the trenches thats all youll know thats trueyoure the right age ja ja the officer said impatiently you were in france i fought in the east against the russians ach so samuel goldman said well that was no fun either i had two friends who went to the eastern front and didnt come back kaupisch and briesen the gestapo man said it wasnt a questionhe knew sarah asked her mother with her eyes how the officer knew something like that hanna goldman shrugged helplessly thats right sarahs father said his voice soft and sad both aryans the officer said not good aryans or they wouldnt have made friends with a goddamn sheeny besides im not here to talk about them im here to talk about your stinking murdering turd of a son if hed said anything like that to sarah she thought she would have tried to brain him with an ashtray her father only sighed and said i dont know any more than you do i probably know less than you do because youve been chasing him ever since the tragedy took place why shouldnt we just kill you or take you off to a camp because of what that little cocksucker did the gestapo man snarled had he seen saul sarah had her doubts he wouldnt have called him little if he had saul was one meter eightyeight centimeters tall he weighed ninety kilos you could say a lot of things about him but not little not if you wanted to stay within shouting distance of the truth as if the gestapo cared or had to care samuel goldman sighed because we had nothing to do with anything saul may have done he suggested saul had done it all right sarah would never forget the sound that shovel blade made smashing into the side of the workgang boss head saul had had plenty of provocation but hed done it the gestapo man snorted you arent even citizens of the reich only residents i can do whatever i want with you to you yes sir i know you can father said mournfully you asked why you shouldnt i gave you the best answer i could are you playing games with me jewboy demanded the officer in the black uniform with the shiny metal buttons sarah would have killed him for that too if she could her father didnt even flinch games no sir he replied all im doing is the best i can for my family and me wouldnt you do the same in my place like youd catch me in a kikes place fat chance the gestapo man said sarah might have guessed hed have no fellowfeeling if you did how could you do a job like his then he added if you see him if you hear anything from him you are to report it to us immediately if you dont youll pay for it understand me yes sir samuel goldman said i understand the gestapo man stormed into the kitchen youre in there listening he yelled think i dont know you understand me too he glared at them till they both nodded too then he stomped out of the house he might have suddenly remembered he had other jews in munster to terrorize chances were he did as if wed really tell on saul sarah exclaimed as soon as he slammed the door i dont think so but we will her father said she stared at him wondering if her ears were working right he nodded ja we will butwhy how that wasnt sarah it was her mother who sounded as bewildered as she felt ill tell you why and samuel goldman did theyre liable to cook something up and send it to us thats why then if we dont report it they can arrest us for protecting a fugitive so chances are we have to play the game by their rulesand we have to hope saul has the good sense to know we might be under this kind of pressure sarah was sure saul would her father sounded anything but she knew why too devoted to the life of the mind samuel goldman had never known what to make of his big muscular son saul hadnt done badly in school but it wasnt what he cared about father had to wonder whether somebody like that had any brains at all saul will do fine mother had confidence in him too which made sarah feel better hanna goldman went on and if they didnt catch him right away theyll have a harder time of it now harder and harder the longer he stays free i hope so father said but again he sounded far from certain this time sarah was inclined to agree with him however little she wanted to germany was a land that ran on forms and papers food was rationed so was clothing everyone had an identity card and had to show it a dozen times a day how could a jew on the run not get caught in the spiderweb of officialdom and bureaucracy sarah couldnt imagine but so far saul hadnt and if he hadnt so far maybe he could keep on doing whatever he was doing and stay free maybe sarah could hope so anyhow she could even pray and she did though she didnt think she was very good at it maybe god valued sincerity over style she could hope that was true tooand she did a few kilometers up ahead lay a railwayjunction town called hirson willi dernen did his best not to care northeastern france had winters almost as beastly as the ones hed grown up with in eastern germany willi was holed up in a village called watigny east of the place that mattered to the fellows with the fancy shoulder straps one of these days theyd order him to go forward and he would he wasnt thrilled about it but he would what theyd do to him if he didnt was certain and dreadful what the frenchmen would do to him after he did might not be so bad if he was lucky for the moment even the generals could see that advancing through waistdeep snowdrifts was asking to get your dick shot off german guns pounded hirson the french replied but not many shells came down on watigny there were german batteries north and south of the village but none close by about half the people whod lived here fled before the wehrmacht arrived not all those houses were vacant french refugees from farther north and eastto say nothing of belgians and even dutchmensquatted in some of them the germans took the rest before long theyd probably throw out the squatters too for the time being the officers in charge of security were still sorting out who was who people from the older generation remembered the last time soldiers in feldgrau came through these parts some of them were among the folks whod run away others seemed gruffly tolerant of the occupiers their attitude said this was nothing new to them theyd done it once and they could do it again by order of the divisional commander the local tavern stayed open the exchange rate was pegged at ten francs to the mark that made even privates like willi rich menor as rich as they could be in a place like watigny where getting by was as much as anyone could hope for the tavern still had beer and wine as well as brandy that came in china crocks and was probably homemade it got you crocked all right willi had found that out by experience it also left you with a mother of a hangover strong french coffee and strong german aspirins blunted a katzenjammer though willi and wolfgang storch slogged through the snow toward the oasis orders were that no german soldier could go in alone nobodyd got knocked over the head here maybe it had happened somewhere else or maybe the high command was scared of its own shadow that was how it looked to willi he opened the door both he and wolfgang hurried inside then he closed the door again to block the cold wind whining through the streets it was gloomy inside but the fire gave some warmth frenchmen sat at a couple of tables drinking smoking murmuring in the language willi didnt speak corporal baatz and a couple of other noncoms occupied another they didnt try to keep their voices downthey were the winners after all winners or not willi wanted nothing to do with them a glance from wolfgang said he didnt either they walked past the underofficers and up to the bar the man behind it was big broadshouldered and fair he looked much more like a german than a frenchman but a photo on the wall behind him showed him in the uniform of a french soldier in the last war the patch he wore over one eye didnt hide all the scarring around the socket it did explain why he hadnt got mobilized this time around guten tag claude willi said more respectfully than not guten tag the tapman answered after he got wounded hed spent two years in a pow camp hed picked up some german there and hadnt forgotten all of it other people of his generation had learned it from the kaisers soldiers whod occupied the area they still knew bits and pieces too what you want eh claude went on beer bitte willi said brandy for me please wolfgang added they both laid moneygerman moneyon the zinc bar claude sighed but he took it what choice did he have go and sit he said pointing to an empty tableshrewdly the one farthest from where baatz and his buddies were michelle she bring now youre talking wolfgang radiated enthusiasmor something related to it anyhow a grin also stretched across willis face claudes daughter was about their age like her father she was large and solid and fair on her it looked good she came out from a back room claude gave her the drinks she carried them over to the soldiers thank you dear willi said auf deutsch he trotted out one of his handful of recently acquired french words merci pas d e quoi she answered gravely and went away as far as anybody knew she didnt sleep with soldiers everybody thought that was too damn bad arno baatz waved his mug fill me up over here he called claude brought a pitcher of beer to his table and poured the mug full that didnt satisfy baatz how come those noaccount lugs get the pretty girl and i get you he demanded claudes one eye skewered him like a lepidopterists collecting pin because they isarepolite the tapman answered and he walked back to the bar what im not corporal baatz yelled beerfueled outrage making him even shriller than usual you take that back nein claude said with dignity baatz jumped to his feet ill show you then you stinking pigdog come fight like a man claude turned around and took one step back toward him giving himself room to maneuver baatz rushed him willi wanted to avert his eyes he couldnt stand the unteroffizier but no denying he was a rough man in a rough trade he gave claude one that should have dented a panzer ii the barman blinked his good eye then he swung his fist caught arno baatz right on the button with a noise like a cleaver smacking into a frozen side of beef baatz went straight over backwards the back of his head smacked the stone floor he didnt move he didnt even twitch holy jesus willi said did you kill him claude took the question seriously he felt for the noncoms pulse he lives he said laconically and dropped baatzs wrist it fell back limply baatz might be alive but he sure wasnt connected to the real world the tapman looked to the other germans at the corporals table he hit me first please take him away he is no more welcome here they didnt argue with him nobody in his right mind would have argued with claude thennot without a schmeisser in his hands anyhow arno baatz was as boneless as an octopus as they dragged him out of the tavern one of the frenchmen drinking there sent up smoke signals from his pipe he said something in his own language claude shrugged a massive shrug as if to say well what can you do willi guessed the customer had warned him he would get in trouble well say he started it willi volunteered its the truth wolfgang agreed danke claude said for official business this is good for not official business he spread his hands and let his voice trail away willi understood that if arno baatz and his friendsassuming he had any which struck the biased willi as improbabledecided to come back with weapons what would the officers set over them do about it anything even if they did how much would that help claude after the fact maybe well go forward again soon blizzards cant last foreveri dont think wolfgang said then awful arno will be out of your hair ja maybe claude said it was the first time willi had heard him even slightly enthusiastic about the prospect of a german advance he was a frenchmen the germans had maimed him in the last war you couldnt blame him for not wishing them well but you also couldnt blame him for wanting corporal baatz the hell out of watigny even if that meant the wehrmacht went forward the tapman ducked into the back room for a little while then came out again a couple of minutes later so did michelle she brought willi a beer and wolfgang a brandy they hadnt ordered when they tried to pay for them she wouldnt take their money merci merci willi said it didnt seem enough but it was the best he could do they finished the free drinks and left after they got outside and closed the door behind them again wolfgang said if she really wanted to thank us she could have taken us into that back room while papa looked the other way shes not that kind of girl willi said yeah aint it a shame wolfgangs breath smoked even though he didnt have a cigarette in his mouth after a couple of steps he brightened could be worse you know old arno sure got his boy did he ever willi agreed enthusiastically they walked on through the snow toward the house where they were quartered french villagers stared fearfully at vaclav jezek and the rest of the czechs in his outfit vaclav knew why too their uniforms werent quite the right color their helmets were the wrong shape and they spoke some funny foreign language to people who didnt know any better that was plenty to turn them into germans and just to make things worse they were coming from the east if they were germans they would have smashed all the defenders ahead of them but you couldnt expect civilians to think of things like that one of the locals came out with something vaclav had picked up a handful of french words but not nearly enough to let him follow what did he say he asked the guy along as an interpreter benjamin halevy looked even less happy than he had before he heard the frenchmans news the jewish sergeant pointed north and west old geezer claims the germans are already over there shit vaclav said if that was true they were in danger of getting cut off and surrounded ifdoes he know his ass from a hole in the ground he eyed the frenchman the guy was around fifty and had some ugly scars on his jaw and left cheek maybe those werent war wounds but they sure looked like them if this fellow had gone through the mill before he wouldnt see a cow and imagine it was a german armored division halevy went back and forth with him after a last merci the sergeant returned to czech sure sounds like he does they pushed through the woods over there this guy says he saw a couple of armored cars but no tanks bad enough vaclav muttered several of his countrymen nodded he went on where are our tanks where are our armored cars nobody answered him the germans always seemed to have armor when they broke through they used their armor to break through the french scattered it up and down the line which meant they never had enough where they needed it most that was one reason they were falling back and the nazis moving up halevy gave vaclav a crooked grin hey pal thats why youve got your antitank rifle right vaclav told him where he could put the antitank rifle halevy would have walked very straight if hed tried you could get your behind in a sling for telling off a noncom but vaclavs behind was already in a sling because he was up at the front so what did he care he would have expected a jew to get stuffy about that kind of thing maybe to threaten him with official regulations but sergeant halevy just laughed and said something about his mother and troopships from another guy or under different circumstances vaclav would have tried to rearrange his face he laughed now too theyd been through it together theyd earned the right to zing each other seriously we ought to head up that way halevy said if your rifle can take out those cars itll do us some good vaclav was no more enthusiastic about putting his dick on the chopping block than any other soldier in his right mind would have been but he could see the need ill try it he said attaboy halevy told him he clapped another czech soldier on the back dominik take point right sergeant dominik didnt sound thrilled but he never did he was little and skinny and nervous as a cat in a room full of rottweilersall of which made him a goddamn good point man he carried a captured german submachine gun if he ran into trouble he could spray a lot of lead at it lets go the sergeant said he moved right behind dominik he didnt believe in staying away from trouble none of the people who said jews were a bunch of cowards had seen him in action david had stayed right up there with everybody else too till he stopped one and they both hated nazis even more than vaclav did which he wouldnt have believed if he hadnt seen it with his own eyes bonne chance called the frenchman whod warned them about germans luck that meant or something like it vaclav waved to the guy without looking back trees and bushes and rocks the western part of the ardennes was as wild and rugged as anything in czechoslovakia vaclav would have bet the germans couldnt get any armor through here but he would have lost if he had hed already escaped from tanks in these parts panzer is and iis and also some captured czech ts those infuriated him yes everybody grabbed whatever he could get his hands onhis own antitank rifle and dominiks machine pistol showed as much but seeing czech tanks fight against czech soldiers made him want to cry dominik waved urgently vaclav dove behind the closest bush he didnt know what was up ahead and he didnt want to find out the hard way sergeant halevy twiddled fingers at him ever so cautiously vaclav slithered forward he swore under his breath every time a knee or an elbow broke a twig then he frozegerman voices up ahead the breeze swung and he got a whiff of cigarette smoke god in heaven im tired one of the fritzes said i could sleep for a month just a little going on klaus if those dry tones didnt come from a sergeant vaclav would eat his boots ja klaus said and then what the hell was that that was vaclavs antitank rifle scraping through some dry bushes the goddamn thing was more than a meter and a half longalmost as long as he was tall it wasnt just heavy it was also unwieldy as all getout jezek froze i didnt hear anything the noncom said i sure thought i did klaus replied want to check it out nah i just want to sit here and grab a smoke sounds good to me let me bum one off you the sergeant said even more warily than before vaclav crawled forward he spotted an armored car between a couple of chestnuts hoping the noise wouldnt give him away he chambered a round the germans didnt have kittens so he got away with it a couple of those long fat rounds through the engine compartment and that armored car wouldnt go anywhere for a while he waggled the fingers on his left hand to let sergeant halevy know he was in position the rest of the czechs opened up on the germans his noise covered by theirs he punched one through the armored cars thin steel side and into the engine he was about to shoot at it again when a german with a submachine gun popped up out of nowhere vaclav shot him instead a round designed to pierce armor did horrible things to flesh it seemed to blow out half the germans insides the poor bastard fell over with a grunt and never stirred after that it was over fast for him anyhow shoulder achingeven with muzzle brake and padded stock the antitank rifle kicked harder than a kangaroovaclav reloaded here came the other armored car he fired at where the driver would sit once twice the car slid to the left and slammed into a tree that seemed to take the vinegar out of these germans they either ran off or gave up good job sergeant halevy called to vaclav dont you wish it was this easy all the goddamn time jesus vaclav exclaimed im just glad it was this easy once halevy laughed for all the world as if he were joking lieutenant julius lemp stood at stiff attention when a rear admiral reamed you out you had to stand there and take it and pretend it didnt hurt the process was a lot like picking up dueling scars except you had no sword of your own you thickskinned idiot karl donitz didnt raise his voice which only made things worse did you want to drag the united states into this war no sir lemp replied woodenly he stared straight at a spot three centimeters in front of donitzs nose the roundfaced chief of uboat operations was not a man who stood out in a crowd donitz was supposed to be a pretty good guy too he had a reputation for sticking up for his captains but nobody would stick up for you when you screwed up the way lemp had uboats brought the americans in the last time donitz said we try not to make the same mistakes twice you know he waited yes sir again something mechanical might have spoken through lemp ive had to calm down goebbels and von ribbentrop and the fuhrer donitz said they all wanted your scalp he waited what am i supposed to say now lemp wondered he tried im honored sir in a way he was if the propaganda minister and the foreign minister and hitler himself noticed you youd done something out of the ordinary no doubt about it rear admiral donitzs pale eyes grew cold as the seas off greenland i wouldnt be if i were you he said and his voice was as icy as his face dr goebbels had to put together a whole propaganda campaign to shift the blame away from us now theres some doubt about who sank the athenia but not among us eh no sir i did it all right lemp still didnt change expression yeah sometimes you had to stand there and take it this was one of those times id run you out of my office if you told me anything else donitz said if you screw up like this again i wont be able to help you do you understand that yes sir men who served on uboats werent normally long on military discipline this was one of those occasions where formality was mandatory though you took your abuse by the numbers a notation about your error will go into your service jacket donitz said which meant lemp would be a long time seeing another promotion yes sir lemp said one more time he couldnt get into more trouble as long as he kept saying that and he was in plenty already next time we send you out for gods sake try not to sink anything flying the stars and stripes donitz said i will sir lemp replied but he couldnt help adding you are going to send me out again yes yes the commander of the kriegsmarines uboat forces sounded impatient youve proved you can hit what you aim at we need that in our skippers i have to dress you down because you aimed at the wrong ship i have my orders too you understand did that mean hed been going through the motions before it sure sounded that way to lemp if he had he could take his act on stage hed make more money with it than he ever could in a naval career i see the uboat skipper said cautiouslyone more phrase that stayed pretty safe donitz looked altogether different when he smiled all right then he said dismissed and you can tell your crew we wont send them to a camp lemp saluted yes sir ill do that some of them have been worried about it some of them had been scared shitless you didnt want to say that to a rear admiral though lemp didnt like the idea of living in a place where making an honest mistake could land you in this much trouble but no matter what else the vaterland was it was the vaterland go on go on donitz had spent all the time with him he was going to stacks of papers smothered the admirals desk it wasnt as if he had nothing else going on after one more salute lemp made his escape he was glad hed worn his greatcoat germany had enough coal to keep furnaces going and heat buildings but wilhelmshaven was bloody cold outside screeching gulls wheeled overhead the air smelled of the sea and more faintly of fuel oilfamiliar odors to a uboat skipper donitzs office wasnt far from the harbor and from the seaside barracks that housed uboat crewmen when they came in to port lemp made for the twostory redbrick building with dormer windows where the sailors from the u were staying a sailor wearing a stahlhelm and carrying a rifle stood guard outside he saluted lemp the skipper and his crew werent quite under arrestbut they werent quite not under arrest either returning the salute lemp said you can relax jochen i think theyll give you some other duty soon i wouldnt mind jochen said lemp walked on in the sailors crowded the wardroom smoking and playing cards and reading newspapers it wasnt nearly so crowded as the long steel tube of the u would have been though everything stopped when the men saw lemp they searched his face as anxiously as they would have searched the horizon when royal navy destroyers were in the neighborhood its over lemp said the admiral read me the riot act but theyll let us put to sea again the sailors cheered they stamped their feet a couple of them whistled shrilly only later did lemp wonder why as long as they stayed in harbor they were safe any time they went hunting they laid their lives on the line and they were glad to do it if that wasnt madness of course it was he had a case of the same disease so did the british sailors who tried to bring merchantmen into their harbors and the other sailors who set out to sink uboats so did the soldiers in german feldgrau and so did the bastards in assorted shades of khaki who tried their best to stop the wehrmacht without that kind of madness you couldnt have a war julius lemp took it for granted so did men far more important than he what did donitz say asked a machinists mate that we were bad boys for sinking an american liner that we could have got the reich into all kinds of trouble but we didnt lemp answered he also said he needed people who could shoot straight more cheers rose these were so loud and raucous jochen stuck his nose into the wardroom to see what was going on nobody told him miffed he slouched back outside the soldiers started clapping and stomping again well go out there and do some more straight shooting lemp said the men shouted agreement they were good fellows all rightand crazy the same way he was chapter fifteen for more than two years the war in spain had electrified the world everybody could see it foretold what would happen when fascism squared off against marxism both sides threw what they could into the struggle italian troops german planes russian tanksmost of the bodies on both sides stayed spanish not all chaim weinberg wouldnt have left new york city without a strong feeling that something had to be done to stop fascism before it exploded all over europe he wasnt the only one the international brigades were proof of that outnumbered and outgunned the republic remained a going concern despite everything marshal sanjurjo could do to crush it and then when the internationals were about to get pulled from the line the big war did break out in europe spains fight was suddenly britain and frances fight too materiel flooded south across the pyrenees as the french border opened up it seemed too good to be true it was as soon as hitler turned his troops on the low countries and france rather than czechoslovakia the flood didnt go back to being a trickle it dried up altogether everything the french could make they shipped northeast to shoot at the boches germany and italy had already pretty much forgotten about spain with the french and english navies in the war the fascists had a much harder time getting through than theyd had before and they needed their toys to use against the western democracies so spain went from being the cockpit of world attention to the war that everybody forgot everybody that is except the poor sorry bastards still stuck fighting it lately sanjurjos men on an outpost a few hundred meters away had found themselves a new weapon a loudspeaker system it crackled to life now come over to the winning side a spaniard shouted and the loudspeaker gave him something close to the voice of god come over to us and well feed you what we eat ourselves its lovely chicken stew tonight dont miss it ha chaim said and turned to mike carroll you know how to make sanjurjos chicken stew first you steal a chicken carroll answered wearily thats an old one got a smoke yeah chaim gave him a gauloise lovely chicken stew the nationalist boomed again thanks tastes like shit but thanks carroll puffed happily chaim agreed with himthe french tobacco did taste like shit but gauloises and gitanes were better than no cigarettes at alland better than rollyourowns made from other peoples and your own butts chicken stewwith dumplings lying cocksucker chaim said without much rancor every so often guys from the other side deserted from what they said the nationalists were just as hungry just as miserable as the republicans maybe their officers have chicken stew carroll said now youre talking chaim said republican officers ate and lived no better than the men they led it was an article of faith on this side that the enemys officers exploited their soldiersthey were fighting for class distinctions after all some of what the deserters said supported that some but not all the republicans mostly discounted anything that disagreed with what theyd thought before wonderful chicken stew all you can eat somebody in the republican lines fired at the loudspeaker if you were hungry and cold and miserable talk of food could drive you nuts and you had to be nuts to shoot like that at long range with the crappy rifles and cheap ammo most republicans carried how likely were you to hit what you aimed at even if you did what kind of damage could you do and besides chaim pulled his entrenching tool off his belt it was very well made hed taken it off a dead italian he started digging that stupid assholes gonna bring some hate down on our heads tell me about it carrolls entrenching tool consisted of some scrap iron a smith had beaten flat and then bolted to a stick but it moved dirt too he deepened his foxhole and added dirt to the parapet in front of it and the parados behind sure as hell the shot woke up the nationalist artillery sanjurjos men had more guns and better guns than the republicans hitler and mussolini had been lavish in supplying their spanish friends till they got distracted nobody on the republican side had ever been lavish with anything not till the czech fight started and not for long enough then fragments wined and snarled overhead chaim dug like a mole trying to make what vets of the last war called a bombproof he should have done that a long time ago he knew as much but nobody liked to dig without need now the need was here mike carroll made dirt fly too they both stopped about the same time somebody not far away had been wounded and was making a godawful racket id better go get him chaim said though he could think of few things he wanted to do less as if to convince himself he added god knows id want somebody to pick me up if i got hit yeah carroll also scrambled out of his hole even if hed just improved it not being by himself above ground made chaim a little less lonely it also made him wonder if hed have to try to make pickup for two well if he stopped something himself somebody was out there to make pickup on him he scuttled along like a pair of ragged clawssome damn poem picking the exact wrong moment to bounce around in his head like a snake would have been closer because his belly hugged the ground every second off to his left mike also looked flattened by a steamroller to add to the joy a couple of nationalists started shooting at them with rifles luckily none of the rounds came close spaniards whether nationalists or republicans made pisspoor riflemen chaim didnt know why that was true but it sure seemed to be the bullets got close enough to scare him cracking past but no closer than that he crawled past some trench a shell hit had caved in and flopped down into the earthwork beyond with a sigh of relief mike carroll made it too there lay the wounded guy trying to clutch his chest and his leg at the same time and howling like a banshee two other men from the international brigades were nothing but raw meat and bloodno blaming them for not helping their buddy because nobody could ever help them again fuck carroll said hoarsely see who it is chaim hadnt noticedone injured fighter sounded much like another no matter which language hed grown up speaking now he took a look fuck he echoed its milt milton wolff el lobo to the spaniards on both sideshad led the abraham lincoln battalion since robert merriman was lost the spring before hed kept them in the line no matter what sanjurjos goons threw at them he wasnt just their heart he was also a big part of their backbone and he was badly hurt fragments had shredded his left calf and thigh and laid open the left side of his chest jesus chaim muttered his stomach tried to turn over he wouldnt let it what do we do carroll sounded as lost and horrified as chaim felt if you saw your father like thatwhat can we do try and patch him up try and get him back to the docs maybe they can pour some blood into him chaim answered republican doctors could do more with transfusions than just about anybody that was one of the few places where the republic worked wellif the crack mobile unit was anywhere within a few kilometers anyhow they used their wound dressings they used strips of cloth from their uniforms and from those of the dead men who didnt care any more one of the corpses had a miraculously unbroken syringe in a belt pouch chaim jabbed wolff with itit was the only painkiller he was likely to get wolff was a big mansixtwo easywhich only made things worse manhandling him over to a communications trench that went back was no fun for chaim or mike carroll or the wounded abe lincoln officer hauling him across bare broken ground and praying the snipers didnt get lucky would have been even worsechaim supposed they were heading back instead of sideways when wolff stopped screaming and asked will i die he sounded amazingly calm the morphine must have hit him all at once i dont think so milt chaim answered and hoped he wasnt lying well get you patched up you bet mike agreed a red cross flag flew over an aid tent in his bad spanish chaim asked is the blood truck close quien sabe a harriedlooking male nurse answered he sounded like a fruit but that was the least of chaims worries and he did gasp when he found out who the wounded abe lincoln was el lobo madre de dios he crossed himself by the way people went dashing out of the aid tent chaim got the idea theyd track down the blood truck as fast as they could he wondered whether they would have done the same if he came in wounded actually he didnt wonder he knew damn well they wouldnt and he had a hard time getting pissed off about it he was just a soldado he had his uses but their were plenty more like him milton wolff was el lobo if he stayed out of action long the lincolns wouldnt be the same and while the rest of the world might have forgotten the spanish civil war it remained brutally real to the people who went on fighting it hansulrich rudel was getting sick of huddling in muddy slit trenches this one was in western belgium it was two in the morning and british bombers were overhead again by the roar of their engines they werent very far overhead either raf whitleys and hampdens couldnt fly very high no matter how much their pilots might wish they could and at night it hardly mattered luftwaffe night fighters found enemy planes more by luck than any other way when german bombers struck england under cover of darkness the rafs night fighters had the same problem bombs whistled down some of them landed close enough for the bursts to make rudels ears hurt blast could do horrible things to you even when fragments and flame didnt he buried his face against the trench wall hed come out looking like the end man in a minstrel show but he didnt care as long as he came out more explosions and the rending crash of something metal going to smithereens all at once goddamn flying suitcases somebody a couple of meters away said ja hansulrich nodded smelling mold and damp hampdens were a lot like luftwaffe bombers though more slabsided than any of themhence the nickname whitleys were bigger slower and clumsier but carried more bombs they could take a lot of punishmentand needed to because they got it rudel wouldnt have wanted to fly one in the daytime the british had tried that but not for long well the luftwaffe wasnt sending stukas over england any more either some things cost more than they were worth even biplane gladiators were dangerous to the german divebombers as for hurricanes and the newer spitfires the real trouble was hurricanes and spitfires chewed up bfs almost as easily as they mulched stukas bfs held their own against the top raf fighters but they had short range and couldnt linger long over england and when they had to escort the s as well as the bombers they couldnt mix it up with the enemy the way they should from everything rudel had heard nobody in the luftwaffe higherups had dreamt the would show such weaknesses war gave all kinds of surprisesincluding the nasty ones a few more bombs fell then things eased off the drone of enemy engines faded in the west hansulrich spat to get the taste of loam out of his mouth well he said brightly that was fun several people in the trench told him what he could do with his fun somebody who knew his classics quoted goethes gotz von berlichen du kannst mich mal am arsch lechen even if it was poetry lick my ass got the point across he climbed out of the trench something was burning a stuka in a halfblasted revetment the orange flames sent a dim flickering light across the airstrip got to put that out a flyer said if the damned englishmen see it theyre liable to come back groundcrew men started playing a hose in the ju that would take a while to do any good gasoline and oil liked to keep burning and the ammo in the stukas machine guns started cooking off the popping seemed absurdly cheerful hope none of those rounds hits anybody hansulrich said jesus maria somebody saida catholic by the oath thatd be all we need somebody else was exhausted relentlessly pragmatic or both only thing i hope is i can get back to sleep amen the catholic said sure enough he sounded like a bavarian the burning divebomber gave just enough light to let hansulrich have an easy time going back to his tent he lay down on the cotand then remembered his face was muddy if he hadnt been a ministers son he might have quoted gotz von berlichen himself being one he knew that thinking the words was as bad as saying them he sometimes swore in the heat of action but never in cold bloodand he always regretted it afterwards when he got up and came out the next morning the fellow in the next tent greeted him with whos the nigger funny manfred fun ny hansulrich said you should take it to the movies go drink some milk preachers son manfred jeered youll feel better hansulrichs hands balled into fists he took a step toward the other flyer enough both of you a more senior officer said do you want to get tossed in the clink save that scheisse for the enemy hear me reluctantly manfred nodded even more reluctantly so did hansulrich he was sick of being the white crow in the squadron he couldnt even say that somebody would have told him he was the white crow because he drank so much milk if hed changed his ways and drunk schnapps everybody would have liked him the notion didnt cross his mind other people razzed him about his dirty face but not so viciously as manfred had some other pilots and rear gunners had also got muddy though none quite so muddy as rudel while they ate a grunting bulldozer repaired damage to the airstrip german bombersspades and flying pencilsdroned past overhead bound for england bfs would protect the heinkels and dorniers from raf fighters and they could protect themselves better than stukas all the same hansulrich wondered how much longer the luftwaffe would go over the enemy island by day nighttime bombing was less accurate but also much less expensive he wasnt sorry not to cross the north sea again he counted himself lucky to have made it back the times hed tried it maybe the twinengine bombers would have better luck maybe his own mission lay to the southwest the french were bringing materiel up from paris to the front that still shielded their capital from the wehrmacht s onslaught if the luftwaffe could smash up those trucks and trains enemy troops would get less of what they needed to keep up the fight ready he asked sergeant dieselhorst the man in the rear seat looked at him nah ill bug out as soon as we get airborne rudels ears heated me and my big mouth lets go get em now youre talking dieselhorst said bombed up gassed up their stuka rumbled down the runway hansulrich pulled back on the stick the stukas nose lifted the plane would never be pretty though the design was fairly new plenty of aircraft looked more modern the nonretractable landing gear made the ju seem older than it was but the beast got the job done next to that what were looks a few black puffs of smoke appeared in the sky as the stuka squadron crossed over the front line but only a few this wasnt the kind of barrage that would have greeted the germans over englandnowhere close the french didnt seem as serious about the war as the british but they hadnt rolled bellyup yet either we just have to keep thumping them till they do hansulrich thought was that river glittering in the sun the marne hansulrich thought so the farthest the kaisers armies reached in the last war the wehrmacht was almost there too though it had started rolling in dead of winter and had to take out holland as well as belgium silver sausages gleamed above paris barrage balloons the english used them over their towns too they didnt keep places from getting bombed they did keep divebombers from stooping on targets hansulrich shuddered imagining what would happen if he tore off the stukas wing against a mooring cable hed feel like an idiotbut not for long well he didnt have to worry about that anyhownot yet the squadrons targets lay in front of paris captain mehlers voice filled his earphones i think thats what we want down below the new squadron leader said lets hit em here we go hansulrich said into the speaking tube warning sergeant dieselhorst jawohl the gunner and radioman said i was listening too hansulrich tipped the ju over into a dive acceleration slammed him back in his seat it would be trying to tear dieselhorst out of his hansulrich had never heard of a rear gunners straps and harness failinga good thing too that wasnt pretty to think about down below the highway swelled yes that was a truck convoy as the shriek from the stukas sirens mounted soldiers started bailing out and running like ants too late fools too late everything had a red tinge rudel was right on the edge of blacking out he pulled the bombrelease lever then yanked back on the stick as hard as he could to bring the stuka out of its deadly plunge behind him the poilus would just have discovered hell on earth you all right sergeant dieselhorsts voice said he wasnt sure about himself let alone rudel ithink so hansulrich made himself nod as they usually did after a steep dive his thoughts needed a few seconds to come back to normal he muzzily recalled the stukas in spain that had crashed before the luftwaffe installed that gadget to pull out of dives if pilots didnt he fought for altitude hed got up to meters when dieselhorsts machine gun started chattering dodge the gunner yelled french fighter hansulrich threw the big clumsy ju around the sky in ways the manufacturer never intended an opencockpit dewoitine monoplane zoomed pastobsolescent but flying a could have hacked it out of the air with the greatest of ease it still outclassed a stuka though here it came for another pass hansulrich saw the skeleton with a harrow painted on its dark green flank the machine guns firing through the grim reapers propeller disk blazed rudel jinked againright into the stream of bullets his engine coughed and quit and started smoking a round punched through both sides of the cockpit in front of him before he had time to blink weve got to get out he yelled to dieselhorst praying the sergeant would answer i was hoping youd be here to tell me that dieselhorst said sounds good to me are we still inside french territory or did we make it back to our own lines only one way to find out rudel eyed the gauges dont waste time eitherwere losing altitude he yanked back on the canopy the stukas glasshouse had two movable parts one for the pilot the other for the gunnerradioman hansulrich hoped the bullet that almost nailed him hadnt messed up the track along which his part slid he breathed a sigh of relief when it retracted smoothly enough wind tore at him it didnt want to let him get out he fought his way clear of the cockpit a quick glance told him sergeant dieselhorst was already gone rudel threw himself into space he missed smashing himself against the stukas upthrust tail the first risk every pilot bailing out took then he counted down from ten and yanked the ripcord wham the blow he took when the chute opened made him gray out for a second the same as divebombing would have done he came to faster than he would have pulling out of a dive though he looked around there was another canopy below him and to the left dieselhorst hadnt hit the tail either good back in the last war pilots hadnt worn parachutes the powers that be thought having them would turn men into cowards soldiers had gone into that war without steel helmets too theyd learned better there sooner than they had with chutes the luftwaffe model still left something to be desired hansulrich dropped faster than he would have likedbut not nearly so fast as if the chute hadnt opened he couldnt steer very well either he bent his legs and tried to relax as the ground rushed up at him he sprained an ankle anyway but didnt think he broke it he used his belt knife to cut away the canopy before it dragged him into some trees he couldnt see where sergeant dieselhorst had come down hold it right there shithead or youre fucking dead meat somebody yelled hansulrich needed a moment to realize he understood the obscenitylaced command it was in german hed landed among friends happily he raised his hands im a stuka pilot he shouted back my number twos around here somewhere three men in fieldgray cautiously emerged from those trees get under cover you dummkopf one of them said theres frenchies only a few hundred meters from here hansulrich tried to stand his ankle didnt want to let him my leg he said one of the soldiers had a machine pistol he covered the other two who were riflemen they trotted forward and each got one of rudels arms over his shoulder well take you to an aid station one of them said they lugged him back to the woods a knock on the door up till now sarah goldman hadnt known something so ordinary could be so terrifying the ordinary police thumped the gestapo pounded she could guess who was there from the different knocks and she proved right most of the time if only proving right would have done her the least bit of good this knock didnt seem quite so frightening so sarah told herself anyway as she went to the door maybe she was trying to find hope whether it was really there or not she braced herself to face some scowling ss man all in black but no oh frau breisach she exclaimed in glad surprise even if wilhelmina breisach liked to grumble about every little thing the people across the street had always got on well with the goldmans till the nazis started making things tough on jews and naturally no one from the neighborhood seemed eager to stop by after saul didwhat he did better to pretend you didnt have any idea who those people were than to have to explain why you wanted anything to do with them so sarah hesitated before asking wont you come in no thank you please excuse me but id better not frau breisach shook her head she was a plump reasonably pretty blond a few years younger than sarahs mother now she thrust an envelope into sarahs hand this was addressed to us but i think it may be for you she didnt wait for any answer from sarah but scurried away as if hoping no one had seen her come she probably was hoping exactly that too thank you sarah said but she was talking to frau breisachs back she closed the door scratching her head what was that all about her father asked i dont know then sarah looked down at the envelope and she did ice and fire rippled through her fractions of a heartbeat apart she recognized the handwriting on the address i think maybe youd better have a look at this mother you too samuel and hanna goldman came out to see why she was fussing without a word she handed her father the envelope behind his glasses his eyes widened so did those of sarahs mother neither of them said much they didnt know the gestapo had put microphones in their house but they also didnt know it hadnt in adolf hitlers germany in they didnt want to take any foolish chances sarahs father took the letter out of the envelope sarah and her mother crowded close to read it with him hello uncle aunt and cousin elisabeth it said just a note to let you know basic training is going well dont listen to the rubbish you hear from some people we get plenty to eat the work is hard and we are often tired but this is no strength through joy cruise we are getting ready for war i may end up in panzers the drill sergeants say i have the knack for them i hope so they hurt the reich s enemies more than anything else does i think i must go nowmore drills stay well heil hitler the scrawled signature was adalbert sarah and her father and mother all eyed one another that was sauls handwriting how in the world did he sarah began and left it right there he must have got some identity papers samuel goldman whispered and when he did the professors chuckle was most unprofessorial well who would guess to look for him there when sarah thought of it like that she started to laugh the nazis wouldnt believe saul had joined the wehrmacht even if he and father both tried to do it right after the war broke out to the thugs who ruled germany jews were nothing but a pack of cowards and so chances were theyd go on combing through the sad shabby civilian world simply because they couldnt imagine a jew would deliberately expose himself to danger mother plucked the letter and the envelope from fathers fingers she carried the papers off to the fireplace in the front room no matter what the gestapo said they werent going to report this no indeed jews got only cheap smoky brown coal for their heating and cooking needs and precious little of that the fire on the grate was more a token gesture than anything else even so the envelope and letter flamed for a moment then curled to gray ash there mother sounded pleased with herself thats taken care of anyhow so it is father nodded i wonder how he managed to his voice trailed away again several pictures formed in sarahs mind maybe one of the fellows on sauls football club had connections and got him papers maybe after he fled munster he went drinking with somebody named adalbert and stole the identity documents he needed or maybe he ran into this adalbert walking along a country road and knocked him over the head that would make saul a real criminal not just somebody whod snapped because a gang boss wouldnt treat him like a human being the thought should have horrified sarah somehow it didnt her brother never would have done anything like that if the nazis hadnt pushed him over the line never i hope hell be all right mother said worriedly you can tell hes not an ordinary german after all father followed that faster than sarah did jews arent the only ones who get circumcised he said sometimes its medically necessary what i wonder is how frau breisach knew that letter was really for us somebody must have recognized the handwriting sarah had no trouble figuring that out saul used to go over there all the time to help the breisach kids with their homeworkback when you could without getting into too much trouble i mean i think he was sweet on hildegarde breisach for a while but she didnt go on yes but her father said heavily i wouldnt have minded intermarriage very much the allwise allknowing and allpowerful stateyou could hear the stress he gave the wordis a different story and hildegarde would have been insane to take the chance if the state really were allwise and allpowerful frau breisach would have taken sauls letter straight to the gestapo mother said some people still remember what human decency means never mind human decency the breisachs know us father said that counts for more id say i wouldnt bet a pfenning that theyd help some strange jew but weve lived across the street from them since the last war we arent strangerswere neighbors people first jews second you might say all over germany gentiles are probably going well i dont have a good word to say about most jews but abraham down the street hes all right i wonder how much good it will do sarah said some anyhow father nodded toward the now anonymous ashes in the fireplace and im jealous of your brother for heavens sake why mother got that out before sarah could he made it into the wehrmacht father answered i fought for germany before i would have done it again i am a german dammit whether the nazis want to let me be one or not isnt getting shot once enough for germany mother asked pointedly if i hadnt the goons would have treated us even worse than they did father said hitler says jews havent got any gutsbut he cant say that about frontline soldiers from the last war so we have it better than most jewsnot good but better oh joy sarah said in a hollow voice if this is better i dont want worse father nodded solemnly youd better not the difference between bad and worse is much bigger than the difference between good and better so when you think about the difference between better and worse he sounded like someone who knew what he was talking about chances were he did what had life in the trenches been like sarah had read all quiet on the western front who hadnt shed seen the movie too but her father had really gone through all those things and maybe more besides it was probably like the difference between reading about kissing and kissing only more so mother started to laugh whats funny sarah asked she sure didnt see anything still in a low voice to foil the microphones that might not be there at all her mother answered our only sons just gone into the wehrmacht and im happy happy he has a better chance of staying safe there than he would if he were still running around the countryside somewhere sarah laughed too when you put it that way it was funny her father put things in perspective the way he usually did if you have to go that far for a laugh youve got more tsuris than you need he hardly ever dropped a yiddish word into his german it would have made him seem less german more openly jewish it might even have made him seem that way to himself sarah stared at him now she understood tsuris of courseunderstood what the word meant and these days also understood the thing we do have more tsuris than we need mother said neither sarah nor samuel goldman tried to tell her she was wrong it could have been worse though if the gestapo caught up with saul after he clouted that work bosswhat would they have done to him whatever it was sarah made herself think about something else do you suppose the british bombers will come over tonight she said that was something else all right but not a better something else let them her father sounded almost gay bombs dont care if were jews bombs can fall on gestapo headquarters too alevai two yiddish words from him in two minutes what was the world coming to of course the gestapo men can run into a shelter sarah said so what even that doesnt always help father said and he was right sarah felt like a german too if not so strongly as father did but she had trouble believing any german would cry if a bunch of gestapo men got blown up chapter sixteen german artillery crashed down on the french position luc harcourt dug as hard as he could trying to carve a cave into the front wall of his foxhole if he could manage that fragments would have a hard time biting himbarring a direct hit of course he wished he hadnt had that last thought but it did make him dig faster than ever the ground was muddyalmost too muddy to let him make the shelter he wanted a cavein could kill him too and much more ignominiously than a shell would have but artillery was a worse risk five months of war had taught luc to fear artillery more than anything but tanks and what were tanks but artillery on tracks luc almost had the hole he wanted when the shelling let up as suddenly as it had begun he knew what that meant his entrenching tool went back on his belt he grabbed his rifle theyll be coming any second sergeant demange yelled from a trench near the foxhole for the raw replacements and the idiots in his section make em pay for it thats all we dont have a hell of a lot of room to back up in your sergeant is right that was lieutenant marquetluc thought that was his name anyhow hed replaced the previous company commander a few days earlier after captain remond stopped some shrapnel with his chest hed been alive when he went off to the aid station now who could say the lieutenant seemed brave enough he did like to hear himself talk though three times in a lifetime the boches have attacked paris they took it once to our shame we held them the last time to our everlasting glory which would you rather have now my friends all luc wanted was to come through alive and in once piece the only shame he worried about was letting his buddies down they mattered to him paris next to the dirty smelly frightened men alongside of whom he fought paris wasnt so much of a much smallarms fire picked up the germans knew what was going on as well as the frenchmen they were trying to murder they wanted to get into the french fieldworks as fast as they could while the poilus were still woozy from the barrage if they do that im dead the thought was enough to make luc stick his head up and bring his rifle to his shoulder a bullet cracked past too close for comfort he wouldnt have had to worry about that if hed stayed all nicely huddled in his young cave no but then he would have had to worry about other things sure as hell the germans were loping forward the men who ran straight up and down had less experience than the ones who folded themselves as small as they could most of the boches did know enough to hit the dirt or dive behind something when french machine guns started chattering the germans never got to meaux the last time around that meant all the damage in town was brand new the thirteenthcentury cathedral lay in ruins a couple of kilometers behind luc guns and stukas cared nothing for antiquitiesand the french werent shy about placing observers in the steeples if the bastards in fieldgray kept pressing forward pretty soon french guns would start shelling meauxand the boches would have put men with binoculars up in high places as if thinking of french guns had called them up several batteries of quickfiring s started banging away at the germans theyd slaughtered the boches by the thousands in and all through the last war things were tougher now german s outranged them and delivered bigger shells the enemy knew better than to advance in tightpacked ranks too but when you needed to drop a lot of artillery on some unlucky place in a hurry s were still hard to beat german medics in red cross smocks and armbands ran around gathering up the wounded luc left them alone as much as he could war was tough enough without making it worse he thought so anyhow a medic fell and then another one another german wearing the red cross emblem pointed angrily toward the french lineright about toward where sergeant demange was lurking a moment later that medic ducked which meant a bullet hadnt missed him by much he could take a hinthe dove behind a battered stone wall naughty sergeant luc called sos your mother demange answered which wasnt exactly a ringing denial of anything luc was in no position to tell him what to do he had other things on his mind anyway have we got any tanks in the neighborhood do they sure havent seen any of ours the sergeant said since luc hadnt either he asked the next important question have we got any antitank guns sure as hell hope so demange answered that was also less encouraging than luc wished it were meaux lay in a loop of the marne maybe the germans were having trouble getting their armor across the river theyd managed farther east with far fewer problems than he wished theyd hadprobably far fewer than they should have had with luck the allies were figuring out how to make those crossings tougher without luck the boches were feinting here so they could knock the crap out of the french and english defenders somewhere else even without tanks they hadnt given up in front of meaux more artillery came in this barrage precisely aimed at the french forward positions luc cowered in his hole while hell fell all around him up sergeant demange screamed up you gutless assholes theyre coming luc didnt want to come up shell fragments did dreadful things but he didnt want to get shot or bayoneted in his foxhole either the germans aimed to make the french keep their heads down so theyd make easy meat the french couldnt let them impose their will on the combatluc supposed he came up firing a german had crawled to no more than thirty meters away he had a potatomasher grenade in his right hand luc shot him before he could fling it heilige scheisse screamed the soldier in the coalscuttle helmet he clutched at himself he must not have pulled the grenades fuse cord because it didnt go off after he dropped it then french machine guns opened up one of them from a spot where luc hadnt known his side had a machine gun the boches hadnt known it was there either several of them fell others ran back toward the river luc would have done the same thing in their boots flesh and blood had limits and facing machinegun fire out in the open went beyond them the german luc had shot lay where hed gone down he wasnt dead he kept thrashing around and yelling and swearing make him shut up sergeant demange called either blow his head off or go out there and bring him back neither possibility appealed to luc killing a wounded man in cold blood felt like murder if he were lying there wounded he wouldnt want the germans taking pot shots at him but if he went out there to get the boche other soldiers in fieldgray might nail him he knew he had only a few seconds to make up his mind demange wouldnt hesitate longer than that before shooting the german himself he wouldnt have second thoughts about it afterward either je suis dans le merde luc muttered up shit creek or not he had to do something he climbed out of the foxhole and crawled toward the wounded boche firing had slacked off that could end any second as he knew too well none of the few rounds flying about came closethe germans werent aiming at him anyway ill take you in he called to the soldier in fieldgray hoping the fellow understood french well fix you up if we can merci the man answered in gutturally accented french hurts i bet luc said the bullet had torn up the germans left leg can you climb up on top of me ill try the boche did it he felt as if the fellow weighed a tonnehe was a bigger man than luc and weighted down with boots and helmet and equipment slowlythe only way he couldluc crawled back toward the french line seeing what he was doing the germans paid him the courtesy of aiming away from him other hands reached out to pull the wounded man off him the german groaned as they got him down into the trenches luc had never been so glad to get under cover again himself whew he said i felt naked out there you did good kid sergeant demange said and handed him a gitane thanks luc leaned close for a light you didnt go out there pretty damn quick i was gonna plug the motherfucker demange said yeah i figured thats why i went lucs cheeks hollowed as he sucked in harsh smoke maybe theyll learn something off him the noncom said hell sing like a goddamn canary and sergeants they know stuff not without pride he tapped his own chest was he a sergeant i didnt notice luc said demange rolled his eyes grinning luc added if id known that i wouldve shot him for sure funny man demange said scornfully you got that crappy hash mark on your sleeve so you think youre entitled to be a goddamn funny man sergeant if it meant id come through the war without getting shot id never make another joke the rest of my life luc promised oh yeah sergeant demange said lucs head bobbed up and down as if it were on springs demange spat out a tiny butt crushed it underfoot and lit a fresh gitane then he returned to the business at hand well you dont need to worry about that on account of it doesnt luc already knew as much all the same he wished demange hadnt spelled it out anastas mouradian was drunk yes a blizzard howled outside even so a proper soviet officer wasnt supposed to do any such thing sergei yaroslavsky knew that perfect well he would have been angrier at mouradian if he werent drunk himself they couldnt fly they had plenty of vodka what were they going to do not drink it try as he would sergei couldnt come up with a good reason for leaving it alone ivan kuchkov was bound to be drinking with his fellow enlisted men if the chimp got smashed the rest of the aircrew should too it showed solidarity between enlisted men and officers it also showed that neither enlisted men nor officers had anything better to do when they couldnt get an sb off the ground to save their lives if hitlerite bombers show up now if we have to take shelter outside weve got plenty of antifreeze in our blood sergei said never mind hitlerite bombers what about hitlerite soldiers when mouradian was sober he spoke excellent russian he stayed fluent when he got drunk but his armenian accent turned thick enough to slice sergei laughed and laughed when he got drunk everything was funny where would hitlerite soldiers come from out of the sky with parachutes like they did in holland and belgium anastas looked around the inside of the tent his eyes big and round like an owls he might have expect nazi parachutists to pop up any minute now that owlish stare only made sergei laugh harder than ever he looked around the inside of the tent too enough of the wind outside got in to make the flame from the kerosene lamp flicker that wasnt why his wide highcheekboned face registered dismay were out of pelmeni and pickled mushrooms whered they go mouradian patted his stomach good not spicy enough but good being a southerner he liked everything full of fire as far as sergei was concerned the mushrooms and the meat dumplings were fine this way russians had all kinds of snacks that went with vodka even a halfskilled cook at a forward airstrip could do a decent job with some of them we had a big plate of them sergei said sadly the plate was still there but for a couple of crumbs from the pelmeni it was bare sergei sighed he pointed at anastas not even the fucking germans would be crazy enough to drop parachutists in this weather god shouldnt have been crazy enough to make this weather mouradian must have been very drunk or he wouldnt have talked about god so seriously it gave sergei a hold on him which wasnt something anybody in the ussr wanted to give anyone else of course there was something close to an evenmoney chance neither of them would remember anything about this come morning even without dumplings or mushrooms sergei raised his tumbler za stalina to stalin anastas echoed they both drank the vodka was no better than it had to be it went down as if sergei were swallowing the lighted kerosene lamp the really good stuff slid down your throat smooth as a kiss then exploded in your stomach like a kg bomb but this got you there smooth or not sergei sighed if it was harsh now hed feel it worse in the morning the good stuff didnt make you think elephants in hobnailed boots were marching on top of your skull we have aspirins he asked somewhere mouradian said vaguely then he brightened well have more vodka da that cheered sergei up too at least a little another dose of what made you feel bad could make you feel better he reached for the bottle again if he drank it now hed feel better right away leave me some anastas said leave me some sir sergei said the drunker you got the more important military discipline seemedunless of course it didnt he passed mouradian the bottle they drank till there was very little left to drink they would have drunk till nothing was left to drink but they both fell asleep first getting up in the morning was as bad as yaroslavsky had known it would be or maybe a little worse the first thing he did was drink half the remaining vodka he would have drunk all of it but anastas snatched the bottle out of his hands to each according to his needs the armenian croaked and no one in the ussr no matter how hung over dared quarrel with unadulterated marx fortunately the aspirins turned up sergei dryswallowed three of them mouradian took four as sour as sergeis stomach already was the aspirins felt like a flamethrower in there if he belched he figured he could incinerate the whole airstrip mouradian didnt look or sound much happier breakfast he said the mere thought made sergei groan then anastas added theyll have teacoffee too maybe well maybe sergei peeled back the tent flap and looked out the sun shone brilliantly off snow he squinted at the alarming landscape dont want to bleed to death through my eyeballs he muttered tell me about it mouradian said fervently both being brave men they made it to the field kitchen shchi cabbage soupseemed safe enough to sergei anastas stuck to plain brown bread the cooks had one battered samovar full of tea another full of coffee after getting outside of some of thatand after the aspirins took holdsergei decided hed live eventually he would decide he wanted to the radio blared out music mouradian turned it down sergei would have loved to turn it off but he didnt dare people might think you didnt want to listen to the news if you didnt want to listen to the splendid achievements of the glorious soviet state people would wonder why not some of the people who wondered would have nkvd connections too and youd be heading for a camp faster than you could blink nobody complained about turning down the radio though several other men eating breakfast had redtracked eyes sallow skin and a hangdog expression when it was snowing at an isolated airstrip what were you going to do besides drink the song ended an announcer gabbled about the overfulfillment of production norms at factories in smolensk magnitogorsk and vladivostok not easy to imagine three more widely separated places thus despite the efforts of fascists and other reactionaries prosperity spreads throughout this great bulwark of the proletariat the announcer said sergei had nothing against the bulwark of the proletariat in his present fragile state though he didnt much want to hear about it he made himself seem attentive even so as he would have during a dull lecture in school the penalty for obvious boredom then would have been a rap on the knuckles or maybe a swat on the backside he might pay more now music returned he didnt have to seem to be listening to that so closely he couldnt ignore it altogether however or show he didnt like it it wouldnt have gone out without some commissars approval without the states approval in other words and if the state approved citizens who knew what was good for them needed to do the same at the top of the hour a different announcer came on the air this fellow sounded better educated than the joker whod been bragging about production norms and now the news the man said several people with red air force light blue on their collar tabs perked up news from around the world mattered soviet forces continue to punish the polish reactionaries and the nazi bandits who support them the announcer crowed over the past several days soviet infantrymen have driven another twenty kilometers deeper into poland knowledgeable officers report that enemy resistance is beginning to crumble nobody said anything nobody even raised an eyebrow sergei didnt think anyone actually fighting the poles and germans believed their resistance was crumbling he knew damn well he didnt that particular item had to be aimed at bucking up civilian morale hundreds if not thousands of kilometers from the front foreign commissar litvinov has protested to the japanese government about its troop buildup between puppet manchukuo and progressive siberia the announcer went on hearing that made sergeis headache get worse this borderland between the ussr and poland was nowhere in particular he tried to imagine fighting a war at the eastern edge of siberia that was nowhere in particular with capital n and p the only reason either the soviet union or japan cared about it was because of strategy other than that the whole area could go hang vladivostok was the ussrs window on the pacific it was a window frozen shut several months a year but never mind that vladivostok also sat on the end of the worlds longest supply line it was the place where the transsiberian railroad finally stopped it wasnt a million kilometers from moscowit only seemed that way what would happen if the little yellow monkeys who lived in japan tried to seize the railroad and cut the towns lifeline how long before vladivostok withered how long before the japanese could just walk in sergei was too young to remember the siege of port arthur and the russojapanese war as a whole but he knew about them few soviet citizens didnt even though the tsars corrupt regime was to blame for the russian defeat it still rankled brooding about it made him read some of what the radio newscaster was saying when he started paying attention again the man was saying and the french government has declared that the front is paris the french say they are determined to fight in the capital itself and to fight on beyond it even if it falls they did not have to do this during the last war whether they will live up to their promises only time will tell if theyd done better by czechoslovakia when the war started they might not be in this mess now anastas mouradian said theyll probably expect us to pull their chestnuts off the fire for them too too fucking bad if they do weve got enough worries of our own sergei said german radio reports that adolf hitler has indignantly denied any military coup was attempted against him the announcer said reliable sources inside germany report that at least four prominent german generals have not been seen for several weeks however no one eating breakfast said anything to that no one imagined anything could be safe to say no one even wanted to look at anyone else the look on your face could betray you too soviet generalsfar more than four of themstarted disappearing in like some of the old bolsheviks who started getting it in the neck at the same time a few confessed to treason in show trials before they were executed others were simply put to death or vanished into the camps or justdisappeared it wasnt only generals either officers of all ranks were purged so were bureaucrats of all ranks and so were doctors and professors and anyone who seemed dangerous to anyone else now the same thing was happening in germany sergei had sometimes thought that communists and nazis were mirror images of each other one sides left being the others right and conversely hed never shared that thought with anyone had he tried he would put his life in the other persons hands he wished the idea had never crossed his mind just having certain notions was deadly dangerous they might show up on your face without your even realizing it and if they did you were dead or maybe worse so did the enemy have to worry about the kinds of things that had convulsed the soviet union for the past couple of years good sergei thought if both sides were screwed up the same way the one he was on looked to have a better chance ludwig rothe lit a gitane hed got from a german infantryman whod taken a pack from a dead french soldier it was strong as the devil but it tasted like real tobacco not the hay and ersatz that went into german cigarettes these days have another one of those sergeant fritz bittenfeld asked plaintively you look like a hungry baby blackbird trying to get a worm from its mama ludwig said fritz opened his mouth very wide as if he really were a nestling laughing ludwig gave the panzer driver a gitane chirp theo hossbach said flapping his arms chirp he got a cigarette too theyd all smoked them down to tiny butts when a blackshirt whod been prowling around the panzer park finally got to them can i talk to you boys for a minute he asked a little too casually his shoulder straps were plain gray with two gold pips that made him the ss equivalent of a captain how could you say no you couldnt whats up sir ludwig tried to keep his voice as normal as he could you men have served under major koral for some timeisnt that so the ss man said ja ludwig said fritz and theo both nodded no harm in admitting that not when the blackshirt could check their records and find out for himself that koral had led the panzer battalion since the war started all right the ss man said in nowweregettingsomewhere tones how often have you heard him express disloyalty toward the fuhrer and the reich disloyalty ludwig echoed he had trouble believing his ears but the ss man nodded importantly he seemed as full of his own righteousness as the more disagreeable kind of preacher picking his words with care ludwig said sir you do know dont you that major korals already been wounded in action twice yes yes the ss man nodded impatiently as if that were of no account to him it probably wasnt he went on im not talking about his military behavior im talking about his political behavior you idiot his gaze added youre supposed to know things like that without being told sergeant rothe bristled at so obviously being thought a moron but then he chuckled to himself if the blackshirt figured him for a dummkopf a dummkopf he would be by god sir the major just gives me orders he doesnt waste his time talking politics with noncoms whats going on anyway theo sounded as innocent as an unweaned baby his dreamy features let him get away with that more easily than ludwig could have the ss man didnt hesitate before answering you will have heard that certain wehrmacht generals betrayed their country by viciously plotting against the fuhrer ludwig had heard that all right from hitlers own lips telling the ss man as much struck him as the very worst of bad ideas gott im himmel he exclaimed as if it were a complete surprise i heard it ja but i thought it was only enemy propaganda beside him theo and fritz nodded its true all right the blackshirt said they were disgraces to the uniform they wore disgraces to the volk disgraces to the reich and so we must purify the army of all their associates and of everyone who might have shared their vicious views now do you understand why i am inquiring about major koral he wouldnt do anything like that fritz said he wouldnt put up with anybody else who did either theo nodded again thats right i think so too ludwig said you might be surprised you might be very surprised indeed the ss man said weve found treason in some places where no one would have thought to look for it if these generals hadnt disgraced themselves if ludwig hadnt heard it from the fuhrer he would have wondered what that meant he did wonder what the ss and the gestapo were up to now had they sniffed out more real treason or had they discovered it regardless of whether it was really there he didnt ask this fellow that kind of question that it could occur to him might be plenty to mark him as disloyal he did ask why do you think major koral might be mixed up in thisthis scheisse scheisse it is the ss man agreed he pulled a scrap of paper from the right beast pocket of his tunic he haslet me seea long history of association with general fritsche and also with general halder he may have been a social democrat before the record is not completely clear about that but it is worrisome and one of his cousins was formerly married to a jew if fritsche and halder were two of the generals whod tried to overthrow the fuhrer that might mean something or of course it might not ludwig had a long history of association with his cats but hed never wanted to eat mice himself the rest didnt seem to mean much the social democrats had been the biggest party in germany during the weimar republic they were about as exclusive as a blizzard ludwig had no great use for jews but he thought one of his cousins was married to one too he hoped to god the ss would never dig that out and use it against him sorry not to be more help sir he said insincerely like the sergeant said major korals always been brave in combat theo added didnt he win the iron cross first class didnt they put him up for the ritterkreuz the iron cross first classjust like the fuhrer ludwig thoughtone more thing he knew better than to say out loud but the two awards werent really comparable lots of officers got the iron cross first class now for a common soldier in the kaisers army to have won it the last time around was much more remarkable even the knights cross in this war wasnt the same the ss man looked unhappy enough at theos mild questions that has nothing to do with anything he said stiffly if you recall anything suspicious about him report it to your superiors at once at once do you hear he tramped off his back ramrod straight jesus christ on roller skates fritz said i think id sooner go to the dentist than get another little visit like that you can spread that on toast and call it butter theo agreed ludwig supposed it was agreement anyhow the radioman came out with the strangest things sometimes fritz bittenfeld found a new question should we go tell the major hes got hounds sniffing on his trail if we see him in the field sure ludwig said but those fucking goonsve got to be keeping an eye on him if we go blab what happens to us we stick our dicks in the sausage grinder thats what oh that smarts theo said in shrill falsetto ludwig and fritz both laughed better to laugh than to grab at yourself which was what ludwigs figure of speech made him want to do assuming it was a figure of speech of course with the ss you could never be sure and if they did it for realludwig wanted to grab at himself again bitterly fritz said its a hell of a note when you find out combats not the worst thing that can happen to you yeah its a hell of a note all right ludwig said you going to tell me it isnt true i can deal with the czechs and the french and the english i can even deal with the russians if i have to my old man fought in the east the last time around yeah i can cope with thatbet your ass i can but heaven help me if ive got to try and handle the cocksuckers who think theyre on my side he kept his voice down no one but his buddies could possibly have heard him only after the words were out of his mouth did he wonder if he could trust fritz and theo they all trusted one another with their lives on the battlefield but political matters were differentand as fritz had said worse if he and the driver and the radioman couldnt trust one anotherludwig swore under his breath this was the nastiest thing the ss did right here if you werent sure you could count on people whod already saved your bacon more times than you could remember then what you were screwed that was what were as bad as the russians you know theo said which was too close for comfort to what ludwig was thinking the radio operator went on pretty soon im going to start praying for cloudy weather what the hell is that supposed to mean ludwig demanded well if my shadow isnt there i dont have to worry that itll betray me to the gestapo when im not looking theo answered that either made no sense at all or altogether too much maybe it isnt there because its off betraying you to the gestapo later ludwig wondered about himself at the time what he said seemed logical enoughto him anyhow it didnt faze theo either nothing would surprise me any more he said shadows arent to be trusted no matter how much you feed em they never get any fatter than you do and have you ever seen one that wasnt as dark as a nigger even when it was walking on a snowbank fritz looked from one of his crewmates to the other i think youve both gone round the bend he declared zu befehl theo said at your service he clicked his heels as if he were a prussian grandee or an austrian gentleman with more noble blood than he knew what to do with a battery of french s near meaux started shelling the panzer park at extreme long range only a few shells came close enough to drive the germans into the holes theyd dug they had dug holes of course whenever they stopped for more than a few minutes they dug anyone would have thought wehrmacht menand their french and english counterpartsdescended from moles rather than monkeys wonder if the ss shithead has enough sense to take cover fritz remarked nobodyll miss him if he doesnt ludwig said with a little luck even the frenchmen wont miss him fritz and theo both groaned neither tried to tell him he was wrong after a while when the french guns didnt blow up any ammunition dumps or show other tangible evidence of success they eased off the panzer crews came up above ground and there was the blackshirt a pistol in hand leading major koral to a waiting auto with a swastika flag flying above its right fender face pale and set the major got in the car sped away back toward germany what is this world coming to ludwig wondered out loud nothing good fritz answered dammit weve still got a war to fight so does major koral theo added koral would likely lose his and who would get the blame if the wehrmacht also lost its chapter seventeen paris in wartime alistair walsh had seen the city of light in too then though it had been pretty clear that the kaisers troops wouldnt make it this far bombers were only nuisances in those fondly remembered days things were different now not quite twentyone years later maybe had felt like this the sense of the fieldgray juggernauts car bearing down on the city with all the people in it wondering whether to run away or to grab what amusement they could before everything disappeared british money went a long way in france walsh remembered that from the last time around and it still seemed true hed got buzzed at a bar where the fellow serving drinksa man no more than a couple of years older than he washad a patch over his left eye and walked with a limp you here before tommy the frenchman asked in fair english oh yes alistair brushed his wounded leg with one hand i caught a packet toonot so bad as yours but thats just bloody luck one way or the other yes we could both be dead the bartender agreed handing him his whiskey and soda and youyou have another chance right walsh didnt like thinking about that however true it was so do you pal come to that damned germans bomb paris every chance they get the frenchman called his eastern neighbors several things unlikely to appear in dictionaries walsh hadnt learned a lot of french in his two stays on the continent but what he had learned was of that sort you bet he said and slid a shilling across the zinctopped bar here buy yourself one too merci the barman made the silver coin vanish damn shame about the eiffel tower too walsh added awkwardly when the top part falls offfell offit should fall on the governments head the french veteran said then maybe it do some good after we beat the boches we build it again there you go alistair started to suggest that the germans could pay for it but he swallowed that reparations had been nothing but a farce after the last war why expect anything better this time around drink up mon ami the frenchman said you will look for other sport eh night still comes too soon especially with blackout too right it does walsh realized the barman really liked him otherwise the fellow would have tried to keep him in there forever but the man must have realized hed do all right from his other customers soldiers wearing several different uniforms packed the place as long as none of them was in german kit walsh had to push through double blackout curtains to get out onto the street a little light leaked out despite the curtains a flic blew his whistle and shouted something irate since alistair didnt understand it he didnt have to answer that was how he felt anyhow and it was already dark enough to let him fade into the crowd before the copper could get a good look at him he knew where he was going or thought he did the house was supposed to be around the corner and a couple of streets up he figured it would be easy to find even in the dark places like that always had queuesor given french carelessness about such things crowdsof horny soldiers outside waiting their turn for a go with one of the girls but he missed it maybe he walked past the corner in the gloom or maybe the place wasnt where he thought it was he wandered around bumping into people and having others bump into him excuse me he said and pardon it wasnt curfew time yet and paris kept going regardless of such tiresome regulations cars honked like maniacs as they rattled along they had headlamps masked with black paper or cloth so only a tiny slit of light came out with luck not enough to see from feet the faint glow wasnt enough to let drivers see much either every so often the sound of crunching bumpers and frantic cursing punctuated the night another couple of steps and alistair bumped into somebody else excuse me he repeated resignedly pardon said his victim a woman they both stepped forward again trying to go around each other and bumped once more bloody hell walsh said you could be as foulmouthed as you pleased in a country where most people didnt know what you were talking about but the woman laughed i was thinking the same thing she said her english better than the barmans sorry alistair mumbled dont worry she answered my husband would say that when he was alive he was a soldier from the last war you were married to a tommy walsh asked thats right she said my father was a butcher my brother got killed at verdun and so fred took over the business better than he could have done in england he always said but he died five years agoand now we have war again too right we do walsh wondered what the hell to say next verdun was gone lost this time around though not with the titanic bloodbath of he couldnt very well ask a woman where the maison de tolerance was he wondered if he could talk her into taking him home with her if she was used to british soldiers though he was no damned englishmanby the way she sounded her fred had come from yorkshire or thereabouts before he could find anything she said maybe you should go left at the next corner its not far at allonly a few meters good luck tommy then she was nothing but fading footsteps on the street this time she stepped around him nimbly as a dancer alistair laughed at himself so she wasnt a widow who needed consolingnot from him anyhow too damned bad he muttered shed be better than what i could pay for and then thoughtfully left is it he didnt think in meters but he could make sense of them you had to if you were going to fight on the continent he found the corner by stepping off the curb he didnt fall on his face which proved god loved drunks he didnt get run over crossing the street eitherno thanks to the french drivers most of whom tooled along as if they could see for miles not six inches past their noses if they were lucky a long block down the street he bumped into somebody else ere myte watch yourself growled an unmistakable cockney oh keep your hair on walsh retorted not only showing he was from britain himself but suggesting he had the bulge to deal with any ordinary soldier he paused he still couldnt see much but his ears told him a long file of men stood here breathing and muttering and shuffling their feet a light went on in his head even if it illuminated nothing out here is this the queue for you fink oid wyte loike this for anyfing else the cockney answered i suppose not walsh said freds widow knew soldiers all right and knew what theyd be looking for if she knew he also wouldnt have minded looking for herwell that was how the cards came down she might have been better but this wouldnt be badnot while it was going on anyhow later hed likely wonder why he wasted his money on some tart whod forget him as soon as he got off her but that would be later the queue lurched forward a few feet somebody joined it behind alistair and then somebody else he wished he could light a cigarette but that was against the blackout rules too one more thing hed have to wait for well it wouldnt be long breakfast at the airstrip was rolls and strong coffee hansulrich rudel longed for milk by the way a lot of the stuka pilots and rear gunners went on they longed for schnapps or whiskey he didnt care what they drank as long as it didnt hurt what they did in the air they sassed him unmercifully hed got used to thatby all the signs he was the only teetotaler in the luftwaffe he didnt much like it but he couldnt fight everybody all the time and then someone said something different to him what do you think of the new wing commander colonel steinbrenner rudel shrugged he seems like a good enough officerand im sure hes a good german patriot do you think colonel greim wasnt asked the other pilot a new fish was he maxi or moritz moritz that was it hansulrich shrugged again hed still be in charge of the wing if the powers that be thought he was me i say heil hitler and i go about my business what else can you do moritz started to say something stopped and then tried again the war hasnt gone the way everybody hoped it would when it started and so rudel gulped coffee he needed help prying his eyelids openlike most flyers these days he was chronically short on sleep and this brew would do the trick too which meant it had to come from captured stock but he could see some things even with his eyes closed how many wars do go just the way one side thinks they will beforehand do we toss out the fuhrer because things arent perfect of course not moritz said quickly of course not hansulrich agreed he hadnt expected his colleague to say anything else that the other man might not dare say anything else never crossed his mind he believed in fuhrer and party at least as strongly as he believed in his fathers stern lutheran god till the latest political upheavals hed assumed everybody else felt the same way this foolishness isnt doing the war effort any good moritz looked down into his coffee mug then he eyed hansulrich again which foolishness he asked quietly the coup or whats happening now to anybody who might have known anything about it why the coup of course rudels answer was as automatic as the mechanism that pulled a stuka out of a dive only after it came out did he fully realize what the other man had said i could report you for that he exclaimed he almost said i should report you for that ja i know moritz answered but think first would i go up there to get my ass shot off if i werent loyal to the vaterland nobody without a death wish would fly a stuka if he werent doing it for his country even so hansulrich said you cant be loyal to the vaterland if youre not loyal to the fuhrer wed lose for sure if anyone else tried to run the war or if we bugged out of it wed stab ourselves in the back the same way we did in no doubt the other pilot said was that agreement or was he just trying to get hansulrich out of his hair hansulrich knew which way hed bet he didnt know what to do next anyone who wondered about vengeance was less loyal to the party and the fuhrer than he should have been but if you were a brave pilot and you hurt the french and british every time you flew rudel was still chewing on that when he headed off to hear colonel steinbrenners morning briefing with the rest of the pilots his ankle still hurt but he could walk on it and use the stukas aileron controls that was all that counted if we can break through north of paris we have them steinbrenner declared then we wheel around behind the city the way we would have done it in if von kluck hadnt run short of men and turned too soon he was in his fortiesold enough to remember von klucks turn maybe old enough to have been one of the footsloggers who made it and then got hurled back from the marne by the way he spoke he still took it personally a generation later weve done better this time than we did in he went on thanks to the panzers and to you boys weve got most of the french channel ports that makes it harder for england to send men and machines to the continent and whos to thank for the panzers and the stukas and the rest of our toys the fuhrer thats who hansulrich nodded vigorously so did most of the other men in the wing he judged that some of them like him meant it from the bottom of their hearts others wanted to be seen nodding so the new wing commander would have no reason to doubt their loyalty whited sepulchers he thought scornfully his father had plenty of things to say about parishioners who acted pious in church but behaved like animals as soon as they got outside again and a few stubborn souls moritz among them just sat there listening as if colonel steinbrenner were going on about the weather maybe they had the courage of their convictions some men did fight for voterland rather than fuhrer rudel didnt think the two were separable he was willing to bet germanys foes didnt either after a moment steinbrenner resumed your target is chaumont theres a railway viaduct thereits more than six hundred meters long and it crosses the suize artillery hasnt been able to knock it out and the enemy keeps sending men and materiel across it time to put a stop to that by god now everybody nodded give the luftwaffe a purely military problem and it would handle things just fine even hansulrich was relieved that he wouldnt have to think about politics while he was flying if any of the other men felt differently he would have been very surprised groundcrew men were already bombing up his stuka and fueling it when he went out to the revetment sergeant dieselhorst was grabbing a premission cigarette a safe distance away whats on the plate dieselhorst asked chaumont railroad bridge hansulrich said ach so the sergeants cheeks hollowed as he took one last drag he crushed the butt underfoot flakll be thick enough to walk on he said mournfully they know what those bridges are worth you can always bow out hansulrich said the rear gunner sent him a reproachful look rudel gestured toward the ju well come on then heil hitler heil dieselhorst echoed whatever he thought of the rumored coup he didnt say much he just did his job that wasnt the worst attitude for a noncomor anyone elseto have inside the planes cabin he and hansulrich went through their preflight checks everything came up green with all the flying the planes were doing the groundcrews had to work miracles to keep so many of them airborne so far the mechanics and armorers seemed up to it a groundcrew man spun the prop hansulrich fired up the engine another groundcrew man sat on the wing to help guide him as he taxied out of the revetment and onto the airstrips chewedup grass the ground crewman hopped off with a wave rudel gave him one too when he got the takeoff signal he gunned the stuka it bounced down the runway and lurched into the air it might not have been pretty but it flew all right chaumont wasnt far on the map but it was far enough farther than the kaisers army had ever got we have company sergeant dieselhorst said distracting rudel he looked around making sure hed read the noncoms tone the right way yes those were messerschmitts flying with the stukas not hurricanes or french fighters streaking in to attack them chaumont was important then flights over france unlike those across the channel didnt always get escorts laid on hansulrich saw the flak well before he reached the target it did look thick enough to walk on yes the enemy also knew how important chaumont was hansulrich muttered to himself but didnt say anything out loud he didnt want dieselhorst worrying any more than necessary worrying as much as proved necessary would likely be bad enough hurricanes streaked at the stukas maybe a minute and a half later the s zoomed away to meet the british fighters hansulrich had seen over england that that was the best way to hold off enemy planes sticking too close to the bombers you were escorting gave attackers a big edge sometimes the enemy got through no matter what you did sergeant dieselhorsts machine gun chattered rudel saw a couple of stukas diving for the deck hoping to outrun the hurricanes on their tails he wished them luck and feared theyd need it he started his own dive for the railroad bridge sooner than hed intended to which also meant it had to be shallower that gave the antiaircraft gunners plenty of time to fire at him shells burst all around his stuka he hung on to the stick as tight as he couldit was like driving a car on a badly rutted dirt road puffs of evil black smoke came closer and closer a few bits of shrapnel rattled off the plane or tore into itluckily only a few trying not to think about anything else hansulrich bored in on the bridge the viaduct had three levels towering more than fifty meters above the river it overleaped some plump pipesmoking mustachioed french engineer of the last century must have been proud of himself for designing it rudel yanked at the bombrelease lever with a little luck hed make that frenchmans grandchildren unhappy as soon as the bombs fell free the stuka got faster and friskier more flak burst behind it in front of it all around it and sergeant dieselhorsts voice rang tinnily through the speaking tube you nailed the fucking bridge its going down danken gott dafur rudel said he sped back toward the east keeping his gauges at the edge of the red till he was sure hed made it to germanheld territory if one of the hurricanes had chosen to chase him redlining the gauges wouldnt have done much good the stuka made a fine divebomber but a poor tired donkey in a sprint on the flat he got down to his surprise colonel steinbrenner trotted up before his prop stopped spinning rudel the colonel said they swore youd got shot down again they said nobody could go into that kind of fire and come out the other side in one piece they whoever they were hadnt tried it themselves hansulrich shrugged he hadnt thoughtmuchabout going down all hed thought about was doing his job letting the other get in the way would have distracted him it might have given him cold feet now that hed made it through he wondered why the devil it hadnt shrugging again he said im here the bridge is down theres an iron cross first class steinbrenner said medals werent the biggest thing on rudels mindnowhere close he did say make sure dieselhorst gets one too he kept the enemy fighters off my back hell be taken care of the wing commander promised hansulrich believed him back in the last war enlisted men always got the shitty end of the stick the fuhrer understood thathed seen it for himself in four years at the front hed sworn things would be different this time around and hed meant it some of the vons left over from the last round might not like it but too bad for them hansulrich climbed out of the cockpit behind him sergeant dieselhorst was coming out too made it the noncom said with a wry grin ja hansulrich nodded and do you know what we won besides the eisenkreuz i mean whats that dieselhorst asked a chance to have just as much fun again tomorrow or maybe later on today rudel answered the rear gunner and radioman made a wry face hot damn he said joaqu in delgadillo looked across the straits of gibraltar to africa that was better than looking at gibraltar itself the british had fought like fourteen different kinds of demon to hold on to the rock in the end it didnt do them a pesetas worth of good spains gold and scarlet flew over gibraltar for the first time in more than two hundred years posters slapped onto walls or fences still standing boasted of the return to spanish sovereignty ours again they shouted and goodbye to england glum british pows moped behind barbed wire the people whod lived in gibraltar were mostly spaniards the ones left alive after the fight seemed just as disheartened as the enemy soldiers general sanjurjos men were making them sorry theyd backed the union jack a couple of condor legion german airmen walked by gabbing in their incomprehensible guttural language delgadillo wondered why they didnt choke to death every time they opened their mouths one of them nodded to him and said buenos dias sound by sound the words were in spanish but no one who heard them would have dreamt they came from a spaniards throat buenos dias delgadillo answered politely even if they did talk as if their mouths were full of glue theyd done marshal sanjurjo a lot of good german bombers had helped flatten the british defenses here for instance and made british battleships keep their distance that thought made joaquin look west instead of south if the royal navy wanted to cause trouble it still could and it might not only to pay spain back for reclaiming gibraltar but to keep the straits open so british and french ships could pass into and out of the mediterranean hed faced fire from big naval guns before german planes pounded them into silence if he never had to do that again hed light a grateful candle in church once was twice too often they were much much worse than landbased artilleryand that was more than bad enough the condor legion men were looking out to sea too one of themnot the one whod spoken beforeasked where is your engineering officer he spoke betternot well but better delgadillo pointed north that way about a kilometer and a half why do you need him he would never have asked that of one of his own officers spanish common soldiers didnt ask their officers anything they existed to do as they were told but the germans were so foreign so exotic they might not know that sure enough this one answered readily enough we need spare parts to discuss since the big war in europe began we have from a shortage of them suffered why didnt he put his verbs where they would do him some good did he hide them in his own language too he must have or he wouldnt have done it in spanish i dont know if hell be able to help you senor delgadillo was polite he didnt tell the condor legion men the engineering officer didnt have a chance in hell of doing them any good lieutenant lopez tried hard sometimes he could come up with a new bolt or a spring for a rifle hed done yeomans duty repairing the broken axle on a horsedrawn wagon but he knew no more about airplane parts than a goat knew about the miracle of transubstantiation well we will out find many thanks much obliged the german said he and his pal headed north a spaniard on a mission bound to be futile would have taken his time the germans marched away as if they were on a parade ground why anybody would be so diligent without some superiors eye on him was more than delgadillo could fathom he shrugged the foreigners might be a little bit crazy but they were good at what they did and they were on his side he looked west again no british battleships no smoke in the distance no enormous shells crashing down like the end of the world nothing but one spanish soldier with the jitters well no that wasnt quite true a couple of hundred meters away an officer with enormous tripodmounted binoculars scanned the horizon delgadillo knew there were observation posts up on the heights of the rock too they could see farther from there if the battleships came and those germans didnt have their spare partswhat would happen then the same thing that would happen if there were no airplanes the ships would pound the stuffing out of gibraltar he laughed at himself what could he do about it any which way jump into the closest foxhole work his rosary for all it was worth and pray to the virgin to keep the guns from blowing him to dogmeat a common soldiers life wasnt easy but most of the time it was pretty simple any common soldier no matter whose army he belonged to learned to look busy evenoften especiallywhen he wasnt sergeant carrasquel turned his basilisk stare on joaquin but didnt put him to work if you had a rag and a brush you could look as if you were cleaning your rifle no underofficer ever complained if he caught you doing that and if you werent so diligent as you might have beenwell how could a sergeant tell having successfully evaded any real duty most of the day delgadillo queued up for supper with no small feeling of accomplishment food on the rock was pretty good not the smallest reason was that much of it came from captured british supplies the enemy had done his best to destroy what he could before gibraltar fell but the spaniards took the place before he could ruin it all joaquin had heard that the tommies scorned bully beef but it beat the devil out of going empty pride went before a fall he got nabbed for kitchen police washing and drying and scrubbing werent dangerous but they werent any fun either pepe rivera the boss cook was a top sergeant and an eviltempered son of a whore too no matter what joaquin did it wasnt good enough to suit him delgadillo had just gone to bed when antiaircraft guns woke him up he grabbed his helmeta spanish copy of the german model from the last warand ran for the closest trench god damn the french to hell he said as he scrambled down into it he will he does another soldier said it wasnt the first time french bombers had crossed from morocco to hit gibraltar they were only nuisance raidsnothing like the pounding the papers said the germans were giving to london and paris but you could get killed in a nuisance raid too if you were careless or unlucky bombs whistled down they exploded none of them especially close the drone of aircraft engines overhead faded away the antiaircraft guns kept hammering for another ten or fifteen minutes then they seemed satisfied and shut up gracias a dios y su madre joaquin said climbing out of the trench he yawned enormously maybe he could grab some sleep at last out on the streets of munster away from any possible microphones sarah goldman said i wish wed get another letter even here she named no names and gave no details you never could tell who was listening if people in germany had learned anything since that was it her mother nodded so do i but we were lucky to get one and frau breisach put herself in danger to bring it to us i know it was kind of her brave of her too sarah said propaganda posters sprouted like mold on walls and fences and tree trunks some showed jutjawed blueeyed men in coalscuttle helmets recruiting posters for the wehrmacht and the waffenss sarah didnt mind those so much germany was at war after all father and saul would have joined if the country had let them in spite of everything saul had joined thered been more waffenss posters lately especially since the coup against hitler failed sarah didnt like that but she didnt know what she could do about it no actually she did know she couldnt do a thing other posters showed hooknosed flabbylipped jews pulling the strings on puppets of chamberlain and daladier or a capitalist jew in a morning coat and top hat shaking hands with a communist jew in overalls and a flat cloth cap above a womans corpse labeled germany still others carried a stark simple message the jews are our misfortune why do they hate us so much sarah whispered the poison made her want to hate herself i only wish i knew mother answered then maybe i could do something about it she sighed her breath smoked spring was supposed to be on the way but it hadnt got here yet or maybe knowing wouldnt make any difference sometimes things just are what they are thats all thats what i was afraid of sarah said if it made sense though she shook her head in frustration if it had to make sense the goyim wouldnt do it they might sometimes people dont care what they do mother paused then added and look at the name you just called them if you could youd do worse than call them names wouldnt you i wouldnt start anything sarah said but after all theyve done to us shouldnt we get even if we can an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth and after a while everyones blind and nobody has any teeth mother said sadly laborers were still repairing british bomb damage and hauling away rubble one wheelbarrow at a time the raf wanted to make sure germany had no eyes or teeth sarah had always thought of herself as a german at least till the nazis wouldnt let her any more and the enemy bomber crews were trying to kill her too all the same she wouldnt have shed a tear if one of their bombs blew up hitler and hess and goebbels and goring the laborers paused when sarah and her mother went by sarah felt their eyes on herand maybe on mother too she tried to pretend the sweaty men in overalls werent there that was one more complication she didnt need and looking at them would have reminded her of saul working in a gang just like this oneand of his shovel caving in the gang boss skull she wished she could forget shed ever seen that she wished she could forget shed ever heard it too hey sweetheart one of the workmen called he rocked his hips forward and back his buddies laughed sarah just kept walking they dont know were jews she said in a low voice a good thing too theyd be worse if they did her mother answered i keep hearing theyre going to make us put yellow stars on our clothes thank god it hasnt happened yetthats all i can say like the ghetto in the old days sarah shivered not quite mother said sarah raised a questioning eyebrow the older woman explained in the old days they wouldnt have charged us ration points for the cloth we need to make the stars where did you hear that sarahs heart sank it had the ring of truth exactly the kind of thing the nazis with their often maniacal drive for efficiency would think of i forget who told me maybe i dont want to remember mothers face twisted it sounds too much like something theyd do i was thinking the same thing sarah said i was hoping youd tell me i was crazy she said verruckt the proper german term back before the nazis took over or back at home even now she would more likely have said meshuggeh it was a friendlier more comfortable word but she didnt want to speak any yiddish where aryans might overhear aryans her father had had several instructive things to say on that score he tore mein kampfs claims to little pieces and then stomped on the pieces he really knew what he was talking about where the halfeducated hitler cobbled together bits and pieces from pamphlets and political tracts and lying outdated books hed read hitler reassembled them into his own mosaic which had precious little connection to real history samuel goldman was scholar enough to know as much he could prove it citing chapter and verse all of which of course did him no good whatever he wasnt going to change the nazis minds knowing how much of the partys antisemitism was built on lie atop lie only gave him a sour stomach and heart palpitations with an effort sarah dragged her mind away from fathers frustrations she had plenty of her own to dwell on the most immediate came out i hope well be able to get what we need i hope well be able to get anything well we havent starved yet mother said which was true but less than encouraging with jews able to shop only as things were about to close and with their being unwelcome in so many shops anyhow staying fed and clothed was even harder for them than for their german neighbors one clever jew in hamburg had given her familys ration coupons to a gentile friend who used them to shop for her the friend could have used the coupons for her own kin but she hadnt done that shed played squaretill someone betrayed them the jewish family got it in the neck for evading rationing regulations and the gentiles got it in the neck for helping jews for all sarah knew they had sidebyside bunks in the dachau camp or maybe theyd all been shot she wouldnt have been surprised if you were a german jewor an aryan rash enough to remember you were also a human beingyou couldnt win a trolley rattled by the motorman ignored sarah and her mother as they ignored him jews werent supposed to ride streetcars either except going off to the work gangs in the morning or coming back from them at night no you couldnt win i hope our soles will last her mother said leather and even synthetics for shoe repairs were impossible to come by sarah nodded she hoped her soul would last too chapter eighteen victory will come soon so the official from the german department in charge of interned neutrals had assured peggy druce konrad hoppe that was the bastards name well herr hoppe wasnt as smart as he thought he was here it was a month later and germany was still fighting hard here it is a month later peggy thought more than a month pretty soon itll be spring and here i am still stuck in goddamn berlin the raf had come over several times french planes had dropped bombs once or twice even the russians had shown up flying all the way across poland and eastern germany in bombers said to be bigger than anybody elses none of that had done a hell of a lot of actual damage berlin was a long way off for enemy planesa long way off from anywhere civilized in peggys biased opinion the bombers had to carry extra fuel which meant they couldnt carry so many bombs german searchlights ceaselessly probed the night sky hunting marauders german antiaircraft fire was like a million fourths of july all folded into one it didnt do much good though that had to be part of why berlin seemed so jumpy to peggy these days berliners talked about hermann call me meyer goring as hermann the kikebut in low voices to friends they trusted in places where the gestapo was unlikely to overhear they were less discreet than they might have been though peggy wouldnt have heardand chuckled abouthermann the kike if they werent but she was careful where she chuckled too she judged that most of berlins angst came simply from victory deferred had the wehrmacht paraded through paris when herr hoppe thought it would chances were the generals wouldnt have tried whatever they tried or had that happened earlier nobody officially admitted anything after whatever it was didnt work peggy stopped hearing so many juicy jokes passing them on didnt just land you in trouble any more you could with the greatest of ease end up dead ss men in black uniforms and soldiers in fieldgray seemed to compete with one another in arresting people and hauling them off god knew where to do god knew what to them peggy had never been so glad she carried an american passport it was sword and shield at the same time you couldnt walk more than a block without somebody snapping your papers at you and when you showed them what a relief it was to pull out the leatherette folder stamped in gold with the gold old american eagle and olive branch rather than the german one holding a swastika in its claws here you are peggy would say and show off the passport with all the prideand all the reliefshe felt so far the talisman had never failed whether she displayed it to ss man abwehr official or ordinary berlin cop it always made him back off oh he would say whoever he happened to be this time around sometimes the german would salute after that sometimes hed just turn away in disappointment or maybe disgust but he would always let her go on then three blocks farther along some other jumpedup kraut reveling in his petty authority would growl your papers the whole stupid farce would play out again once a particularly reptilian ss managain in peggys biased opiniontried out his english on her demanding what is an american doing in berlin trying to get out pal nothing else but peggy answered from the bottom of her heart you want to send me home ill kiss your shiny boots and were they ever she could have put on her makeup using the highly polished black leather for a mirror for some reason the ss man didnt like that either it is a privilege to come to the capital of the reich he spluttered im sure the raf thinks so too peggy said sweetly the ss man was a fine fair aryan which only made his flush more obvious air pirates he said proving he not only read but believed goebbels newspapers they murder innocent civilianswomen and children sure peggy said and then incautiously what do you think your own bombers are doing we strike only military targets the ss man insisted the scary thing was he plainly believed that too peggy wanted to yank off his highcrowned cap and beat him over the head with it in the hope of knocking some sense into him but she held backit was bound to be a lost cause if you were the kind of jerk who joined the ss you had to be immune to sense she contented herself with can i go now may it should be may proud of winning a battle in her language the ss man handed back her passport and waved her on she turned a cornerand walked straight into a police checkpoint your papersat once a beerbellied cop shouted peggy produced the american passport the policeman recoiled like bela lugosi not seeing his reflection in a mirror as the ss man had before him he barked what are you doing in berlin and as she had before peggy answered truthfully trying to get out only later did she wonder about taking a big chance twice running how many chances had she taken too damned manyshe was sure of that hadnt she been proud of acting more mature she sure couldnt prove it today but she got by with it one more time pass the cop said writing a note on a sheet clipped to a flat board any gestapo official who examined all the reports various berlin security officials compiled could figure out everywhere she went for all she knew some gestapo goon did that every day if she were a spy it might have meant something but she was only an interned tourist with a big mouth she couldnt even have fun shopping window displays had nothing to do with what you could actually buy and everything you could buy required ration coupons of one kind or another she got enough for food to keep her going for almost everything else the germans didnt seem to feel obligated to take care of her and after the athenia went down she couldnt get out shed tried to arrange another train ticket to copenhagen shed tried to arrange a plane ticket to stockholm once she was in scandinavia she could get to england once she was in england she could get to the statesif the germans didnt torpedo her on the way and if they did well going down with her ship sometimes seemed more appealing than staying in berlin but they wouldnt let her out she got your papers when she tried to buy her tickets too and when she flashed her passport then it wasnt magic it was more like poison they would frown they would check a list then they would say i am very sorry but this is verboten they liked saying verboten telling people no was much more fun than saying yes would have been you got to watch your victims throw the most delightful tantrums peggy refused to give them the satisfaction she just walked away both times after failing to get the plane ticket she hied herself off to the us embassy if she couldnt get help there she figured she couldnt get help anywhere by all the signs she couldnt get help anywhere the embassy personnel spoke english not german but they might as well have clicked their heels and intoned verboten what they did say amounted to sorry but we cant make the german government get off the dime why not peggy snarled at an undersecretaryshed made herself obnoxious enough at the embassy that the clerks had booted her upstairs to get rid of her denmarks neutral swedens neutral were neutral for crying out loud why wont the nazis let me out of this loony bin the undersecretaryjenkins his name was constantine jenkinshad shiny fingernailspainted with clear polishand a soft wellmodulated voice peggy guessed he was a fairy not that that should have had anything to do with the price of beer well mrs druce the long answer is that the germans say theyre at war and they fear espionage he replied that weakens any arguments we might make because it means they can tell us sorry emergencywe dont have to listen to you espionage my ass peggy blurted which made the faggy undersecretary blink she went on the only thing ive seen is what a horrible rundown dump this place is that is information the germans would rather keep to themselves jenkins said seriously and besides the short answer is the germans are just being germanssometimes they enjoy being difficult and when they do you can shout till youre blue in the face for all the good it does you being pissy you mean shit peggy said that made much more sense than she wished it did she also made the american diplomat blink again which was the most fun shed had all day she went on cant i just sneak over the border somewhere all i want to do is go home i would not recommend it he said seriously we can be of no assistance to anyone caught violating the regulations of the country in which she happens to find herself and whether those regulations are just or humane is im afraid beside the point shit she said again and walked out of the embassy a man standing across the street wrote something down were the nazis keeping tabs on her in particular or on everybody who went in and out what difference did it make really they wouldnt let her go to sweden they wouldnt let her go to denmark they wouldnt let her go to norway or finland eithershed also found out that oslo and helsinki were off limits the bastards wouldnt let her go anywhere decent damn them to hell she thought about warsaw regretfully she didnt think about it long maybe she could get to scandinavia or romania from there but she feared the odds werent good the russians had pushed poland right into bed with germany the poles probably didnt want to land there but what choice did they have when the red army jumped them she wished stalin such a horrible case of mange it would make his soupstrainer mustache fall out thatd teach him then she had a brainstormor she hoped it was anyway she turned around and went back to the american embassy the guy across the street scribbled some more maybe the gestapo would have to issue him another pencil this time peggy didnt have to be so difficult to get to see the queer undersecretary constantine jenkins eyed her as if she had a case of the mange what can i do for you now mrs druce he asked warily can you help me get to budapest peggy asked hungary wasnt exactly a nice place these days admiral horthys government and wasnt that a kick in the ass a landlocked country run by an admiral was a hyena skulking along behind the german lion feeding on scraps from the bigger beasts kill when the hungarian army helped hitler dismantle czechoslovakia england and france promptly broke relations so did russia but she didnt think any of them had gone and declared war on the horthy regime and if they hadntsomething might be arranged well jenkins said thats interesting isnt it i hope so peggy sent him a reproachful stare why didnt you think of it yourself for his part he looked affronted because chances are the germans wont let you go even if hungary is an ally because getting to budapest doesnt mean all your troubles are over or even that any of them are if i can get into hungary i bet i can get out peggy said romania dont get your hopes up the undersecretary warned romanians and hungarians like each other about as much as frenchmen and germans and for most of the same reasons romanians spite hungarians for the fun of it and vice versa but if youre trying to get out of hungary you need to worry about marshal antonescus goons not admiral horthys oh peggy knew she sounded deflated hell she felt deflated she paused to visualize a map of southeastern europe well if i could get into yugoslavia that would do the trick too anywhere but this nazi snake pit would i dont suppose you want to hear that the hungarians have territorial claims against yugoslavia too jenkins said jesus is there anybody the hungarians dont have territorial claims against peggy exclaimed iceland possibly jenkins didnt sound as if he was joking he explained why if you think hitler hates the treaty of versailles im right peggy broke in yes you are he agreed but horthy and the hungarians hate the treaty of trianon even moreand with some reason because trianon cost them more territory than versailles cost germany a lot of it wasnt territory where hungarians lived but some of it wasand they want the rest back too they arent fussy not about that im sure peggy sighed people couldnt have screwed up the treaties at the end of the war much worse than they did could they never imagine things cant be screwed up worse than they are already constantine jenkins replied but that said in this particular case i have trouble imagining how they could be right peggy sighed she got to her feet well im going to give it a shot what have i got to lose good luck for a wonder the american diplomat didnt sound as if he meant and the horse you rode in on lady so peggy went off to the train station to try to get a ticket to budapest when she displayed her passport the clerk said you will need an entry visa from the hungarian embassy and an exit visa from the foreign ministry i regret this but it is strictly verboten that word againto sell tickets without proper and complete documentation crap she muttered in english which made the clerk scratch his bald head its a technical term she explained helpfully meaning well crap i see he said by his tone he didnt peggy did all too well she went off to the hungarian embassy at corneliusstrasse ah yesan interesting case said the minor official who dealt with her his native language gave his german a musical accent had he spoken english she supposed he would have sounded like a vampire maybe for once german was better he relieved her of fifty deutschmarks and stamped her passport so she was almost good to go last stop the foreign ministry nobody wanted to come right out and tell her no but nobody wanted to give her an exit visa either and nobody did finally one of ribbentrops flunkies sighed and squared his shoulders and said it is not practical at this time why the devil not peggy blazed id think youd be glad to get rid of me the man shrugged my orders say this visa is not to be issued i must of course follow them by the way he talked it wasnt that something very bad would happen to him if he didntthough something probably would but not following an order was as dreadful to him as desecrating the sacrament would have been to a devout catholic aw shit peggy said and that pretty much summed things up vaclav jezek had never liked quartermaster sergeants as far as he was concerned most of them were fat pricks this miserable frenchman was sure wide through the seat of his pants and he was acting like a prick all right he thought he personally owned everything in the depot near the village of hary vaclav had been arguing with him through benjamin halevy because he still hadnt picked up much french himself since that wasnt getting him anywhere he fixed the french sergeant with a glare and asked him sprechen sie deutsch he got exactly what he hoped for indignant sputters then the frenchman spoke to the jewish noncom doing the translating he wants to know why you think he should speak the enemys language does he vaclav pounced tell the son of a bitch i figured he would because hes doing more to help the nazis by sitting on his ammo till it hatches than he could any other way are you sure you want me to say that halevy asked he really wont help you if i do fuck him hes not helping me now hes got rounds for my antitank rifle and he wont turn them loose jezek said all right ill try i just wanted to make sure you knew what you were doing in the jews french vaclavs insult sounded less nasty than it would have in czech or germanfrench was better for kissing ass than for telling somebody off no matter what it sounded like the crack got home the quartermaster went as hotand as redas iron in the forge he said several things that sounded heartfelt whats all that mean vaclav asked with clinical curiosity youd break your piece over his head if you knew halevy said vaclav laughed not this goddamn thing antitank rifles were huge heavy brutes the heavier the weapon was the less it kicked when it spat one of its honking big bullets jezek approved of that as things were his shoulder was sore all the time you could stop an elephant with an antitank rifle sometimes you could even stop a tank elephants couldnt grow more armor tanks unfortunately could the rifle would be obsolete pretty soon and youd need a field gun to deal with enemy armor in the meantime vaclav wished he had a field gun to deal with this goddamn quartermaster sergeant the frenchman and the jew went back and forth halevy chuckled he doesnt like you jezek suits mein that case were even vaclav said im trying to defend his lousy country its more than hes doing christ knows you can translate that too halevy did the french sergeant didnt just sputterhe bleated then he sprang up from his folding chair vaclav thought the fellow was going to try and slug him monsieur le francais would get a dreadful surprise if he did jezek promised himself that but the quartermaster sergeant spun on his heel and stormed away the view from the rear was no more appetizing than the one from the front if hes going after military policemen to haul you off halevy began theyll grab you too cause youre the one who said it in french vaclav said happily the jew seemed less delighted too bad for him vaclav thought just to be helpful he added its called shooting the messenger in yiddish french and czech halevy told him what he could do with a messenger to listen to him shooting was the least of it vaclav listened in admiration he didnt understand everything halevy said but he wanted to remember some of what he did understand the quartermaster sergeant came back a thunderstorm clouded his brow he said several pungent things of his own french might lack the guttural power of czech or german when it came to swearing but the sergeant did his damnedest vaclav hardly cared at the same time as the frenchman was cussing him out he was also handing over half a dozen fiveround clips of long fat antitankrifle cartridges tell him thanks jezek said to benjamin halevy sure the jew eyed him it wont do you any good you know he spoke in french the quartermaster replied halevy translated for vaclav he says you can shove a round up your ass and then hit yourself in the butt with a golf club to touch it off a golf club vaclav had to laugh well thats something differentfuck me if its not hed say fuck you anyway halevy replied lets get out of here before he decides he really does have to shaft us just on general principles that seemed like good advice vaclav took it the quartermaster offered a couple of poignant parting shots vaclav glanced toward halevy the polyglot jew declined to translate that was bound to be just as well civilians streamed away from the front they didnt want to get caught by bombs and shells and machinegun bullets well who in their right minds would have vaclav didnt either but when you put on a uniform that was the chance you took some of the frenchmen andwomen eyed the czechs suspiciously they werent poilus they werent tommies either british soldiers were familiar sights in france the damnfool locals probably thought they were germansit wasnt as if that hadnt happened before farther east vaclav would have thought german uniforms were plenty familiar here too maybe he was wrong soldiers came back with the civilians the ones who clutched wounds pale and tightlipped were simply part of what war did the ones who didnt seem hurt worried vaclav more hed watched the czech army fight till it couldnt fight any more then when the nazis kept the pressure on the czechs went to pieces would the same thing happen here as far as vaclav could see france was in better shape than czechoslovakia had been the country seemed united in its fight against the nazis czechoslovakia sure hadnt been half the slovaksmaybe more than halfwanted the state to come to pieces their precious slovakia was supposed to be independent these days but hitler pulled the strings and made father tiso dance as for the sudeten germans the miserable bastards whod touched off the warvaclav muttered something foul the czechs had been pulling them out of the army because they were unreliable he muttered something else too little too late back right after the last war ended czechoslovakia should have shipped all those shitheads back to germany if they wanted to join the reich so much well fine so long it hadnt happened too goddamn bad a french captain spotted the enormous rifle vaclav had slung over his left shoulder he said something in his own language vaclav only shrugged and looked blank do you want me to understand him halevy askedin czech vaclav didnt even have to think about it nah he said hell pull me off to do something stupid thatll probably get me killed id rather go on back to camp makes sense the jew agreed like vaclav he stared at the french officer as if he had no idea the fellow was talking to them the frenchman said something else vaclav and halevy went right on impersonating idiots the captain tried bad german jezek understood that he also understood the captain did have something dangerous for him to try he didnt let on that he understood one damn thing he was willing to risk his life as hed thought before that was why he wore the uniform but he wasnt willing to get himself killed without much chance of hurting the enemy ah screw you both the captain said in german when the czechs wouldnt admit they followed him they went right on feigning ignorance the frenchman gave up vaclav had his ammo and he didnt have to try anything idiotic as far as he was concerned the day was a victory so far once upon a timeprobably not very long agothe froggies had had themselves a big old supply dump outside a place called hary willi dernen eyed what was left of it with something not far from disgust the frenchmen had hauled away whatever they still had a use for then poured gasoline on the rest and set fire to it the stink of stale smoke was sour in his nostrils come on get moving arno baatz growled nothing worth grabbing in this miserable place right corporal willi said whenever baatz talked to him these days he had to fight like a son of a bitch to keep from giggling every once in a while that showed in the way he sounded the underofficer favored him with his best glare did i say something funny no corporal willi answered hastily and bit down hard on the inside of his cheek so the pain would drive mirth from his voice awful arno remembered getting slugged in the tavern back in watigny he knew it had happened anywayyou couldnt very well not know when you woke up with an enormous bruise on your chin and a knot on the back of your head but baatz showed no sign of remembering that willi and wolfgang storch had been in there to see his piteous overthrow he also didnt remember hed been jealous because michelle brought drinks to them but not to him hed stopped a good one all right and that was highly convenient since he didnt remember he didnt blame them for the damaged state of his skull lieutenant erich krantz had replaced lieutenant gross the same way gross had replaced neustadt gross had kept his arm after all he might even come back to duty one day neustadt hadnt been so lucky krantz was here nowat least till he stopped something junior lieutenants seemed to have an unfortunate knack for doing that and if the enemy didnt get them they were liable to do themselves in krantz stooped and started to pick up a charred board sir you might want to be careful with that willi said getting ready to shove the officer aside if krantz didnt feel like listening but the lieutenant did hesitate what why he asked corporal baatz butted in sir dernens right he didnt say that every day so willi let him go on the french pulled out of here just a little while ago thats the kind of thing they might boobytrap is it krantz looked surprised and intrigued well how about that all right i wont mess with it thats a good idea sir baatz said his narrow rather piggy eyes said krantz should have figured this out for himself luckily for him it wasnt easy to gig a manespecially a noncomon account of the look on his face and baatz looked mean and scornful most of the time so maybe the lieutenant didnt notice anything strange krantz was looking south and west now that weve driven the french out of here we should be able to go on to laon without much trouble we as in you and your tapeworm willi thought the way it looked to him the froggies had hung on so hard at hary because it shielded laon they were probably digging in a little closer to the city even nowas well as anyone could in this miserable freezing weather krantz was an officer wasnt he supposed to know stuff like that because he was an officer he didnt have much experience obviously and if he kept poking around in a gutted supply dump he wouldnt live long enough to get any either willi didnt want to be standing close by when something krantz was playing with went boom he couldnt say anything like that to the lieutenant yes the fuhrefs wehrmacht was a much more democratic easygoing place than the kaisers army had been old sweats whod put in their time in the trenches in the last war all said so of course hitler was an old sweat himself hed fought almost from first to last without getting seriously wounded the way things were on the western front from to that was either amazing luck or proof of the gott mit uns on a landsers belt buckle but that was just the prussian buckle the last time around not the national one hitler had served in a bavarian regiment and would have had a different motto in front of his belly button yes the wehrmacht was more democratic now still a private couldnt explain the facts of life to an officer not even corporal baatz could a grizzled feldwebel might have done it but sergeant pieck was wounded too and hadnt been replaced krantz would have to learn on his ownif he lasted as if to show the platoon commander he wasnt ready for general staff lampassen on the outer seams of his trouser legs the french put in a counterattack later that afternoon whether krantz had or not willid been fearing one he was no general staff officer either but he could see what a long southern flank the germans held the wehrmacht had gone around the maginot line to the north not through it evidently the generals had counted on keeping the enemy too busy up there to worry about down here unfortunately what you counted on wasnt always what you got by the time the s started whistling in willi already had himself a foxhole it had belonged to a poilu whod dug himself a cave in the northern wall to protect himself from german shells coming in from that direction willi hacked and scraped at the nearly frozen dirt in the southern wall of the hole with his entrenching tool to try to make himself the same kind of shelter from french artillery no splinters flayed his flesh or broke his bones so he supposed hed done well enough no shells burst especially close to him so he couldnt prove a thing but proof didnt matter all that mattered was he didnt get hurt he wasnt sorry to let the frenchmen come at him for a change sometimesmostly when there were panzers aroundattackers had the edge more often defenders crouched in the best shelter they could find or make and tried to murder the fellows coming at them his mouth went dry he recognized that creaking clanking rumble as far as he knew the germans didnt have any panzers in the neighborhood if the french did it wasnt such a good day to crouch in a foxhole boom the report behind him was one of the sweetest sounds hed ever heard a split second later he heard another one that unmusical clang was an antitank round slamming into a french panzer and the smaller pop s and blams that followed marked ammunition cooking off inside the stricken machine willi wouldnt have wanted to be a french panzer crewman not right then not for anything he stood up and fired at the foot soldiers loping along with the hastily whitewashed french panzers the poilus threw themselves flat and shot back at him boom the mm antitank gun had found another targetfound it and missed it behind their steel shield the german artillerymen frantically reaimed and reloaded meanwhile the french panzers turret swung inexorably toward them both guns spoke together as near as made no difference the enemy panzer slewed sideways and stopped with a track shot off but its highexplosive shell ruined the german gunners their shield did some good against smallarms fire if a shell burst behind itwell tough luck but then another antitank gun off to the left fired two quick rounds the crippled french panzer started to burn in earnest behind the line german artillery woke up shells started raining down on the ground south of hary willi ducked back into his hole some of those shells would fall short your own side could kill you tooone more lesson he wondered whether lieutenant krantz had learned before long the french attack petered out the froggies didnt seem to have had their hearts in it not that that helped the crew of the antitank gun willi knew more than a little sympathy for the sorry bastards in adrian helmets and worn khaki uniforms like him they were at the mercy of officers who sent them forward and hoped something grand would come of it he lit a cigarette and stuck his head out for another look around the two killed french panzers in front of him would burn for a long time a few khakiclad bodies lay on the snowstreaked ground a raven glided down out of the sky and pecked at one scavengers never waited long and there was lieutenant krantz peeking out of his own hole in the ground like a feldgrau marmot hed come through another scrap a few more and hed start having an idea of what was going on out here as much as i do anyway willi thought as much as anybody does he took another drag and blew out a long happy plume of smoke hed made it again theo hossbach was messing with the panzer iis radio set again methodically taking out one tube after another replacing each with a fresh one and trying the radio again hows it going ludwig rothe asked him since theo was wearing earphones it wasnt surprising that he didnt follow it also wasnt surprising that he didnt take them off so he could ludwig had often thought that theo cared more about the radio than about either of his crewmates direct action then ludwig yanked the earphones off theos head the radio operator gave him a wounded look what did you go and do that for he asked so i could talk to you ludwig suggested by the way theo blinked that hadnt occurred to him are you a goddamn blackshirt so you have to interrogate me right this fucking minute gott im himmel ludwigs head might have been on a swivel as he looked around the panzer park nobody seemed to be paying attention to his panzer for which he was duly grateful are you out of your mind theo do you want them to haul you away nah if i did i wouldve but even theo stopped short swallowing whatever hed been about to come out with he was definitely an idiot but maybejust maybehe wasnt quite an imbecile wouldve done what ludwig wondered the first thing that sprang to mind was wouldve plugged the fuhrer when i had the chance ludwig didnt ask him if that was what he meant for one thing he feared theo would say yes for another letting theo know such a thought had crossed his own mind would give the radioman a hold on him and so ludwig pointed to the set theo was working on and asked his original question over again hows it going havent found the new bad tube yet as theo spoke he extracted another one they give out faster when we bang all over the landscape you know sure but what am i supposed to do about it keep working were as deaf as the damned frenchmen till you do ludwig had examined quite a few knockedout french panzers most of them had no radios at all french panzer leaders signaled their subordinates with wigwag disks the germans carried them too but only for emergencies they worked well enough on the practice field in real combat with dust and dirt flying they were much harder to make out and of course a panzer commander who stood up in the cupola to semaphore with wigwag disks was as likely to get shot as any other suicidal damn fool theo grunted and forgot about ludwig he put the earphones back on after a moment he nodded not to rothe but to the radio set you finally find the dead one ludwig asked hopefully a moment later he remembered theo couldnt hear him any more he didnt want to tear the earphones off the radiomans head again that was pushing things even for a sergeant for a wonder hossbach doffed the earphones of his own accord were back in business he reported outstanding because ludwig had given him a hard time before he made himself sound enthusiastic now yes theo lived in his old little world and visited the real one as seldom as he could get away with but he did his job pretty well anyhow ludwig had heard plenty of other panzer commanders bitch about their radiomen and drivers in terms that horrified him all in all he was more lucky than not french artillery came down about half a kilometer in front of the panzer park somebody was getting it in the neckprobably a bunch of poor damned infantrymen as usualbut the precious panzers stayed out of range of enemy guns when not actually fighting planes buzzed by overhead ludwig looked up more curious than worried sure enough stukas and messerschmitts flew west to punish the french and the english the enemy didnt use planes against german forces anywhere near so much ludwig was damned glad of it too hed seen what air power could do to soldiers he didnt want anybody doing that to him german s opened up maybe they were shooting at the french guns maybe they were softening up the poilus so the next german thrust could finally break through them instead of just pushing them back maybeludwig laughed at himself not for the first time he was pretending hed joined the general staff no lampassen on the legs of his black coveralls something off in the distance blew up with a hell of a bang even theo noticed ammunition dump he said christ i hope so ludwig answered damned frenchmen have already thrown more shit at us than we ever thought they had the more we can get rid of the less theyre liable to hit us with theo blinked in owlish surprise i hadnt thought of it like that youre always off in radioland ludwig said half the time i dont think you even remember theres a war on oh i remember theo said id be doing something better than this if they hadnt stuck a uniform on me so would you he still looked like an owl but a challenging owl now getting that much of a rise out of him took ludwig by surprise watch your mouth the panzer commander said again the way things are if anybody in the other blackshirts hears you go on like that youre down the shitter he was proud of those panzer coveralls but wished the ss didnt wear the same color theo nodded slowly he seemed much moreengaged with the real world than he often did he even looked around to make sure nobody was eavesdropping before he said well youre right about that too and things shouldnt work that way either you know damn well they shouldnt well fix it after the war ludwig said we cant waste time worrying about it now if france and england beat us again were screwed remember how it was when we were kids when they occupied us and we needed a bushel of marks to get a bushel of turnips do you want to see those days back again who would only a crazy man but theo looked around again softly he added the other thing i dont want is i dont want our own side fucking us over and thats what weve got hed just put his life in ludwigs hands if ludwig reported him the way a dutiful sergeant was supposed to hed have a new radioman in short order what would happen to theo after that was none of his business he would be better off not wondering about such things theo wouldnt but he would but he didnt want a new radioman theo spent too much time in his own little world but most days he did a good job if he doubted whether germany was always wisewell so did ludwig gruffly the sergeant clapped the other man on the shoulder well take care of that after the war too theyll have to listen to us then nobody has to do anything theo spoke with unwonted conviction but then he must have realized hed taken things as far as they could go or more likely a few centimeters farther he seemed to shrink back into himself well wed better worry about the frenchies right this minute eh now youre talking relief filled ludwigs voice something else onhe hopedthe french side of the line went up with a hell of a bang that relieved him too he knew how hideously vulnerable to antitank rounds the panzer ii was as with the previous bang the fewer of them the enemy could aim at him the better the panzers rattled forward an hour or so later foot soldiers in feldgrau loped along with the armor one of them waved to ludwig who stood head and shoulders out of the cupola he nodded back panzers could do things the infantry only dreamt about everybody knew that and had known it all along but the war had taught a different lesson that panzers needed infantrymen too without them enemy soldiers could get in close and raise all kinds of hell with grenades and bottles full of blazing gasoline and whatever other lethal little toys they happened to carry stukas screamed down out of the sky fire and smoke and dirt rose into the air a few hundred meters ahead even at that distance blast from the big bombs rattled ludwigs teeth what it was doing to the bastards in khaki on whom the bombs fellludwig felt a curious mixture of sympathy and hope that nobody up ahead was in any shape to fight any more a forlorn hope and he knew it some of them would be dead some would be maimed or too shellshocked to know sausage from saturday but there were always some lucky stubborn assholes whodhe hadnt even finished the thought before a french machine gun started banging away a landser toppled clutching at his chest other german foot soldiers hit the dirt ludwig was back inside the turret a split second before several bullets rattled off the panzers armor smallarms ammo couldnt get through that never stopped machine gunners from trying scheisse fritz said like ludwig the driver must have hoped the stukas would do all their work for them ludwig swung the turret toward the closest french machine gun he fired back hot mm cartridge cases clattering down onto the fighting compartments floor the enemy hotchkiss fell silent the panzer pushed on chapter nineteen meaux was gone luc harcourt could see the smoke in the east much of which came from the lost town maybe the boches were celebrating by burning everything they couldnt steal or maybe french engineers had planted charges under everything they didnt want the enemy to use german prisoners who spoke french had nothing but admiration for the engineers as far as luc was concerned who torched or blew up what hardly mattered any more no matter who did it france caught hell all he cared about was staying in one piece till the war ended no guarantee of that sergeant demange was commanding the company no replacement officer had come forward since lieutenant marquet stopped an antitank round with his stomach it cut him in half the top half lived and screamed much longer than luc wished it would have luc had a squad himself a private first class wasnt much of a noncom but hed gone this far without getting hit that put him several long steps ahead of the scared conscripts he led the sergeant came by his redtracked eyes missing nothing the gitane in the corner of his mouth twitched as he snapped dont let em lay there with their thumbs up their asses harcourt set the sorry sods to digging theyll hate you now but theyll thank you as soon as the germans start shelling us again right sergeant luc said wearily he knew demange was right too but he wanted nothing more than to lie there himself and who cared where his thumb went with a sigh he hauled himself to his feet come on you miserable lugs you can rest once youve got foxholes to rest in they groaned some of them didnt even have hard hands yet their palms blistered and bled when they used shovels or entrenching tools but theyd seen dead menboth bloodied and astonished after meeting death unexpectedly and bloated and stinking from lying in the fields four or five days unburied they didnt want anyone else seeing them like that worse than getting caught naked they werent eager but they dug so did luc he already had a scrape of sorts he improved it as fast as he could there seemed to be a lull now but how long would it last another twenty minutes another twenty seconds no time at all dont throw the dirt every which way he said in something not far from horror sweet suffering jesus pile it in front of you dont they teach you anything in basic these days they teach us how to march and how to shoot one of the new fish said he had bloody hands and a pale unweathered face from what they tell us there isnt anything elseor if there is we can pick it up at the front theyre sending you out to get slaughtered they ought to see the boches facetoface themselves thatd teach them somethingthe ones who come back from it luc said savagely sure as hell the shooting picked up before the soldiers finished their foxholes they might be raw but they werent complete idiots they knew enough to jump into the holes and keep on digging while inside them luc didnt think anybody got hit he thanked the god in whom he had more and more trouble believing he also thanked that god who might or might not be there for sending nothing worse than smallarms fire his way german machine guns fired faster than their french counterparts sergeant demange said the same thing had been true the last time around though both sides used different models now why couldnt the french have caught up with their longtime foes especially since the germans hadnt been allowed to mess with machine guns till they started laughing at the treaty of versailles luc knew the answer to that france hadnt wanted to believe another war would come the germans by contrast embraced battle the way a man embraced his girlalthough fire from the flank could send them running too but they had the better tools with which to do their job is that a tank one of the rookies asked fearfully no my dear luc said after listening for a moment thats a truckone of our trucks by god maybe weve got reinforcements moving in we could sure use someill tell you that he almost shot one of the newcomers before he recognized the khaki greatcoat and the crested adrian helmet the french uniform had been modernized after it still looked oldfashioned next to what the germans wore the boches seemedstreamlined almost like oncoming diesel locomotives where are they shouted a corporal who sounded a hell of a lot like sergeant demange demange himself gave an answer that was almost useful look in the direction the bullets are coming from mon vieux youll find the germans i promise funny the corporal said you see i laugh and having laughed a laugh that could have come straight off the cow on the label of a popular brand of cheese he sent several shots toward the boches a loop of the marnewhose course was complicated in these partscurled up toward the french position from the south the enemy would have to cross the river twice to get in behind luc and his comrades as hed seen to his sorrow they were good at such things but he could hope they would think two crossings were too much trouble here he popped up out of his hole to fire at an oncoming gray shape in a coalscuttle helmet the shape went down luc ducked before he could decide whether hed hit it or not thinking of it as a shape a target meant not thinking of it as a human being he might just have killed if he didnt think of it as a human being he didnt have to think so much about what he was doing in this damned foxhole and ducking in a hurry meant that none of the other shapes in fieldgray had the chance to draw a bead on a khaki shape and wonder whether hed hit it luc didnt want some nice german young man to have him on his conscience the nazis must also have decided that fording the marne twice was more trouble than it was worth but that didnt mean they stopped coming if they couldnt go around the french here they seemed determined to plow through them sergeant demange screamed for his men to hold fast till he realized they would all get killed or captured if they tried one reason he made a good company commander was his aversion to dying luc shared the feeling he wondered whether that would do him any good after fighting for a while in some woods the french fell back into one of the riverside villages luc didnt know which one it was there were lots of them each somethingsurmarne the soldiers had fun with that calling them things like ammodumpsurmarne and blowjobsurmarne a blowjob on the marne would have been a hell of a lot more fun than what luc was going through most of the locals had long since bugged out luc would have were he still a civilian nobody was paying those poor slobs to get shot at and they didnt have the weapons to shoot back but a few stubborn souls always stuck around he wished one of them would have been a teenage girl with legs up to there but no such luck most were grizzled men whod done their bit the last time around and werent about to let a little gunfire drive them away from their stone houses and shops and farms they were plenty tough their wives were even scarier at least to luc several locals had varmint guns they were ready to turn them against the boches big rats but still gray one of them said with a raspy chuckle sergeant demange didnt want them dumb assholes wont take orders he muttered to luc he was a little more polite to the embattled villagers and peasants but only a little let us do the job you know what happens if the germans catch a franctireur the guy gets it and then they shoot a bunch of hostages to remind everybody else to play by the rules they shot my cousin like that in said another rifletoting villager dont you think you paid em back after that demange asked with surprising gentleness the local had two fingers missing from his left hand and walked with a limp not enough he said never enough demange could have argued with him instead at his unobtrusive gesture three soldiers sidled up to the man and forcibly disarmed him the other locals muttered which bothered the sergeant not a bit i told youlet us do the job demange said they might have squawked some more but incoming artillery made everybody scramble for cover a house that took a direct hit fell in on itself a woman swore horribly as soon as luc saw that the house wouldnt catch fire he ran for the ruins you couldnt ask for better coverand maybe like lightning s wouldnt strike the same place twice here came the germans they must have had some new guys among them seeing a village that had just got shelled they figured nobody would be waiting for them in there one of them got close enough for luc to see how surprisedand offendedhe looked when he got shot it was almost funny although no doubt not to the poor boche well too bad for him his buddies the ones who hadnt caught packets themselves hit the dirt and started moving up the way theyd learned in training luc wished for a battery of s to tear them to pieces wishing didnt produce any french guns smallarms fire then but damned if a couple of french tanks didnt show up a few minutes later they were renaults left over from the last war without much armor and without much speed still each one had a cannon and a machine gun and there didnt seem to be any german armor around the boches didnt like getting shot up while unable to reply any better than anyone else would have luc would have bugged out and so did the germans ill be fucked sergeant demange said wasnt sure wed get away with it this time well id rather be lucky than good he was good which meant he could afford to talk like that but luck counted too if a shell came down on your hole how good you were didnt matter luc shivered inside his own foxhole he was still here maybe it was only fool luck but hed take it any which way spring seemed to be coming early to eastern poland and western byelorussia as far as sergei yaroslavsky was concerned that was a mixed blessing the warmer clearer weather meant he could fly more often against the poles and germans but it also meant the thaw would start pretty soon and when it did all the dirt airstrips in this part of the world would turn to mud nobody would do much flying till the ground dried out and hardened up again rasputitsa the mud time russian had a word for it it came in both fall and spring in fall because of rain in spring from melting snow the spring rasputitsa was worse and lasted longer not just airplanes would be grounded armies would slow to a crawl if they moved at all sergei didnt think the soviet generals had intended to keep on fighting the poles till the rasputitsa came he didnt think theyd intended to draw the nazis in on the poles side either he did keep what he thought to himself if he said something like that out loud hed end up in a place where the spring thaw started in juneif it ever did the ussr had plenty of places like that and plenty of people had found out more about them than they ever wanted to know he had the feeling he wasnt the only one in his squadron thinking thoughts the nkvd wouldnt like meals became oddly constrained men seemed to be chewing on more than sausage and black bread swallowing more than tea and vodka you couldnt ask another pilot or navigator what was on his mind if he told you he proved himself a fool with a death wish he was much more likely to say something innocuous and peg you for an informer sergei knew he didnt trust a couple of his fellow pilots you had to watch out if the enemy didnt get you your own side would his bombardier had a simple solution fuck em all ivan kuchkov declared fuck their mothers fuck their grannies too the filthy old cunts to him that wasnt mat it was the way he talked maybe he didnt know where ordinary russian stopped and mat started maybe he just didnt care some of these people you have to be careful around sergei saidcarefully i suppose kuchkov said with a noncoms sigh about the foibles of his superiors the guys who think they have big dicks are the guys whore big pricks all right right yaroslavsky wondered why he bothered he stood a better chance of talking a thunderstorm into changing its ways than he did of persuading ivan but not even the nkvd could send a thunderstorm to a camp in siberia ivan kuchkov wasnt so lucky the blocky bombardier amazed sergei by winking at him dont get your tit in a wringer captain he said they never come after the likes of me im not worth bothering with how many other people have thought the same thing sergei said how many of them turned out to be wrong poor sorry fuckers kuchkov said sergei started to nod then caught himself hed already said more to ivan than to any of his fellow officers even anastas mouradian if ivan was a fellow with a pipeline to the nkvd hed said more than enough to hang himself he eyed the bombardiers broad rather stupid face ivan kuchkov was a russian peasant of purest ray serene surely he didnt have the brains to inform on anybodydid he you never could tell that was the first rule there was that ironjawed commissar who looked even more like a village pig butcher than kuchkov did what was his name khrushchev that was it yes he sure seemed the type whod take off his shoe and pound it on the bar if he got into an argument and if that didnt work hed pound it on your head but regardless of what he looked like he was nobodys fool hed lived through the purges after all when so many hadnt so maybe dear ivan wasnt as dumb as he let on either their sb got off the ground to fly a mission against a luftwaffe airstrip in eastern poland as sergei guided the bomber into formation with the others he wondered when the rasputitsa would close down operations muck had flown from the tupolevs tires as it roared down the strip but it got airborne make the mud a little thicker a little gooier and it wouldnt one way to deal with the problem would have been to pave runways that never crossed yaroslavskys mind soviet authorities didnt pave highways between towns not least because invaders could have used paved roads too but if the highways werent paved airstrips werent likely to be either heres hoping we give the nazis a nice surprise anastas mouradian said that would be good sergei agreed better than good his copilot said if we dont surprise them theyre liable to surprise us and getting surprised by a bunch of germans doesnt sound like a whole lot of fun erright sergei gave the armenian a funny look did mouradian talk that way because he was making a joke or because his russian was slipping maybe it was both together anastas did like to make jokes but they didnt always come out the way he wanted maybe that was why stalin and beria and mikoyan and the other formidable fellows from the caucasus cut such a swath through soviet politicsthe russians who were trying to deal with them couldnt figure out what the devil they were talking about till too late yaroslavsky didnt say that to anastas one more timeyou never could tell if the armenian took it wrong it might end up as a oneway ticket to a labor camp and then sergei forgot about it mes tore into the soviet bombers the plane just in front of his spun down toward the dappled ground trailing flame from its left engine another sb fortunately farther away blew up in midair that felt worse than a near miss from an antiaircraft shell sergeis bomber staggered as if bouncing off a wall one of the rear machine guns chattered kuchkovs voice came through the voice tube these pricks are all over everywhere like crabs on cunt hair do something about it for christs sake off to sergeis left a soviet bomber dropped its load over nothing in particular broke formation and scooted for byelorussia that looked like cowardice another sb went down and then another however the fascists had found out about this attack they were all over it what had seemed cowardice a moment before began to look more and more like good sense sergei fired the forward machine gun at a tracers didnt come close the german fighter flipped away with almost contemptuous ease during the spanish civil war the sb outran and outclimbed nationalist fighters everybody said so but those german and italian biplanes must have been mighty clumsy as yaroslavsky had first seen in czechoslovakia the bomber was no match for a messerschmitt one more sb tumbled in flames that was enoughno too muchfor sergei dump the bombs ivan he yelled into the speaking tube were heading for home now youre talking boss kuchkov said grating metallic noises said he was opening the bay and pulling release levers as fast as he could half a dozen kg bombs whistled toward the ground theyre bound to come down on some mothers head kuchkov called cheerfully he wasnt even wrong sergei could console himself with that thought he hauled the sb around and roared east at full throttle maybe it could outrun an italian fiat next to a he might have been piloting a garbage scow the airspeed indicator said he was making better than kilometers an hour all the same he felt nailed in place in the sky when a messerschmitt could get up over how could anybody blame him either kuchkovs ventral machine gun barked again the bombardier let out a shout of triumphor was it surprise nailed the fucker he roared damned if he didnt anastas mouradian certainly sounded surprised as bombaimer he had a better view below than sergei did the pilot managed to get out and hit the silk too bad only means hell be flying against us again before too long sergei said he tried to look every which way at once including in his rearview mirror german fighters were bad enough when you knew they were around if they took you by surprise you were dead it was about that simple he flew over the poles and russians soldiers from both sides fired at the sb that always happened they werent likely to hit anything wont it be wonderful mouradian said in his armenianaccented russian if we lead the fascists to our airstrip and they shoot us up after we land fucking wonderful sergei halfagreed his superiors wouldnt love him for leading the luftwaffe back to the field but what could you do his only other choice was putting down on the first open ground he saw and if it was rough or muddyand odds were it would be one or the other if not bothhe was asking to go noseup or dig a prop or a wingtip into the dirt his superiors wouldnt love him for that either there was the airstrip groundcrew men could get the plane under cover in a hurry sergei landed in a hurry tooas much a controlled crash as a proper descent his teeth clicked together when the landing gear smacked the ground he tasted bloodhed bitten his tongue anastas said something flavorful in armenian that he didnt translate you all right ivan sergei asked the bombardier im here anyway kuchkov answered darkly that would do right now anything would they scrambled out of the plane the groundcrew men hauled it towards a revetment theyd drape camouflage netting over it in minutes it would be next to impossible to spot from the air no s circled overhead or swooped low all the same sergei decided he could hardly wait for the rasputitsa to kick in full bore the front was paris alistair walsh would have known as much even if papers didnt scream it even if posters werent pasted to everything that didnt try to pick you up bomb craters and now shell hits from nazi heavy artillery told their own story when the s started reaching the city of light that would be real trouble no walsh thought when the boches drive their tanks down the champselysees thats real trouble till it happened hed damn well enjoy paris instead of fighting in it or he hoped he would this time he didnt exactly have leave his unit had fallen back into the eastern outskirts of town maybe they were supposed to be setting up somewhere getting ready to hold back the next german push if they were though nobodyd bothered to tell him about it in a way that wasnt so good it said orders from on high werent getting where they needed to go he would have been more upset were he less surprised if the germans kept pushing everybody else back of course things would go to hell every so often god only knew they had in a lot of parisians had already run away on the other hand a lot of provincials from the north and west had fled into paris one step ahead of the invaders you couldnt be sure whether the face that peered out a window at you belonged to a homeowner or a squatter whod picked a lock or broken a window if you were a tommy what the hell difference did it make anyhow plenty of bars stayed open most of the men who filled them were soldiersfrench english or from heaven knew where walsh had run into czechs before maybe the harddrinking fellows who spat incomprehensible consonants at one another were more from that lot or maybe they were yugoslav adventurers or white russians orbut what the hell difference did that make either one of the poilus had a concertina when he started playing it several other frenchmen sang with more enthusiasm than tune walsh knew just enough of the language to recognize a dirty word or two every line the barmaids pretended to be shocked their acting might have been even worse than the soldiers singing half a dozen military policemen stormed into the joint the concertina squalled to a stop the french mps started hauling poilus out into the street then they grabbed one of the maybeczechs he was in french uniform he said something to them it didnt helpthey dragged him toward the door then he hit one of them in the face the frenchman went down with a groan his buddy unperturbed hauled out a blackjack and coshed the slav who also crumpled he might not have wanted to go wherever they were taking people but he would walshs hand tightened on his mug of pisssour pissthin beer they wouldnt haul him off without a fight they didnt haul him off one of them nodded his way shrugged gallically and said eh bien monsieur le anglais he pointed to the flattened mp and soldier as if to say well what can you do just leave me alone thats all walsh didnt loosen his grip on the mug he didnt want to provoke the military police but he also didnt want them taking him anywhere by the time they got through theyd more than half emptied the dive wotll it be mate the barman asked walsh in english he might have picked up from an australian in the last war another mug of the same for what walsh felt like spending the wine would be urine too and the whiskey or brandy loaded with enough fusel oil in them to make him wish he were dead come morning right yare the barman was opening a bottle when walsh heard the scream of a big shell in the air two wars worth of reflexes threw him flat on the floor a split second before the shell burst in the street outside plywood covered the plateglass windows but how much did that help when a maybe even a blew up far too close blast shoved in the plywoodand brought down part of the roof fistsized chunks of jagged metal slammed through wood and glass not so many knifelike glass splinters spun through the air as would have without the plywood but one as long as a pencil buried itself in the side of the bar about three inches in front of walshs nose more shells screamed in he rolled himself into a ball not that that would do him any good if his luck was out maybe it wasnt none of the others hit close enough to do the tavern any more harm after an eternity of ten or fifteen minutes the bombardment stopped walsh had to make himself unroll he felt like a sowbug that had just escaped an elephant as he dazedly picked himself up he realized not everybody in the little bar had been so lucky if he wanted that beer he would have to get it himself the barmans blood splashed broken bottles behind the bar the stink of the spilled potables almost drowned the butchershop odor of blood other soldiers were down too walsh did what he could for them which mostly consisted of pulling tables and chairs off them and using their wound dressings he hoped he helped a little the door had been blasted open the door not to put too fine a point on it had been blasted off its hinges and lay in the middle of the floor he stepped over it and out into the street which now had a crater big enough to hold a horse it was filling up with water from a broken main staggering away walsh realized one thing was absolutely trueand absolutely terrifying the front was paris the front was the ussuri river northeastern manchukuo was about as different from the mongolian border region as anything sergeant hideki fujita could imagine gone were waterless wastes with camels and wild asses running through them great forests of pine towered toward the sky here rainand sometimes snowpoured down out of the sky japanese soldiers whod been here longer than fujita said tigers prowled these woods he didnt know about that hed seen no sign of them himself but he wouldnt have been surprised he did know there were russians on the far side of the ussuri that was the same here as it had been kilometers to the west not far east of the ussuri the russians transsiberian railroad ran south toward vladivostok if japan could get astride the railroad the ussrs eastern port would fall into japanese hands like a ripe fruit fujita crouched in a logroofed dugout artistically camouflaged with dirt and pine boughs and now the latest snowfall he peered across the ussuri toward the red army positions on the far bank he couldnt see as much as he would have liked the other side of the border was as thickly wooded as this oneand the russians damn them were at least as good as his own people at hiding what they were up to what do you see sergeant lieutenant kenji hanafusa asked trees sir snow fujita answered not much else no tigers no russians either theyre there the lieutenant said oh yes sir fujita agreed theyre everywhere the mongols would have fallen over years ago if the russians werent propping them up no the russians are really everywhere hanafusa said a quarter of the way around the world theyre fighting the poles and the germans and thats why were here when things get cooking on this front theyll be too busy in the west to do anything about it yes sir fujita said resignedly japanese officers always figured enlisted men were hayseeds the sergeant had figured out why his unit was transferring from the mongolian border to the northeast as soon as it got the order he knew what a map looked like and if hed never slept in a bed with a frame and legs till he got conscriptedlieutenant hanafusa didnt need to know that as soon as the weather warms up and the snow melts i think well move hanafusa said sounds good to me sir fujita said you needed as many clothes here in the winter as you did in mongolia and that was saying something something buzzed by high overhead an airplane is that one of ours or one of theirs hanafusa asked let me see sir fujita raised the field glasses the plane was too far off to let him make out whether it bore the rising sun or the soviet red star but he recognized the outline and spoke confidently its one of ours sir well good hanafusa said both sides sent up reconnaissance planes each wanted to see what the other was up to every so often one side would send up fighters to chase off the spies or shoot them down sometimes the other side would send up fighters of its own then the men on the ground could watch dogfights and cheer on the planes they thought were theirs sergeant fujita hoped the russians would open up with their antiaircraft guns he didnt want them hitting the japanese planethat was the last thing he had in mind but if they started shooting at it his side could see where theyd positioned their guns that would be worth knowing when the big fight started he wasnt much surprised when the guns stayed silent the russians were better at hiding their artillery till they really needed it than hed imagined anyone could be if you didnt think they had any guns nearby half a dozen batteries were zeroed in on you if you thought you knew about those half a dozen batteries four wouldnt be where you expected them to be and youd missed another half a dozen you wouldnt find out about them either not till the russians needed to show them to you he said as much to lieutenant hanafusa not all of the kwantung army had as much experience with the russians as the men whod fought them in mongolia did these fellows whod been on the ussuri or over by the amurwell what did they know not much not so far as fujita could see but hanafusa nodded thank you sergeant he said weve seen that ourselves there have been skirmishes along this frontier too you know even the korean army got into the actbut they had to ask us for help when the russians turned out to have more than they expected all right sir fujita wasnt sure it was but what could he say he did share hanafusas scorn for the korean army the kwantung army was a power unto itself it dictated policy for japan as often as tokyo told it what to do the kwantung army had masterminded and spearheaded the japanese thrust deep into china some people said there were men in the cabinet back in japan who didnt like that and wanted to pull back if there were those people were keeping their mouths shut and walking softly army officers had assassinated cabinet ministers before they could again and everybody knew it the only force that had any chance of restraining the kwantung army wasnt the cabinet it was the navy generals here saw the russians looming over manchukuo like the bears cartoonists drew them as the admirals looked across the ocean and babbled about americaand sometimes england can the americans give us trouble sir fujita blurted what here on the ussuri lieutenant hanafusa stared dont be ridiculous fujitas cheeks heated in spite of the chilly wind wailing down from siberia no sir i didnt mean that i meant well anywhere oh i see the lieutenant relaxed mm they wont jump in and pull the russians chestnuts out of the fire the way they did in the russojapanese war im sure of that the communists dont have any friends england and france are fighting germany too but the two wars might as well be one on the moon the other on the sun they dont like stalin any better than we do and neither do the americans yes sir that did help ease fujitas mind all the same he went on ive talked to some guys who served in peking they say the united states doesnt like what were doing in china who are these people hanafusa asked softly sergeant fujita beat a hasty retreat i dont know their names sir just some guys i was talking with waiting in line for comfort women that wasnt exactly true but lieutenant hanafusa would never prove it you didnt rat on your friends i see the lieutenant had to know it was a lie but he also had to know he wouldnt get anything more his snort sent steam jetting from his nostrils your brothel buddies arent too smartthats all ive got to say the americans go right on selling us fuel oil and scrap metal no matter whats happening in china as long as they keep doing that they dont much careright oh yes sir fujita knew he wasnt the smartest guy ever born but he wasnt dumb enough to get into an argument with an officer if you were that dumbhe shook his head he couldnt imagine anybody that dumb not in the japanese army chapter twenty julius lemp scowled at u what the hell have you done to my boat he demanded of the engineering officer standing with him on the quay at kiel its a dutch invention that worthy answered we captured several of their subs that use it were calling it a snorkelwell some of the guys who install it call it a snort but you know how mechanics are ugliest goddamn thing ive ever seen lemp said it looks like the boats got a hardon the engineering officer chuckled well ive never heard that one before he couldnt appease lemp so easily all you have to do is put it on im the poor son of a bitch who has to take it to sea why the hell did you pick on me i couldnt say anything about that i got my orders and i carried them out the engineering officer replied he wasnt chuckling any more if youve really got your tits in a wringer about it go talk to admiral donitz that shut lemp up with a snap hed done more talking with the head of the uboat force than he ever wanted to and about less pleasant subjects sinking an american liner when the reich wasnt at war with the usa would do that to you german propaganda loudly insisted england had lowered the boom on the athenia lemp and donitz both knew better and despite all that it could have been worse lemp hadnt got demoted he did have that reprimand sitting in his promotion jacket like a big stinking turd but nobodyd said a word about putting him on the beach and letting him fill out forms for the rest of the war a good thing too because he wanted nothing more than to go to sea butthe kriegsmarine had its ways of showing it was unhappy with an officer all right loading down his boat with experimental equipment was one of them you didnt want a skipper you really cared about to play the guinea pig oh no in that case youd lose somebody you wanted to keep if thethe goddamn snort thats what it wasdidnt work as advertised but if that happened in u poor old lemp people in the know would say first the liner and now this he wasnt lucky was he poor old lemp poor old lemp thought he was stuck with it all right i dont need to talk to the admiral he mumbled after a long silence no good the engineering officer paused in the middle of lighting a cigarette a chilly breeze blew off the baltic but it didnt faze him he was one of those people who could keep a match alive in any weather with no more than his cupped hands it was a useful knack for submariners who had to come up onto the conning tower to smoke some guys had it and some didnt that was all there was to it happily puffing away the engineering officer went on youll take two engineers to sea with you this cruise wunderbar lemp said a uboat needed a second engineer the way a fighter plane needed an extra prop in its tail the only reason you took one was to train him so he could become the engineer on a new boat his next time out or so lemp thought till the engineering officer told him leutnant beilharz is an expert on using the snorkel lemp would have liked that better if he hadnt tempered it with if anybody is of course still maybe it meant the powers that be didnt actively hope hed sink maybe gerhart beilharz proved improbably young and improbably enthusiastic he also proved improbably tall within a centimeter either way of two meters type vii boatshell all submarineswere cramped enough if you were short with all the pipes and conduits running along just above the level of most peoples headsyoure asking to get your skull split lemp said i know beilharz said he pulled an infantrymans stahlhelm out of his duffel bag i got this from my cousin hes somewhere in france right now im pretty good at remembering to duck but maybe the helmetll keep me from knocking my brains out when i forget thatd be nice lemp agreed dryly try not to smash up the valves and such when you go blundering through the boat if you dont mind jawohl gerhart beilharz saidhe really was an eager puppy and he knew things worth knowing or he was supposed to anyhow tell me about the snort lemp urged youve heard that sir have you good the young engineer said its a wonderful gizmo honest to god it is you can charge your batteries without surfacing thats what the dutch were mostly using it for but you can cruise along submerged too and youre much harder to spot than you would be on the surface but how am i supposed to spot targets if i do that lemp asked if im puttering along at three or four knots you can do eight easily sir beilharz broke in you can get up to thirteen but that sets up vibrations youd rather not have can i get the periscope up high enough to look out with it while im running with the snorkel on lemp asked aber naturlich beilharz sounded offended that he could doubt true believers always sounded offended when you doubted they sounded that way because they were that was what made them true believers lemp was also a true believer in his way he believed in going out and sinking as many ships bound for england as he could anything that could help him sink those ships he approved of anything that didnthe eyed the ungainly snorkel one more time well well give it a try he said the north sea is rough will the snort suck all the air out of the boat if the nozzle goes under water thats not supposed to happen leutnant beilharz said stiffly lemp concluded that it could whether it was supposed to or not what happened then did it vent exhaust back into the boat that might not be much fun he wished hed never set eyes on the miserable athenia then theyd have fitted the goddamn experimental whatsit onto somebody elses uboat well he was stuck with it he tried it out before the u left the calm waters of kiel bay it worked as advertised the diesels chugged along with the whole boatbut for the tip of the snorkel tubesubmerged gerhart beilharz seemed as proud as a new papa showing off his firstborn son what happens when the little bugger pisses in your eye after you take his diaper off to change him lemp wondered sourly he stayed surfaced through the kiel canal and out into the north sea away from the sheltered bay the ocean showed some of what it could do several sailors went a delicate green puke in the bilges would remind the crew it was there all through the cruise rides smoother down below beilharz suggested nein lemp shook his head ill use the snort when i have to but not for this i want to get out there and go hunting dammit even eight knots is only half what i can make on the surface so well stay up here the second engineer looked aggrieved but that was all he could do lemp had the power to bind and to loose to rise and to sink he cruised along at fifteen knots heading up toward the gap between scotland and norway the royal navy patrolled the gap of coursethey didnt want subs getting loose in the atlantic they laid minefields in the north sea too a lot of uboat skippers stuck close to the norwegian coast some evenmost unofficiallyducked into norwegian territorial waters to stay away from the royal navy sometimesalso most unofficiallythe limeys steamed into norwegian waters after them lemp steered straight for the narrower gap between the orkneys and the shetlands as far as he was concerned the norwegian dogleg only wasted fuel he prided himself on being a hardcharging skipper sometimes these days he wondered how proud he should be would he have torpedoed the athenia if hed waited longer to make sure of what she was but he couldnt dwell on that not if he wanted to do his job and the north sea was plenty wide chances were he wouldnt hit a mine or get spotted by a destroyer and if he did get spotted he told himself it was at least as much the destroyers worry as his he kept four men up on the conning tower all the time during the day their zeiss binoculars scanned from side to side and went higher up into the sky to make sure the watchmen spotted a plane before it saw the uboat leutnant beilharz took his turn up there why not it was the only time when he could stand up straight his disapproval of the way lemp usedor rather didnt usethe snorkel stuck out like a hedgehogs spines finally lemp pulled him into his own tiny cabin only a sheet of canvas separated it from the main passageway but it gave him more privacy than anyone else on the sub enjoyed quietly he said we have the gadget if we need it we know what to do with it till then i dont intend to break routine have you got that yes sir gerhart beilharz answered sourly uboat discipline was on the easygoing sideenough to threaten to give officers from the surface navy a stroke that formal response felt like and was a reproach where the conversation would have gone from there was anybodys guess downhill was lemps but somebody yelled smoke on the horizon itll keep lemp said as he jumped to his feet ja beilharz sprang up too he wore his cousins helmet all the time inside the uboatand needed it too it scraped on something overhead as he trotted along behind lemp he might make a submariner yet even if he was oversized lemp would have thought hard about chucking him overboard had he tried to waste time the big polemounted field glasses were aimed northwest when lemp stepped out onto the top of the conning tower what is it he demanded looks like a light cruiser skipper the bosun answered well well lemp muttered peering through the powerful binoculars it was indeed a warship maybe a cruiser maybe only a destroyer he would rather have seen a fat freighter out there butbefore he did anything else he scanned the horizon himself if it was a cruiser it was likely to have destroyers escorting it ignoring them while making a run at the bigger ship could prove embarrassing to say the least shall we stalk it beilharz asked all but panting at the chance itll give you a chance to try the snort in action lemp didnt answer right away only after hed gone through degrees without spotting any more smoke or another hull did he slowly nod ja he said well do it he heard the odd reluctance in his own voice whether the junior engineer did or not beilharz could afford to be eager to him this was like playing with toys but lemp had to be careful u and the crew were all on his shoulders a burden that sometimes felt heavier than the one atlas bore he muttered something the wind blew away then he clapped beilharz on the shoulder lets go below well see what we can do with your precious gadget he didnt submerge right away he still wanted to get as close as he could on the surface where he had the best turn of speed when he did go under he could still make the eight knots beilharz had promised and he would have been down to half that on battery power the extra speed helped him maneuver into a good firing position he launched two torpedoes at the cruiserhe still thought it was onefrom a little more than meters the british warship never changed course which meant no one aboard saw them at all one hit up near the bow the other just abaft of amidship like a man bludgeoned from behind the ship never knew what hit it it shuddered to a stop rolled steeply to starboard and sank inside of fifteen minutes cheers dinned through the long hollow steel cigar of the us hull lemp went to his tiny cabin and pulled out the bottle of schnapps he used to congratulate sailors on a job well done he thrust it at leutnant beilharz here you go gerhart take a big slug he said youve earned it you and your snort beilharz drank and then coughed lemp got the idea the young man didnt take undiluted spirits very often well if he stayed in uboats long he would after a sailor pounded beilharz on the back he said pretty soon i bet every boat in the kriegsmarine will mount a snorkel but us weve got ours now everybody cheered some more why not theyd just given the royal navy a damn good shot in the teeth staff sergeant alistair walsh shivered inside a house that once upon a time had kept an uppermiddleclass french family warm and dry and snug that family was gone now so were the glass from the windows a wall and a half and most of the roof what was left of the twostory house gave walsh and several other british soldiers a good firing position from which to try to stop the germans pushing down from the northeast he wasnt sure whether he was technically in paris or in one of the french capitals countless suburbs they blended smoothly into one another maybe the fine details mattered to a frenchman walsh didnt much care all he cared about right now was whether the side that mostly wore khaki could hold off the side in fieldgray if the french were determined to fight paris could swallow up an army seizing the place block by block house by housewalsh wouldnt have wanted to try it and he would have bet the germans werent what anyone would call keen on the notion either if they got around paris to the north and came in behind it the jig was up theyd tried that in the last war but hadnt quite brought it off they were trying it again now walsh worried that they would make it this time but he couldnt do anything about that all he could do was make life as rough as he could for any boches who got within a few hundred yards of him more boches were trying to do that than he would have liked germans had always been aggressive soldiers hed seen that the last time around and it hadnt changed a bit in the generation since and they had their peckers up now the way they hadnt in they thought they were winning and they wanted to keep right on doing it the tommies who huddled with walsh werent so sure how their side was doing theyd all started out in different regiments but here they were thrown together by the fortunes or misfortunes of war one of themwalsh thought his name was billsaid where do we go if we have to fall back from here sergeant beats me walsh answered more cheerfully than he felt they want us to hold where we are so well do that as long as we can he peered out through a hole that had been a window the bomb that had mashed this house had leveled three on the far side of the street as far as walsh was concerned that was all to the good it let him see farther than he could have if they still stood some british infantrymen were setting up a bren gun over there using the rubble to conceal and strengthen their position that wouldnt protect them from artillery the way a concrete emplacement would but it was a damn sight better than nothing and walsh liked having machine guns around they stretched an ordinary riflemans life expectancy not only did they chew up enemy foot soldiers they also drew fire which meant the germans wouldnt be shooting anywhere else so muchsay at the precious and irreplaceable carcass of one staff sergeant alistair walsh artillery probably based somewhere inside of paris thundered behind the british position the shells came down a few hundred yards in front of walsh a short round burst much too close to the bren gunners one of them turned and shook his fist in the direction of his own gunners walsh would have done the same thing artillerymen and foot soldiers often brawled when they came together in taverns behind the line the artillerymen seemed to wonder why not the infantry they knew all right cant win can you sergeant a different private said his name was nigel and he talked like an educated man oh i dont know look at it the right way and were all winners so far walsh replied nigel looked puzzled hows that this isnt a holiday on the fucking riviera his wave encompassed the shattered house and the wreckage all around too bloody right its not walsh agreed but youre still here to piss and moan about it eh they havent thrown you in a hole in the ground with your rifle and tin hat for a headstone they havent taken your leg off with a strap to bite on cause they ran out of ether with the last poor bloke if youre not a winner on account of that chum what would you call it heh nigel chuckled sheepishly put it like that and youve got something all right taken all in all though i do believe id sooner win the irish sweepstakes he lit a navy cut and passed around the packet he might talk like a toff but he didnt act like one with one of nigels fags in his mouth walsh didnt feel like arguing any more sure as hell a cigarette was better than a soft answer for turning away wrath then the german artillery woke up and he forgot about everything else he hoped the fritzes were sending back counterbattery fire if they wanted to drop some on his own gunners heads he didnt mindtoo much but no such luck the first shells burst a little closer to his position than the german rounds had then they walked west christ were for it this time he shouted and dove under the diningroom table it was the best shelter around the other tommies knew what they were doing too they all ended up in a mad tangle under there that table a great solid hunk of oak had to date back to the last century it would keep the rest of the roof and the ceiling from coming down on their heads if anything could if anything could that table wouldnt stop a shell burst on the house or right outside of it from filling them with fragments walsh knew that painfully welland with somebodys boot in his eye somebody elses elbow in his stomach and somebody else altogether squashing him flat painfully was le mot juste an explosion to the right another to the left two more behind the house bits and pieces of things came down something about the size of a football thumped on top of the table and banged away another chunk of the ceiling whatever it was walsh wouldnt have wanted it landing on him but it didnt that table might have let a tank run over him not that he was anxious to find out by experiment the bombardment pressed on deeper into the allied position it was almost like the walking barrages the british had used in the last go that memory galvanized walsh up he shouted urgently lifting his face from the small ofhe thoughtnigels back get up well be arsedeep in boches any second now getting out from under the table was more complicated than getting in there had been theyd packed themselves in too tightly after mighty wrigglings and much bad language they got loose bill had a gash on his left leg it might have come from broken glass on the floor or a graze by a fragment in civilian times walsh would have thought it was nasty neither he nor bill got excited about it now walsh ran up to the top floor sure as dammit here came the fritzes their storm troops had submachine guns and lots of grenades theyd learned that stunt in theyd bring real machine guns along too the current models were more portable than maxims had been back then and they were fritzes that alone gave walsh a healthy respect for their talents he took a quick look at the brengun position across the street it didnt seem to have taken a hit but the gun stayed quiet with luck the crew was playing possum luring the boches forward to be mown down without luck somebody else would have to get over thereif he couldand use the bren an unwary german yes there were such things just not enough of them showed himself for rather too long walshs enfield jumped to his shoulder almost of its own accord the stock slammed him when he pulled the trigger the german went down by the boneless way he fell walsh didnt think hed get up again now they know were here nigel called from downstairs he didnt sound criticalhe was reminding walsh of something he needed to remember we couldnt have kept it secret much longer the veteran noncom answered as long as they havent got any tanks winkling us outll take a bit of work he hadnt seen any mechanical monsters right around here they did less well in builtup places than out in the open they grew vulnerable to grenades and flaming bottles of petrol and other dirty tricks a machine gun started barking from most of a mile away bullets slammed into the eastfacing stone wall it wasnt aimed fire but it made the englishmen keep their heads down a rifle could hit at that range only by luck the machine gun stayed dangerous not because it was more accurate but because it spat so many rounds german infantry advanced under cover of that machinegun fire walsh had been sure the boches would they knew what was what and then like the cavalry riding to the rescue in an american western the bren gun in the wreckage across the street opened up walsh heard the fritzes shout in dismay as they dove for cover this wouldnt be so easy as theyd thought the machine gun that had been firing at walsh and his chums forgot about them and went after the more dangerous bren gun the germans didnt use light machine guns in this war they had a generalpurpose weapon that filled both the light and heavy roles it wasnt ideal for either but being beltfed it could go longer than a boxfed bren not that that did the advancing landsers much good the brengun position was secure against smallarms fire the tommies manning it ignored the other machine gun and kept the foot soldiers in fieldgray at a respectful distance and walsh and his pals and the other riflemen in the halfwrecked suburb made the germans pay whenever they stuck their heads up the only thing he dreaded was that the german artillery would come back it didnt after half an hour or so the attack petered out the fritzes had taken a good many casualties and walsh couldnt see that theyd gained an inch of ground nigel passed around the packet of navy cuts again bill found a bottle of wine the french family had forgotten they passed that around too it didnt take long to empty once it ran dry walsh set it aside if he got the chance hed make a petrol bomb out of it he opened a tin of steakandkidney puddingthe best ration the army made a smoke some wine a tin of foodhe was happy as a sheep in clover a soldier could be satisfied with next to nothing and often was when milt wolff went down harvey jacoby took command of the abraham lincoln battalion hed been a labor organizer in seattle before he came to spain chaim weinberg thought he was a pretty good guy he was brave and smart but nobody would ever call him anything like el lobo he had neither the name nor the personality for ithe ran things with brains and common sense he came back from a meeting of international brigade officers muttering to himself theyre going to pull us out of the line here he announced his tone declaring that it wasnt his idea and he didnt like it for hell but he couldnt do anything about it he must have known the news would bring a storm of protest and it did what for chaim yelped his voice one among many we can hold the ebro line foreverno pasaran the republic is going to transfer the international brigades to where they need us more jacoby said picking his words with obvious care that only made the abe lincolns hotter than ever next to chaim mike carroll called they cant do that the party wouldnt like it again he was far from the only man with the same thought they can they are jacoby held up a hand which slowed but didnt stop the torrent of vituperation at last something resembling quiet except for being much noisier prevailed it was enough to satisfy jacoby anyhow listen to me he said and then again louder listen to me goddammit things arent the way they used to be and wed better get used to it whats so different chaim challenged heres whatthe republic doesnt have to worry about the party line any more jacoby answered back when we were getting most of our stuff from the soviets the government had to pay attention to what the party wanted but whens the last time a russian ship tied up in barcelona chaim knew the answer to that just before the big european war started since then that supply line had dried up all the supply lines for both sides had dried up nationalists and republicans were fighting with what they had left from before and with what they could make for themselves that that might affect policy hadnt occurred to him up till now but it did the party isnt the tail that wags the dog any more harvey jacoby said regretfully russian officers cant tell the spaniards what to do and how to do things his grin was crooked well they can but the spaniards have quit listening chaims chuckle sounded forced in his time with the internationals hed seen that russians could be as obnoxious and arrogant as germans firmly convinced they were the wave of the future they ordered people around to suit themselves and had as much give as so many snapping turtles somebodychaim had forgotten whohad said if the fuckers werent on our side thered be a bounty on em that about summed things up were toughern any outfit the republic has someone told jacoby if we dont want to move they cant make us they want us to move because were tough the new leader said way it sounds to me is theyre going to push the fascists back from madrid and they want troops who know what theyre doing a different kind of murmur ran through the troops whod volunteered to come to spain there was a time early in the civil war when marshal sanjurjo could have taken madrid easily but he chose instead to rescue colonel moscardo besieged in the fortress at toledo with a small garrison he succeeded but he gave the republic time to fortify the capital the internationals had taken gruesome casualties keeping it in republican hands getting on toward three years later it still was mike turned to chaim think we can move the bastards damned if i knowdepends on just where we go and what weve gotta do chaim answered even getting therell be a bitch kittyknow what i mean fuck i dont want to think about that mike said with feeling the republics railway net had more holes than a cheap sock the roads might have been in worse shape yet even assuming the quartermasters could scrape together enough trucks to move all the internationals and enough gas to keep them moving chaim wanted to march from the ebro to madrid like he wanted a hole in the head hed signed up to give sanjurjo a black eye not to walk his own legs off madrid jacoby said again as if the name carried magic all by itself and damned if it didnt he went on do you want to keep on fighting for chicken coops and frozen hills here or do you want to fight for a place that really counts madrid had magic yes another thoughtful murmur rose from the abe lincolns but even magic was worth only so much to veterans cut the crap harvey said a guy who could only have come from new york city fightings fighting its all shitty no matter where you do it you can cry if you want to jacoby said you can go home if you want toand if the commissars and border guards let you get away with it but if you stick with the abe lincolns youre damn well going to madrid so whatll it be izzy oh ill go izzy answered i still want to kick these fascist assholes around the block same like the rest of us but you got to let us blow off steam first what do you think im doing jacoby said i know how hot the boilers run on some of you guys chaim found himself nodding the new cod hit that nail right on the head a meeting of the abe lincolnsa meeting of any group from the international brigadeswas more like a workers soviet than a typical military gathering or such meetings always had been like that anyway not everybody who came to spain to fight for the international brigades was a red but most of the men were and the reds had always dominated the way things went they had yes how long could they keep on doing it as jacoby had said the partys stock was down chaim snorted there was a capitalist figure of speech for you well everybody elses stock in spain was down too the war still mattered to the people who had to fight it the rest of the world cared only for what was happening near paris spanish anarchist militiamen came forward to take the international brigades place on the ebro line they had a sprinkling of foreigners with them too as chaim trudged toward the railhead down in tortosa he exchanged nods with a tall pale skinny fellow with a dark mustache and hair who had to come from england or ireland the internationals were a raggedy bunch americans many of them jews antinazi germans antifascist italians frenchmen who remembered the ideals of the revolution englishmen magyars who hated horthy and poles and romanians and greeks and god knew who all else who couldnt stand their local strongmen there were even a couple of chinamen and a jap they were raggedy all right but they could fight bombs cratered the approaches to the bridge across the ebro plenty of bombs must have gone into the river too but the bridge still stood aerial bombardment was no fun but it wasnt the warwinning monster people had feared it would be there werent enough bombs and the planes couldnt place them accurately enough to do everything the generals wanted the train that chuffed into tortosa for the fighters had seen better days better years better decades the locomotive wheezed asthmatically the cars seemed to be missing half their windows once chaim squeezed inside he discovered the compartments had nothing but hard benches he was lucky to get to sit down at all the internationals were packed in tight as sardines without the benefit of olive oil to grease the spaces between them boy this is fun he said to nobody in particular scheisse declared the tall skinny blond german wedged in beside him my ass the guy looked as if he ought to belong in the ss but his heart was in the right place he took a pack of gitanes from his breast pocket and offered it to chaim zigarette thanks chaim said he shared the red wine in his canteen with the young blond fellow they talked in a weird mixture of english german yiddish and spanish the germans name was wladimirhe insisted on the w at the front even if it sounded like a vdiehl chaim could think of only one reason why a german his age would be called wladimir your folks name you for lenin you betcha diehl answered a phrase he must have picked up from an american they tried to help the red revolution in bavaria my father i think was lucky to live they fought hitlers goons in the streets when the nazis were new and no one thought they would ever amount to anything my father and mother have been fighting the nazis longer than almost anyone he spoke with somber pride and well he might among the internationals that was something to be proud of if anything the locomotive seemed even wheezier pulling out of tortosa than it had coming in chaim knew why it was pulling all these cars stuffed with soldiers and it had to take the long way to madrid if the republicans hadnt recaptured the corridor to the sea from the nationalists there would have been no direct route through their territory from the upper ebro to the city they would have had to go to barcelona take ship land in valencia or some other port and then head west from there and they probably would have arrived just too late to do the cause any good nobody bothered to feed the internationals on the train along with the wine in his canteen chaim had enough bread and garlicky sausage to keep from getting too hungry for a couple of days hed been in spain long enough to assume inefficiency would rear up and try to bite him in the ass wladimir carried stewed beans and smoked herrings instead they swapped some of their iron rations what chaim got was no better than what he gave away but at least it was different they didnt go very fast again he was anything but surprised it wasnt all the poor spavined engines fault the spanish railroad net had been ramshackle to begin with at least by american standards and german oneswhat wladimir had to say put out more highpressure steam than the locomotives boiler harvey jacobyd known what he was talking about all right two and a half years of war two and a half years of bad maintenanceoften of no maintenancedid nothing to improve matters everybody had to get out and walk a couple of miles outside the little town of villar jacoby and other international brigade big shots promised that another train would be waiting at the depot chaim marched past a break in the track fascist saboteurs or just an ancient railroad line coming apart at the seams he couldnt tell he wasnt sure it mattered any which way the line was fucked up and sleepy villar might never have seen a train since the beginning of time a few small boys stared at the internationals as they slogged up to the yawningly empty depot none of the other locals seemed to want to show their faces chaim would have been angrier had he believed the officers promises to begin with hed been in spain too long to trust anybody or anything any more the train did show upfourteen hours later in the middle of the night the locals had emerged by then to offer food and drink at inflated prices the internationals proposed a different bargain if they got fed they wouldnt sack the town upon hasty consideration the people of villar agreed god protect us from our friends wladimir said and chaim nodded when somebody shook him awake he didnt want to get up he really didnt want to get on another train as usual nobody cared what he wanted he managed to snag another seat it was hard and cramped and uncomfortable but inside of ten minutes he was snoring again he dozed till an hour past sunup not even artillery bursts around the station as the internationals disembarked in madrid got him very excited it was a big city and it already looked like hell the nationalists had battered it with guns and bombs ever since the war was young but the international brigades were here to do what theyd done beforeto help make sure madrid stayed with the republic and somewhere chaim would find a warm place to sleep chapter twenty one joaquin delgadillo didnt know what to make of major bernardo uribe his new battalion commander was recklessly brave you had to be to keep going forward into the shelling the british laid down in their defense of gibraltar uribe hadnt hung back hed even won sergeant carrasquels grudging respectand carrasquel gave no other kind but if the major wasnt a maricon joaquin had never seen anybody who was uribe smelled of rose water regardless of the hour he was always shaved smooth as a womanthis among soldiers for whom scruffiness was a mark of pride and he exaggerated the castilian lisp into something beyond both effeminacy and selfparody if he ever tries rubbing up against me ill break my rifle over his head by god delgadillo thought but uribe never did virile machismo virtually defined the nationalist cause major uribe cared nothing for machismounless it made him hotbut in his own strange way he was worth more to marshal sanjurjo than a lot of harddrinking hardwenching officers we are going back to madrid he told his soldiers flouncing atop a kitchen table he was using for a podium we are well take it away from the republican beasts once and for all this time and do you know what ive heard have you got any idea my dears he waited expectantly one hand cupped behind his ear what is it senor the soldiers chorused joaquin loud among them ive heard the international brigades are back in madrid isnt that jolly the major shrilled no por dios sergeant carrasquel muttered beside joaquin they may be a bunch of fucking reds but they can fight i ran up against those cocksuckers in and once was plenty thank you very much up on his rickety platform uribe turned the sergeants argument upside down and inside out people say they make good soldiers and i guess thats true but theyre a pack of filthy godless communists they kill priests and they rape nuns for the fun of it the sooner we kill every one of them the sooner we make spain a clean place to live again some of the nationalist soldiers cheered most of those joaquin saw were men new to the battalion how much did they know about hard fighting sergeant carrasquel who knew as much as anybody in the world these days did some more muttering thats all great but how many of us are those assholes going to kill victory will be ours major uribe insisted ours spains germany and italy have other scores to settle but wethe honest people of spain the pious people of spain we will give the red republic what it deservesmuerte a la republicaviva la muerte viva la muerte the troops shouted back long live death the battle cry of the spanish foreign legionsounded ferocious when they yelled it in major uribes fulllipped mouth it seemed more like an endearment uribe of course was not speaking for himself alone he was passing on orders hed got from the officers above him if those officers said the battalion was going to madrid to madrid it would go the only other choice was desertion and if marshal sanjurjos men caught you after you sneaked away orever so much worsewent over to the republicthey wouldnt waste a cigarette on you before they stood you against the closest wall they might not even waste a firing squads worth of bullets on you why should they when they could bash in your skull with a brick or hang you upside down cut your throat and bleed you like a stuck pig joaquin didnt want to go over to the republic he hated communists and anarchists and freethinkers and he had a low opinion of catalans too even if he hadnt hated all those people when the war started all the fighting hed done would have turned his heart to stone against them and deserting was too risky a healthy man of military age without papers to prove he really ought to be a civilian wouldnt last long and so resignedly delgadillo climbed aboard a beatup train with the rest of the men in the battalion and clattered north from gibraltar sergeant carrasquel checked the soldiers off one by one as they got on in front of him trying to skedaddle with the sergeants beady black eyes on you was worse than hopeless if you started thinking about getting out of line carrasquel knew it before you did hillsides were starting to turn green down in the south spring came early the calendar insisted it was still winter up on the far side of the pyreneesmaybe even up in madridit would be but the warm breezes blowing up from africa made the southern coast of spain almost tropical you wait somebody said when we get over the mountains itll be raining sure as the devil it wasand a cold nasty rain at that yes winter still ruled most of europe the closer they got to madrid the more sergeant carrasquel fidgeted damned russian planes shot us up last time i was here he said they shot us and bombed us and not a fucking thing we could do about it but pray will they do it again joaquin asked getting attacked from the air was even more terrifying than moving up under artillery fire he thought so while no one was shelling him anyhow sergeant carrasquel only shrugged and lit a canaria like everything else the local brand wasnt what it had been before the war he blew out a stream of smoke before answering im sure god knows amigo but he hasnt told me yet when he does i promise ill pass it along ears burning joaquin shut up the train rattled along one good thing about the rain those gray clouds scudding along overhead meant enemy aircraft couldnt get off the ground no matter how much their pilots might want to they also meant marshal sanjurjos planes couldnt fly but that didnt worry joaquin so much the train came in after dark so it got closer to the citycloser to the promised land so to speakthan hed thought it could rain still pattered down but it wasnt the only reason he couldnt see the great city hed come to take both sides observed a stringent blackout if anyone showed a light someone else would fire at it even in the absence of light the republicans artillery lobbed a few shells at the train somebody asked carrasquel how they could know where it was he gave the poor naive fellow the horse laugh did your mamacita tell you where babies come from he jeered theyve got spies same as we do sometimes i think every fourth guy in spain is a spy for one side or the otheror maybe both he was kidding on the square when the civil war broke out how many spaniards had ended up stuck behind the lines in a part of the country ruled by the faction they despised millions surely and lots of them would do what they could for their side when they found the chance early on general mola had bragged that he had four columns moving on madrid and a fifth inside the city ready to help as soon as the nationalist troops got closer the same held true all over the country when the republicans advanced as they sometimes did they could find traitors to help them too general molas four columns hadnt taken madrid the fifth column inside hadnt given enough help and the reds who held the city had massacred all the nationalist sympathizers they could get their hands onthousands of them people said it wasnt as if the nationalist martyrs hadnt been avenged either marshal sanjurjos authorities here must have known reinforcements were coming up from the south odds were the reinforcements had come because authorities here asked for them joaquin was no marshal but he could see that plain as day hed figured the authorities would have barracks ready for the newcomers or at least tents pitched in a field the muddy field was here so was the dripping night along with all his buddies joaquin got to wrap himself in a blanket and try to stay dry this is an embarrassment major uribe said angrily on behalf of my superiors men i apologize to you he apologized because his superiors never would joaquin could see that too sergeant carrasquel said this is the kind of shit that makes people go over to the other side they ought to whale the stuffing out of whoever couldnt be bothered to take care of us joaquin whistled softly anybody who opened his mouth that wide was liable to fall right in carrasquel had to know as much too but he didnt keep quiet you had to admire him for that rain or no rain mud or no mud joaquin fell asleep when he woke up the clouds had blown away and the sun was shining brightly and he could see madrid he took a good lookand winced and turned away it was too much like looking at the halfrotted corpse of what had been a beautiful woman two and a half years of bombing and shelling left madrid a skeletal wreck of its former self guns boomed there in the ruins a salvo of shells screamed toward the nationalists miserable encampment they burst well short but even somadrid might not be alive any more but like some movie monster it wasnt dead either marshal sanjurjos men had to take it and drive a stake through its heart if they could samuel goldman stared morosely at the bandages across the palms of his hands he was a wounded war veteran he walked with a limp because he was a wounded war veteran except during the last war hed never done hard physical labor none of that mattered to the nazis who ran munster jews went into work gangs that was what they were for it was so mean so unfair it made sarah goldman want to grind her teeth and scream at the same time you couldnt scream very well while you were grinding your teeth but that was beside the point instead of letting out a shriek that would have brought the neighbors and the police she asked do you want to put on more ointment papa he shook his head no i need to toughen up my hands pretty soon theyll have calluses then everything will be all right no it wont sarah exclaimed her fathers chuckle was also a wheeze well youre right sweetheart but it will as far as that goes anyhow i cant do anything about the rest somebody should be able to she said what do you want me to do samuel goldman asked write a letter to the fuhrer why not what have you got to lose you were a frontline soldier just like him maybe hed listen to you youve said it yourself things arent as bad for veterans as they are for other jews mmthats true for a moment sarah thought her father would pull out a piece of paper and start writing but he shook his head instead he looked even older and more tired than he had when he first came home from the labor gang what have i got to lose if i were just any jewish veteran i think i would send him a letter because i wouldnt have anything but with saulwith saul i would do better not to remind the authorities about us or do you think im wrong he meant the question seriously sarah respected him for that if she could find a reason to make him change his mind he would she respected him for that too but she saw at once that she couldnt find a reason like that no i just wish i did she said sadly everythings gone wrong and we cant do anything about it not everything her father said were all still here and three of us are together and if saul isnt he isnt anywhere the nazis are likely to look for him either ill tell you something else too what the fuhrer isnt the first ruler who hardened his heart against the jews pharaoh did the same thing in egypt more than three thousand years ago and look what it got him pesach isnt far away you know sarah eyed him in something not far from astonishment she didnt think shed ever heard him call the holiday pesach before when he said anything he said passover and it wasnt as if they were a religious or an observant family they ate pork theyd never bothered with matzoh during passover they didnt go to the synagogue even on the high holy days her surprise must have shown samuel goldman laughed softly youre right he said i never cared much about being a jew before so i was jewish and friedrich lauterbach was lutheran so what we were both germans werent we as a matter of fact no sarah said as a matter of fact yes as a matter of policy no even now father was relentlessly precise but if as a matter of policy the nazis wont let me be a german what else can i be only a jew and do you know what else what sarah whispered again fascinated and intrigued her father smiled a sad crooked smile i find i rather like it thats what i wish id been more of a jew when i had more of a choice i wish wed raised you and saul more in the faith hitler made me less assimilated than i thought i was and part of me wants to thank him for it isnt that funny sarah bent down and kissed him on the cheek he needed a shave his beard was rough under her lips oh good she exclaimed good he looked at her over the tops of his spectacles why because that means im not the only one who feels the same way she said very often you dont understand what something is worth till you run into someone who tries to tell you it isnt worth anything samuel goldman said and very often that turns out to be too late i can only hope it wont here if i thought it would do any good i would pray buthe spread his hands in apology to her or perhaps to godi still cant make myself imagine it helps make yourself believe it helps sarah corrected he smiled again more broadly this time make myself believe it helps he agreed thats what i meant to say i believe i am a jew all right whether i can believe i am a believing jewi am the kind of jew who enjoys making paradoxes like that which is probably not the kind of jew god had in mind when he made us well why did he make us the way we are then why did he make so many of us like that stubborn and crossgrained you mean now father was grinning from ear to ear something he hardly ever did he made us in his own image didnt he no wonder were this way youre having more fun playing with this than you ever did with the greeks and romans sarah made it half an accusation and her father to her astonishment went from grinning to blushing like a schoolgirl i sure am he said i didnt know it showed so much ive even started brushing up my hebrew and i havent cared a pfennig for it since my father and mother made me get barmitzvahed know what im thinking of trying next tell me sarah urged she was fascinated in spite of herself and had the feeling her father felt the same way aramaic samuel goldman said in a low voice he might have been someone who dabbled in drugs confessing that he planned to start shooting morphine into his veins all sarah knew about aramaic was that it was an ancient language growing up in a family that prided itself on its secularism on its germanness she hadnt learned much more about hebrew maybe that was why she blurted teach me teachyou her father echoed the idea might never have occurred to him before no no might about it plainly the idea never had occurred to him before but she nodded im not a blockhead you know i could learn it and you taught from the end of the last war till the nazis wouldnt let you do it any more you liked doing it too and everybody always said you were good at it what on earth would you do with aramaic dear samuel goldman asked or even hebrew come to that beats me sarah said cheerfully whatll you do with them father blinked then he started to laugh to tell you the truth i dont know either i just thought learning something new would help me pass the time of course pickandshovel work is liable to take care of that sarah nodded if youre able to go on with it yourself if youre not too tired a bargain her father held out one abused hand she solemnly clasped it he hesitated then went on i have found one possible use for all this oh sarah couldnt see any not at first then she thought she did you mean going to palestine if we ever got the chance mm that too for hebrewif we ever got the chance by the way father sounded he didnt think they would but that isnt what i meant i was thinking that if i asked god in one of his own languages why he was doing this to us i might possibly get an answer with a sigh of regretor exhaustionhe shook his head too much to hope for isnt it she wished she could tell him no but almost of its own accord her head bobbed up and down im sorry but im afraid it is pete mcgill listened to max weinstein spit out singsong syllables at wang wang answered damned if he didnt mcgill stared at max like most of the marines at the american legation in peking hed picked up a few chinese words and phrases himself most of them foul but hed never imagined hed be able to sling the lingo the way max did hed never imagined he would want to either what are you going back and forth with him about he asked has he got a nice clean sister shit mcgill drag your mind out of the gutter why doncha max said me and wang we were talking about mao tsetung about who about what for a second the name was just another singsong noise in petes ears then it rang a bell he looked disgusted he sounded that way too as he went on jesus christ on a fuckin pogo stick you go to all the trouble of learning that dumb language and what do you want to talk about a lousy red my aching back man worry about the important stuff first as far as he was a concerned women and food topped the list with weapons running a strong third he was a marines marine nobody ever said max couldnt hold his own in brawling and drinking he wasnt big but he didnt back away from anybody maos no lousy red he said maos the straight goods if anybody in this crappy country can give the japs grief maos the guy chiang kaishek pete mcgill began my ass weinstein said and then scuse me my ass corporal see the difference is chiangs all about chiang first last and always maos about china instead aint that right wang what you say wang wasnt about to admit he understood enough english to make sense of that but max started spouting chinese and waving his arms even in his own language wang answered cautiously pete knew why if wang sounded like a red hed lose his cushy post at the legation hed have to try to make an honest living instead if there was any such thing in china these days hes not telling me everything hes thinking max complained hes smartern you are thats why pete said and explained his own reasoning oh max grunted yeah i bet youre right thats just how the reactionaries who run the corps would respond to constructive classcentered criticism give it a rest willya pete said rolling his eyes i bet you even sound like a communist recruiting pamphlet when youre getting laid he did his best to imitate a pompous red proselytizer the triumph of the waddayacallit the proletariat cannot be deniedand wiggle your tongue a little over to the left sweetheart he laughed himself silly he thought that was funny whether max did or not after a second the jewish marine laughed too ah fuck you mcgill he said between chuckles then he got serious again you ever hear of a hooker in the states or here who wasnt from the proletariat gals who can find any other way to make a livingwell they do you get an extra charge out of feeling guilty when you screw em mcgill asked max couldnt claim he didnt lay chinese whores if he tried pete would call him a liar to his face even if that started a fight weinstein was one of the horniest marines in peking and that was saying something he gave pete the finger aside from that he didnt try to answer wang said something in chinese max replied in the same language pete didnt know just what he said but it sounded like a phrase that was definitely raunchy whatever it was wang giggled then he said something that set max snickering cmon mangive pete urged he says maos the really horny son of a bitch max answered maos gotta be up near fifty but he likes his broads youngeighteen twenty twentytwo like that wang says he likes a bunch of em in bed with him all at the same time too what a dirty old man pete said it wasnt that that didnt sound like fun and it wasnt that he didnt like young women either but he was young himself imagining a chinaman old enough to be his father in the middle of an orgy made him want to puke or at least to trade places after a few seconds he asked does captain horner know about this shit then he started laughing again this time on account of the captains name well i never told himi know that max got out between snickers of his own he went back and forth with wang in chinese again wang says he never talked about it with any other roundeye i believe him he doesnt know enough english to do it and how many leathernecks speak chinese you make one and everybody knows youre a queer duck mcgill said max flipped him off again ignoring that pete went on you really ought to pass this stuff to the captain he picks up as much intelligence as he can on the chinese and the japs yeah yeah max said pete knew what that meant or thought he did listen i dont care if you dont feel like telling cause itll make one of your precious red heroes look bad but i dont give a shit about that so if you dont pass it on i damn well will all right already shut up weinstein said shut up pete didthen three days later he quietly went up to captain horner the officer listened then nodded i heard some of this from weinstein but not all of it he said its interesting im not sure what i can do with ithell im not sure what the united states can do with it assuming its truebut it is interesting yes sir pete had hoped to get a bigger rise out of him maybe what horner had already heard from max took the edge off of it and maybe the captain had other things on his mind that didnt occur to pete till the following wednesday when a bombshell hit the american legation more than half the marines in the garrison would be transferred to shanghai effective immediately there are many more foreignersnot just americans but also europeansin shanghai than in peking horner told the assembled leathernecks we can be more useful there also shanghai is a port with direct connections to the united states he paused looking unhappy if the war between japan and china keeps getting worse moving our men between here and the coast may prove neither easy nor safe better to reduce our presence in peking now when we dont lose face by doing it under duress that sounded to pete as if the united states had to react to what was going on around itas if the country had little choice he would rather the usa dictated circumstances and didnt have to respond to them sometimes though you had to play the hand you were dealt even if it was a bad one captain horner displayed a couple of typewritten sheets of names several columns worth on each i shall post these as soon as we finish here he said if your name is on the list pack your kit and be ready to move tomorrow the japanese authorities have promised there will be no difficulties as we march to the train station he looked as if he were biting down on something nasty as he spoke that american marines should need japanese permission to move through peking but they did at least they had it questions the captain asked nobody had any if the other marines were anything like mcgill their only question was whether their name had made the list as soon as captain horner posted it everybody swarmed forward to see petes was there so were those of most of his buddies misery loves company he said and he wasnt joking he had a day to boil everything hed picked up in peking into a duffels worth of stuff some of the residue he could mail back to his folks jade and enamelwork and the like the resthe set it out for the marines who were staying behind take whatever you want and pitch the rest he told them he wasnt the only guy saying that eithernot even close somebody who stayed in peking would hit the jackpot with what other marines thought was junk whether hed get the chance to enjoy it might be a different question japanese and chinese stared at the leathernecks marching through the city some of the chinamen pointed and exclaimed the japs showed better discipline eyesfront sergeant larry koenig bawled mcgills head went to the front he kept looking around though koenig wouldnt catch him at itand he didnt the train flew american flags and had the stars and stripes painted on and on top of every car no one wanted another incident like the gunboat panays misfortune pete knew damn well he didnt he climbed onto the train his corporals stripes assured him of a seat the whistle screeched the train started to roll in a day or soshanghai well itll be different anyhow pete thought and lit up an old gold hideki fujita would have liked to see better weather before japan unleashed its attack along the ussuri other sergeants whod been stationed along this stretch of the border between manchukuo and the soviet union longer than he had laughed at him for saying so he would have bet even privates whod been stationed here a while laughed at him they knew better than to do it where he could catch them though he would have made them sorry he couldnt thump other sergeants as long as he didnt do anything permanent he could knock privates around as he pleased the hell of it was the laughing sergeants and even the laughing privates might be right this was the kind of place that had about twenty minutes of summer every year with a half hour of spring to warn you it was coming and another half hour of fall to warn you it was going if the army waited for perfect weather in which to strike it might still be waiting in this weather was a lot of things perfect it wasnt not unless you were a polar bear one blizzard after another howled down from siberia the swirling snow did let the japanese hide the men and materiel they brought forward for the attack of course it also made bringing troops and guns and munitions forward that much harder but if you complained about every little thing sergeant fujita did wonder whether the horrible weather also let the russians bring up reinforcements and guns when he mentioned that to lieutenant hanafusa the platoon commander indulged in what seemed to be everybodys favorite sport he laughed at fujita not likely sergeant hanafusa said the russians are too busy fighting the poles and the germans to even worry about us yes sir fujita said woodenly and dropped the subject like a live grenade he wasnt an educated man or anything he couldnt hold his own in an argument against somebody who was but he knew his own country was up to its armpits in china that didnt keep anybody from starting this new adventure russia was bigger than japan a hell of a lot bigger why shouldnt it also be able to pat its head and rub its stomach at the same time after a while snow started melting faster than it fell more and more bare ground appeared white no longer cloaked the pines and firs and spruces on both sides of the ussuri here and there flowers started blooming they sprouted with what struck fujita as frantic haste as if they knew they wouldnt have long to do whatever they did he wouldnt have called this spring in japan but it looked to be as much as the ussuri country had to offer lieutenant hanafusa seemed delighted spring comes early this year he exclaimed even the weather kami are on our side no one told him he was wrong fujita only hoped the spirits in charge of the weather knew what they were doing no not only he hoped the people in charge of the kwantung army knew what they were doing too whenever he got the chance he peered across the ussuri with field glasses he rarely glimpsed russians whatever the red army had over there it was concealed the japanese would find out when they crossed the riverno sooner he kept hoping the people in charge of things would change their minds hope was cheapno free and one of the big reasons it was free was that it was so unreliable men and guns kept right on moving up toward the ussuri fujita presumed planes did too but the airstrips were farther back so he didnt see them superior private shinjiro hayashi said please excuse me sergeant san but do our superiors believe the russians dont know were preparing an attack his education didnt keep him from seeing what also looked all too obvious to fujita if you think our superiors tell me what they believe hayashi youre dumber than i give you credit for and that isnt easy fujita snapped he quashed the university student without showing how worried he was himself he hoped he didnt show it anyhow if hayashi had suspicions he also had the common sense to keep quiet about them the japanese got a start hour on april the last couple of days dragged along everybody got ready and did his best to make sure the red army went on thinking everything was normalif that was what the red army thought when we detach vladivostok from the communists the emperor will be proud of us lieutenant hanafusa told his platoon as they waited for the barrage to begin sergeant fujita imagined marching into vladivostok he imagined the emperor pinning a medal on him with his own divine hand he imagined his heart bursting in his chest from pride the shelling opened right on time the noise was titanic the kwantung army was firing everything it had and firing as fast as it couldso it seemed to fujita anyhow hanafusas whistle shrilled lets go he said they raced out of the dugouts and ran for the boats waiting on the river as soon as they got in got over and got out they could start fighting a more ordinary kind of war russian shells were already dropping on the japanese side of the ussuri the barrage hadnt stunned all the reds then too bad even if fujita hadnt really believed it would the russians were just too good at covering up and digging in well no help for it he jumped into his assigned boat the whole squad made it in he cut the rope that tied the boat to the riverbank come on he yelled and started paddling like a man possessed the rest of the soldiers paddled with him he didnt want to go into the river with the heavy pack on his back hed sink like a stone and the water that splashed up onto him said it was bitterly cold even now russian machine guns on the far bank yammered out death tracers snarled past the boat bullets kicked up rows of splashes in the stream one holed the boat miraculously without hitting anybody water jetted in stuff something into that fujita shouted to the closest soldier the man did fujita didnt see what he didnt care as long as the leak slowed nobody would mud grated under the boats keel the japanese soldiers jumped out they ran toward the closest machinegun nest the sooner they knocked out those deadly toys the longer they were likely to live one of them exploded into red mist fifty meters from the enemy strongpoint mines everybody else yelled fujita wanted to run very fast and to stand very still both at the same time he might have guessed the russians would use mines to protect their positions but he didnt have to like it a couple of more men went down before the japanese chucked grenades into the dugout through the firing slit even that didnt do for all the russians one fellow staggered out all bloody his uniform shredded he raised his hands over his head tovarishchi he choked out fujita had heard that in mongolia comrades it meant he shot the russian in the face you cant shoot at us and then quit bastard he said from everything hed heard machine gunners everywhere had a hard time giving up and he might even have done the russian a favor he was inclined to think so what greater disgrace than surrender was there japanese soldiers stormed into the woods they soon discovered their artillery hadnt done everything it might have the russians had more machine guns farther back from the ussuri they had snipers in camouflage smocks high up in the trees theyd hidden more mines to slow and to channel the japanese advance and they had riflemen waiting in rearfacing foxholes invisible from the front men who stayed quiet till the japanese went by and then shot them in the back those fellows had as much trouble surrendering as machine gunners did airplanes dueled overhead in among the trees fujita couldnt see how the aerial combat went when bombs fell on the red army positions ahead he felt like cheering when explosions came too close to his own men he swore he thought the russians were taking more punishment than they were giving out but he wasnt sure maybe he was just rooting for his own team halfway through that mad afternoon a runner told him youre in command of the platoon huh he said what happened to lieutenant hanafusa he caught two in the chest the other soldier answered maybe hell make it but a shrug said the odds were bad fujita sure wouldnt have wanted to catch two in the chest or even one in the toe but if the platoon was hisat least till another officer showed uphe had to do his best with it they were still at least a kilometer from the days planned stop line he needed to find out what was up with the other squads too forward he called that was never wrong chapter twenty two moscow speaking the radio announced it was sergei yaroslavsky drank a glass of sugared tea hot from the samovar pilots and navigators jammed the ready room at the byelorussian airstrip a stuka could have taken out the whole squadron with a wellaimed bomb the nazis were sleeping lateor later anyhow the soviet flyers hungered for news not least because it might tell them what they would be doing next smoke from almost as many papirosi as there were red air force officers in the ready room blued the air somebody got up and made the radio louder when he sat down someone else patted him on the back as if to say good job yes they were all jumpy this early morning comrades soviet citizens our motherland has been invaded the news reader said solemnly without provocation without warning the empire of japan has launched a multipronged attack against the siberian districts of the russian federated soviet socialist republic of the peaceloving ussr severe fighting is reported in several areas all drives against the transsiberian railroad have already been blunted or soon will beso red army commanders in the field have assured general secretary stalin under his leadership victory of the soviet workers and peasants is assured sergei nodded so did almost everybody else in the ready room some officers he was sure had no doubts that what was coming out of the radio was the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and if you did have doubts looking as if you didnt was even more important people couldnt suspect what they didnt see the announcer went on and on about towns bombed from the air atrocities on the ground and numbers of japanese soldiers killed except for civilians he said not a word about soviet casualties there must have been some chances were they were heavy sergei was sure he wasnt the only one to notice the omission notice or not the red air force officers went right on nodding foreign commissar litvinov has pledged that this war against the japanese will have a result different from that of the tsars corrupt regime in the newsreader finished sergei cheered and clapped his hands so did everyone else nobody could be proud of russias performance in the russojapanese war after a pause the announcer talked about fighting in the soviet west the rasputitsa has made movement difficult for both sides he admitted that wasnt the smallest understatement sergei had ever heard eastern poland and western byelorussia were somewhere between swamp and bog the germans still occasionally flew off paved runways the red air force was grounded in western europe the fighting in france has reached what the germans call a decisive phase the fellow went on the french government denies german claims that there is fighting inside the paris city limits the french and english admit heavy fighting continues east and northeast and even north of the french capital they state they still hope to halt and eventually repel the latest german thrust however he spoke with an air of prissy disapproval like an important mans plump wife talking about the facts of life as far as the ussr was concerned the imperialists were hardly better than the fascists but the soviet union and england and france had the same enemies at the moment expedience could trump ideology and sure enough the newsreader sounded a little warmer when he said british and french bombing of german territory seems to be picking upjudging at least by the outraged bleats emanating from hen goebbels if one listens to the germans their opponents take care to bomb only schoolhouses orphanages and hospitals sergei chuckled then he wondered why he was laughing yes german propaganda was pretty hamfisted but wasnt what poured out of soviet radios just as clumsy that was something a good soviet citizen wasnt supposed to notice after all didnt pravda mean truth maybe only someone who was serving in the militarymaybe only someone serving in the military whod spent some time in a foreign countrywould notice the discrepancies once you spotted a few lies though you started wondering what else you heard was malarkey across the table anastas mouradian sat there smoking papirosi one after another did irony fill his liquid black eyes or was that only sergeis imagination anastas was going to get in trouble one of these days anybody who looked ironic in the middle of the morning news was bound to get noticed the only surprise was it had already taken this long when the announcer shifted to increased production and overfulfillment of the fiveyear plans norms the officers started to relax this was only fluff theyd already got the meat from the news if you were careful you could smile about this stuff without risking too much at last music replaced the news two fronts remarked the flyer from siberia the guy who came from a thousand kilometers north of irkutsk and laughed at the cold weather here quickly bogdan koroteyev added its not what we wanted of course but its what weve got well win anyhow anastas mouradian said sergei nodded vigorously he grinned at his crewmate that was how you were supposed to talk he had his doubts whether anastas meant it but what did that have to do with anything the picture you showed the outside world was more important to your survival anyhow than whatever you carried deep inside your heart youd better believe we will lieutenant colonel borisov boomed we can whip the little yellow monkeys with one hand tied behind our back and as soon as things are dry here well show the nazis and poles what we can do no one argued with the squadron commander for one thing he was the squadron commander for another what he said was bound to be the party line russia hadnt beaten the japanese the last time around but it was easy to blame that on tsarist corruption as the radio announcer had the red army had performed well in recent border clashes well it had if you believed the news sergei wished he hadnt started wondering about what he heard on the radio and read in the papers it made him wonder about everything oh well what could you do doubting the official stories might give you a better notion of what was really going on what was the phrase in the bible you saw through a glass darklythat was it in the ussr that was likely to be your closest approach to truth no enemy planes came overhead if german or polish bombers had taken off from paved runways they were harassing other soviet fields and the sbs here couldnt fly even if the pilots wanted to as with the winter blizzards the flyers had nothing to do but sit around and wait somebody pulled out a bottle of vodka it was early to start drinking sergei thought so anyhow by the way bogdan koroteyev tilted back the bottle he started at this heathen hour all the timeor maybe he hadnt stopped from the night before sergei took a swig too when the bottle came his way why not you didnt want to look like a wet blanket or anything newsboys hawked the volkischer beobachter on every street corner in berlin decisive battle in france they yelled decisive battle in france the newspaper headline shouted in what had to be point type the photo under the headline showed three wehrmacht men rifles in hand leaping over some obstacle in unison except for the weapons and helmets they might have been olympic hurdlers nothing can stop our infantry the subhead boasted paper lady asked a towheaded kid of about fourteen if the war lasted long enough hed put on the same uniform the soldiers on the front page were wearing see how you like it then you little son of a bitch peggy druce thought aloud all she said was nein danke in another block or two she knew shed have to do it again boys old men womenthe only men of military age were cops soldiers and sailors on leave and middleaged fellows whod been too badly wounded in the last war to have to wear the uniform this time around she supposed some farmers and doctors and factory workers were also exempt but she didnt see them whatever jobs they had they were busy doing them another newsboy cried a different headline soviet russia now encircled in a ring of steel several people stopped to pay a few pfennigs for his paper the germans like that idea when they thought about it they didnt have to think that the reich was fighting a twofront war peggy wouldnt have called a halfassed fight over here and what might be a bigger more serious one way the hell over there a ring of steel a ring with gaps so big would fall off your finger pretty damn quick but the goebbels school of newspaper writing had perpetrated far worse atrocities even a hearst headline man might have come up with this one a big beefy cop came out of his tavern he was in his fifties with a big mustache hed probably grown before the last war and never bothered to shave off at the moment he was using a prehensile lower lip to suck beer foam out of it he saw peggy watching him do it to cover his embarrassment he did just what shed known he would he held out his hand and said papieren bitte out came her american passport here she said im a neutral as you see he scowled at the passport and at her in the struggle against bolshevism and world jewry there can be no neutrals he declared some germans really did talk that way the same as some communists really did parrot the moscow line then he said come to the station with me so my captain can decide what to do with you to the station peggy yelped youve got no right i am an officer of police the cop said importantly of course i have the right in hitlers germany he damn well did too he touched the billy club on his belt do you defy my authority ill bust your head open if you do no she said but let me see your papers please i will complain to my embassy and i want to know who you are ha much good it will do you he showed her his id willingly enough his name was lorenz muller peggy wrote it down she didnt think the embassy would be able to do anything either but it was the only card she had so she played it with as much panache as she could the station was only a couple of blocks away except for his uniform and haircut the desk sergeant looked like a desk sergeant back in the states fat and bored but wary in other words muller spewed out a stream of german too fast for peggy to follow it the sergeant listened then turned to her what happened he asked i said i was a neutral and i amim an american and he got angry at me and brought me here peggy answered an american let me see your passport please when the desk sergeant said please he sounded as if he meant it peggy handed him the passport after studying it he gave it back yes it is in order danke schon you may go what lorenz muller spluttered furiouslyfor about a second and a half then without raising his voice the desk sergeant gave him the most thorough reaming out peggy had ever heard she understood maybe one word in three but that was plenty muller wouldve needed to get plopped into a specimen jar as soon as he was born to be as congenitally idiotic as the sergeant claimed and he would have had to be years old to have acquired all the vices the sergeant imputed to him by the time the man got done nothing was left of muller but a demoralized puddle of goo on the floor so it seemed to peggy anyhow i am sorry you ran into thisindividual the desk sergeant told her shed never dreamt the word could sound so filthy by all means visit your embassy a formal complaint will go into his record which is good by then she didnt want to she found herself pitying muller which she wouldnt have dreamt possible a few minutes earlier as she walked out of the station the sergeant tore into the cop againsomething about getting the reich in bad with an important neutral power lets hear it for the red white and blue peggy thought yeah lets in the end she did go by the embassy the underlings quickly shunted her up to constantine jenkins whose job probably included dealing with obstreperous tourists he heard her out and then said sounds like the sergeant did worse to this fellow than we could manage in a month of sundays aint it the truth she said all the same i do want you to make a formal complaint just remember that the official head of the prussian police is hermann goring jenkins said he wont listen if he does listen he wont care i understand all that peggy said i still want to get it on the record okay ill do it jenkins promised maybe itll keep some other american from getting dragged to a police station because he runs into a cop in a lousy mood thatd be good peggy said see im a public benefactor shed been a lot of things in her time but that was a new one undersecretary jenkins gave her a look that would have been fishy if not for the halfhidden amusement she spotted what you are is a troublemaker he said accurately and you enjoy making trouble for the third reich too who me peggy couldnt possibly have been as innocent as she sounded and as a matter of fact she wasnt hansulrich rudel gulped from a big mug of steaming black coffee plenty of pilots in the squadron were keeping themselves going with benzedrine hansulrich thought pills were even more unnatural than alcohol he didnt want to use them if he had to though if it meant victory for the reich and any one mission might he knew that they were so close so close the radio kept going on about the battle of france the decisive battle if they could break through the enemys lines hed never be able to form new ones maybe nobody in the whole battle could see that as well as the flyers who went after the french strongpoints he wondered whether the allied fighter pilots had that same sense of seeing the whole chessboard at once when they looked down from five or six thousand meters or were they just trying to spot the stukas before the german divebombers roared down and blasted another bridge or train or battery of s to hell and gone he shrugged he had more immediate things to worry about the german attack had accomplished a lot it had knocked the low countries out of the war it had pushed french and english ground forces back from the middle of belgium to the outskirts of paris the enemy was on the ropes but he wasnt out worse luck and while german supply lines had got longer and thinner those of the allies had contracted the irony facing the germans was that success made further success harder nobody on the other side could be in much doubt about what the wehrmacht and the luftwaffe had in mind any more either that made planning easier for the forces in khaki which didnt mean the forces in feldgrau couldnt still win hansulrich was flying off an airstrip in northern france not long before it had been a french strip a couple of smashed french fighters still lay alongside the runway german technicians had cannibalized them for usable partsthey were just scrap metal now off in the distance artillery rumbled rudel hoped it came from his own side giving the allies hell otherwise french and english guns would be pounding the landsers he thanked god he was no foot soldier he slept soft and in a real beda cot anyway he ate well most of the time he was in no danger the enemy could still kill him that came with any kind of military life but he wouldnt be hungry and filthy and lousy when it happened if it happened he wasnt scared all the time either of course when he was he was about as scared as any human being could be that also held true for the infantry though it was true for the ground pounders a lot more often than it was for him too sergeant dieselhorst came by a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth he sketched a salute and asked have they told you what were doing next not yet hansulrich pointed toward major bleyles tent as soon as the boss lets me know ill tell you if they havent hauled him off in the middle of the night dieselhorst remarked hansulrich looked around in all directions nobody stood close to them and nobody seemed to be paying any attention to what they were saying even so he wagged a finger at the rear gunner if you arent careful theyll haul you off in the middle of the night he warned yeah i know dieselhorst made a sour face thats not what i signed up for dammit neither did i rudel said who would have dreamt so many traitors to the vaterland were still running around loose yeah who dieselhorst said tonelessly the cigarette twitched as he eyed hansulrich at last almost against his better judgment he went on who knows how many of them really are traitors too what else would they be if the government arrested them hansulrich exclaimed sergeant dieselhorsts cigarette jerked again thats right youre the milk drinker he might have been reminding himself sometimes people get arrested because they tell friends the truth sometimes they get arrested because somebody with pull doesnt like them and sometimes by god they get arrested for no reason at all dirty traitors tried to overthrow the fuhrer and stab us in the back again rudel said hotly where would we be if theyd got away with it better off albert dieselhorst suggested then he held up his hand and if you dont care for that go tell one of the pigdogs in a black shirt about it youll have a new gunner faster than you can fart i dont want a new gunner i want before hansulrich could say what he wanted dieselhorst did it for him you want a good little boy who never makes trouble and never looks past the end of his nose unless hes aiming at the enemy you want somebody just like you i wish i were lieutenantyou can bet your ass itd make my life simpler but ive got palsbetter germans than ill ever bein concentration camps or dead because those ss bastards hauled em out of bed in the middle of the night this isnt russia dammit this is a civilized country or its supposed to be had a flyer rudel didnt know well said anything like that he would have reported the man to the ss without the least hesitation but he was alive not least because sergeant dieselhorst was good at what he did by any reasonable definition dieselhorst was a good german a patriotic german if he was talking this way youre upset youre not yourself hansulrich said dieselhorst stamped out the cigarette im not crazy if thats what youre trying to say this whole war is a lot more fucked up than youve figured out yet and some of the people whore running it dont say any more i dont want to listen to it rudel said all i have to do is fly the same with you too christ lieutenant flying is the easy partany jerk with an airplane can do that dieselhorst said trying to steer clear of the shit that pours down from on high thats where the going gets tough well lets see what we have to do thats all hansulrich was grateful for the chance to turn away as far as sergeant dieselhorst was concerned he was part of the shit that poured down from on high theyd gone through much too much together for hansulrich to feel easy about turning in the sergeant now hed keep his mouth shutfor the moment anyway gisors major bleyle said a few minutes later theyre pushing supplies through there to the front near beauvais he whacked a map with a pointer gisors is about seventy kilometers northwest of paris youll recognize it by the castle and the cathedral here are some photos he passed around the reconnaissance shots railroad and highway pick your targets when we get there well try to knock out both routes questions he waited nobody raised a hand all right then good luck everybody rudel and dieselhorst stuck to business as the pilot taxied the stuka out of the revetment and got it into the air hansulrich felt bruised by their earlier encounter he wondered if dieselhorst did too one more thing he couldnt ask messerschmitt s accompanied the jus as they flew west hansulrich hadnt seen a for quite a while the twoengined fighters hadnt lived up to expectations over the north sea and england maybe theyd gone back to the shop for retooling or maybe the idea wasnt as good as the high foreheads in the design bureau thought it would be antiaircraft fire came up as soon as they crossed the front it was heavy and alarmingly accurate the allies had more and more guns shooting at the luftwaffe they knew what was at stake here as well as the germans did french and british fighters attacked too the s darted away to take them on then more fighters jumped the divebombers they were french machines not too fast and not too heavily armed the s outclassed them stukas unfortunately didnt hansulrich threw his all over the sky trying to dodge the enemy fighters it was like trying to make a rhinoceros dance even when you did it the result was none too graceful sergeant dieselhorsts machine gun chattered again and again how you doing back there rudel asked him they havent shot me yet thats something anyway the rear gunner answered how are we doing it was a fair questionseveral bullets had hit the stuka everything shows green hansulrich said a ju could take a lot of punishment the war had shown that the divebomber needed to rudels head might have been on a swivel now which way is gisors hed done so much frantic jinking he didnt know north from sauerkraut he spotted what he thought was the cathedral steeple a moment before major bleyles voice dinned in his earphones abort break off were losing too many planes devil take me if i will hansulrich muttered to himself to sergeant dieselhorst he added i have the target im going into my dive what about bleyles orders what about em rudel shoved the control column forward the stukas nose went down acceleration slammed him back against the armored seat damned if that wasnt a truck column on the road even if this wasnt gisors after allplenty of little french towns had cathedralshed do some damage he yanked at the bombrelease lever then pulled up for all he was worth in the rear seat sergeant dieselhorst whooped what a fireworks show they must have been hauling ammo gut sehr gut hansulrich said officially of course i never heard the majors order to withdraw what order was that sir dieselhorst said innocently rudel laughed then grimaced ignoring orders disobeying ordersonce such things started where did they stop with trying to overthrow the fuhrer but i helped the reich more than i would have by obeying he thought maybe the conspirators had felt the same way he shrugged he was loyal he knew it his superiors did too pretty soon theyd refill the stukas gas tank and bomb her up again and he and dieselhorst would go off and try this again and if they came back from that run theyd do it one more time and one more after that till the war was won and they didnt have to worry about it any more as long as you looked at things the right way they were pretty simple somebody kicked willi dernen in the ribs he grunted and folded up on himself and tried to go back to sleep after a few seconds the german marching boot thudded into him again he grunted once more louder this time reluctantly his eyes opened there you go corporal baatz said time to get moving again your mother arno dernen said with great determination he screwed his eyes shut again arno baatz kicked him yet again this time with real malice he knew just where to put a boot to make it hurt most willi wondered how he knew had he learned in noncom school along with other bastardry or maybe from an ss interrogator or was it just natural talent it worked the same any which way willi sat up clutching at the injured part as with macbeth baatz had murdered sleep get it in gear he snapped nobody put you on leave willi staggered to the bushes to take a leak he was still yawning when he came back no one who hadnt been through a campaign had the faintest notion of how exhausting war was some men could get kicked almost to death without waking up let alone marching the mechanism simply wore down willi wasnt there yet but he wasnt far from that dreadful place maybe breakfast would help then again maybe it wouldnt he took out his mess tin and advanced on the field kitchen the cooks spooned the tin full of slop they called it porridge but that gave it too much credit they took everything remotely edible they could find and boiled it all together in a giant kettle it ended up tasting the way library paste smelled the coffee by contrast was pretty good that was because it wasnt wehrmacht issue like the cigarettes the landsers smoked it was the good stuff foraged from french farms and villagesand no doubt corpses wolfgang storch already had a tin cups worth you know youre beat to shit when even this stuff wont make your heart turn over he said sadly tell me about it willi agreed he gulped the coffee anyway he certainly didnt move slower with it inside him if he moved any slower hed be dead the stink that fouled what should have been a fine spring morning reminded him how easy dying was these days the wehrmacht was still pushing forward so what he smelled were mostly dead frenchmen dead germans were no sweeter to the nose though lieutenant krantz took advantage of having most of his men gathered together we have to get through the platoon commander said earnestly we arent as far along as we ought to be the more we fall behind schedule the better the chance we give the enemy if he stops us here he can reinforce his positions north of paris that wouldnt be goodnot a bit a few of the soldiers eating breakfast and smoking managed weary nods willi didnt have the energy he knew too damned well why they hadnt come farther or gone faster anybody with a gram of sense did the terrain in the ardennes sucked and they didnt have enough panzers along to punch through the frenchmen and their friends blocking the way west most of the goodiesand most of the air supportwent to the right wing the one punching ahead somewhere to the northwest the plan had almost worked in the last war the high command had decided it just needed to make the fist a little bigger this time around and maybe the high command knew what it was doing and maybe it had its head up it ass one reason you fought wars was to find out things like that willi washed out his mess tin and stowed it on his belt he put on his helmet and picked up his mauser the rifle was just over four kilos it only seemed to weigh a tonne he couldnt even sling it he had to carry it insteadthe french were too damned close as if to remind him of that a hotchkiss machine gun stuttered awake the malign rattle made his asshole pucker somewhere up ahead lay laon which the germans had been bombing and shelling for days how many french soldiers still crouched in the ruins with rifles and machine guns and grenadeswaiting come on lieutenant krantz said weve got to move up and that damned gun is in the way well im awake now willi thought as he heaved himself to his feet raw terror burned away exhaustion and anybody who had to stalk a wellsited machine gunand this one would be because the frenchies knew how to play the game toomade an intimate acquaintance with terror farms in these parts were small stone fences separated one from another poilus lurked behind the fences every so often one of them would pop up and shoot or a mortar team would lob a couple of bombs from god knew where willi hated mortars you couldnt hear the rounds coming till they got right on top of you which was just exactly too late there wolfgang pointed the machine gun was firing from a stone farmhouses window narrowed to a slit with more building stones willi swore under his breath this one would be a bitch and a half to get rid of the position was shielded against anything this side of an antitank gun or maybe it wasnt lieutenant krantz spoke into the radio set a lancecorporal got to lug fifteen minutes later a fellow with a couple of tanks on his back and a sinisterlooking nozzle in his hand came forward everyone shied away from him he didnt seem to care or maybe he was used to the response by now keep them busy all right he said the german soldiers nodded you wanted a flamethrower man on your side to succeed but you felt faintly guilty when he did nobody mourned a flamethrower man who got roasted by his own hellish device either and willi had never heard of anyone who managed to surrender with that apparatus on his back but that wasnt his worry except at one remove he raised up from behind a boulder and took a shot at the machine guns firing slit he ducked back down as soon as hed pulled the triggerand a good thing too because the hotchkiss promptly spat lead his way the froggies in the farmhouse were mighty alert willi hoped the miserable bastard with the flamethrower had his life insurance paid up one of his buddies groaned somebody else yelled for a medic if you poked a bear in its den you were liable to get clawed the last thing willi wanted was to rise up again and shoot at the slit he did it anyway which proved what a strong thing wehrmacht training wasand even more how powerful was his fear of looking bad in front of his squadmates without that fundamental fear nobody could have fought a war when he rose up one more time the muzzle of the hotchkiss was pointing straight at him before the frenchies could shoot him though the flamethrower man used his toy foomp even across several hundred meters willi heard the manmade dragons noise fire engulfed the machine gun and the firing slitand whoever had the bad luck to be right behind them german soldiers whooped even so nobody seemed especially eager to show himself maybe more frenchmen had dragged their charred friends away from the trigger and were waiting to give optimists or foolsassuming there was a differencea nasty surprise the flamethrower man solved that problem he crawled right up to the farmhouse stuck his nozzle into the firing slit and foomp he cocked his head to one side as if listening then he waved no more trouble here the gesture said willi still wasnt enthusiastic about standing up but he did the soldiers trotted forward as smoke rose from the farmhouse the breeze came out of the west as it commonly did willis nose wrinkled along with woodsmoke he caught the reek of burnt meat the flamethrower had done its job all right even so nobody wanted much to do with the fellow who carried it he stood there a little more smoke trailing from the snout of his infernal machine again he didnt seem particularly surprised or disappointed well why would he how many times had he seen this same response by now lieutenant krantz pointed toward laon his officers whistle squealed come on he yelled not far now follow me an officer who said that made his troops want to do it all the same the infantrymen hesitated that rattling clatter out of the east getting louder nowpanzers willi said in delight our panzers he hadnt seen many of them these two little panzer is were no more than mobile machinegun nests better than a poke in the eye with a carrot though both panzer commanders stood up in their turrets they waved to the foot soldiers who returned the compliment come with us one of the men in black coveralls shouted over engine noise keep the french pigdogs away and you keep them away from us lieutenant krantz said the panzer commander whod spoken before nodded everybody needed help now and then willi loped along to the left of the panzers a french machine gun fired at them which was stupid its bullets couldnt hurt them one of the panzers crushed the sandbagged position turning back and forth and round and round on top of it to make sure nothing in there survived then a rifle of a sort willi hadnt heard before went offa big boom that would have set anyones teeth on edge what followed wasnt the ping of a ricochet either that round punched clear on through the baby panzers thin frontal armor the machine kept going in a straight line till it rammed a big oak and stopped drivers hit willi realized german had antitank rifles too but you didnt expect to run up against one right after youd finally picked up some armor war wasnt what you expected it was what you got what the surviving panzer got was out of there its crew knew that antitank rifle could do for them too and it did two rounds into the engine compartment turned the panzer into an immobile machinegun nest we go on regardless lieutenant krantz declared willi was still willing to advance able hed just have to see vaclav jezek sprawled behind a chunk of chimney that a shell hit had detached from a nearby house he chambered another round in his antitank rifle and waited the crew of that disabled panzer i wouldnt stay inside long a hit from any kind of artillery would mangle them and torch them at the same time a couple of more hits from the antitank rifle might set the tank on fire sure enough the commander clambered out of the turret the czech was ready despite a muzzle brake and a padded stock the antitank rifle slammed his shoulder when he pulled the trigger hed already seen that although these mm armorpiercing rounds werent designed to kill mere human beings they did one hell of a job the german in black coveralls never knew what hit him he tumbled off the tank and lay still the driver was sneakier or maybe smarter he scuttled out and kept the tanks carcass between him and jezek till he bolted for some trees jezek shot at him too but missed shit he said in disgust sergeant halevy had dug himself a foxhole a few meters away and fronted it with bricks and stones from the ruined house dont get yourself in an uproar he said you did what you were supposed to do neither one of those tanksll bother us any more fuck it vaclav said i should have finished the other cocksucker too you cant kill all of them by yourself the jew said remember youve got to leave some for me heh jezek said before the shooting started hed had doubts about how well jews would fight yeah hitler was giving them a hard time but they were still jews werent they once they had rifles in their hands they seemed to do just fine youd better dig in halevy said if the tanks couldnt do for us theyll see how the artillery works without raising his head vaclav pulled the entrenching tool off his belt and started scraping out a foxhole of his own halevy knew how the germans operated all right even now some junior officer with a radio or a field telephone was probably talking to his regimental hq telling the gunners at which map square the trouble lay fifteen minutes of fire ought to soften things up hed say and hed get that artillery fire too the germans were mighty damn slick about such things vaclav had seen as much in czechoslovakia and here in france they wouldnt have been half so dangerous if they werent so blasted good at what they did he wondered how good the defenders were czechs frenchmen belgians driven back from their own country englishmen negro troops from some colony or otherwhatever the french marshals didnt urgently need somewhere else seemed to be jammed into a military sausage around laon now if the casing didnt split and spill soldiers all over everywhere sure as hell here came the guns huddling in his scrape vaclav wished it were twice as deep or even four times he hated artillery more than anything else german infantry made a fair fight you could even face panzers his monster rifle helped even the odds but what could you do with artillerymen hope your own sides guns slaughtered themthat was all it didnt seem enough most of the shells were longnot very long but jezek took whatever he could get if the troops a little farther back had hell coming down on their heads he didnt he could think of plenty of times when the nazis artillery had been right on target as soon as the shelling stopped he came up out of his trench ready to fight the germans counted on stunning their opponents at least for a little while he kept an eye on the tank whose driver hed shot the one that had slammed into the oak if the germans could get the other driver into the machine it might come back to life he wouldnt have wanted to sit down on a seat soaked with his predecessors blood but war made you do all kinds of things you didnt want to we can do it sergeant halevy shouted in czech then he said what was probably the same thing in french in czech he went on theyve got to be at the end of their tether if we stop them theyre really stopped how could he know that nobody in the middle of a battle knew a damn thing it sure sounded good though the germans came forward vaclav had known they would they were bastards but they were brave bastards and they exposed themselves as little as they could which made them smart bastards no new panzers rolled up for which he thanked the god in whom he had more and more trouble believing he wasnt thrilled about using the antitank rifle as an oversized snipers piecethe fight with the french quartermaster sergeant lingered painfully in his memorybut he wasnt thrilled about getting killed in his hole either he could literally have killed elephants with this rifle knocking over a few nazis while they were still a long way off would make the rest go to ground and not move forward so fast it would also make him wish some quartermaster sergeant could issue him a new shoulder but that was one more thing hed worry about later it worked out just the way hed hoped that stood out because it happened so rarely in this war he hit two germans with four shots which slowed the rest of them down to an amazing degree then of course the antitank rifles loud roar and big blast of fire from every round drew the enemys concentrated attention ordinary mausers werent especially accurate out close to a kilometer off but they made him keep down and he could have done without the machine gun probing for him he really could have done without the mortar bombs that started raining down on the allied front they did their best to make up for the artillerys poor performance if one of them landed in your hole you were dead because you couldnt do anything about it but then for a wonder alliedprobably frenchmortars closer to laon opened up on the germans so did a couple of batteries of s that had stayed quiet and hidden up till now those s were weapons from the last war and outclassed these dayswhich didnt mean they couldnt kill you if they got the chance the german mortars quit firing quite suddenly thus encouraged vaclav stuck his head upand plugged a soldier in fieldgray whod made the mistake of coming out from behind the dead cow hed been using for cover jezek ducked down again right away a good thing too because nothing had taken out that german machine gun it sent a long angry burst after him fuck me sergeant halevy called from his nearby hole maybe we really will stop these assholes he hadnt believed it before then well who could blame him vaclav hadnt believed it either he still wasnt sure he did more french troops came up to join the ragtag and bobtail on the front line they wore khaki instead of the last wars horizon blue but their uniforms still looked oldfashioned next to those the enemy wore still and all jezek wasnt inclined to fuss oldfashioned or not they were here and they were shooting at the germans what more could you want and the germans themselves werent what they had been when the war broke out they remained consummate professionals and hed remembered a moment before how brave they were but they were also flesh and blood they were every bit as worn out and ragged as the allied troops they faced it was like the later rounds of a championship prize fight both sides were bloodied both half out on their feet but they kept slugging away the prize here was even sweeter than money this fight was for power damned if one of the german mortars didnt start up again several of the frenchmen whod just come up screamed like damned souls the butchers bill rose again thus encouraged the men in fieldgray put in another attack vaclav blew the head right off one of them with the antitank rifle and those frenchmen had brought along several machine guns the german weapon might be better but the hotchkiss sufficed for all ordinary purposes of slaughter no infantry no matter how good could advance in the face of fire like that sullenly taking as many of their wounded with them as they could the germans drew back when vaclav reached for another clip he discovered hed run dry well he had a pistol and at least one of those frenchmen didnt need his rifle any more any which way it didnt look as if the wehrmacht could break into laon alistair walsh gave the junior lieutenant who brought the order a hard look he wanted to pretend he hadnt heard it or at least hadnt understood it were going to do whatsir he said normally that tone from a staff sergeant old enough to be his father would have wilted a subaltern but this youngster just up to the front from somewhere to let him keep his uniform clean and even pressed was strengthened by the holy writ from headquarters were going to counterattack he repeated brightly cant very well let the boches have their own way all the time eh counterattack with what walsh demanded christ on his cross its everything we can do and a little more besides he added silentlyto hang on where we are forces to be committed include the subaltern rattled off several regiments british and french those should be plenty to shift the germans hereabouts dont you think well they would be walsh said he finally got a frown from the young officer what do you mean arent they in this vicinity this is where they are reported to be oh bloody hell walsh muttered he did his best to explain the facts of life well sir pieces of them are you might say whats left of them after the boches spent these past weeks banging on them with hammers and rocks what is your estimate of their relative combat effectiveness the subaltern asked sir im just a sergeant walsh said a staff sergeant whod served in the last war wasnt just a sergeant walsh wondered whether the second lieutenant understood that about even money he guessed with a mental sigh he went on the only reason we havent come to pieces near as i can see is that the germans have it about as bad as we do he had much more sympathy for the fritzes in the front linepoor bloody infantry just like himthan he did for the starched gormless creature standing before him now no matter what you thought a single pip on each shoulder strap didnt turn you into gods anointed isee the subaltern said slowly maybe he did have some notion of walshs station after all or maybe not i am here to deliver these orders not to adjust them the attack will go in is that clear sir its bleeding madness walsh said the lieutenant only waited walsh sighed and swore gods anointed or not those pips meant the youngster could break him like a rotten stickafter which the attack would go in anyway sure as hell sometimes the real enemy wore the same uniform as you a precise salute yes sir ill tell the men an equally precise reproach the subalterns cheeks reddened as if hed been slapped he felt that all right i should be honored to go forward with you he said never mind sir walsh said wearily its not your fault its just war when bill got the word he grimaced and shrugged well were fucked now in his broad northern accent it came out fooked which only added to the point its bloody murder is what it is nigel said i thought field marshal haig did his worst in the last war he had an education all righthe hadnt been born when haig was doing his worst walsh whod lost a slightly older cousin in the mud at passchendaele was inclined to agree what could he do though not a damned thing except go forward as long as the german guns let him no help for it he said maybe the germans really are on the ropes maybe babies really do come from under cabbage leaves too nigel said not likely though we wouldnt have so much fun makin em if they did bill said walsh laughed at that barrage should start at itshe paused to look at his watch now as soon as the guns let up we go forwardand may god go with us on the western front in the last war barrages sometimes lasted a week they were supposed to kill all the enemy soldiers and flatten all the wire between the side doing the bombarding and a breakthrough well theory was wonderful long barrages warned an attack was coming they didnt kill enough defenders and the ones who lived always got to their machine guns before the attackers reached their line one reason was that bombardments didnt flatten enough wire but did tear up the ground so attacking troops couldnt move fast even when they most needed to short and sweet worked better even in theyd figured that out enough to shock enough to wound not enough to throw away surprise and then the infantryand the tanks when there were tankswould go in and clean up the mess they had driven the germans backin bill had a flask of applejack he passed it around walsh took a nip with the other waiting british soldiers a little dutch courage never hurt anybody at on the dot guns back in paris opened up on the germans in the suburbs german counterbattery fire started right away walsh didnt mind as long as those s were shooting at the allied guns they werent pounding the front lines after not quite half an hour the bombardment stopped up and down the front officers whistles screeched walshs heart thuttered in his chest he was probably pale as paste he told himself it wouldnt be so bad as going over the top but hed been a kid then now he knew all the nasty things that could happen to you he didnt want to get shot again but he didnt want to seem a coward in front of his men either lets go he said hoarsely and they went hed barely crossed the street before a mauser round cracked past him no the bombardment hadnt got everybody how many fritzes waited in foxholes and shattered buildings too damned manyhe was sure of that he almost stumbled over a german crouching behind some rubble the man was trying to bandage one hand with the other he threw up both of them and bleated kamerad when he saw walsh who would take care of prisoners anybody or would people behind the lines shoot them to save themselves the bother walsh knew such things happened he bent down and threw the wounded germans rifle into some bushes gesturing with his own weapon he said go on go on what happened later wasnt his worry danke the fritz said off he went both hands still above his head walsh forgot about him as soon as he was gone plenty of other germans ahead and not all the bastards would be bleeding he was glad to hear bren guns banging away they brought real firepower right up to the front you could carry one and fire from the hip or even from the shoulder you couldnt move forward fast not in this smashed suburb wreckage slowed you down too much stubborn germans lurking in the wreckage were liable to slow you down for good but the enemy seemed less stubborn than usual maybe the counterattack had surprised and dismayed them as much as it had walsh stranger things must have happened though he couldnt come up with one offhand something warned him to throw himself down behind a burntout citroen only a few seconds after he did two germans with schmeissers came out of what was left of a house walsh pulled the pin on a grenade and rose up onto his knees to send it flying a soft thump a guttural cry of alarm and a bang all packed close together shrieks followed both fritzes were down walsh shot them one after the other to make sure they didnt get up again he scurried forward and grabbed a submachine gun and as many clips as the germans carried he slung his rifle so he could go forward carrying the schmeisser at close quarters he wanted to be able to spray a lot of lead around nigel came up and took the other german weapon walsh shared ammunition with him this is going better than i expected the youngster remarked i was thinking the same thing in lieu of knocking wood walsh rapped his knuckles on his own tin hat nigel managed a haggard grin walsh gave him a gitanewhat he hadlit one of his own and tramped ahead again he found one german fast asleep on what had been some french merchants bed the artillery hadnt wakened him neither had the allied infantry assault walsh knew just how the poor bugger felt hed felt that way himself he carried away the germans mauser and dropped it in the mud he left the man alone without a weapon the fellow was no threat to anybody and this would be allied ground by the time he woke up damned if it wont walsh said in tones of wonder maybe the generals and even that snotnosed subaltern knew what they were up to after all and if they did wasnt that the strangest thing of all schmeisser at the ready walsh pressed on gerhard elsner strode over to ludwig rothe who was adding oil to his panzers crankcase still running all right the company co asked anxiouslythered been a lot of wear and tear in the drive across the low countries and france but rothe answered you bet captain good thats what i want to hear elsner said tomorrow morning we smash them we go through south of beauvaisbetween there and a village called alonne three or four kilometers of open ground we wont have to fight in builtup places thats what they tell me anyhow heres hoping theyre rightwhoever they are that gets expensive fast rothe said he turned to his driver and radioman but well be ready right fritz bittenfeld and theo hossbach both nodded then theo yawned everybody was beat ludwig was running on looted french coffee and on pills hed got from a medic the pills were supposed to keep a dead man going for a day and a half ludwig still wanted to hole up somewhere and go to sleep so he figured he was about two steps worse off than dead this is the breakthrough the breakthrough captain elsner said he ignored the yawn he was running on nerves and maybe drugs too same as everyone else we crack the line we pour through we wheel around behind paris and we make every old fart who remembers sickjealous of us we can do it we can and we will heil hitler his right arm shot up and out heil hitler ludwig echoed he imitated the party salute so did fritz and theo if theo was a beat lateand he wascaptain elsner pretended not to see that too he was a good officer he cut some slack for any man who was good in the field and theo was as far as ludwig was concerned all the heiling was a bunch of quatsch but youd get your head handed to you if you said that out loud the failed coup against the fuhrer left everybody jumpy then theo stopped being dreamy and asked a sharp question when we go in will we have infantry support as much of it as there is captain elsner answered panzegrenadiers in halftracks and trucks could keep up with armor ordinary groundpounders couldnt the panzers were supposed to pierce the enemy lines and let the footbound infantry pour through after them panzers helped infantry enormously what theyd found out in czechoslovakia and here in the west though was that infantry support also helped panzers foot soldiers moving up along with the armor stopped plenty of unpleasant surprises the attack was scheduled for morning gave attackers the most daylight in which to do what they could and morning also let the germans come out of the rising sun which made them tougher targets ludwig approved of that he knew better than most people how vulnerable his steel chariot was as in the attack on czechoslovakia and the one that launched this campaign white tapes guided the panzers to their start line in the dark but this operation wouldnt be anywhere near so strong establishment strength for a panzer company was thirtytwo machines theyd been pretty much up to snuff before after this grinding campaign across the low countries and france captain elsners company had thirteen runners and it was in better shape than a lot of others well the enemys taken his licks too ludwig thought all through the advance hed driven past dutch and belgian and french and british wreckage hed breathed air thick with the smells of death and burnt rubber and scorched paint and hot iron that stench was in his coveralls now not even washingnot that hed had much chance to washgot rid of it behind them the sky lightened gray and then blue spread west rothe checked his watch hed synchronized it with the captains before they moved up any second now now the eastern horizon blazed with light not the sun but muzzle flashes from the artillery pounding the poilus and tommies up ahead get a move on fritz ludwig shouted into the speaking tube right you are boss bittenfeld put the panzer in gear tracks rattling and clanking it growled forward because of the crews experience they took point for their platoon ludwig could have done without the honor the point man commonly discovered trouble by smashing his face against it french s and occasional s answered the german barrage ludwig didnt want to duck down into the turret so soonhe couldnt see out nearly so well but with fragments sparking off the panzers side armor he didnt want to get sliced up either you acquired experience by not getting killed theyre alert today fritz remarked they would be ludwig agreed gloomily im going to miss the waitress at that estaminet in fouquerolles the driver cheerfully mangled the french word and the name of the village where theyd stayed not long before limber as an eel she was cant you think of anything but pussy ludwig asked knowing the answer was no machinegun bullets clattered off the right side of the turret guten morgen theo said from his seat in the back of the fighting compartment ill give them a good morning by god rothe said and then to bittenfeld panzer halt halting fritz responded and the panzer ii shuddered to a stop ludwig traversed the turret there was the gun still spitting bullets machine gunners never learned you could fire at a panzer till everything turned blue and you still wouldnt penetrate the armor of course each crew that made the mistake lived to regret itbut rarely for long ludwig fired several rounds from the mm cannon those would punch through whatever sandbags protected the machine gun theyd punch through the soldiers serving the gun too sure as hell it shut up maybe the crew was lying low more likely those men wouldnt fire that piece again not at a panzer and not at horribly vulnerable infantrymen either but ludwig also saw a burning panzer ii a few hundred meters away a machine gun couldnt do for one but anything bigger damn well could and if an antitankgun crew was drawing a bead on this stopped panzerget moving ludwig yipped into the speaking tube a horsepower engine wasnt supposed to be able to throw kilos of steel around like a bugatti at le mans all the same when fritz hit the gas the panzer jumped like one of the many barmaids hed goosed ludwig almost got thrown out of his seat he spied armored shapes up ahead their lines were rounder than those of germanys slabsided panzers get on the horn theo he said tell the captain the enemys got armor in the neighborhood im doing it hossbach said but i bet he already knows elsner hadnt known when he briefed the company maybe one of those french machines had taken out the other panzer ii they had more armor and bigger guns than most german panzersthey were easily a match for the czechs tanks well we beat those rothe thought the next interesting question was what french armor was doing right at the schwerpunkt here was it dumb luck or had the enemy guessed much too right if the breakthrough was going to happen it would have to be a breakthrough indeed panzer halt rothe commanded again he fired at the closest enemy panzer yes he was outgunned but the mm could break a french chars armored carapace the enemy machine caught fire the crew bailed out he gunned them down with the coaxial machine gun as they ran for cover an ordinary machine gun was plenty to kill ordinary soldiers step on it fritz he saidnot a command in the manual but also not one easy to mistake again the driver did his best to pretend he was at the grand prix that might have been why the antitank round slammed into the engine and not the fighting compartment all three crewmen screamed scheisse at the same time the panzer stopped it wouldnt go anywhere again get out ludwig yelled the french or british gunners were bound to be reloading when they didhe didnt want to be there theo opened the hatch behind the turret then he slammed it shut again fire he said follow me out then rothe told him he jumped out the turret hatch on the side away from that deadly round theo and fritz both made it out after him bullets cracking past them said out wasnt the best place to be not when it was in the middle of a horribly bare field ludwig pointed to some bushes a couple of hundred meters away crouching low zigzagging the panzer crewmen ran for them not much of a hope but some ludwig didnt understand why he crashed to the ground then he did because it started to hurt he shrieked and clutched at himself it was a bad one he knew that right away then he groaned again because fritz went down too damned if theo didnt make it to the bushes sometimes youd rather be lucky than good medic ludwig cried med another bullet caught him and he didnt hurt at all after that luc harcourt crouched in a foxhole all around him french and german tanks blazed away at one anotherand at any poor damned infantrymen their crews happened to spot he felt like a tiny ratlike ancient mammal stuck in the middle of a horde of battling dinosaurs they might kill him without even realizing he was there well hed had at least some small share of revenge when a panzer ii started burning the crew tried to make it out they escaped the tank but he shot one of them before the bastard could find a hole and pull it in after himself how many of us did you get you fucker he muttered as he slapped a fresh clip onto his rifle you wont get any more he wanted to huddle there not moving not looking up rolled into a ball like a pillbug so he made as small a target as he could he wanted to but he didnt if the boches got this far theyd kill him as easily as if they were squashing a pillbug what they said in training turned out to be true your best chance of living was acting like a soldier hed thought it was a bunch of patriotic crap when he heard it the first time but no speaking of crap his drawers were cleanwell not dirty on account of that even if he couldnt remember the last time he changed them he knew the modest pride of going through fear and coming out the other side hed fouled himself before yes but not now like sergeant demange he was past thattill the next time things got even worse than this anyhow a french tank stopped not far from his hole the commander popped out of the cupola like a jackinthebox he pointed at the germans advance he yelled if we stop them here we can break them he disappeared again the tank fired its cannon at well something luc didnt pop up himself to see what the noise all around was worse than loud it made his brain want to explode out through his ears the tank fired again the machine gun in its bow also banged awayagain luc couldnt see what it was shooting at then the tank rumbled forward the commander hadnt urged him to do anything the man wasnt willing to try himself of course he had twenty or thirty millimeters of hardened steel shielding him from the unpleasant outside world but to be fair he also had worse things aimed at him than foot soldiers were likely to face stilladvance it almost seemed a word in a foreign language the french army and the bef had got booted out of belgium and beaten back across northern france theyd given up more ground than their fathers or more often their mourned uncles who hadnt lived to sire children did in the channel ports were lost which meant the tommies would have a harder time getting into the fight advance after all that if they kept retreating the boches would win luc hated that thought the germans were good at what they did on the whole they fought cleanor no dirtier than the french but so what they were still boches he popped up and fired at some germans they dove for cover that was all hed wantedthey were too far off for him to have much chance of hitting them but if they were hiding behind trees or digging new scrapes for themselves they werent advancing against the defenders here defenders that wasnt one tank commanded by a homicidalor suicidalmaniac more french armor was going forward against the troops in fieldgray a crew of artillerymen manhandled a mm antitank gun into a position a couple of hundred meters farther east than it had held before even khakiclad infantrymenno great swarm of them but somewere climbing out of their holes and trenches and moving toward the boches maybe twenty meters away sergeant demange was watching the show from his foxhole he looked as astonished as luc felt he looked almost astonished enough to let the gitane fall out of his mouth almost but not quite he caught lucs eye this is something you dont see every day he shouted he had to say it two or three times before luc understood it sure is luc answered do you want to join the party were he a new fish he would have wavedand given a german sniper or machine gunner something to draw a bead on he knew better now do i look that fucking stupid demange said luc wanted to tell him yes but didnt have the nerve sure as the devil a sergeant who scared you more than the boches did wasnt the worst thing to have around then the veteran didnt just surprise luc he flabbergasted him he scrambled from his foxhole and scurried toward a crater a bursting had dug as soon as he got there he called somebodys got to do it right no doubt somebody did luc wondered whether one of the somebodies had to be him regretfully he decided he couldnt hang back when even a coldblooded pragmatist like demange was advancing coming up out of a hole felt like a snail shedding its shell and turning into a slug luc grimaced and shook his head as he ran for a crater of his own no he didnt want to think about slugs not when the lead variety were snarling all over the place his dive into the shell hole would have won no worse than a bronze at the last olympics luc shook his head again those were hitlers games and to hell with him time for another look around german and french tanks burned nearby the thick black smoke that rose from them hid the field as well as any barrage of smoke shells german artillery laid down luc fired at another boche again he had no idea whether he hit him in a way that wasnt so bad one less fellow on his conscience he wished that particular organ had a switch he could flick or a plug he could pull he didnt like to think about all the things hed done but sometimes they bubbled up whether he wanted them to or not come on sergeant demange rasped what did that american marine say in the last war do you want to live forever airplanes swooped low over the battlefield machine guns yammering luc had started to move but froze again not that that would do him any good if those probing bullets found him they didnt the fighters werent messerschmitts they were english hurricanes the roundels on their broad wings looking inside out to luc because the red was in the center instead of the blue and they were shooting up the germans see how you like it cochons salauds he whooped joyously hed been on the other end of strafing too many times here as so many other places in war it was better to give than to receive nowdid the english have anything like the stuka so they could really give the germans whatfor they didnt seem to but maybe what they did have was enough the boches enjoyed air attack no more than anybody else only a few of them ranthey were good troops but it took the starch out of them just the same and a moment after the hurricanes roared away a french tank knocked out what had to be the enemys command vehicle from then on the few german tanks still moving didnt work together so smoothly any more come on sergeant demange said again more urgently this time it was like this in the summer of too if we hit em a good lick well get em well get emon les aura the slogan from the last war should have seemed as dated as groundscraping skirts somehow it didnt luc scrambled out of the shell hole and trotted forward sure as hell the germans were pulling back yes they were pros they had rear guards with machine guns to make sure nobody chased them hard but they were pulling back they werent breaking through they wouldnt break through and if they wouldnt they wouldnt win the war in a hurry what would happen once they saw that too luc lit a gauloise that was their worry not his he kept on advancing
