robert jordan brandon sanderson a memory of light and the shadow fell upon the land and the world was riven stone from stone the oceans fled and the mountains were swallowed up and the nations were scattered to the eight corners of the world the moon was as blood and the sun was as ashes the seas boiled and the living envied the dead all was shattered and all but memory lost and one memory above all others of him who brought the shadow and the breaking of the world and him they named dragon from aleth nin taerin alt a camora the breaking of the world author unknown the fourth age prologue by grace and banners fallen bayrd pressed the coin between his thumb and forefinger it was thoroughly unnerving to feel the metal squish he removed his thumb the hard copper now clearly bore its print reflecting the uncertain torchlight he felt chilled as if hed spent an entire night in a cellar his stomach growled again the north wind picked up making torches sputter bayrd sat with his back to a large rock near the center of the war camp hungry men muttered as they warmed their hands around firepits the rations had spoiled long ago other soldiers nearby began laying all of their metalswords armor clasps mailon the ground like linen to be dried perhaps they hoped that when the sun rose it would change the material back to normal bayrd rolled the oncecoin into a ball between his fingers light preserve us he thought light he dropped the ball to the grass then reached over and picked up the stones hed been working with i want to know what happened here karam lord jarid snapped jarid and his advisors stood nearby in front of a table draped with maps i want to know how they drew so close and i want that bloody darkfriend aes sedai queens head jarid pounded his fist down on the table once his eyes hadnt displayed such a crazed fervor the pressure of it allthe lost rations the strange things in the nightswas changing him behind jarid the command tent lay in a heap jarids hairgrown long during their exileblew free face bathed in ragged torchlight bits of dead grass still clung to his coat from when hed crawled out of the tent baffled servants picked at the iron tent spikes whichlike all metal in the camphad become soft to the touch the tents mounting rings had stretched and snapped like warm wax the night smelled wrong of staleness of rooms that hadnt been entered in years the air of a forest clearing should not smell like ancient dust bayrds stomach growled again light but he wouldve liked to have something to eat he set his attention on his work slapping one of his stones down against the other he held the stones as his old pappil had taught him as a boy the feeling of stone striking stone helped push away the hunger and coldness at least something was still solid in this world lord jarid glanced at him scowling bayrd was one of ten men jarid had insisted guard him this night i will have elaynes head karam jarid said turning back to his captains this unnatural night is the work of her witches her head eris skeptical voice came from the side and how precisely is someone going to bring you her head lord jarid turned as did the others around the torchlit table eri stared at the sky on his shoulder he wore the mark of the golden boar charging before a red spear it was the mark of lord jarids personal guard but eris voice bore little respect whats he going to use to cut that head free jarid his teeth the camp stilled at the horribly insubordinate line bayrd stopped his stones hesitating yes there had been talk about how unhinged lord jarid had become but this jarid sputtered face growing red with rage you dare use such a tone with me one of my own guards eri continued inspecting the cloudfilled sky youre docked two months pay jarid snapped but his voice trembled stripped of rank and put on latrine duty until further notice if you speak back to me again ill cut out your tongue bayrd shivered in the cold wind eri was the best they had in what was left of their rebel army the other guards shuffled looking down eri looked toward the lord and smiled he didnt say a word but somehow he didnt have to cut out his tongue every scrap of metal in the camp had gone soft as lard jarids own knife lay on the table twisted and warpedit had stretched thin as he pulled it from his sheath jarids coat flapped open it had had silver buttons jarid karam said a young lord of a minor house loyal to sarand he had a lean face and large lips do you really think really think this was the work of aes sedai all of the metal in the camp of course jarid barked what else would it be dont tell me you believe those campfire tales the last battle phaw he looked back at the table unrolled there with pebbles weighting the corners was a map of andor bayrd turned back to his stones snap snap snap slate and granite it had taken work to find suitable sections of each but pappil had taught bayrd to recognize all kinds of stone the old man had felt betrayed when bayrds father had gone off and become a butcher in the city instead of keeping to the family trade soft smooth slate bumpy ridged granite yes some things in the world were still solid some few things these days you couldnt rely on much once immovable lords were now soft as well soft as metal the sky churned with blackness and brave menmen bayrd had long looked up totrembled and whimpered in the night im worried jarid davies said an older man lord davies was as close as anyone was to being jarids confidant we havent seen anyone in days not farmer not queens soldier something is happening something wrong she cleared the people out jarid snarled shes preparing to pounce i think shes ignoring us jarid karam said looking at the sky clouds still churned there it seemed like months since bayrd had seen a clear sky why would she bother our men are starving the food continues to spoil the signs shes trying to squeeze us jarid said eyes wide with fervor this is the work of the aes sedai stillness came suddenly to the camp silence save for bayrds stones hed never felt right as a butcher but hed found a home in his lords guard cutting up cows or cutting up men the two were strikingly similar it bothered him how easily hed shifted from one to the other snap snap snap eri turned jarid eyed the guard suspiciously as if ready to scream out harsher punishment he wasnt always this bad was he bayrd thought he wanted the throne for his wife but what lord wouldnt it was hard to look past the name bayrds family had followed the sarand family with reverence for generations eri strode away from the command post where do you think youre going jarid howled eri reached to his shoulder and ripped free the badge of the sarand house guard he tossed it aside and left the torchlight heading into the night toward the winds from the north most men in the camp hadnt gone to sleep they sat around firepits wanting to be near warmth and light a few with clay pots tried boiling cuts of grass leaves or strips of leather as something anything to eat they stood up to watch eri go deserter jarid spat after all weve been through now he leaves just because things are difficult the men are starving jarid davies repeated im aware thank you so much for telling me about the problems with every bloody breath you have jarid wiped his brow with his trembling palm then slammed it on his map well have to strike one of the cities theres no running from her not now that she knows where we are whitebridge well take it and resupply her aes sedai must be weakened after the stunt they pulled tonight otherwise shed have attacked bayrd squinted into the darkness other men were standing lifting quarterstaffs or cudgels some went without weapons they gathered sleeping rolls hoisted packs of clothing to their shoulders then they began to trail out of the camp their passage silent like the movement of ghosts no rattling of chain mail or buckles on armor the metal was all gone as if the soul had been stripped from it elayne doesnt dare move against us in strength jarid said perhaps convincing himself there must be strife in caemlyn all of those mercenaries you reported shiv riots maybe elenia will be working against elayne of course whitebridge yes whitebridge will be perfect we hold it you see and cut the nation in half we recruit there press the men in western andor to our banner go to whats the place called the two rivers we should find able hands there jarid sniffed i hear they havent seen a lord for decades give me four months and ill have an army to be reckoned with enough that she wont dare strike at us with her witches bayrd held his stone up to the torchlight the trick to creating a good spearhead was to start outward and work your way in hed drawn the proper shape with chalk on the slate then had worked toward the center to finish the shape from there you turned from hitting to tapping shaving off smaller bits hed finished one side earlier this second half was almost done he could almost hear his pappil whispering to him were of the stone bayrd no matter what your father says deep down were of the stone more soldiers left the camp strange how few of them spoke jarid finally noticed he stood up straight and grabbed one of the torches holding it high what are they doing hunting weve seen no game in weeks setting snares perhaps nobody replied maybe theyve seen something jarid muttered or maybe they think they have ill stand no more talk of spirits or other foolery the witches are creating apparitions to unnerve us thats thats what it has to be rustling came from nearby karam was digging in his fallen tent he came up with a small bundle karam jarid said karam glanced at lord jarid then lowered his eyes and began to tie a coin pouch at his waist he stopped and laughed then emptied it the gold coins inside had melted into a single lump like pigs ears in a jar karam pocketed this lump he fished in the pouch and brought out a ring the bloodred gemstone at the center was still good probably wont be enough to buy an apple these days he muttered i demand to know what you are doing jarid snarled is this your doing he waved toward the departing soldiers youre staging a mutiny is that it this isnt my doing karam said looking ashamed and its not really yours either im im sorry karam walked away from the torchlight bayrd found himself surprised lord karam and lord jarid had been friends from childhood lord davies went next running after karam was he going to try to hold the younger man back no he fell into step beside karam they vanished into the darkness ill have you hunted down for this jarid yelled after them voice shrill frantic i will be consort to the queen no man will give you or any member of your houses shelter or succor for ten generations bayrd looked back at the stone in his hand only one step left the smoothing a good spearhead needed some smoothing to be dangerous he brought out another piece of granite hed picked up for the purpose and carefully began scraping it along the side of the slate seems i remember this better than id expected he thought as lord jarid continued to rant there was something powerful about crafting the spearhead the simple act seemed to push back the gloom there had been a shadow on bayrd and the rest of the camp lately as if as if he couldnt stand in the light no matter how he tried he woke each morning feeling as if someone hed loved had died the day before it could crush you that despair but the act of creating something anythingfought back that was one way to challenge him the one none of them spoke of the one that they all knew was behind it no matter what lord jarid said bayrd stood up hed want to do more smoothing later but the spearhead actually looked good he raised his wooden spear haftthe metal blade had fallen free when evil had struck the campand lashed the new spearhead in place just as his pappil had taught him all those years ago the other guards were looking at him well need more of those morear said if youre willing bayrd nodded on our way out we can stop by the hillside where i found the slate jarid finally stopped yelling his eyes wide in the torchlight no you are my personal guard you will not defy me jarid jumped for bayrd murder in his eyes but morear and rosse caught the lord from behind rosse looked aghast at his own mutinous act he didnt let go though bayrd fished a few things out from beside his bedroll after that he nodded to the others and they joined himeight men of lord jarids personal guard dragging the sputtering lord himself through the remnants of camp they passed smoldering fires and fallen tents abandoned by men who were trailing out into the darkness in greater numbers now heading north into the wind at the edge of camp bayrd selected a nice stout tree he waved to the others and they took the rope hed fetched and tied lord jarid to the tree the man sputtered until morear gagged him with a handkerchief bayrd stepped in close he tucked a waterskin into the crook of jarids arm dont struggle too much or youll drop that my lord you should be able to push the gag offit doesnt look too tightand angle the waterskin up to drink here ill take out the cork jarid stared thunder at bayrd its not about you my lord bayrd said you always treated my family well but here we cant have you following along and making life difficult theres just something that we need to do and youre stopping everyone from doing it maybe someone should have said something earlier well thats done sometimes you let the meat hang too long and the entire haunch has to go he nodded to the others who ran off to gather bedrolls he pointed rosse toward the slate outcropping nearby and told him what to look for in good spearhead stone bayrd turned back to the struggling lord jarid this isnt witches my lord this isnt elayne i suppose i should call her the queen funny thinking of a pretty young thing like that as queen id rather have bounced her on my knee at an inn than bow to her but andor will need a ruler to follow to the last battle and it isnt your wife im sorry jarid sagged in his bonds the anger seeming to bleed from him he was weeping now odd thing to see that ill tell people we passif we pass anywhere you are bayrd promised and that you probably have some jewels on you they might come for you they might he hesitated you shouldnt have stood in the way everyone seems to know what is coming but you the dragon is reborn old bonds are broken old oaths done away with and ill be hanged before i let andor march to the last battle without me bayrd left walking into the night raising his new spear onto his shoulder i have an oath older than the one to your family anyway an oath the dragon himself couldnt undo it was an oath to the land the stones were in his blood and his blood in the stones of this andor bayrd gathered the others and they left for the north behind them in the night their lord whimpered alone as the ghosts began to move through camp talmanes tugged on selfars reins making the horse dance and shake his head the roan seemed eager perhaps selfar sensed his masters anxious mood the night air was thick with smoke smoke and screams talmanes marched the band alongside a road clogged with refugees smudged with soot they moved like flotsam in a muddy river the men of the band eyed the refugees with worry steady talmanes shouted to them we cant sprint all the way to caemlyn steady he marched the men as quickly as he dared nearly at a jog their armor clanked elayne had taken half of the band with her to the field of merrilor including estean and most of the cavalry perhaps she had anticipated needing to withdraw quickly well talmanes wouldnt have much use for cavalry in the streets which were no doubt as clogged as this roadway selfar snorted and shook his head they were close now the city walls just aheadblack in the nightheld in an angry light it was as if the city were a firepit by grace and banners fallen talmanes thought with a shiver enormous clouds of smoke billowed over the city this was bad far worse than when the aiel had come for cairhien talmanes finally gave selfar his head the roan galloped along the side of the road for a time then talmanes reluctantly forced his way across ignoring pleas for help time hed spent with mat made him wish there were more he could offer these people it was downright strange the effect matrim cauthon had on a person talmanes looked at common folk in a very different light now perhaps it was because he still didnt rightly know whether to think of mat as a lord or not on the other side of the road he surveyed the burning city waiting for his men to catch up he could have mounted all of themthough they werent trained cavalry every man in the band had a horse for longdistance travel tonight he didnt dare with trollocs and myrddraal lurking in the streets talmanes needed his men in immediate fighting shape crossbowmen marched with loaded weapons at the flanks of deep columns of pikemen he would not leave his soldiers open to a trolloc charge no matter how urgent their mission but if they lost those dragons light illumine us talmanes thought the city seemed to be boiling with all that smoke churning above yet some parts of the inner city rising high on the hill and visible over the wallswere not yet aflame the palace wasnt on fire yet could the soldiers there be holding no word had come from the queen and from what talmanes could see no help had arrived for the city the queen must still be unaware and that was bad very very bad ahead talmanes spotted sandip with some of the bands scouts the slender man was trying to extricate himself from a group of refugees please good master one young woman was crying my child my daughter in the heights of the northern march i must reach my shop a stout man bellowed my glasswares my good people talmanes said forcing his horse among them i should think that if you want us to help you might wish to back away and allow us to reach the bloody city the refugees reluctantly pulled back and sandip nodded to talmanes in thanks tanskinned and darkhaired sandip was one of the bands commanders and an accomplished hedgedoctor the affable man wore a grim expression today however sandip talmanes said pointing there in the near distance a large group of fighting men clustered looking at the city mercenaries sandip said with a grunt weve passed several batches of them not a one seemed inclined to lift a finger we shall see about that talmanes said people still flooded out through the city gates coughing clutching meager possessions leading crying children that flow would not soon slacken caemlyn was as full as an inn on market day the ones lucky enough to be escaping would be only a small fraction compared to those still inside talmanes sandip said quietly that citys going to become a death trap soon there arent enough ways out if we let the band become pinned inside i know but at the gates a wave of feeling surged through the refugees it was almost a physical thing a shudder the screams grew more intense talmanes spun hulking figures moved in the shadows inside the gate light sandip said what is it trollocs talmanes said turning selfar light theyre going to try to seize the gate stop the refugees there were five gates out of the city if the trollocs held all of them this was already a slaughter if the trollocs could stop the frightened people from fleeing it would grow far worse hurry the ranks talmanes yelled all men to the city gates he spurred selfar into a gallop the building would have been called an inn elsewhere though isam had never seen anyone inside except for the dulleyed women who tended the few drab rooms and prepared tasteless meals visits here were never for comfort he sat on a hard stool at a pine table so worn with age it had likely grayed long before isams birth he refrained from touching the surface overly much lest he come away with more splinters than an aiel had spears isams dented tin cup was filled with a dark liquid though he wasnt drinking he sat beside the wall near enough the inns single window to watch the dirt street outside dimly lit in the evening by a few rusty lanterns hung outside buildings isam took care not to let his profile show through the smeared glass he never looked directly out it was always best not to attract attention in the town that was the only name the place had if it could be said to have a name at all the sprawling ramshackle buildings had been put up and replaced countless times over two thousand years it actually resembled a goodsized town if you squinted most of the buildings had been constructed by prisoners often with little or no knowledge of the craft theyd been supervised by men equally ignorant a fair number of the houses seemed held up by those to either side of them sweat dribbled down the side of isams face as he covertly watched that street which one would come for him in the distance he could barely make out the profile of a mountain splitting the night sky metal rasped against metal somewhere out in the town like steel heartbeats figures moved on the street men heavily cloaked and hooded with faces hidden up to the eyes behind bloodred veils isam was careful not to let his eyes linger on them thunder rumbled the slopes of that mountain were filled with odd lightning bolts that struck upward toward the everpresent gray clouds few humans knew of this town not so far from the valley of thakandar with shayol ghul itself looming above few knew rumors of its existence isam would not have minded being among the ignorant another of the men passed red veils they kept them up always well almost always if you saw one lower his veil it was time to kill him because if you didnt hed kill you most of the redveiled men seemed to have no reason to be out beyond scowling at each other and perhaps kicking at the numerous stray dogsslatribbed and feralwhenever one crossed their path the few women who had left shelter scuttled along the edges of the street eyes lowered there were no children to be seen and likely few to be found the town was no place for children isam knew he had grown from infancy here one of the men passing on the street looked up at isams window and stopped isam went very still the samma nsei the eye blinders had always been touchy and full of pride no touchy was too mild a term they required no more than whim to take a knife to one of the talentless usually it was one of the servants who paid usually the redveiled man continued to regard him isam stilled his nerves and did not make a show of staring back his summons here had been urgent and one did not ignore such things if one wished to live but still if the man took one step toward the building isam would slip into telararirhiod secure in the knowledge that not even one of the chosen could follow him from here abruptly the samma nsei turned from the window in a flash he was moving away from the building striding quickly isam felt some of his tension melt away though it would never truly leave him not in this place this place was not home despite his childhood here this place was death motion isam glanced toward the end of the street another tall man in a black coat and cloak was walking toward him his face exposed incredibly the street was emptying as samma nsei darted off down other streets and alleys so it was moridin isam had not been there to witness the chosens first visit to the town but he had heard the samma nsei had thought moridin one of the talentless until he demonstrated differently the constraints that held them did not hold him the numbers of dead samma nsei varied with the telling but the claim never dipped below a dozen by the evidence of his eyes isam could believe it when moridin reached the inn the street was empty save for the dogs and moridin walked right on past isam watched as closely as he dared moridin seemed uninterested in him or the inn which was where isam had been instructed to wait perhaps the chosen had other business and isam would be an afterthought after moridin passed isam finally took a sip of his dark drink the locals just called it fire it lived up to its name it was supposedly related to some drink from the waste like everything else in the town it was a corrupt version of the original how long was moridin going to make him wait isam didnt like being here it reminded him too much of his childhood a servant passeda woman with a dress so frayed that it was practically ragsand dropped a plate onto the table the two didnt exchange a word isam looked at his meal vegetablespeppers and onions mostly sliced thin and boiled he picked at one and took a taste then sighed and pushed the meal aside the vegetables were as bland as unseasoned millet porridge there wasnt any meat that was actually good he didnt like to eat meat unless hed seen it killed and slaughtered himself that was a remnant of his childhood if you hadnt seen it slaughtered yourself you couldnt know not for certain up here if you found meat it could have been something that had been caught in the south or maybe an animal that had been raised up here a cow or a goat or it could be something else people lost games up here and couldnt pay then disappeared and often the samma nsei who didnt breed true washed out of their training bodies vanished corpses rarely lasted long enough for burial burn this place isam thought stomach unsettled burn it with someone entered the inn he couldnt watch both approaches to the door from this direction unfortunately she was a pretty woman dressed in black trimmed with red isam didnt recognize her slim figure and delicate face he was increasingly certain he could recognize all of the chosen hed seen them often enough in the dream they didnt know that of course they thought themselves masters of the place and some of them were very skilled he was equally skilled and also exceptionally good at not being seen whoever this was she was in disguise then why bother hiding herself here either way she had to be the one who had summoned him no woman walked the town with such an imperious expression such self assurance as if she expected the rocks themselves to obey if told to jump isam went quietly down on one knee that motion woke the ache inside his stomach from where hed been wounded he still hadnt recovered from the fight with the wolf he felt a stirring inside of him luc hated aybara unusual luc tended to be the more accommodating one isam the hard one well that was how he saw himself either way on this particular wolf they agreed on one hand isam was thrilled as a hunter hed rarely been presented with such a challenge as aybara however his hatred was deeper he would kill aybara isam covered a grimace at the pain and bowed his head the woman left him kneeling and took a seat at his table she tapped a finger on the side of the tin cup for a few moments staring at its contents and did not speak isam remained still many of those fools who named themselves darkfriends would squirm and writhe when another asserted power over them indeed he admitted with reluctance luc would probably squirm just as much isam was a hunter that was all he cared to be when you were secure with what you were there was no cause to resent being shown your place burn it but the side of his belly did ache i want him dead the woman said her voice was soft yet intense isam said nothing i want him gutted like an animal his bowels spilled onto the ground his blood a milkpan for ravens his bones left to bleach then gray then crack in the heat of the sun i want him dead hunter althor yes you have failed in the past her voice was ice he felt a chill this one was hard hard as moridin in his years of service he had learned contempt for most of the chosen they bickered like children for all their power and supposed wisdom this woman made him pause and he wondered if he actually had spied on all of them she seemed different well she asked do you speak for your failures each time one of the others has tasked me with this hunt he said another has come to pull me away and set me on some other task in truth hed rather have continued his hunt for the wolf he would not disobey orders not direct ones from the chosen other than aybara one hunt was much the same to him as another he would kill this dragon if he had to such wont happen this time the chosen said still staring at his cup she hadnt looked at him and she did not give him leave to stand so he remained kneeling all others have renounced claim on you unless the great lord tells you otherwiseunless he summons you himselfyou are to keep to this task kill althor motion outside the window caused isam to glance to the side the chosen didnt look as a group of blackhooded figures passed the winds didnt cause the cloaks of these figures to stir they were accompanied by carriages an unusual sight in the town the carriages moved slowly but still rocked and thumped on the uneven street isam didnt need to see into the carriages curtained windows to know that thirteen women rode inside matching the number of myrddraal none of the samma nsei returned to the street they tended to avoid processions like this for obvious reasons they had strong feelings about such things the carriages passed so another had been caught isam would have assumed that the practice had ended once the taint was cleansed before he turned back to look at the floor he caught sight of something more incongruous a small dirty face watching from the shadows of an alleyway across the street wide eyes but a furtive posture moridins passing and the coming of the thirteens had driven the samma nsei off the street where they were not the urchins could go in some safety maybe isam wanted to scream at the child to go tell it to run to risk crossing the blight to die in the stomach of a worm was better than to live in this town and suffer what it did to you go flee die the moment passed quickly the urchin retreating to the shadows isam could remember being that child hed learned so many things then how to find food that you could mostly trust and wouldnt vomit back up once you found out what was in it how to fight with knives how to avoid being seen or noticed and how to kill a man of course everyone who survived long enough in the town learned that particular lesson the chosen was still looking at his cup it was her reflection she was looking at isam realized what did she see there i will need help isam finally said the dragon reborn has guards and he is rarely in the dream help has been arranged she said softly but you are to find him hunter none of this playing as you did before trying to draw him to you lews therin will sense such a trap besides he will not deviate from his cause now time is short she spoke of the disastrous operation in the two rivers luc had been in charge then what knew isam of real towns real people almost he felt a longing for those things though he suspected that was really lucs emotion isam was just a hunter people held little interest for him beyond the best places for an arrow to enter so as to hit the heart that two rivers operation though it stank like a carcass left to rot he still didnt know had the point really been to lure althor or had it been to keep isam away from important events he knew his abilities fascinated the chosen he could do something that they could not oh they could imitate the way he stepped into the dream but they needed channeling gateways time he was tired of being a pawn in their games just let him hunt stop changing the prey with each passing week one did not say such things to the chosen he kept his objections to himself shadows darkened the doorway to the inn and the serving woman disappeared into the back that left the place completely empty save for isam and the chosen you may stand she said isam did hastily as two men stepped into the room tall muscular and redveiled they wore brown clothing like aiel but didnt carry spears or bows these creatures killed with weapons far deadlier though he kept his face impassive isam felt a surge of emotion a childhood of pain hunger and death a lifetime of avoiding the gaze of men like these he fought hard to keep himself from trembling as they strode to the table moving with the grace of natural predators the men dropped their veils and bared their teeth burn me their teeth were filed these had been turned you could see it in their eyeseyes that werent quite right werent quite human isam nearly fled right then stepping into the dream he couldnt kill both of these men hed have been reduced to ash before he managed to take down one of them hed seen samma nsei kill they often did it just to explore new ways of using their powers they didnt attack did they know this woman was chosen why then lower their veils samma nsei never lowered their veils except to killand only for the kills they were most eagerly anticipating they will accompany you the chosen said you shall have a handful of the talentless as well to help deal with althors guards she turned to him and for the first time she met his eyes she seemed revolted as if she were disgusted to need his aid they will accompany you she had said not they will serve you bloody son of a dog this was going to be a hateful job talmanes threw himself to the side narrowly avoiding the trollocs axe the ground trembled as the axe broke cobblestones he ducked and rammed his blade through the creatures thigh the thing had a bulls snout and it threw back its head to bellow burn me but you have horrid breath talmanes growled whipping his sword free and stepping back the thing went down on one leg and talmanes hacked off its weapon hand panting talmanes danced back as his two companions struck the trolloc through the back with spears you always wanted to fight trollocs in a group well you always wanted to fight anyone with a team on your side but it was more important with trollocs considering their size and strength corpses lay like heaps of trash in the night talmanes had been forced to fire the city gates guardhouses to give light the halfdozen or so guards who had remained were now recruits in the band for the time being like a black tide the trollocs began to retreat from the gate theyd overextended themselves in pushing for it or rather being pushed for it there had been a halfman with this crew talmanes lowered his hand to the wound in his side it was wet the guardhouse fires were burning low hed have to order a few of the shops set on fire that risked letting the blaze spread but the city was already lost no sense in holding back now brynt he yelled set that stable aflame sandip came up as brynt went running past with a torch theyll be back soon probably talmanes nodded now that the fighting was done townspeople began to flood out of alleys and recesses timidly making for the gate and presumablysafety we cant stay here and hold this gate sandip said the dragons i know how many men did we lose i dont have a count yet a hundred at least light mats going to have my hide when he hears about that mat hated losing troops there was a softness to the man equal to his geniusan odd but inspiring combination send some scouts to watch the city roadways nearby for approaching shadowspawn heap some of these trolloc carcasses to make barriers theyll work as well as anything else you soldier one of the wearied soldiers walking past froze he wore the queens colors my lord we need to let people know this gate out of the city is safe is there a horn call that andoran peasants would recognize something that would bring them here peasants the man said thoughtfully he didnt seem to like the word they didnt use it often here in andor yes the queens march sandip ill set the sounders to it talmanes sandip said good talmanes knelt to clean his sword on a fallen trollocs shirt his side aching the wound wasnt bad not by normal terms just a nick really the shirt was so grimy he almost hesitated to wipe his weapon but trolloc blood was bad for a blade so he swabbed down the sword he stood up ignoring the pain in his side then walked toward the gate where hed tied selfar he hadnt dared trust the horse against shadowspawn he was a good gelding but not borderlandtrained none of the men questioned him as he climbed into the saddle and turned selfar westward out of the city gate toward those mercenaries hed seen watching earlier talmanes wasnt surprised to find that theyd moved closer to the city fighting drew warriors like fire drawing cold travelers on a winter night they hadnt joined in the battle as talmanes rode up he was greeted by a small group of the sellswords six men with thick arms and likelythick wits they recognized him and the band mat was downright famous these days and so was the band by association they undoubtedly also noticed the trolloc bloodstains on talmanes clothing and the bandage at his side that wound had really begun to burn fiercely now talmanes reined in selfar then patiently patted at his saddlebags i stowed some tabac here somewhere well one of the mercenaries asked the leader was easy to pick out he had the finest armor a man often became leader of a band like this by staying alive talmanes fished his secondbest pipe out of his saddlebag where was that tabac he never took the best pipe into battle his father had called that bad luck ah he thought pulling out the tabac pouch he placed some in the bowl then removed a lighting twig and leaned over to stick it into a torch held by a wary mercenary we arent going to fight unless paid the leader said he was a stout man surprisingly clean though he could have done with a beard trim talmanes lit his pipe puffing smoke out behind him the horns started blowing the queens march turned out to be a catchy tune the horns were accompanied by shouts and talmanes looked back trollocs on the main thoroughfare a larger batch this time crossbowmen fell into ranks and began loosing at an order talmanes couldnt hear were not the head man began again do you know what this is talmanes asked softly around his pipe this is the beginning of the end this is the fall of nations and the unification of humankind this is the last battle you bloody fool the men shuffled uncomfortably do you do you speak for the queen the leader said trying to salvage something i just want to see my men taken care of if you fight talmanes said ill promise you a great reward the man waited i promise you that youll continue to draw breath talmanes said taking another puff is that a threat cairhienin talmanes blew out smoke then leaned down from his saddle putting his face closer to the leader i killed a myrddraal tonight andoran he said softly it nicked me with a thakandar blade and the wound has gone black that means i have a few hours at best before the blades poison burns me from the inside out and i die in the most agonizing way a man can therefore friend i suggest that you trust me when i tell you that i really have nothing to lose the man blinked you have two choices talmanes said turning his horse and speaking loudly to the troop you can fight like the rest of us and help this world see new days and maybe youll earn some coin in the end i cant promise that your other option is to sit here watch people be slaughtered and tell yourselves that you dont work for free if youre lucky and the rest of us salvage this world without you youll draw breath long enough to be strung up by your cowardly necks silence horns blew from the darkness behind the chief sellsword looked toward his companions they nodded in agreement go help hold that gate talmanes said ill recruit the other mercenary bands to help leilwin surveyed the multitude of camps dotting the place known as the field of merrilor in the darkness with the moon not due to rise for some time she could almost imagine that the cook fires were shipborne lanterns in a busy port at night that was probably a sight she would never see again leilwin shipless was not a captain she would never be one again to wish otherwise was to defy the very nature of who she had become bayle put a hand on her shoulder thick fingers rough from many days of work she reached up and rested her hand on his it had been simple to slip through one of those gateways being made at tar valon bayle knew his way around the city though he had grumbled about being there this place do set the hairs on my arms to points hed said and i did wish to never walk these streets again i did wish it hed come with her anyway a good man bayle domon as good as shed found in these unfamiliar lands despite moments of unsavory trading in his past that was behind him if he didnt understand the right way of things he did try this do be a sight he said scanning the quiet sea of lights what want you to do now we find nynaeve almeara or elayne trakand bayle scratched at his bearded chin he wore it after the illianer style with the upper lip shaved the hair on his head was of varying lengths hed stopped shaving a portion of his head now that she had freed him shed done that so they could marry of course it was well the shaven head would have drawn attention here hed done quite well as sojhin once certain issues had been resolved in the end however she had to admit that bayle domon was not meant to be sojhin he was too roughcut and no tide would ever soften those sharp edges that was how she wanted him though shed never say so out loud it do be late leilwin he said perhaps we should wait until morning no there was a quiet to the camps true but it was not the quiet of slumber it was the quiet of ships waiting for the right winds she knew little of what was happening hereshe hadnt dared open her mouth in tar valon to ask questions lest her accent reveal her as seanchan a gathering of this size did not occur without dedicated planning she was surprised at the immensity of it shed heard of the meeting here one that most of the aes sedai had come to attend this exceeded anything shed anticipated she started across the field and bayle followed both of them joining the group of tar valon servants they had been allowed to accompany thanks to bayles bribe his methods did not please her but she had been able to think of no other way she tried not to think too much about his original contacts in tar valon well if she was never to be on a ship again then bayle would find no more opportunities for smuggling that was a small comfort youre a ships captain thats all you know all you want and now ship less she shivered and clenched her hands into fists to keep from wrapping her arms around herself to spend the rest of her days on these unchanging lands never able to move at a pace brisker than what a horse could provide never to smell the deepsea air never to point her prow toward a horizon hoist anchor set sail and simply she shook herself find nynaeve and elayne she might be shipless but she would not let herself slip into the depths and drown she set her course and started walking bayle hunched down slightly suspicious and tried to watch all around them at once he also glanced at her a few times lips drawn to a line she knew what that meant by now what is it she asked leilwin what do we be doing here ive told you we need to find yes but why what do you think you will do they do be aes sedai they showed me respect before and so you do think theyll take us in perhaps she eyed him speak it bayle you have something on your mind he sighed why do we need be taken in leilwin we could find ourselves a ship somewhere in arad doman where there do be no aes sedai or seanchan i wouldnt run the kind of ship you prefer he regarded her flatly i do know how to run an honest business leilwin it would no be she raised a hand quieting him then rested it on his shoulder they stopped on the pathway i know my love i know im speaking words to distract to set us spinning in a current that goes nowhere why that single word scratched at her like a splinter under a fingernail why why had she come all this way traveling with matrim cauthon putting herself dangerously near the daughter of the nine moons my people live with a grave misconception of the world bayle in doing so they create injustice they did reject you leilwin he said softly you do no longer exist ill always be one of them my name was revoked but not my blood i do be sorry for the insult she nodded curtly i am still loyal to the empress may she live forever but the damane they are the very foundation for her rule they are the means by which she creates order by which she holds the empire together and the damane are a lie suldam could channel the talent could be learned now months after she had discovered the truth her mind could not encompass all of the implications another might have been more interested in the political advantage another might have returned to seanchan and used this to gain power almost leilwin wished she had done that almost but the pleas of the suldam growing to know those aes sedai who were nothing like what shed been taught something had to be done and yet in doing it did she risk causing the entire empire to collapse her movements must be considered very very carefully like the last rounds of a game of shal the two continued to follow the line of servants in the dark one aes sedai or another often sent servants for something they had left in the white tower so traveling back and forth was commona good thing for leilwin they passed the perimeter of the aes sedai camp without being challenged she was surprised at the ease of it until she spotted several men alongside the path they were very easy to miss something about them blended into the surroundings particularly in the darkness she noticed them only when one moved breaking off from the others to fall into step a short distance behind her and bayle in seconds it was obvious that hed picked the two of them out perhaps it was the way they walked the way they held themselves theyd been careful to dress plainly though bayles beard would mark him as illianer leilwin stoppedlaying a hand on bayles armand turned to confront the one following them a warder she assumed from descriptions the warder stalked up to them they were still near the perimeter of the camp the tents organized in rings she had noticed with discomfort that some of the tents glowed with a light too steady to come from candle or lamp ho bayle said raising a friendly hand to the warder we do be seeking an aes sedai named nynaeve almeara if she is not here perhaps one named elayne trakand neither makes their camp here the warder said he was a longarmed man and he moved with grace his features framed by long dark hair looked unfinished chiseled from rock by a sculptor who had lost interest in the project partway through ah bayle said that do be our mistake then could you point us to where they do be making camp it do be a matter of some urgency you see he spoke smoothly easily bayle could be quite charming when necessary much more so than leilwin could that depends the warder said your companion she wishes to find these aes sedai too she do bayle began but the warder held up a hand i would hear it from her he said inspecting leilwin it do be what i wish leilwin said my aged grandmother these women they did promise us payment and i do mean to have it aes sedai do not lie everyone do know this fact if you will not take us to them then provide someone who will the warder hesitated eyes widening at the barrage of words then blessedly he nodded this way he led them away from the center of the camp but he no longer seemed suspicious leilwin let out a quiet breath and fell into step with bayle behind the warder bayle looked at her proudly grinning so widely hed certainly have given the two of them away if the warder had looked back she couldnt help a hint of a smile herself the illianer accent had not come naturally to her but both had agreed that her seanchan tongue was dangerous particularly when traveling among aes sedai bayle claimed that no true illianer would accept her as one of them but she was clearly good enough to fool an outsider she felt relieved when they moved away from the aes sedai camp into the dark having two friendsthey were friends despite their troubles with one anotherwho were aes sedai did not mean she wanted to be inside a camp full of them the warder led them to an open area near the middle of the field of merrilor there was a very large camp here with a great number of small tents aiel bayle said softly to her there do be tens of thousands of them interesting fearsome stories were told of aiel legends that could not all possibly be true still the talesif exaggeratedsuggested that these were the finest warriors this side of the ocean she would have welcomed sparring with one or two of them had the situation been different she rested a hand on the side of her pack shed stowed her cudgel in a long pocket on the side easily within reach they certainly were a tall folk these aiel she passed some of them lounging by campfires seemingly relaxed those eyes however watched more keenly than the warders had a dangerous people ready for killing while relaxing beside fires she could not make out the banners that flapped above this camp in the night sky which king or queen do rule this camp warder she called the man turned to her his features lost in the night shadow your king illianer at her side bayle stiffened my the dragon reborn she was proud that she didnt miss a step as they walked but it was a near thing a man who could channel that was worse far worse than the aes sedai the warder led them to a tent near the center of the camp you are fortunate her light is on there were no guards at the tent entrance so he called in and received permission to enter he pulled back the flap with one arm and nodded to them yet his other hand was on his sword and he stood in fighting posture she hated putting that sword to her back but she entered as ordered the tent was lit by one of those unnatural globes of light and a familiar woman in a green dress sat at a writing desk working on a letter nynaeve almeara was what back in seanchan one would call a telartia woman with fire in her soul leilwin had come to understand that aes sedai were supposed to be calm as placid waters well this woman might be that on occasionbut she was the kind of placid water found one bend away from a furious waterfall nynaeve continued to write as they entered she no longer wore braids her hair was loose around the top of her shoulders it was a sight as strange as a ship with no mast ill be with you in a moment sleete nynaeve said honestly the way you lot have been hovering over me lately makes me think of a mother bird who has lost an egg dont your aes sedai have work for you to do lan is important to many of us nynaeve sedai the wardersleete said in a calm gravelly voice oh and hes not important to me honestly i wonder if we should send you out to chop wood or something if one more warder comes to see if i need she glanced up finally seeing leilwin nynaeves face immediately grew impassive cold burningly cold leilwin found herself sweating this woman held her life in her hands why couldnt it have been elayne that sleete had brought them to perhaps they shouldnt have mentioned nynaeve these two demanded to see you sleete said his sword was out of its sheath leilwin hadnt seen that domon muttered softly to himself they claim that you promised to pay them money and they have come for it they did not identify themselves in the tower however and found a way to slip through one of the gateways the man is from illian the woman somewhere else shes disguising her accent well perhaps she wasnt as good with the accent as shed assumed leilwin glanced at his sword if she rolled to the side hed probably miss a strike assuming he went for the chest or neck she could pull the cudgel and she was facing an aes sedai shed never stand up from that roll shed be caught in a weave of the one power or worse i know them sleete nynaeve said voice cool you did well in bringing them to me thank you his sword was sheathed at once and leilwin felt cool air on her neck as he slipped out of the tent quiet as a whisper if youve come to beg forgiveness nynaeve said youve come to the wrong person ive half a mind to give you over to the warders to question maybe they can bleed something useful about your people from that treacherous mind of yours it is good to see you again too nynaeve leilwin said coolly so what happened nynaeve demanded what happened what was the woman talking about i did try bayle suddenly said regretfully i did fight them but i was taken easily they could have fired my ship sunk us all killed my men better that you and all aboard should have died illianer nynaeve said the terangreal ended up in the hands of one of the forsaken semirhage was hiding among the seanchan pretending to be some kind of judge a truthspeaker is that the word yes leilwin said softly she understood now i regret breaking my oath but you regret it egeanin nynaeve said standing knocking her chair back regret is not a word i would use for endangering the world itself bringing us to the brink of darkness and all but shoving us over the edge she had copies of that device made woman one ended up around the neck of the dragon reborn the dragon reborn himself controlled by one of the forsaken nynaeve flung her hands into the air light we were heartbeats from the end because of you the end of everything no more pattern no more world nothing millions of lives could have winked out because of your carelessness i leilwins failures seemed monumental suddenly her life lost her very name lost her ship stripped from her by the daughter of the nine moons herself all were immaterial in light of this i did fight bayle said more firmly i did fight with what i could give i should have joined you it appears leilwin said i did try to explain that bayle said grimly many times now burn me but i did bah nynaeve said raising a hand to her forehead what are you doing here egeanin i had hoped you were dead if you had died trying to keep your oath then i could not have blamed you i handed it to suroth myself leilwin thought a price paid for my life the only way out well nynaeve glared at her out with it egeanin i no longer bear that name leilwin went down on her knees i have had all stripped from me including my honor it now appears i give myself to you as payment nynaeve snorted we dont keep people as if they were animals unlike you seanchan leilwin continued kneeling bayle rested a hand on her shoulder but did not try to pull her to her feet he understood well enough now why she had to do as she had he was quite nearly civilized on your feet nynaeve snapped light egeanin i remember you being so strong you could chew rocks and spit out sand it is my strength that compels me she said lowering her eyes did nynaeve not understand how difficult this was it would be easier to slit her own throat only she had not the honor left to demand such an easy end stand leilwin did as told nynaeve grabbed her cloak off the bed and threw it on come well take you to the amyrlin maybe shell know what to do with you nynaeve barged out into the night and leilwin followed her decision had been made there was only one path that made sense one way to preserve a shred of honor and perhaps to help her people survive the lies they had been telling themselves for so long leilwin shipless now belonged to the white tower whatever they said whatever they tried to do with her that fact would not change they owned her she would be a da covale to this amyrlin and would ride this storm like a ship whose sail had been shredded by the wind perhaps with what remained of her honor she could earn this womans trust its part of an old borderlander relief for the pain melten said removing the bandage at talmanes side the blisterleaf slows the taint left by the cursed metal melten was a lean mophaired man he dressed like an andoran woodsman with a simple shirt and cloak but spoke like a borderlander in his pouch he carried a set of colored balls that hed sometimes juggle for the other members of the band in another life he must have been a gleeman he was an unlikely man to be in the band but they all were in one way or another i dont know how it dampens the poison melten said but it does its no natural poison mind you you cant suck it free talmanes pressed his hand to the side the burning pain felt like thorny vines crawling in under his skin creeping forward and tearing at his flesh with every movement he could feel the poison moving through his body light but it hurt nearby the men of the band fought through caemlyn up toward the palace theyd come in through the southern gate leaving the mercenary bandsunder sandips commandholding the western gate if there was human resistance anywhere in the city it would be at the palace unfortunately fists of trollocs roved the area between talmanes position and the palace they kept running across the monsters and getting drawn into fights talmanes couldnt find out if indeed there was resistance above without getting there that meant leading his men up toward the palace fighting all the way and leaving himself open to being cut off from behind if one of those roving groups worked around behind him there was nothing for it though he needed to find out whatif anythingremained of the palace defenses from there he could strike further into the city and try to get the dragons the air smelled of smoke and blood during a brief pause in the fighting theyd piled dead trollocs against the right side of the street to make room for passage there were refugees in this quarter of the city too though not a flood of them a stream maybe seeping in from the darkness as talmanes and the band seized sections of the thoroughfare leading up toward the palace these refugees never demanded that the band protect their goods or rescue their homes they sobbed with joy at finding human resistance madwin was in charge of sending them toward freedom along the corridor of safety the band had carved free talmanes started up toward the palace atop the hill but only barely visible in the night though most of the city burned the palace was not aflame its white walls hung in the smoky night like phantoms no fire that had to indicate resistance didnt it wouldnt the trollocs have attacked it as one of their first actions in the city hed sent scouts along the street up ahead as he gave his menand himselfa short breather melten finished tying talmanes poultice tight thank you melten talmanes said nodding to the man i can feel the poultice working already you said this is part of the cure for the pain what is the other part melten unhooked a metal flask from his belt and handed it over shienaran brandy full strength its not a good idea to drink in combat man take it melten said softly keep the flask and drink it deep my lord or come the next bell you wont be standing talmanes hesitated then took the flask and took a long swallow it burned like the wound he coughed then tucked the brandy away i believe you mistook your bottles melten that was something you found in a tanning vat melten snorted and its said you have no sense of humor lord talmanes i havent one talmanes said stay close with that sword of yours melten nodded eyes solemn dreadbane he whispered whats that borderlander title you slew a fade dreadbane it had about seventeen bolts in it at the time doesnt matter melten clasped him on the shoulder dreadbane when you cant take the pain any longer make two fists and raise them toward me i will see the deed done talmanes stood up unable to suppress a groan they both understood the several borderlanders in the band agreed wounds made by a thakandar blade were unpredictable some festered quickly others made men sick when one went black like talmanes though that was the worst nothing short of finding an aes sedai in the next few hours could save him see talmanes muttered it is a good thing i have no sense of humor otherwise i should think the pattern was playing a joke on me dennel you have a map handy light but he missed vanin my lord dennel said hurrying across the dark street carrying a torch and a hastily drawn map he was one of the bands dragon captains i think ive found a faster way through the streets to where aludra had the dragons stored were fighting to the palace first talmanes said my lord dennels words came more softly from his wide lips he was picking at his uniform as if it didnt fit right if the shadow reaches those dragons im well aware of the dangers dennel thank you how fast could you move the things assuming we reach them im worried about extending ourselves too far and this city is going up faster than oilsoaked love letters to a high lords mistress i want to get the weapons and leave the city as quickly as possible i can level an enemy bulwark in a shot or two my lord but the dragons do not move quickly they are attached to carts so that will help but they arent going to be any faster than say a line of supply wagons and they would take time to set up properly and fire then we continue to the palace talmanes said but at the palace he said sternly we might find women who can channel us a gateway straight to aludras warehouse besides if we find the palace guard still fighting we know we have a friend at our backs we will retrieve those dragons but well do it smartly he noticed ladwin and mar hurrying down from above there are trollocs up there mar said hastening up to talmanes a hundred strong at least hunkered down in the street form ranks men talmanes shouted we push for the palace the sweat tent fell completely still aviendha had anticipated incredulity perhaps at her tale questions certainly not this painful silence though she had not expected it she did understand it she had felt it herself after seeing her vision of the aiel slowly losing jietoh in the future she had witnessed the death dishonor and ruination of her people at least now she had someone with whom to share that burden the heated stones in the kettle hissed softly someone should pour more water but none of the rooms six occupants moved to tend it the other five were all wise ones nakedas was aviendhaafter the manner of sweat tents sorilea amys bair melaine and kymer of the tomanelle aiel all stared straight ahead each alone for the moment with her thoughts one by one they straightened their backs and sat up as if accepting a new burden that comforted aviendha not that shed expected the news to break them it was still good to see them set their faces toward the danger instead of away from it sightblinder is too close to the world now said melaine the pattern has been twisted somehow in the dream we still see many things that may or may not happen but there are too many possibilities we cannot tell one from another the fate of our people is unclear to the dreamwalkers as is the fate of the caracarn once he spits in sightblinders eye on the last day we do not know the truth of what aviendha saw we must test this sorilea said eyes like stone we must know is each woman now shown this vision instead of the other or was the experience unique elenar of the daryne amys said her training is nearly complete she will be the next to visit rhuidean we could ask hayde and shanni to encourage her aviendha suppressed a shudder she understood too well how encouraging the wise ones could be that would be well bair said leaning forward perhaps this is what happens whenever someone goes through the glass columns a second time maybe that is why it is forbidden none of them looked at aviendha but she could feel them considering her what she had done was forbidden speaking of what happened in rhuidean was also taboo there would be no reprimand rhuidean had not killed her this was what the wheel had spun bair continued to stare into the distance sweat trickled down the sides of aviendhas face and her breasts i do not miss taking baths she told herself she was no soft wetlander still a sweat tent wasnt truly necessary on this side of the mountains there was no bitter cold at night so the heat of the tent felt stifling not comforting and if water was plentiful enough for bathing no she set her jaw may i speak dont be foolish girl melaine said the woman was round in the belly nearly to term youre one of us now no need to ask permission girl it would take time for them to see her truly as one of them but they did make an effort nobody ordered her to make tea or to throw water on the kettle with no apprentice around and no gaishain handy they took turns doing these tasks i am less concerned with whether the vision repeats aviendha said than with what i was shown will it happen can we stop it rhuidean shows two types of vision kymer said she was a younger woman perhaps less than a decade aviendhas senior with deep red hair and a long tanned face the first visit is what could be the second to the columns what has happened this third vision could be either amys said the columns always show the past accurately why would they not show the future with equal accuracy aviendhas heart lurched but why bair said softly would the columns show a despair that cannot change no i refuse to believe it rhuidean has always shown us what we needed to see to help us not destroy us this vision must have a purpose as well to encourage us toward greater honor its unimportant sorilea said curtly but aviendha began its unimportant sorilea repeated if this vision were unchangeable if our destiny is to fall as you have spoken would any of us stop fighting to change it the room grew still aviendha shook her head we must treat it as if it can be changed sorilea said best not to dwell on your question aviendha we must decide what course to take aviendha found herself nodding i yes yes you are correct wise one but what do we do kymer asked what do we change for now the last battle must be won almost amys said i wish for the vision to be unchangeable for at least it proves we win this fight it proves nothing sorilea said sightblinders victory would break the pattern and so no vision of the future can be sure or trusted even with prophecies of what might happen in ages to come if sightblinder wins this battle all will become nothing this vision i saw has to do with whatever rand is planning aviendha said they turned to her tomorrow she said from what youve told me hes preparing for an important revelation the caracarn has a fondness for dramatic presentations bair said her tone itself fond hes like a crockobur who has toiled all night making a nest so that he can sing of it in the morning to all who will listen aviendha had been surprised to discover the gathering at merrilor she had found it only by using her bond to rand althor to determine where he was arriving here to find so many together the wet lander forces collected she wondered if this was part of what shed seen was this gathering the start of what would become her vision i feel as if i know more than i should she spoke almost to herself you have had a deep glimpse of what the future may hold kymer said it will change you aviendha tomorrow is key aviendha said his plan from what you said kymer replied it sounds as if he intends to ignore the aiel his own people why would he give boons to everyone else but not to those who are most deserving does he seek to insult us i dont think that is the reason aviendha said i think he intends to make demands of those who attend not grant them gifts he did mention a price bair said a price he intends to make the others pay no one has been able to pry the secret of this price from him he went through a gateway to tear earlier this evening and returned with something melaine said the maidens report ithe keeps his oath to bring them with him now when we have inquired after his price he has said that it is something that the aiel need not worry about aviendha scowled he is making men pay him in order to do what we all know he must perhaps he has been spending too much time with that minder the sea folk sent him no this is well amys said these people demand much of the caracarn he has a right to demand something of them in return they are soft perhaps he intends to make them hard and so he leaves us out bair said softly because he knows that we are already hard the tent fell silent amys looking troubled ladled some water onto the kettles heated stones it hissed as the steam rose that is it sorilea said he does not intend to insult us he intends to do us honor in his own eyes she shook her head he should know better often kymer agreed the caracarn gives insult by accident as if he were a child we are strong so his demandwhatever it ismatters not if it is a price the others can pay so can we he would not make these mistakes if he had been trained properly in our ways sorilea murmured aviendha met their eyes evenly no she had not trained him as well as he could have been trainedbut they knew that rand althor was obstinate besides she was their equal now although she had trouble feeling that way while facing sorileas tightlipped disapproval perhaps it was spending so much time with wetlanders like elayne but suddenly she did see things as rand must to give the aiel an exemption from his priceif indeed that was what he intendedwas an act of honor if he had made a demand of them with the others these very wise ones might have taken offense at being lumped with the wetlanders what was he planning she saw hints of it in the visions but increasingly she was certain that the next day would start the aiel on the road to their doom she must see that did not happen this was her first task as a wise one and would likely be the most important she was ever given she would not fail her task was not just to teach him amys said what i wouldnt give to know that he was safely under the watchful eyes of a good woman she looked at aviendha face laden with meaning he will be mine aviendha said firmly but not for you amys or for our people she was shocked at the strength of that sentiment within her she was aiel her people meant everything to her but this choice was not their choice this choice was hers be warned aviendha bair said laying a hand on her wrist he has changed since you left he has grown strong aviendha frowned in what way he has embraced death amys said sounding proud he may still carry a sword and wear the clothing of a wetlander but he is ours now finally and truly i must see this aviendha said standing i will discover what i can regarding his plans there is not much time remaining kymer warned one night remains aviendha said it will be enough the others nodded and aviendha started to dress unexpectedly the others joined her dressing as well it appeared that they considered her news important enough that they would be going to share it with the other wise ones rather than continuing to sit in conference aviendha was the first to step out into the night the cool air away from the sweltering heat of the sweat tent felt good on her skin she took a deep breath her mind was heavy with fatigue but sleep would need to wait the tent flaps rustled behind the other wise ones melaine and amys speaking softly to one another as they hastened into the night kymer walked purposefully toward the tomanelle section of the camp perhaps she would speak with her sisterfather han the tomanelle chief aviendha started to move off herself but a bony hand took her arm she glanced over her shoulder to see bair standing behind her dressed again in blouse and skirt wise one aviendha said by reflex wise one bair replied with a smile is there something i would go to rhuidean bair said glancing at the sky would you kindly make a gateway for me youre going through the glass columns one of us needs to despite what amys said elenar is not ready particularly not to see something of this nature that girl spends half of her days squawking like a buzzard over the last scrap of a rotting carcass but oh dont you start too youre one of us now aviendha but im still old enough to have tended your greatmother when she was a child bair shook her head her white hair almost seemed to glow in the filtered moonlight i am the best one to go she continued channelers must be preserved for the battle to come i would not have some child walk into those columns now i will do it now that gateway will you grant my request or do i need to bully amys into doing so aviendha would have liked to see anyone bully amys into anything maybe sorilea could do it she said nothing however and created the proper weave to open a gateway the thought of another seeing what shed seen made her stomach twist what would it mean if bair returned with the exact same vision would that indicate the future was more likely it was that terrible was it bair asked softly horrible it would have made spears weep and stones crumble bair i would rather have danced with sightblinder himself then it is much better that i go than another it should be the strongest of us who does this aviendha stopped herself from raising an eyebrow bair was as tough as good leather but the other wise ones werent exactly flower petals bair aviendha said a thought occurring to her have you ever met a woman named nakomi nakomi bair tried the word in her mouth an ancient name i have never known anyone who uses it why i met an aiel woman while traveling to rhuidean aviendha said she claimed not to be a wise one but she had a way about her she shook her head the question was merely idle curiosity well we shall know some of the truth of these visions bair said stepping toward the gateway what if they are true bair aviendha found herself asking what if there isnt anything we can do bair turned you saw your children you said aviendha nodded she hadnt spoken in detail of that segment of the vision it had seemed more personal to her change one of their names bair said never speak of the name that child was called in the vision not even to us then you shall know if one thing is different then others may be different as well will be different this is not our fate aviendha it is a path we will avoid together aviendha found herself nodding yes a simple change a small change but full of meaning thank you bair the aging wise one nodded to her then stepped through the gateway running in the night toward the city ahead talmanes threw his shoulder against a hulking boarfaced trolloc in crude chain armor the beast smelled horrid like smoke wet fur and unwashed flesh it grunted at the force of talmanes assault the things always seemed surprised when he attacked them talmanes pulled back ripping his sword out of the beasts side as it collapsed he then lunged forward and rammed his sword into its throat heedless of its ragged fingernails scratching at his legs life faded from the beady toohuman eyes men fought called grunted killed the street ran up a steep incline toward the palace trolloc hordes had entrenched here holding position and keeping the band from reaching the top talmanes sagged against the side of a buildingthe one next to it was on fire lighting the street with violent colors and bathing him in heat those fires seemed chilly compared to the flaring horrible pain of his wound the flare ran down his leg to his foot and was beginning to work its way across his shoulder blood and bloody ashes he thought what id give for another few hours with my pipe and book alone and peaceful the people who spoke of glorious death in battle were complete flaming fools there was nothing glorious about dying in this mess of fire and blood give him a quiet death any day talmanes pushed himself back up to his feet drops of sweat falling from his face below trollocs amassed themselves behind his rear position they had closed the road behind talmanes force but talmanes was able to proceed cutting through the trollocs ahead retreat would be difficult to pull off as well as this roadway being full of trollocs fighting in the city meant that trollocs could wind through the streets in small groups and attack his flanks as they advanced and later when they retreated throw everything youve got at them men he bellowed hurling himself up the street and into the trollocs blocking the way up the palace was quite close now he caught a goatfaced trollocs sword on his shield right before it would have taken off dennels head talmanes tried to shove the beasts weapon back but light trollocs were strong talmanes barely kept this one from throwing him to the ground as dennel recovered and attacked its thighs bringing it down melten fell in beside talmanes the borderlander was true to his word to stay close in case talmanes needed a sword to end his life the two led the push up the hill the trollocs began to give then rallied a snarling roaring heap of dark fur eyes and weapons in the firelight there were so many of them steady talmanes yelled for lord mat and the band of the red hand if mat were here he would probably curse a lot complain as much then proceed to save them all with some battlefield miracle talmanes couldnt reproduce mats blend of insanity and inspiration but his yell did seem to encourage the men the ranks tightened gavid arrayed his two dozen crossbowmenthe last talmanes had with himatop a building that hadnt burned away they started driving flight after flight of bolts into the trollocs that might have broken human enemies but not trollocs the bolts dropped a few but not as many as talmanes would have hoped theres another fade back there talmanes thought pushing them forward light i cant fight another i shouldnt have fought the one i did he shouldnt be on his feet meltens flask of brandy was gone long since drained to deaden what it could his mind was already as fuzzy as he dared allow he fell in with dennel and londraed at the front fighting concentrating letting trolloc blood out onto the cobbles to stream down the hillside the band gave a good fight of it but they were outnumbered and exhausted down below another trolloc fist joined the ones on the street behind him that was it he would have to either hit that force behindturning his back on the one in frontor break his men into smaller units and send them retreating through side streets to regroup at the gate below talmanes prepared to give the orders forward the white lion voices yelled for andor and the queen talmanes spun as men in white and red broke through the trolloc lines atop the hill a second force of andoran pikemen poured out of a side alleyway coming in behind the trolloc horde that had just surrounded him the trollocs broke before the oncoming pikemen and in moments the entire masslike a pusfilled blisterburst trollocs scattering in all directions talmanes stumbled back momentarily he had to prop himself up with his sword as madwin took command of the counterstrike and his men killed many of the fleeing trollocs a group of officers in bloodied queens guard uniforms rushed down the hillside they didnt look any better than the band guybon led them mercenary he said to talmanes i thank you for showing up talmanes frowned you act as if we saved you from my perspective it happened the other way around guybon grimaced in the firelight you gave us some respite those trollocs were attacking the palace gates i apologize for taking so long to reach youwe didnt realize at first what had drawn them in this direction light the palace still stands yes guybon said were full of refugees though what of channelers talmanes asked hopeful why havent the andoran armies returned with the queen darkfriends guybon frowned her majesty took most of the kinswomen with her the strongest ones at least she left four with enough power to make a gateway together butthe attackan assassin killed two of them before the other two could stop him alone the two arent strong enough to send for help theyre using their strength to heal blood and bloody ashes talmanes said though he felt a stab of hope as he said it perhaps these women could not make a gateway but they might be able to heal his wound you should lead the refugees out of the city guybon my men hold the southern gate excellent guybon said straightening but you will have to lead the refugees i must defend the palace talmanes raised an eyebrow at him he didnt take orders from guybon the band had its own command structure and reported only to the queen mat had made that clear when accepting the contract unfortunately guybon didnt take orders from talmanes either talmanes took a deep breath but then wavered dizzy melten grabbed his arm to keep him from toppling over light but it hurt couldnt his side just do the decent thing and grow numb blood and bloody ashes he needed to get to those kinswomen talmanes said hopefully those two women who can heal i have sent for them already guybon said as soon as we saw this force here well that was something i do mean to stay here guybon warned i wont abandon this post why the city is lost man the queen ordered us to send regular reports through gateways guybon said eventually shes going to wonder why we havent sent a messenger she will send a channeler to see why we havent reported and that messenger will arrive at the palaces traveling ground it my lord a voice called my lord talmanes guybon cut off and talmanes turned to find filgerone of the scoutsscrambling up the bloodied cobbles of the hillside toward him filger was a lean man with thinning hair and a couple of days worth of scruff and the sight of him filled talmanes with dread filger was one of those theyd left guarding the city gate below my lord filger said panting the trollocs have taken the city walls theyre packing the ramparts loosing arrows or spears at anyone who draws too close lieutenant sandip sent me to bring you word blood and ashes what of the gate were holding filger said for now guybon talmanes said turning back show some mercy man someone needs to defend that gate please take the refugees out and reinforce my men that gate will be our only method of retreat from the city but the queens messenger the queen will figure out what bloody happened once she thinks to look here look about you trying to defend the palace is madness you dont have a city any longer but a pyre guybons face was conflicted his lips a tight line you know im right talmanes said his face twisted in pain the best thing you can do is reinforce my men at the southern gate to hold it open for as many refugees as can reach it perhaps guybon said but to let the palace burn you can make it worth something talmanes said what if you left some soldiers to fight at the palace have them hold off the trollocs as long as they can that will draw the trollocs away from the people escaping out this way when they can hold no longer your soldiers can escape the palace grounds on the far side and make their way around to the southern gate a good plan guybon said grudgingly i will do as you suggest but what of you i have to get to the dragons talmanes said we cant let them fall to the shadow theyre in a warehouse near the edge of the inner city the queen wanted them kept out of sight away from the mercenary bands outside i have to find them if possible retrieve them if not destroy them very well guybon said turning away looking frustrated as he accepted the inevitable my men will do as you suggest half will lead the refugees out then help your soldiers hold the southern gate the other half will hold the palace a little longer then withdraw but im coming with you do we really need so many lamps in here the aes sedai demanded from her stool at the back of the room it might as well have been a throne think of the oil youre wasting we need the lamps androl grunted night rain pelted the window but he ignored it trying to focus on the leather he was sewing it would be a saddle at the moment he was working on the girth that would go around the horses belly he poked holes into the leather in a double row letting the work calm him the stitching chisel he used made diamondshaped holeshe could use the mallet on them for speed if he wanted but right now he liked the feel of pressing the holes without it he picked up his stitchmark wheel measuring off the locations for the next stitches then worked another of the holes you had to line the flat sides of the diamonds toward one another for holes like this so that when the leather pulled it didnt pull on the flats the neat stiches would help keep the saddle in good shape over the years the rows needed to be close enough together to reinforce one another but not so close that there was danger of them ripping into one another staggering the holes helped little things you just had to make sure the little things were done right and his fingers slipped and he punched a hole with the diamond pointing the wrong way two of the holes ripped into one another at the motion he nearly tossed the entire thing across the room in frustration that was the fifth time tonight light he thought pressing his hands on the table whats happened to my selfcontrol he could answer that question with ease unfortunately the black tower is what happened he felt like a multilegged nachi trapped in a driedup tidal pool waiting desperately for the water to return while watching a group of children work their way down the beach with buckets gathering up anything that looked tasty he breathed in and out then picked up the leather this would be the shoddiest piece hed done in years but he would finish it leaving something unfinished was nearly as bad as messing up the details curious said the aes sedaiher name was pevara of the red ajah he could feel her eyes on his back a red well common destinations made for unusual shipmates as the old tairen saying went perhaps he should use the saldaean proverb instead if his sword is at your enemys throat dont waste time remembering when it was at yours so pevara said you were telling me about your life prior to coming to the black tower i dont believe that i was androl said beginning to sew why what did you want to know im simply curious were you one of those who came here on his own to be tested or were you one of those they found while out hunting he pulled a thread tight i came on my own as i believe evin told you yesterday when you asked him about me hmm she said im being monitored i see he looked toward her lowering the leather is that something they teach you what pevara asked innocently to twist a conversation about there you sit all but accusing me of spying on youwhen you were the one interrogating my friends about me i want to know what my resources are you want to know why a man would choose to come to the black tower to learn to channel the one power she didnt answer he could see her deciding upon a response that would not run afoul of the three oaths speaking with an aes sedai was like trying to follow a green snake as it slipped through damp grass yes she said he blinked in surprise yes i want to know she continued we are allies whether either of us desires it or not i want to know what kind of person ive slipped into bed with she eyed him figuratively speaking of course he took a deep breath forcing himself to become calm he hated talking with aes sedai with them twisting everything about that mixed with the tension of the night and the inability to get this saddle right he would be calm light burn him we should practice making a circle pevara said it will be an advantage to usalbeit a small oneagainst taims men should they come for us androl put his dislike of the woman from his mindhe had other things to worry aboutand forced himself to think objectively a circle do you not know what one is afraid not she pursed her lips sometimes i forget how ignorant all of you are she paused as if realizing shed said too much all men are ignorant aes sedai androl said the topics of our ignorance may change but the nature of the world is that no man may know everything that didnt seem to be the answer shed been expecting either those hard eyes studied him she didnt like men who could channelmost people didntbut with her it was more she had spent her life hunting down men like androl a circle pevara said is created when women and men join their strength in the one power together it must be done in a specific way the mhael will know about it then men require women to form a circle pevara said in fact a circle must contain more women than men except in very limited cases one woman and man can link as can one woman and two men as can two women and two men so the largest we could create is a circle of three with me and two of you still it could be of use to us ill find you two of the others to practice with androl said among those i trust id say that nalaam is the strongest emarin is very powerful too and i dont think hes yet reached the height of his strength same for jonneth they are the strongest pevara asked not yourself no he said returning to his work that rain picked up again outside and chill air slipped under the door one of the rooms lamps was burning low nearby letting shadows into the room he watched the darkness uncomfortably i find that hard to believe master androl she said they all look to you believe what you wish aes sedai im weakest among them perhaps the weakest man in the black tower this quieted her and androl rose to refill that dwindling lamp as he sat back down a rap on the door announced the entrance of emarin and canler although both were wet from the rain they were nearly as opposite as men could be one was tall refined and careful the other crotchety and prone to gossip they had found common ground somewhere and seemed to enjoy one anothers company well androl asked it might work emarin said taking off his rainsoaked coat and hanging it on a hook beside the door he wore clothing underneath embroidered after the tairen style it would need to be a powerful rainstorm the guards watch carefully i feel like the prize bull at a fair canler grumbled stomping some of the mud off his boots after hanging up his coat everywhere we go taims favored watch us from the corners of their eyes blood and ashes androl they know they know were going to try running did you find any weak points pevara asked leaning forward someplace where the walls are less guarded it appears to depend upon the guards chosen pevara sedai emarin said nodding to her hmm i suppose that it would have i mentioned how intriguing i find it that the one of you who treats me with the most respect is a tairen being polite to a person is not a sign of respect for them pevara sedai emarin said it is merely a sign of a good upbringing and a balanced nature androl smiled emarin was an absolute wonder with insults half the time the person didnt figure out that hed been mocked until theyd parted ways pevaras mouth pursed well then we watch the rotation of guards when the next storm arrives we will use it as cover and escape over the wall near the guards we think are less observant the two men turned to androl who caught himself watching the corner of the room where the shadow fell from a table was it growing larger reaching toward him i dont like leaving men behind he said forcing himself to look away from the corner there are dozens upon dozens of men and boys here who arent yet under taims control we cant possibly lead all of them out without drawing attention if we leave them we risk he couldnt say it they didnt know what was happening not really people were changing oncetrustworthy allies became enemies overnight they looked like the same people yet different at the same time different behind the eyes androl shivered the women sent by the rebel aes sedai are still outside the gates pevara said they had been camped out there for a time claiming the dragon reborn had promised them warders taim had yet to let any of them in if we can reach them we can storm the tower and rescue those left behind will it really be that easy emarin asked taim will have an entire village of hostages a lot of the men brought their families canler nodded his family was one of those he wouldnt willingly leave them beyond that androl said softly turning on his stool to face pevara do you honestly think the aes sedai can win here many of them have decadessome centuriesof experience how much of that was spent fighting pevara did not answer there are hundreds of men who can channel in here aes sedai androl continued each one has been trainedat lengthto be a weapon we dont learn about politics or history we dont study how to influence nations we learn to kill every man and boy here is pushed to the edges of his capacity forced to stretch and grow gain more power destroy and a lot of them are insane can your aes sedai fight that particularly when many of the men we trustthe very men were trying to savewill likely fight alongside taims men if they see the aes sedai trying to invade your arguments are not without merit pevara said just like a queen he thought unwillingly impressed at her poise but surely we need to send information out pevara continued an allout assault may be unwise but sitting here until we are all taken one at a time i do believe it would be wise to send someone emarin said we need to warn the lord dragon the lord dragon canler said with a snort taking a seat by the wall hes abandoned us emarin were nothing to him it the dragon reborn carries the world on his shoulders canler androl said softly catching canler up short i dont know why hes left us here but id prefer to assume its because he thinks we can handle ourselves androl fingered the straps of leather then stood up this is our time of proving the test of the black tower if we have to run to the aes sedai to protect us from our own we subject ourselves to their authority if we have to run to the lord dragon then we will be nothing once he is gone there can be no reconciliation with taim now emarin said we all know what he is doing androl didnt look at pevara she had explained what she suspected was happening and shedespite years of training at keeping her emotions in checkhad not been able to quiet the fear in her voice as she spoke of it thirteen myrddraal and thirteen channelers together in a horrifying rite could turn any channeler to the shadow against his will what he does is pure undiluted evil pevara said this is no longer a division between the men who follow one leader and those who follow another this is the dark ones work androl the black tower has fallen under the shadow you must accept that the black tower is a dream he said meeting her eyes a shelter for men who can channel a place of our own where men need not fear or run or be hated i will not surrender that to taim i will not the room fell silent save for the sounds of rain on the windows emarin began to nod and canler stood up taking androl by the arm youre right canler said burn me if you aint right androl but what can we do were weak outnumbered emarin androl said did you ever hear about the knoks rebellion indeed it caused quite a stir even outside of murandy bloody murandians canler spat theyll steal your coat off your back and beat you bloody if you dont offer your shoes too emarin raised an eyebrow knoks was well outside lugard canler androl said i think you d find the people there not dissimilar to andorans the rebellion happened about oh ten years back now a group of farmers overthrew their lord emarin said he deserved it by all accountsdesartin was a horrid person particularly to those beneath him he had a force of soldiers one of the largest outside of lugard and was looking as if hed set up his own little kingdom there wasnt a thing the king could do about it and desartin was overthrown canler asked by simple men and women who had had too much of his brutality androl said in the end many of the mercenaries who had been his cronies stood with us though hed seemed so strong his rotten core led to his downfall it seems bad here but most of taims men are not loyal to him men like him dont inspire loyalty they collect cronies others who hope to share in the power or wealth we can and will find a way to overthrow him the others nodded though pevara simply watched him with pursed lips androl couldnt help feeling a bit of the fool he didnt think the others should be looking to him instead of someone distinguished like emarin or someone powerful like nalaam from the corner of his eye he saw the shadows underneath the table lengthen reaching for him he set his jaw they wouldnt dare take him with so many people around would they if the shadows were going to consume him theyd wait until he was alone trying to sleep nights terrified him theyre coming when i dont hold to saidin now he thought burn me the source was cleansed im not supposed to be losing more of my wits he gripped the seat of his stool until the terror retreated the darkness withdrawing canlerlooking uncharacteristically cheerfulsaid he was going to fetch them something to drink he wandered toward the kitchen but nobody was to go about alone so he hesitated i suppose i could use a drink as well pevara said with a sigh joining him androl sat down to continue his work as he did emarin pulled over a stool settling down beside him he did so nonchalantly as if merely looking for a good place to relax and wanting a view out the window emarin however wasnt the type to do things without several motivations you fought in the knoks rebellion emarin said softly did i say that androl resumed his work on the leather you said that when the mercenaries switched sides they fought with you you used the word us to refer to the rebels androl hesitated burn me i really need to watch myself if emarin had noticed pevara would have as well i was just passing through androl said and was caught up in something unanticipated you have a strange and varied past my friend emarin said the more i learn of it the more curious i become i wouldnt say that im the only one with an interesting past androl said softly lord algarin of house pendaloan emarin pulled back eyes widening how did you know fanshir had a book of tairen noble lines androl said mentioning one of the ashaman soldiers who had been a scholar before coming to the tower it included a curious notation a house troubled by a history of men with an unmentionable problem the most recent one having shamed the house not a few dozen years ago i see well i suppose that it is not too much of a surprise that i am a nobleman one who has experience with aes sedai androl continued and who treats them with respect despiteor because ofwhat they did for his family a tairen nobleman who does this mind you one who does not mind serving beneath what you would term farmboys and who sympathizes with citizen rebels if i might say my friend that is not a prevalent attitude among your countrymen i wouldnt hesitate to guess youve had an interesting past of your own emarin smiled point conceded you would be wonderful at the game of houses androl i wouldnt say that androl said with a grimace last time i tried my hand at it i almost he stopped what id rather not say androl said face flushing he was not going to explain that period of his life light people will think im as much a talespinner as nalaam if i continue on like this emarin turned to watch the rain hitting the window the knoks rebellion succeeded for only a short time if i remember correctly within two years the noble line had reestablished itself and the dissenters were driven out or executed yes androl said softly so we do a better job of it here emarin said im your man androl we all are no androl said we are the black towers men ill lead you if i must but this isnt about me or about you or any of us individually i am only in charge until logain returns if he ever returns androl thought gateways into the black tower dont work any longer is he trying to return but finds himself locked out very well emarin said what do we do thunder crashed outside let me think androl said picking up his piece of leather and his tools give me one hour im sorry jesamyn said softly kneeling beside talmanes there is nothing i can do this wound is too far along for my skill talmanes nodded replacing the bandage the skin all along his side had turned black as if from terrible frostbite the kinswoman frowned at him she was a youthfullooking woman with golden hair though with channelers ages could be very deceptive im amazed you can still walk im not certain it could be defined as walking talmanes said limping back toward the soldiers he could still gimp along on his own mostly but the dizzy moments came more frequently now guybon was arguing with dennel who kept pointing at his map and gesturing there was such a haze of smoke in the air that many of the men had tied kerchiefs to their faces they looked like a band of bloody aiel even the trollocs are pulling out of that quarter guybon insisted theres too much fire the trollocs are pulling back to the walls all through the city dennel replied theyre going to let the city burn all night the only sector not burning is the one where the waygate is they knocked down all of the buildings there to create a firewall they used the one power jesamyn said from behind talmanes i felt it black sisters i would not suggest going in that direction jesamyn was the only kinswoman remaining the other had fallen jesamyn wasnt powerful enough to create a gateway but neither was she useless talmanes had watched her burn six trollocs that had broken through his line hed spent that skirmish sitting back overcome by the pain fortunately jesamyn had given him some herbs to chew they made his head feel fuzzier but made the pain manageable it felt as if his body were in a vise being smashed slowly but at least he could stay on his feet we take the quickest route talmanes said the quarter that isnt burning is too close to the dragons i wont risk the shadowspawn discovering aludra and her weapons assuming they havent already guybon glared at him but this was the bands operation guybon was welcome but he wasnt part of their command structure talmanes force continued through the dark city wary of ambushes though they knew the approximate location of the warehouse getting there was problematic many large streets were blocked by wreckage fire or the enemy his force had to crawl through alleyways and lanes so twisted that even guybon and the others from caemlyn had difficulty following their intended direction their path skirted portions of the city that burned with a heat so strong it was probably melting cobblestones talmanes stared at these flames until his eyes felt dry then led his men in further detours inch by inch they approached aludras warehouse twice they encountered trollocs prowling for refugees to kill they finished these off the remaining crossbowmen felling over half of each group before they had time to respond talmanes stood to watch but did not trust himself to fight any longer that wound had left him too weak light why had he left his horse behind fool move that well the trollocs would have chased it off anyway my thoughts are starting to go in circles he pointed with his sword down a crossing alley the scouts scurried on ahead and looked in both directions before giving the all clear i can barely think not much longer now before the darkness takes me he would see the dragons protected first he had to talmanes stumbled out of the alley onto a familiar street they were close on one side of the street structures burned the statues there looked like poor souls trapped in the flames the fires raged around them and their white marble was slowly being overcome with black the other side of the street was silent nothing there burning shadows thrown by the statues danced and played like revelers watching their enemies burn the air smelled oppressively of smoke those shadowsand the burning statuesseemed to move to talmanes fuzzy mind dancing creatures of shadow dying beauties consumed by a sickness upon the skin darkening it feasting upon it killing the soul were close now talmanes said he pushed himself forward into a shambling run he couldnt afford to slow them down if that fire reaches the warehouse they arrived at a burnedout patch of ground the fire had been here and gone apparently a large wooden warehouse had stood here once but it had fallen in now the timbers only smoldered and were heaped with rubble and halfburned trolloc corpses the men gathered around him silent the only sound was that of crackling flames cold sweat dripped down talmanes face we were too late melten whispered they took them didnt they the dragons would have made explosions if theyd burned the shadowspawn arrived took the dragons and burned the place down around talmanes exhausted members of the band sank down to their knees im sorry mat talmanes thought we tried we a sudden sound like thunder cracked through the city it shook talmanes to his bones and the men looked up light guybon said the shadowspawn are using the dragons maybe not talmanes said strength surged through him and he broke into a run again his men filled in around him each footfall sent a jolt of agony up his side he passed down the street with the statues flames to his right cold stillness to his left boom those explosions didnt sound loud enough to be dragons dared he hope for an aes sedai jesamyn seemed to have perked up at the sounds and was running in her skirts alongside the men the group barreled around a corner two streets from the warehouse and came up on the back ranks of a snarling force of shadowspawn talmanes bellowed with a startling ferocity and raised his sword in two hands the fire of his wound had spread through his entire body even his fingers burned with it he felt as if hed become one of those statues consigned to burn with the city he beheaded a trolloc before it knew he was there then threw himself at the next creature in line it drew back with an almost liquid grace turning a face on him that had no eyes a cloak that did not stir in the wind pale lips drew back in a snarl talmanes found himself laughing why not and men said he didnt have a sense of humor talmanes moved into apple blossoms in the wind striking forward wildly with a strength and fury to match the fire that was killing him the myrddraal obviously had him at a disadvantage at his best talmanes would have needed help fighting one the thing moved like a shadow flowing from one form to the next its terrible blade darting toward talmanes it obviously felt it only needed to nick him it scored a hit on his cheek the tip of its sword catching on his skin there and slicing a neat ribbon through the flesh talmanes laughed and struck at the weapon with his sword causing the fades mouth to open wide in surprise that wasnt how men were supposed to react they were supposed to stumble at the burning flare of pain cry out as they knew their life had ended ive already had one of your flaming swords in me you son of a goat talmanes screamed attacking time and time again blacksmith strikes the blade such an inelegant form it fit his mood perfectly the myrddraal stumbled talmanes swept back in a smooth motion bringing his sword to the side and slicing the things pale white arm free at the elbow the limb twisted in the air the fades blade dropping from spasming fingers talmanes spun for momentum and brought his sword across with two hands severing the fades head from its neck dark blood sprayed free and the thing fell its remaining hand clawing at the bloodied stump as it collapsed talmanes stood over it his sword suddenly feeling too heavy to hold it slipped from his fingers clanging to the paving stones he tipped and lost his balance falling facefirst but a hand caught him from behind light melten exclaimed looking at the body another one ive found the secret to defeating them talmanes whispered you just have to be dead already he chuckled to himself though melten just looked at him seeming baffled around them dozens of trollocs collapsed to the ground writhing theyd been linked to the fade the band gathered around talmanes some bearing wounds a few were down for good they were exhausted and worn down this batch of trollocs could have ended them melten retrieved talmanes sword and swabbed it clean but talmanes found he was having trouble standing so he sheathed it and had a man fetch a trolloc spear for him to lean on ho the back of the street a distant voice called whoever you are thank you talmanes limped forward filger and mar scouting on ahead without needing orders the street here was dark and cluttered with trollocs that had fallen moments ago so it was a moment before talmanes could climb over the corpses and see who had called to him someone had built a barricade at the end of the street people stood atop it including one who held aloft a torch she had hair in braids and wore a plain brown dress with a white apron it was aludra cauthons soldiers aludra said sounding unimpressed your time you certainly did take it coming for me in one hand she held a stubby leather cylinder larger than a mans fist with a short length of dark fuse attached talmanes knew they exploded after she lit and threw them the band had used them before hurling them from slings they werent as devastating as dragons but still powerful aludra talmanes called you have the dragons please tell me you saved them she sniffed waving for some people to pull apart a side of the barricade to admit his men she appeared to have several hundredmaybe several thousandtownspeople back there filling the street as they opened the way for him he saw a beautiful sight surrounded by townspeople a hundred dragons rested there the bronze tubes had been fitted to wooden dragon carts to comprise a single unit pulled by two horses they were really quite maneuverable all things considered those carts could be anchored in the ground to manage recoil talmanes knew and the dragons fired once the horses were detached there were more than enough people here to do the work horses should have been available to do you think i would leave them aludra asked this lot they do not have the training to fire them but they can pull a cart as well as anyone else we have to get them out talmanes said this it is a new revelation to you aludra asked as if i havent been trying to do that very thing your face what is wrong with it i once ate a rather sharp cheese and it has never quite sat right with me aludra cocked her head at him maybe if i smiled more when i made jokes he thought idly leaning against the side of the barricade then theyd understand what i meant that of course raised the question did he want people to understand it was often more amusing the other way besides smiling was so garish where was the subtlety and and he was really having trouble focusing he blinked at aludra whose face had grown concerned in the torchlight what about my face talmanes raised a hand to his cheek blood the myrddraal right just a cut and the veins veins he asked then noticed his hand tendrils of blackness like ivy growing beneath the skin had wound down his wrist and across the back of his hand toward the fingers they seemed to be growing darker as he watched oh that im dying unfortunately terribly tragic you wouldnt happen to have any brandy would you i my lord a voice called talmanes blinked then forced himself to turn about leaning on the spear yes filger more trollocs my lord lots of them theyre filling in behind us lovely set the table i hope we have enough dinnerware i knew we should have sent the maid for that five thousand seven hundred and thirtyfirst set are you feeling all right aludra asked blood and bloody ashes woman do i look like im feeling well guybon retreat is cut off how far from the east gates are we east gates guybon called maybe a halfhour march we need to head further down the hill onward we go then talmanes said take the scouts and go on point dennel make sure those local folk are organized to haul those dragons be ready to set up the weapons talmanes aludra said stepping in dragons eggs and powder we have few of them left we will need the supplies from baerlon today if you set up the dragons a few shots for each dragon this is all i can give you dennel nodded dragons arent meant to make up frontline units all by themselves my lord they need support to keep the enemy from coming too close and destroying the weapons we can man those dragons but we wont last long without infantry thats why were running talmanes said fie turned took a step and was so woozy he almost fell and i believe i believe ill need a horse moghedien stepped onto a platform of stone floating in the middle of an open sea glassy and blue the water rippled in the occasional breeze but there were no waves neither was there land in sight moridin stood at the side of the platform hands clasped behind his back in front of him the sea burned the fire gave off no smoke but it was hot and the water near it hissed and boiled stone flooring in the middle of an endless sea water that burned moridin always had enjoyed creating impossibilities within his dreamshards sit moridin said to her not turning she obeyed choosing one of the four chairs suddenly arranged near the center of the platform the sky was deep blue cloudless and the sun hung at about threequarters of the way to its zenith how long had it been since shed seen the sun in telaranrhiod lately that omnipresent black storm had blanketed the sky but then this wasnt completely telaranrhiod nor was it moridins dream but a melding of the two like a temporary leanto built off the side of the dream world a bubble of merged realities moghedien wore a gown of black and gold lacework on the sleeves faintly reminiscent of a spiders web only faintly one did well not to overuse a theme as she sat moghedien tried to exude control and selfconfidence once both had come easily for her today trying to capture either was like trying to snatch dandelion seeds from the air only to have them dance away from her hand moghedien gritted her teeth angry at herself she was one of the chosen she had made kings weep armies tremble her name had been used by generations of mothers to frighten their children and now she felt at her neck found the pendant hanging there it was still safe she knew it was but touching it brought her calmness do not grow too comfortable wearing that moridin said a wind blew across him rippling the pristine ocean surface on that wind she heard faint screams you are not completely forgiven moghedien this is a probation perhaps when you fail next i will give the mindtrap to demandred she sniffed he would toss it aside in boredom demandred wants only one thing althor anyone who does not lead him toward his goal is unimportant to him you underestimate him moridin said softly the great lord is pleased with demandred very pleased you however moghedien sank down in her chair feeling her tortures anew pain such as few in this world had ever known pain beyond what a body should be able to endure she held to the coursouvra and embraced saidar that brought some relief before channeling in the same room as the coursouvra had been agonizing now that she rather than moridin wore the pendant it was not so not just a pendant she thought clutching it my soul itself darkness within she had never thought that she of all people would find herself subject to one of these was she not the spider careful in all that she did she reached her other hand up clasping it over the one that held the pendant what if it fell what if someone took it she wouldnt lose it she couldnt lose it this is what i have become she felt sick i have to recover somehow she forced herself to let go of the mindtrap the last battle was upon them already trollocs poured into the southern lands it was a new war of the shadow but only she and the other chosen knew the deeper secrets of the one power the ones she hadnt been forced to give up to those horrible women no dont think about that the pain the suffering the failure in this war they faced no hundred companions no aes sedai with centuries of skill and practice she would prove herself and past errors would be forgotten moridin continued to stare at those impossible flames the only sounds were that of the fire and of the water that boiled near it he would eventually explain his purpose in summoning her wouldnt he he had been acting increasingly strange lately perhaps his madness was returning once the man named moridinor ishamael or elan morin tedronaiwould have delighted in holding a coursouvra for one of his rivals fie would have invented punishments thrilled in her agony there had been some of that at the start then he had lost interest fie spent more and more time alone staring into flames brooding the punishments he had administered to her and cyndane had seemed almost routine she found him more dangerous this way a gateway split the air just to the side of the platform do we really need to do this every other day moridin demandred asked stepping through and into the world of dreams handsome and tall he had jet hair and a prominent nose he gave moghedien a glance noting the mindtrap on her neck before continuing i have important things to do and you interrupt them there are people you need to meet demandred moridin said softly unless the great lord has named you naeblis without informing me you will do as you are told your playthings can wait demandreds expression darkened but he did not object further he let the gateway close then moved to the side looking down into the sea he frowned what was in the waters she hadnt looked she felt foolish for not having done so what had happened to her caution demandred walked to one of the chairs near her but did not sit he stood contemplating moridin from behind what had demandred been doing during her period bound to the mindtrap she had done moridins bidding but had never found an answer to demandred she shivered again thinking of those months under moridins control i will have vengeance youve let moghedien free demandred said what of this cyndane she is not your concern moridin said moghedien had not failed to notice that moridin still wore cyndanes mindtrap cyndane it meant last chance in the old tongue but the womans true nature was one secret that moghedien had discovered moridin himself had rescued lanfear from sindhol freeing her from the creatures that feasted upon her ability to channel in order to rescue her and of course to punish her moridin had slain her that had allowed the great lord to recapture her soul and place it in a new body brutal but very effective precisely the kind of solution the great lord preferred moridin was focused on his flames and demandred on him so moghedien used the chance to slip out of her seat and walk to the edge of the floating stone platform the water below was completely clear through it she could see people very distinctly they floated with their legs chained to something deep below arms bound behind them they swayed like kelp there were thousands of them each of them looked up at the sky with wide horrified eyes they were locked in a perpetual state of drowning not dead not allowed to die but constantly gasping for air and finding only water as she watched something dark reached up from below and pulled one of them down into the depths blood rose like a blooming flower it caused the others to struggle all the more urgently moghedien smiled it did her good to see someone other than herself suffering these might simply be figments but it was possible that they were ones who had failed the great lord another gateway opened at the side of the platform and an unfamiliar woman stepped through the creature had alarmingly unpleasant features with a hooked yet bulbous nose and pale eyes that were off center with one another she wore a dress that tried to be fine of yellow silk but it only served to highlight the womans ugliness moghedien sneered and returned to her seat why was moridin admitting a stranger to one of their meetings this woman could channel she must be one of those useless women who called themselves aes sedai in this age granted moghedien thought sitting she is powerful how had moghedien missed noticing one with this talent among the aes sedai her sources had picked out that wretched lightskirt nynaeve almost immediately yet theyd missed this hag this is who you wish us to meet demandred said lips turning down no moridin said absently youve met hessalam before hessalam it meant without forgiveness in the old tongue the woman met moghediens eyes proudly and there was something familiar about her stance i have things to be about moridin the newcomer said this had better be moghedien gasped the tone in that voice do not take that tone with me moridin cut in speaking softly not turning do not take it with any of us currently even moghedien is favored more than you graendal moghedien asked horrified do not use that name moridin said spinning on her the burning water flaring up it has been stripped from her graendalhessalamsat down without looking again at moghedien yes the way the woman carried herself was right it was her moghedien almost chortled with glee graendal had always used her looks as a bludgeon well now they were a bludgeon of a different type how perfect the woman must be positively writhing inside what had she done to earn such a punishment graendals statureher authority the myths told about herwere all linked to her beauty what now would she have to start searching for the most horrid people alive to keep as pets the only ones who could compete with her ugliness this time moghedien did laugh a quiet laugh but graendal heard the woman shot her a glare that could have set a section of the ocean aflame all on its own moghedien returned a calm gaze feeling more confident now she resisted the urge to stroke the coursouvra bring what you will graendal she thought we are on level footing now we shall see who ends this race ahead a stronger wind blew past and ripples started to rise around them though the platform itself remained secure moridin let his fire die out and nearby waves rose moghedien could make out bodies little more than dark shadows inside those waves some were dead others struggled for the surface their chains removed but as they neared the open air something always towed them back down again we are few now moridin said we four and the one who is punished most are all that remain by definition that makes us the strongest some of us are moghedien thought one of us was slain by althor moridin and required the great lords hand to return him why had moridin never been punished for his failure well it was best not to look too long for fairness in the great lords hand still we are too few moridin waved a hand and a stone doorway appeared on the side of the platform not a gateway just a door this was moridins dreamshard he could control it the door opened and a man strode through it and out onto the platform darkhaired the man had the features of a saldaeana nose that was faintly hooked eyes that tilted he was handsome and tall and moghedien recognized him the leader of those fledgling male aes sedai i know this man mazri that name has been discarded moridin said just as each of us upon being chosen discarded what we were and the names men called us from this moment on this man shall be known only as mhael one of the chosen chosen hessalam seemed to choke on the word this child he she cut off it was not their place to debate if one was chosen they could argue among themselves even plot if they did so with care but questioning the great lord that was not allowed ever hessalam said no more moridin would not dare call this man chosen if the great lord had not decided it there was no argument to be made still moghedien shivered taim mhael was said to be strong perhaps as strong as the rest of them but elevating one from this age with all of their ignorance it galled her to consider that this mhael would be regarded as her equal i see the challenge in your eyes moridin said looking at the three of them though only one of you was foolish enough to start voicing it mhael has earned his reward too many of our number threw themselves into contests with althor when he was presumed to be weak mhael instead earned lews therins trust then took charge of the training of his weapons he has been raising a new generation of dreadlords to the shadows cause what do the three of you have to show for your work since being released you will know the fruits i have harvested moridin demandred said voice low you will know them in bushels and droves just remember my requirement i face althor on the field of battle his blood is mine and no one elses he met each of their eyes in turn then finally those of mhael there seemed to be a familiarity to them the two had met before you will have competition with that one demandred moghedien thought he wants althor nearly as much as you do demandred had been changing lately once he wouldnt have cared who killed lews therinso long as the man died what made demandred insist on doing the deed himself moghedien moridin said demandred has plans for the war to come you are to assist him assist him she said i do you forget yourself so quickly moghedien moridins voice was silky you will do as you are told demandred wants you watching over one of the armies that now lacks proper monitoring speak a single word of complaint and you will realize that the pain you have known up to now is but a shadow of true agony her hand went to the coursouvra at her neck looking into his eyes she felt her authority evaporate i hate you she thought i hate you more for doing this to me in front of the others the last days are upon us moridin said turning his back on them in these hours you will earn your final rewards if you have grudges put them behind you if you have plots bring them to completion make your final plays for this this is the end talmanes lay on his back staring up at a dark sky the clouds above seemed to be reflecting light from below the light of a dying city that was wrong light came from above didnt it hed fallen from the horse not long after starting for the city gate he could remember that most of the time pain made it hard to think people yelled at one another i should have i should have taunted mat more he thought a hint of a smile cracking his lips stupid time to be thinking of such things i have to have to find the dragons or did we find them already im telling you the bloody things dont work like that dennels voice theyre not bloody aes sedai on wheels we cant make a wall of fire we can send these balls of metal hurtling through the trollocs they explode guybons voice we could use the extras like i say talmanes eyes drifted closed the balls explode yes dennel said but we have to launch them first setting them all in a row and letting the trollocs run over them wont do much a hand shook talmanes shoulder lord talmanes melten said there is no dishonor in letting it end now i know the pain is great may the last embrace of the mother shelter you a sword being drawn talmanes steeled himself then he found that he really really didnt want to die he forced his eyes open and held up a hand to melten who stood over him jesamyn hovered nearby with arms folded looking worried help me to my feet talmanes said melten hesitated then did so you shouldnt be standing jesamyn said better than being beheaded in honor talmanes grumbled gritting his teeth against the pain light was that his hand it was so dark it looked as if it had been charred in a fire what what is going on were cornered my lord melten said grimly eyes solemn he thought them all as good as dead dennel and guybon are arguing over placement of the dragons for a last stand aludra is measuring the charges talmanes finally standing sagged against melten before him two thousand people clustered in the large city square they huddled like men in the wilderness seeking one anothers warmth on a cold night dennel and guybon had set up the dragons in a halfcircle bowed outward pointing toward the center of the city refugees behind the band was now committed to manning the dragons three pairs of hands were needed to operate each weapon almost all of the band had had at least some training the buildings nearby had caught fire but the light was doing strange things why didnt it reach the streets those were all too dark as if theyd been painted like he blinked clearing the tears of pain from his eyes realization dawning trollocs filled the streets like ink flowing toward the halfcircle of dragons that were pointed at them something held the trollocs back for the moment theyre waiting until they are all together for a rush talmanes thought calls and snarls came from behind talmanes pivoted then clutched meltens arm as the world lurched he waited for it to steady the pain the pain was actually dulling like glowing flames running out of fresh coal it had feasted upon him but there wasnt much left of him for it to eat as things steadied talmanes saw what was creating the snarls the square they were in adjoined the city wall but the townspeople and soldiers had kept their distance from the wall for it was coated with trollocs like a thick grime they raised weapons in the air and roared down at the people they throw down spears at anyone who comes too close melten said wed been hoping to reach the wall then follow it along to the gate but we cantnot with those things up there raining death upon us all other routes are cut off aludra approached guybon and dennel charges i can set under the dragons she said to them softly but not as softly as she should have these charges they will destroy the weapons they may hurt the people in an unpleasant way do it guybon said very softly what the trollocs would do is worse and we cannot allow the dragons to fall into the shadows hands thats why theyre waiting their leaders are hoping that a sudden rush will give them time to overwhelm us and seize the weapons theyre moving a soldier called from beside the dragons light theyre coming that dark slime of shadowspawn bubbled down the streets teeth nails claws toohuman eyes the trollocs came from all sides eager for the kill talmanes struggled to draw breath on the walls the calls grew excited were surrounded talmanes thought pressed back against the wall caught in a net we pressed back against the wall dennel talmanes shouted over the din the captain of dragons turned from his line where men waited with burning punks for the call to launch the one volley theyd have talmanes took a deep breath that made his lungs burn you told me that you could level an enemy bulwark in only a few shots of course dennel called but were not trying to enter he trailed off light talmanes thought were all so exhausted we should have seen this you in the middle rydens dragon squad aboutface talmanes screamed the rest of you stay in position and fire at the oncoming trollocs move move mover the dragoners sprang into motion ryden and his men hastily turning their weapons about wheels creaking the other dragons began to fire a pattern of shot that sprayed through the streets entering the square the booms were deafening causing refugees to scream and cover their ears it sounded like the end of the world hundreds thousands of trollocs went down in pools of blood as dragons eggs exploded in their midst the square filled with white smoke that poured from the mouths of the dragons the refugees behind already terrified by what they had just witnessed shrieked as rydens dragons turned on them and most of them fell to the ground in fright clearing a path a path that exposed the trollocinfested city wall rydens line of dragons bowed inward like a cup the reverse formation of those firing into the trollocs behind so that the tubes were pointed at the same section of city wall give me one of those bloody punks talmanes shouted holding out a hand one of the dragoners obeyed passing him a flaming brand with a glowing red tip he pushed away from melten determined to stand on his own for the moment guybon stepped up the mans voice sounded soft to talmanes strained ears those walls have stood for hundreds of years my poor city my poor poor city its not your city any longer talmanes said raising his flaming brand high in the air defiant before a wall thick with trollocs a burning city to his back its theirs talmanes swiped the brand down in the air leaving a trail of red his signal ignited a roar of dragonfire that echoed throughout the square trollocspieces of them at leastblew into the air the wall under them exploded like a stack of childrens blocks kicked at a full run as talmanes wavered his vision blackening he saw the wall crumble outward when he toppled slipping into unconsciousness the ground seemed to tremble from the force of his fall chapter eastward the wind blew the wheel of time turns and ages come and pass leaving memories that become legend legend fades to myth and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth comes again in one age called the third age by some an age yet to come an age long past a wind rose in the mountains of mist the wind was not the beginning there are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the wheel of time but it was a beginning eastward the wind blew descending from lofty mountains and coursing over desolate hills it passed into the place known as the westwood an area that had once flourished with pine and leatherleaf here the wind found little more than tangled underbrush thick save around an occasional towering oak those looked stricken by disease bark peeling free branches drooping elsewhere needles had fallen from pines draping the ground in a brown blanket none of the skeletal branches of the westwood put forth buds north and eastward the wind blew across underbrush that crunched and cracked as it shook it was night and scrawny foxes picked over the rotting ground searching in vain for prey or carrion no spring birds had come to call andmost tellingthe howls of wolves had gone silent across the land the wind blew out of the forest and across taren ferry what was left of it the town had been a fine one by local standards dark buildings tall above their redstone foundations a cobbled street built at the mouth of the land known as the two rivers the smoke had long since stopped rising from burned buildings but there was little left of the town to rebuild feral dogs hunted through the rubble for meat they looked up as the wind passed their eyes hungry the wind crossed the river eastward fiere clusters of refugees carrying torches walked the long road from baerlon to whitebridge despite the late hour they were sorry groups with heads bowed shoulders huddled some bore the coppery skin of domani their worn clothing displaying the hardships of crossing the mountains with little in the way of supplies others came from farther off taraboners with haunted eyes above dirty veils farmers and their wives from northern ghealdan all had heard rumors that in andor there was food in andor there was hope so far they had yet to find either eastward the wind blew along the river that wove between farms without crops grasslands without grass orchards without fruit abandoned villages trees like bones with the flesh picked free ravens often clustered in their branches starveling rabbits and sometimes larger game picked through the dead grass underneath above it all the omnipresent clouds pressed down upon the land sometimes that cloud cover made it impossible to tell if it was day or night as the wind approached the grand city of caemlyn it turned northward away from the burning cityorange red and violent spewing black smoke toward the hungry clouds above war had come to andor in the still of night the approaching refugees would soon discover that theyd been marching toward danger it was not surprising danger was in all directions the only way to avoid walking toward it would be to stand still as the wind blew northward it passed people sitting beside roads alone or in small groups staring with the eyes of the hopeless some lay as they hungered looking up at those rumbling boiling clouds other people trudged onward though toward what they knew not the last battle to the north whatever that meant the last battle was not hope the last battle was death but it was a place to be a place to go in the evening dimness the wind reached a large gathering far to the north of caemlyn this wide field broke the forestpatched landscape but it was overgrown with tents like fungi on a decaying log tens of thousands of soldiers waited beside campfires that were quickly denuding the area of timber the wind blew among them whipping smoke from fires into the faces of soldiers the people here didnt display the same sense of hopelessness as the refugees but there was a dread to them they could see the sickened land they could feel the clouds above they knew the world was dying the soldiers stared at the flames watching the wood be consumed ember by ember what had once been alive turned to dust a company of men inspected armor that had begun to rust despite being well oiled a group of whiterobed aiel collected waterformer warriors who refused to take up weapons again despite their toh having been served a cluster of frightened servants sure that tomorrow would bring war between the white tower and the dragon reborn organized stores inside tents shaken by the wind men and women whispered the truth into the night the end has come the end has come all will fall the end has come laughter broke the air warm light spilled from a large tent at the center of the camp bursting around the tent flap and from beneath the sides inside that tent rand althorthe dragon rebornlaughed head thrown back so what did she do rand asked when his laughter subsided he poured himself a cup of red wine then one for perrin who blushed at the question hes become harder rand thought but somehow he hasnt lost that innocence of his not completely to rand that seemed a marvelous thing a wonder like a pearl discovered in a trout perrin was strong but his strength hadnt broken him well perrin said you know how marin is she somehow manages to look at even cenn as if he were a child in need of mothering finding faile and me lying there on the floor like two fool youths well i think she was torn between laughing at us and sending us into the kitchen to scrub dishes separately to keep us out of trouble rand smiled trying to picture it perrinburly solid perrinso weak he could barely walk it was an incongruous image rand wanted to assume his friend was exaggerating but perrin didnt have a dishonest hair on his head strange how much about a man could change while his core remained exactly the same anyway perrin said after taking a drink of wine faile picked me up off the floor and set me on my horse and the two of us pranced about looking important i didnt do much the fighting was accomplished by the othersid have had trouble lifting a cup to my lips he stopped his golden eyes growing distant you should be proud of them rand without dannil your father and mats father without all of them i wouldnt have managed half what i did no not a tenth i believe it rand regarded his wine lews therin had loved wine a part of randthat distant part the memories of a man he had beenwas displeased by the vintage few wines in the current world could match the favored vintages of the age of legends not the ones he had sampled at least he took a small drink then set the wine aside min still slumbered in another part of the tent sectioned off with a curtain events in rands dreams had awakened him he had been glad for perrins arrival to take his mind off what he had seen mienn no he would not let that woman distract him that was probably the point of what he had seen walk with me rand said i need to check on some things for tomorrow they went out into the night several maidens fell into step behind them as rand walked toward sebban balwer whose services perrin had loaned to rand which was fine with balwer who was prone to gravitate toward those holding the greatest power rand perrin asked walking beside him with a hand on mahalleinir ive told you about all of this before the siege of the two rivers the fighting why ask after it again i asked about the events before perrin i asked after what happened but i did not ask after the people it happened to he looked at perrin making a globe of light for them to see by as they walked in the night i need to remember the people not doing so is a mistake i have made too often in the past the stirring wind carried the scent of campfires from perrins nearby camp and the sounds of smiths working on weapons rand had heard the stories powerwrought weapons discovered again perrins men were working overtime running his two ashaman ragged to make as many as possible rand had lent him as many more ashaman as he could spare if only becauseas soon as theyd heardhed had dozens of maidens presenting themselves and demanding powerwrought spearheads it only makes sense rand althor beralna had explained his smiths can make four spearheads for every sword shed grimaced saying the word sword as if it tasted like seawater rand had never tasted seawater lews therin had knowing facts like that had greatly discomforted him once now he had learned to accept that part of him can you believe what has happened to us perrin asked light sometimes i wonder when the man who owns all these fancy clothes is going to walk in on me and start yelling then send me out to muck the stables for being too bigheaded for my collar the wheel weaves as the wheel wills perrin weve become what we needed to become perrin nodded as they walked on the path between tents lit by the glow of the light above rands hand how does it feel perrin asked those memories youve gained have you ever had a dream that upon waking you remembered in stark clarity not one that faded quickly but one that stayed with you through the day yes perrin said sounding oddly reserved yes i can say that i have its like that rand said i can remember being lews therin can remember doing what he did as one remembers actions in a dream it was me doing them but i dont necessarily like themor think id take those actions if i were in my waking mind that doesnt change the fact that in the dream they seemed like the right actions perrin nodded hes me rand said and im him but at the same time im not well you still seem like yourself perrin said though rand caught a slight hesitation on the word seem had perrin been about to say smell instead you havent changed that much rand doubted he could explain it to perrin without sounding mad the person he became when he wore the mantle of the dragon reborn that wasnt simply an act wasnt simply a mask it was who he was he had not changed he had not transformed he had merely accepted that didnt mean he had all of the answers despite four hundred years of memories nestled in his brain he still worried about what he had to do lews therin hadnt known how to seal the bore his attempt had led to disaster the taint the breaking all for an imperfect prison with seals that were now brittle one answer kept coming to rand a dangerous answer one that lews therin hadnt considered what if the answer wasnt to seal the dark one away again what if the answer the final answer was something else something more permanent yes rand thought to himself for the hundredth time but is it possible they arrived at the tent where the clerks worked the maidens fanning out behind them rand and perrin entering the clerks were up late of course and they didnt look surprised to see rand enter my lord dragon balwer said bowing stiffly from where he stood beside a table of maps and stacks of paper the driedup little man sorted his papers nervously one knobby elbow protruding from a hole in his oversized brown coat report rand said roedran will come balwer said his voice thin and precise the queen of andor has sent for him promising him gateways made by those kinswomen of hers our eyes in his court say he is angry that he needs her help to attend but is insistent that he needs to be at this meetingif only so he doesnt look left out excellent rand said elayne knows nothing of your spies my lord balwer said sounding indignant have you determined who is spying for her among our clerks rand asked balwer sputtered nobody shell have someone balwer rand said with a smile she all but taught me how to do this after all no matter after tomorrow my intentions will be manifest for all secrets wont be needed none save the ones i keep closest to my own heart that means everyone will be here for the meeting right perrin asked every major ruler tear and illian the amyrlin persuaded them to attend balwer said i have copies of their exchanges here if you wish to see them my lords i would rand said send them to my tent i will look them over tonight the shaking of the ground came suddenly clerks grabbed stacks of papers holding them down and crying out as furniture crashed to the ground around them outside men shouted barely audible over the sound of trees breaking metal clanging the land groaned a distant rumble rand felt it like a painful muscle spasm thunder shook the sky distant like a promise of things to come the shaking subsided the clerks remained holding their stacks of paper as if afraid to let go and risk them toppling its really here rand thought im not readywere not readybut its here anyway he had spent many months fearing this day ever since trollocs had come in the night ever since lan and moiraine had dragged him from the two rivers he had feared what was to come the last battle the end he found himself unafraid now that it had come worried but not afraid im coming for you rand thought tell the people rand said to his clerks post warnings earthquakes will continue storms real ones terrible ones there will be a breaking and we cannot avoid it the dark one will try to grind this world to dust the clerks nodded shooting concerned glances at one another by lamplight perrin looked contemplative but nodded faintly as if to himself any other news rand asked the queen of andor may be up to something tonight my lord balwer said something is not a very descriptive word balwer rand said balwer grimaced im sorry my lord i dont have more for you yet i only just received this note queen elayne was awakened by some of her advisors a short time ago i dont have anyone close enough to know why rand frowned resting his hand on lamans sword at his waist it could just be plans for tomorrow perrin said true rand said let me know if you discover anything balwer thank you you do well here the man stood taller in these last daysdays so darkevery man looked for something useful to do balwer was the best at what he did and was confident in his own abilities still it did no harm to be reminded of the fact by one who employed him particularly if his employer was none other than the dragon reborn rand left the tent perrin following youre worried about it perrin said whatever it was that awoke elayne they would not awaken her without good cause rand said softly considering her state pregnant pregnant with his children light he had only just learned of it why hadnt she been the one to tell him the answer was simple elayne could feel rands emotions as he felt hers she would have been able to feel how he had been recently before dragonmount back when well she wouldnt have wanted to confront him with a pregnancy when hed been in such a state beyond that he hadnt exactly made himself easy to find still it was a shock im going to be a father he thought not for the first time yes lews therin had had children could remember them and his love for them it wasnt the same he rand althor would be a father assuming he won the last battle they wouldnt have awakened elayne without good reason he continued returning to task im worried not because of what might have happened but because of the potential distraction tomorrow will be an important day if the shadow has any inkling of tomorrows importance it will try whatever it can to keep us from meeting from unifying perrin scratched at his beard i have people close to elayne people who keep watch on things for me rand raised his hand lets go talk to them i have a great deal to do tonight but yes i cant let this slip the two turned toward perrins camp nearby picking up their pace rands bodyguards following like shadows with veils and spears the night felt too quiet egwene in her tent worked on a letter to rand she was not certain if she would send it sending it was not important writing it was about organizing her thoughts determining what she wished to say to him gawyn pushed his way into the tent again hand on his sword warder cloak rustling are you going to stay in this time egwene asked dipping her pen or are you going to go right back out i dont like this night egwene he looked over his shoulder something feels wrong about it the world holds its breath gawyn waiting upon the events of the morrow did you send to elayne as i requested yes she wont be awake its too late for her we shall see it wasnt long before a messenger arrived from elaynes camp bearing a small folded letter egwene read it then smiled come she said to gawyn rising and gathering a few things she waved a hand and a gateway split the air were traveling there gawyn asked its only a short walk a short walk would require the amyrlin to call upon the queen of andor egwene said as gawyn stepped through the gateway first and checked the other side sometimes i dont want to take an action that starts people asking questions siuan would have killed for this ability egwene thought as she stepped through the gateway how many more plots could that woman have spun if shed been able to visit others as quickly quietly and easily as this on the other side elayne stood beside a warm brazier the queen wore a pale green dress her belly swollen from the babes within she hastened over to egwene and kissed her ring birgitte stood to one side of the tent flaps arms folded wearing her short red jacket and wide skyblue trousers her golden braid down over her shoulder gawyn cocked an eyebrow at his sister im surprised you are awake im waiting for a report elayne said gesturing for egwene to join her in a pair of cushioned chairs beside the brazier something important egwene asked elayne fawned jesamyn forgot to check in again from caemlyn i left the woman strict orders to send to me every two hours and yet she dallies light its probably nothing still i asked serinia to go to the traveling grounds to check on things for me i hope you dont mind you need rest gawyn said folding his arms thank you very much for the advice elayne said which i will ignore as i ignored birgitte when she said the same thing mother what is it you wished to discuss egwene handed over the letter she had been working on to rand elayne asked you have a different perspective on him than i tell me what you think of this letter i might not send it to him i havent decided yet the tone is forceful elayne noted he doesnt seem to respond to anything else after a moment of reading elayne lowered the letter perhaps we should simply let him do as he wishes break the seals egwene asked release the dark one why not light elayne it has to happen doesnt it elayne asked i mean the dark ones going to escape hes practically free already egwene rubbed her temples there is a difference between touching the world and being free during the war of power the dark one was never truly released into the world the bore let him touch it but that was resealed before he could escape if the dark one had entered the world the wheel itself would have been broken here i brought this to show you egwene retrieved a stack of notes from her satchel the sheets had been hastily gathered by the librarians of the thirteenth depository im not saying that we shouldnt break the seals egwene said im saying that we cant afford to risk one of rands crackbrained schemes with this elayne smiled fondly light but she was smitten i can rely on her cant i it was hard to tell with elayne these days the womans ploy with the kinswomen we have unfortunately found nothing pertinent in your library terangreal the statue of the smiling bearded man had nearly caused a riot in the tower every sister had wanted to read the thousands of books that it held all of the books seem to have been written before the bore was opened they will keep searching but these notes contain everything we could gather on the seals the prison and the dark one if we break the seals at the wrong time i fear it would mean an end to all things here read this she handed a page to elayne the karaethon cycle elayne asked curious and light shall fail and dawn shall not come and still the captive rails the captive is the dark one i think so egwene said the prophecies are never clear rand intends to enter the last battle and break the seals immediately but that is a dreadful idea we have an extended war ahead of us freeing the dark one now will strengthen the forces of the shadow and weaken us if it is to be doneand i still dont know that it has to bewe should wait until the last possible moment at the very least we need to discuss it rand has been right about many things but he has been wrong too this is not a decision he should be allowed to make alone elayne shuffled through the sheets of paper then stopped on one of them his blood shall give us the light she rubbed the page with her thumb as if lost in thought wait upon the light who added this note that is doniella alievins copy of the termendal translation of the karaethon cycle egwene said doniella made her own notes and they have been the subject of nearly as much discussion among scholars as the prophecies themselves she was a dreamer you know the only amyrlin that we know of to have been one before me anyway yes elayne said the sisters who gathered these for me came to the same conclusion that i have egwene said there may be a time to break the seals but that time is not at the start of the last battle whatever rand thinks we must wait for the right moment and as the watcher of the seals it is my duty to choose that moment i wont risk the world on one of rands overly dramatic stratagems he has a fair bit of gleeman in him elayne said again fondly your argument is a good one egwene make it to him he will listen to you he does have a good mind and can be persuaded we shall see for now i egwene suddenly sensed a spike of alarm from gawyn she glanced over to see him turning hoofbeats outside his ears werent any better than egwenes but it was his job to listen for things like this egwene embraced the true source causing elayne to do likewise birgitte already had the tent flaps open hand on her sword a frazzled messenger leaped from horseback outside eyes wide she scrambled into the tent birgitte and gawyn falling in beside her immediately watching in case she came too close she didnt caemlyn is under attack your majesty the woman said gasping for breath what elayne leaped to her feet how did jarid sarand finally trollocs the messenger said it started near dusk impossible elayne said grabbing the messenger by the arm and hauling her out of the tent egwene followed hastily its been over six hours since dusk elayne said to the messenger why havent we heard anything until now what happened to the kinswomen i was not told my queen the messenger said captain guybon sent me to fetch you at speed he just arrived through the gateway the traveling ground was not far from elaynes tent a crowd had gathered but men and women made way for the amyrlin and queen in moments the two of them reached the front a group of men in bloodied clothing trudged through the open gateway pulling carts laden with elaynes new weapons the dragons many of the men seemed near collapse they smelled of smoke and their skin was blackened by soot not a few of them slumped unconscious as elaynes soldiers grabbed the carts which were obviously meant for horses to pull to help them other gateways opened nearby as serinia sedai and some of the stronger of the kinswomenegwene wouldnt think of them as elaynes kinswomen created them refugees poured through like the waters of a suddenly unstopped river go egwene said to gawyn weaving her own gatewayone to the traveling grounds in the white tower camp nearby send for as many aes sedai as we can rouse tell bryne to ready his soldiers tell them to do as elayne orders and send them through gateways to the outskirts of caemlyn we will show solidarity with andor gawyn nodded ducking through the gateway egwene let it vanish then joined elayne near the gathering of wounded confused soldiers sumeko of the kinswomen had taken charge of seeing that healing was given to those in immediate danger the air was thick with the smell of smoke as egwene hurried to elayne she caught sight of something through one of the gateways caemlyn afire light she stood stunned for a moment then hurried on elayne was speaking with guybon commander of the queens guard the handsome man seemed barely able to remain on his feet his clothing and arms alarmingly bloodied darkfriends killed two of the women you left to send messages your majesty he was saying in a tired voice another fell in the fighting but we retrieved the dragons once we we escaped he seemed pained by something once we escaped through the hole in the city wall we found that several mercenary bands were making their way around the city toward the gate that lord talmanes had left defended by coincidence they were near enough to aid in our escape you did well elayne said but the city you did well elayne repeated voice firm you retrieved the dragons and rescued all of these people i will see you rewarded for this captain give your reward to the men of the band your majesty it was their work and please if you can do anything for lord talmanes he gestured to the fallen man whom several members of the band had just carried through the gateway elayne knelt beside him and egwene joined her at first egwene assumed that talmanes was dead with his skin blackened then he drew a ragged breath light elayne said delving his prostrate form ive never seen anything like this thakandar blades guybon said this is beyond either of us egwene said to elayne standing i she trailed off hearing something over the groans of soldiers and carts creaking egwene elayne asked softly do what you can for him egwene said standing and rushing away she pushed through the confused crowd following the voice was that yes there she found an open gateway at the edge of the traveling grounds aes sedai in a variety of clothing hurrying through to see to the wounded gawyn had done his work well nynaeve was asking quite loudly who was in charge of this mess egwene approached her from the side and grabbed her by the shoulder surprising her mother nynaeve asked what is this about caemlyn burning i she cut off as she saw the wounded she stiffened then tried to go to them there is one you need to see first egwene said leading her to where talmanes lay nynaeve drew in a sharp breath then went to her knees and pushed elayne gently aside nynaeve delved talmanes then froze eyes wide nynaeve egwene said can you an explosion of weaves burst from nynaeve like the sudden light of a sun coming out from behind clouds nynaeve wove the five powers together in a column of radiance then sent it driving into talmanes body egwene left her to her work perhaps it would be enough though he looked far gone the light willing the man would live she had been impressed with him in the past he seemed precisely the type of man that the bandand matneeded elayne was near the dragons and was questioning a woman with her hair in braids that must be aludra who had created the dragons egwene walked up to the weapons resting her fingers on one of the long bronze tubes she had been given reports on them of course some men said they were like aes sedai cast in metal and fueled by the powders from fireworks more and more refugees poured though the gateway many of them townspeople light egwene said to herself there are too many of them we cant house all of caemlyn here at merrilor elayne finished her conversation leaving aludra to inspect the wagons it appeared that the woman wasnt willing to rest for the night and see to them in the morning elayne walked toward the gateways the soldiers say the area outside the city is secure elayne said passing egwene im going through to have a look elayne birgitte said coming up behind her were going come on egwene left the queen to it stepping back to supervise the work romanda had taken charge of the aes sedai and was organizing the injured separating them into groups depending on the urgency of their wounds as egwene surveyed the chaotic mix she noticed a pair of people standing nearby a woman and man illianers by the looks of them what do you two want the woman knelt before her the fairskinned darkhaired woman had a firmness to her features despite her tall slender build i am leilwin she said in an unmistakable accent i was accompanying nynaeve sedai when the call for healing was raised we followed her here youre seanchan egwene said startled i have come to serve you amyrlin seat seanchan egwene still held the one power light not every seanchan she met was dangerous to her still she would not take chances as some members of the tower guard came through one of the gateways egwene pointed to the seanchan pair take these somewhere safe and keep watch on them ill deal with them later the soldiers nodded the man went reluctantly the woman more easily she couldnt channel so she wasnt a freed damane that didnt mean she wasnt a suldam though egwene returned to nynaeve who still knelt beside talmanes the sickness had retreated from the mans skin leaving it pale take him somewhere to rest nynaeve said tiredly to several watching members of the band ive done what i can she looked up at egwene as the men carried him away light nynaeve whispered that took a lot out of me even with my angreal im impressed that moiraine managed it with tam all that time ago there seemed to be a note of pride in nynaeves voice she had wanted to heal tam but could notthough of course nynaeve had not known what she had been doing at the time she had come a long long way since then is it true mother nynaeve asked rising about caemlyn egwene nodded this is going to be a long night nynaeve said looking at the wounded still pouring through the gateways and a longer tomorrow egwene said here let us link ill lend you my strength nynaeve looked shocked mother you are better at healing than i egwene smiled i may be amyrlin nynaeve but i am still aes sedai servant of all my strength will be of use to you nynaeve nodded and they linked the two of them joined the group of aes sedai that romanda had set healing the refugees with the worst wounds faile has been organizing my network of eyesandears perrin said to rand as the two of them hurried toward perrins camp she might be there with them tonight ill warn you im not certain she likes you she would be a fool to like me rand thought she probably knows what im going to require of you before this is over well perrin said i guess that she does like that i know you shes cousin to a queen after all i think she still worries youll go mad and hurt me the madness has already come rand said and i have it in my grip as for hurting you shes probably right i dont think i can avoid hurting those around me it was a hard lesson to learn you implied that youre mad perrin said hand resting on his hammer again as he walked he wore it at his side large though it was hed obviously needed to construct a special sheath for it an amazing piece of work rand kept intending to ask whether it was one of the powerwrought weapons his ashaman had been making but rand youre not you dont seem at all crazy to me rand smiled and a thought fluttered at the edge of his mind i am mad perrin my madness is these memories these impulses lews therin tried to take over i was two people fighting over control of myself and one of them was completely insane light perrin whispered that sounds horrible it wasnt pleasant but heres the thing perrin im increasingly certain that i needed these memories lews therin was a good man i was a good man but things went wrongi grew too arrogant i assumed i could do everything myself i needed to remember that without the madness without these memories i might have gone charging in alone again so you are going to work with the others perrin asked looking up toward where egwene and the other members of the white tower were camped this looks an awful lot like armies gathering to fight one another ill make egwene see sense rand said im right perrin we need to break the seals i dont know why she denies this shes the amyrlin now perrin rubbed his chin shes watcher of the seals rand its up to her to make sure theyre cared for it is which is why i will persuade her that my intentions for them are correct are you sure about breaking them rand perrin asked absolutely sure tell me perrin if a metal tool or weapon shatters can you stick it back together and make it work properly well you can perrin said its better not to the grain of the steel well youre almost always better off reforging it melting it down starting from scratch it is the same here the seals are broken like a sword we cant just patch the pieces it wont work we need to remove the shards and make something new to go in their place something better rand perrin said thats the most reasonable thing anyone has said on this topic have you explained it that way to egwene shes not a blacksmith my friend rand smiled shes smart rand smarter than either of us shell understand if you explain it the right way we shall see rand said tomorrow perrin stopped walking his face lit by the glow of rands powersummoned orb his camp beside rands contained a force as large as any on the field rand still found it incredible that perrin had gathered so many includingof all thingsthe whitecloaks rands eyesandears indicated that everyone in perrins camp seemed loyal to him even the wise ones and aes sedai with him were more inclined to do what perrin said than not sure as the wind and the sky perrin had become a king a different kind of king than randa king of his people who lived among them rand couldnt take that same path perrin could be a man rand had to be something more for a little time yet he had to be a symbol a force that everyone could rely upon that was terribly tiring not all of it was physical fatigue but instead something deeper being what people needed was wearing on him grinding as surely as a river cut at a mountain in the end the river would always win ill support you in this rand perrin said but i want you to promise me that you wont let it come to blows i wont fight elayne going up against the aes sedai would be worse we cant afford to squabble there wont be fighting promise me perrins face grew so hard one could have broken rocks against it promise me rand i promise it my friend ill bring us to the last battle united thatll do then perrin walked into his camp nodding to the sentries two rivers men both of themreed soalen and kert wagoner they saluted perrin then eyed rand and bowed somewhat awkwardly reed and kert hed known them bothlight hed looked up to them as a childbut rand had grown accustomed to people hed known treating him as a stranger he felt the mantle of the dragon reborn harden upon him my lord dragon kert said are we i mean he gulped and looked at the sky and the clouds that seemed to bedespite rands presencecreeping in on them things look bad dont they the storms are often bad kert rand said but the two rivers survives them such it will do again but kert said again it looks bad light burn me but it does it will be as the wheel wills rand said glancing northward peace kert reed rand said softly the prophecies have nearly all been fulfilled this day was seen and our tests are known we do not walk into them unaware he hadnt promised them they would win or that they would survive but both men stood up straighter and nodded smiling people liked to know that there was a plan the knowledge that someone was in control might be the strongest comfort that rand could offer them thats enough bothering the lord dragon with your questions perrin said make sure you guard this post wellno dozing kert and no dicing both men saluted again as perrin and rand passed into the camp there was more cheer here than there was in other camps on the field the campfires seemed faintly brighter the laughter faintly louder it was as if the two rivers folk had managed somehow to bring home with them you lead them well rand said softly moving quickly beside perrin who nodded toward those out at night they shouldnt need me to tell them what to do and thats that however when a messenger came running into camp perrin was immediately in charge he called the spindly youth by name and seeing the boys flushed face and trembling legshe was frightened of randperrin pulled him aside and spoke softly but firmly with him perrin sent the boy off to find lady faile then stepped over i need to talk to rand again youre talking to i need the real rand not the man whos learned to talk like an aes sedai rand sighed it really is me perrin he protested im more me than ive been for ages yes well i dont like talking to you when your emotions are all masked a group of two rivers men passed and saluted he felt a sudden spike of cold solitude at seeing those men and knowing he could never be one of them again it was hardest with the two rivers men but he did let himself be more relaxed for perrins sake so what was it he asked what did the messenger say you were right to be worried perrin said rand caemlyn has fallen its overrun with trollocs rand felt his face grow hard youre not surprised perrin said youre worried but not surprised no im not rand admitted i thought it would be the south where they struckive heard word of trolloc sightings there and im halfcertain that demandred is involved he has never been comfortable without an army but caemlyn yes its a clever strike i told you they would try to distract us if they can undercut andor and draw her away my alliance grows much shakier perrin glanced at where elaynes camp was set up right beside that of egwene but wouldnt it be good for you if elayne ran off shes on the other side of this confrontation there is no other side perrin there is one side with a disagreement on how that side should proceed if elayne isnt here to be part of the meeting it will undermine everything im trying to accomplish shes probably the most powerful of all the rulers rand could feel her of course through the bond her spike of alarm let him know that shed received this information should he go to her perhaps he could send min she had gotten up and was moving away from the tent where hed left her and he blinked aviendha she was here at merrilor she hadnt been here moments ago had she perrin glanced at him and he didnt bother to wipe the shock from his face we cant let elayne leave rand said not even to protect her homeland perrin asked incredulous if the trollocs have already taken caemlyn then its too late for elayne to do anything meaningful elaynes forces will focus on evacuation she doesnt need to be there for that but she does need to be here tomorrow morning how could he make certain she stayed elayne reacted poorly to being told what to doall women didbut if he implied rand perrin said what if we sent in the ashaman all of them we could make a fight of it at caemlyn no rand said though the word hurt perrin if the city really is overrunill send men through gateways to be certainthen its lost taking back those walls would take far too much effort at least right now we cannot let this coalition break apart before i have a chance to forge it together unity will preserve us if each of us goes running off to put out fires in our homelands then we will lose thats what this attack is about i suppose thats possible perrin said fingering his hammer the attack might unnerve elayne make her more eager to act rand said considering a dozen different lines of action perhaps this will make her more vulnerable to agreeing with my plan this could be a good thing perrin frowned how quickly ive learned to use others he had learned to laugh again he had learned to accept his fate and to charge toward it smiling he had learned to be at peace with who he had been what he had done that understanding would not stop him from using the tools given him he needed them needed them all the difference now was that he would see the people they were not just the tools he would use so he told himself i still think we should do something to help andor perrin said scratching his beard how did they sneak in do you think by waygate rand said absently perrin grunted well you said that trollocs cant travel through gateways could they have learned how to fix that pray to the light they havent rand said the only shadowspawn they managed to make that could go through gateways were gholam and aginor wasnt foolish enough to make more than a few of those no id bet against mat himself that this was the caemlyn waygate i thought she had that thing guarded if it was the waygate we can do something perrin said we cant have trollocs rampaging in andor if they leave caemlyn theyll be at our backs and that will be a disaster but if theyre coming in at a single point we might be able to disrupt their invasion with an attack on that point rand grinned whats so funny at least i have an excuse for knowing and understanding things no youth from the two rivers should perrin snorted go jump in the winespring water you really think this is demandred its exactly the sort of thing hed try separate your foes then crush them one at a time its one of the oldest strategies in warfare demandred himself had discovered it in the old writings theyd known nothing of war when the bore had first opened oh theyd thought they understood it but it had been the understanding of the scholar looking back on something ancient dusty of all those to turn to the shadow demandreds betrayal seemed the most tragic the man could have been a hero should have been a hero im to blame for that too rand thought if id offered a hand instead of a smirk if id congratulated instead of competed if id been the man then that i am now never mind that he had to send to elayne the proper course was to send help for evacuating the city ashaman and loyal aes sedai to make gateways and free as many people as possibleand to make certain that for now the trollocs remained in caemlyn well i guess those memories of yours are good for something then perrin said do you want to know the thing that twists my brain in knots perrin rand said softly the thing that gives me shivers like the cold breath of the shadow itself the taint is what made me mad and what gave me memories from my past life they came as lews therin whispering to me but that very insanity is the thing giving me the clues i need to win dont you see if i win this it will be the taint itself that led to the dark ones fall perrin whistled softly redemption rand thought when i tried this last time my madness destroyed us this time it will save us go to your wife perrin rand said glancing at the sky this is the last night of anything resembling peace you shall know before the end ill investigate and see how bad things are in andor he looked back at his friend i will not forget my promise unity must come before all else i lost last time precisely because i threw unity aside perrin nodded then rested a hand on rands shoulder the light illumine you and you my friend chapter the choke of an ajah pevara did her very best to pretend that she was not terrified if these ashaman had known her theyd have realized that sitting still and quiet was not her natural state she retreated to basic aes sedai training appearing in control when she felt anything but she forced herself to rise canler and emarin had withdrawn to visit the two rivers lads and make sure they were going about in pairs that left only her and androl again he quietly tinkered with his leather straps as the rain continued outside he used two needles at once to stitch crossing the holes on either side the man had the concentration of a master craftsman pevara strolled over causing him to look up sharply when she drew close she smothered a smile she might not look it but she could move silently when necessary she stared out of the windows the rain had grown worse splashing curtains of water against the glass after so many weeks of looking as if it would storm at any moment it finally comes those clouds had to break open eventually androl said the rain doesnt feel natural she said hands clasped behind her she could feel the coldness through the glass it doesnt ebb and flow just the same steady torrent a great deal of lightning but very little thunder you think its one of those androl asked he didnt need to say what those meant earlier in the week common people in the towernone of the ashamanhad begun bursting into flame just flame inexplicably theyd lost some forty people many still blamed a rogue ashaman though the men had sworn nobody had been channeling nearby she shook her head watching a group of people trudge past on the muddy street outside she had been one of those at first who had called the deaths the work of an ashaman gone mad now she accepted these events and other oddities as something far worse the world was unraveling she needed to be strong pevara herself had devised the plan of bringing women here to bond these men though tarna had suggested it she couldnt let them discover how disturbing she found it to be trapped in here facing down enemies who could force a person to the shadow her only allies men who only months ago she would have pursued with diligence and gentled without remorse she sat down on the stool emarin had used earlier i would like to discuss this plan you are developing im not sure ive actually developed one yet aes sedai i might be able to offer some suggestions i wouldnt say no to hearing them androl said though he narrowed his eyes whats wrong she asked those people outside i dont recognize them and she looked back out the window the only light came from buildings shining an occasional redorange glow into the drenched night the passersby still moved very slowly down the street in and out of the light of windows their clothing isnt wet androl whispered with a chill pevara realized he was right the man at the front walked with a widebrimmed drooping hat on his head but it didnt break the rain or stream water his rustic clothing was untouched by the downpour and the dress of the woman beside him wasnt blowing at all in the wind now pevara saw that one of the younger men was holding his hand behind him as if pulling the reins of a pack animalbut there was no animal there pevara and androl watched in silence until the figures passed too far into the night to be seen visions of the dead were growing increasingly common you said you had a suggestion androls voice trembled i yes pevara tore her eyes away from the window so far taims focus has been on the aes sedai my sisters have all been taken i am the last youre offering yourself as bait they will come for me she said it is only a matter of time androl fingered the leather strap and looked pleased with it we should sneak you out is that so she said eyebrow raised i have been elevated to the position of maiden in need of rescue have i very valiant of you he blushed sarcasm from an aes sedai i wouldnt have thought id hear that pevara laughed oh my androl you really dont know anything about us do you honestly no ive avoided your kind for most of my life well considering your innate tendencies perhaps that was wise i couldnt channel before but you suspected you came here to learn i was curious he said its something i hadnt tried before interesting pevara thought is that what drives you then leatherworker what has set you drifting on the winds from place to place i suspect she said you have never tried jumping off a cliff before the fact that you havent done something shouldnt always be a reason to try it actually i have jumped off a cliff several of them she raised an eyebrow at him the sea folk do it he explained off into the ocean the braver you are the higher the cliff you choose and you have changed the topic of the conversation again pevara sedai you are quite skilled at that thank you the reason he said holding up a finger that i suggested we sneak you out is because this isnt your battle you shouldnt have to fall here it isnt because you want to hurry an aes sedai away out of meddling in your business i came to you for help androl said i dont want to be rid of you ill happily use you however if you fall here you do so in a fight that is not your own that isnt fair let me explain something to you ashaman pevara said leaning in this is my fight if the shadow takes this tower it will mean terrible things for the last battle i have accepted responsibility for you and yours i will not turn away from it so easily youve accepted responsibility for us what does that mean ah perhaps i shouldnt have shared that still if they were going to be allies perhaps he needed to know the black tower needs guidance she explained so thats the point of bonding us androl asked so we can be corralled like stallions to be broken dont be a fool surely you admit the value of the white towers experience im not sure id say that androl said with experience comes a determination to be set in your ways to avoid new experiences you aes sedai all assume that the way things have been done is the only way to do them well the black tower will not be subject to you we can look after ourselves and youve done a wonderful job of that so far havent you that was unfair he said softly perhaps it was she admitted im sorry your motivations dont surprise me he said what you were doing here was obvious to the weakest of soldiers the question ive had is this why of all women did the white tower send red sisters to bond us who better our entire lives have been dedicated to dealing with men who can channel your ajah is doomed is that so you exist to hunt down men who can channel he said to gentle them see them disposed of well the source is cleansed so you all say it is cleansed pevara all things come and pass and the wheel turns it was once pure so it must someday be pure again it has happened and the way you look at shadows androl is that a sign of purity the way that nalaam mutters in unknown languages do you think we dont notice such things you have two choices as an ajah androl continued you can either continue to hunt usignoring the proof that we offer that the source is cleansedor you can give up on being red ajah nonsense of all ajahs the reds should be your greatest ally you exist to destroy us we exist to make certain that men who can channel do not accidentally hurt themselves or those around them would you not agree that is a purpose of the black tower as well i suppose that might be part of it the only purpose i have been told was that we are to be a weapon for the dragon reborn but keeping good men from hurting themselves without proper training is important as well then we can unite on that idea can we not i would like to believe that pevara but ive seen the way you and yours look at us you see us as as some stain that needs to be cleansed or poison to be bottled pevara shook her head if what you say is true and the source is cleansed then changes will come androl the red ajah and the ashaman will grow together in common purpose over time im willing to work with you now here contain us guide you please trust me he studied her by the light of the rooms many lamps he did have a sincere face she could see why the others followed him though he was weakest among them he had a strange mixture of passion and humility if only he hadnt been one of well what he was i wish i could believe you androl said looking away youre different from the others ill admit not like a red at all i think youll find were more varied than you suppose pevara said there isnt one single motive that makes a woman choose the red other than hatred of men if we hated you would we have come here looking to bond you that was a sidestep in truth though pevara herself did not hate men many reds didat the very least many regarded men with suspicion she hoped to change that aes sedai motivations are odd sometimes androl said everyone knows that anyway different though you are from many of your sisters ive seen that look in your eyes he shook his head i wont believe youre here to help us no more than i believed that the aes sedai who hunted down male channelers really thought they were helping the men no more than i believe a headsman thinks hes doing a criminal a favor by killing him just because a thing needs to be done doesnt make the one doing it a friend pevara sedai im sorry he turned back to his leather working by the close light of a lantern on the table pevara found her annoyance rising shed almost had him she liked men she had often thought warders would be useful couldnt the fool recognize a hand extended across the chasm when he saw it calm yourself pevara she thought you wont get anywhere if anger rules you she needed this man on her side that will be a saddle wont it she said yes youre staggering the stitches its my own method he said helps prevent rips from spreading i think it looks nice too good linen thread i assume waxed and do you use a single lacing chisel for those holes or a double i didnt get a good look he glanced at her wary you know leatherworking from my uncle she said he taught me a few things let me work in the shop when i was little maybe ive met him she fell still for all androls comments that she was good at steering a conversation she had blundered this one directly into places she didnt like to go well he asked where does he live back in kandor youre kandori he asked surprised of course i am dont i look it i just thought i could pick out any accent he said pulling a pair of stitches tight ive been there maybe i do know your uncle hes dead she said murdered by darkfriends androl fell silent im sorry its been over a hundred years now i miss my family but theyd be dead by now even if the darkfriends hadnt killed them everyone i knew back home is dead my sorrow is deeper then truly it is long past pevara said i can remember them with fondness without having the pain intrude but what of your family siblings nieces nephews a smattering of each group androl said do you ever see them he eyed her youre trying to engage me in friendly conversation to prove that you dont feel awkward around me but ive seen how you aes sedai look at people like me i say you dont find us repulsive i hardly think what you do should be straight answer pevara very well fine men who can channel do discomfort me you make me itch all over and it has only grown worse the longer ive been here surrounded by you androl nodded in satisfaction at having pulled it from her however pevara continued i feel this way because it has been ingrained in me over decades of life what you do is terribly unnatural but you yourself do not disgust me you are just a man trying to do your best and i hardly think that is worthy of disgust either way i am willing to look beyond my inhibitions in the name of common good thats better than i could have expected i suppose he looked back toward the rainsplattered windows the taint is cleansed this isnt unnatural any longer i wish i wish i could just show you woman he looked toward her sharply how does one form one of those circles you mentioned well pevara said ive never actually done it with a male channeler of course i did some reading before coming down here but much of what we have is hearsay so much has been lost to start with you must put yourself on the edge of embracing the source then open yourself to me that is how we establish the link all right he said youre not holding the source however it was downright unfair that a man could tell when a woman was holding the one power and when she wasnt pevara embraced the source flooding herself with the sweet nectar that was saidar she reached out to link with androl as she would with a woman that was how one was supposed to begin according to the records but it was not the same saidin was a torrent and what she had read was true she could do nothing with the flows its working my power is flowing into you yes pevara said but when a man and woman link the man must be in control you must take the lead how androl asked i dont know ill try to pass it you must control the flows he eyed her and she prepared herself to pass control to him instead he somehow seized it she was caught in the tempestuous link yankedas if by her hairright in the force of it nearly made her teeth rattle and it felt as if her skin was being pulled off pevara closed her eyes breathed deeply and did not let herself fight back she had wanted to try this it could be useful but she couldnt help a moment of sheer panic she was linked with a male channeler one of the most feared things the land had ever known now he had control of her completely her power flowed through her washing over him and androl gasped so much he said light youre strong she allowed herself a smile the link brought with it a storm of awareness she could feel androls emotions he was as fearful as she was he was also solid shed imagined that being linked to him would be terrible because of his madness but she sensed none of it but saidin that liquid fire that he wrestled with like a serpent that was trying to consume him she pulled back was it tainted she wasnt certain she could tell saidin was so different so alien reports from the early days fragmented spoke of the taint like an oil slick upon a river well she could see a rivermore a stream really it appeared that androl had been honest with her and wasnt very powerful she could not sense any taint but then again she did not know what to look for i wonder androl said i wonder if i can make a gateway with this power gateways dont work in the black tower anymore i know he said but i keep feeling that theyre just beyond my fingertips pevara opened her eyes looking at him she could feel his honesty within the circle but creating a gateway required a lot of the one power at least for a woman androl would have to be orders of magnitude too weak for that weave could it require a different level of strength for a man he reached out a hand using her power somehow mixed with his own she could feel him pulling the one power through her pevara tried to maintain her composure but she did not like him having control she could do nothing androl she said release me its wonderful he whispered eyes unfocused as he stood up is this what it feels like to be one of the others those with strength in the power he drew more of her power and used it objects in the room began to rise into the air androl panic it was the panic shed felt after hearing that her parents were dead she hadnt known this sense of horror in over a hundred years not since taking the test for her shawl he had control of her channeling absolute control she began to gasp trying to reach for him she could not use saidar without him releasing it back to herbut he could use it against her images of him using her own strength to tie her in air ran through her mind she could not end the link only he could he noticed suddenly and his eyes widened the circle vanished like a wink of the eye and her power was her own again without thinking she lashed out this would not happen again she would have the control the weaves sprang from her before she knew what she was doing androl fell to his knees hand sweeping across his table as he threw his head back brushing tools and scraps of leather to the floor he gasped what have you done taim said we could pick any of you pevara muttered as she realized what she had done shed bonded him the reverse after a fashion of what hed done to her she tried to calm her thundering heart an awareness of him blossomed in the back of her mind like what theyd known in the circle but somehow more personal intimate taim is a monster androl growled you know that you take his word on what you can do and you do it without my permission i i androl clenched his jaw and pevara immediately felt something something alien something strange it felt like looking at herself feeling her emotions circled back on her endlessly her self melded with his for a seeming eternity she knew what it was like to be him think his thoughts she saw his life in the blink of an eye was absorbed by his memories she gasped and fell to her knees in front of him it faded not completely but it faded it felt like swimming a hundred leagues through boiling water and only now emerging having forgotten what it was like to have normal sensations light she whispered what was that he lay on his back when had he fallen he blinked looking up at the ceiling i saw one of the others do it some of the ashaman bond their wives you bonded me she said horrified he groaned rolling over you did it to me first she realized with horror that she could still feel his emotions his self she could even understand some of what he was thinking not the actual thoughts but some impressions of them he was confused worried and curious he was curious about the new experience foolish man shed hoped that the two bonds would have somehow canceled one another out they did not we have to stop this she said ill release you i vow it just just release me i dont know how he said standing up and breathing in deeply im sorry he was telling the truth that circle was a bad idea she said he offered a hand to help her to her feet she stood on her own without accepting it i believe it was your bad idea before it was mine so it was she admitted it isnt my first one but it might be one of my worst she sat down we need to think through this find a way to the door to his shop slammed open androl spun and pevara embraced the source androl had grabbed his stitching groover in one hand like a weapon hed also seized the one power she could sense that molten force within himweak because of his lack of talent like a single small jet of magma but still burning and hot she could feel his awe so it was the same for him as it was for her holding the one power felt like opening your eyes for the first time the world coming to life fortunately neither weapon nor the one power was needed young evin stood in the doorway raindrops dribbling down the sides of his face he shut the door and hurried to androls workbench androl it he froze seeing pevara evin androl said youre alone i left nalaam to watch he said breathing in and out it was important androl we are never to be a one evin androl said never always in pairs no matter the emergency i know i know evin said im sorry its justthe news androl he glanced at pevara speak androl said welyn and his aes sedai are back ewan said pevara could feel androls sudden tension is he one of us still evin shook his head sick hes one of them probably jenare sedai is too i dont know her well enough to tell for sure welyn though his eyes arent his own any longer and he now serves taim androl groaned welyn had been with logain androl and the others had been holding to the hope that although mezar had been taken logain and welyn were still free logain androl whispered he isnt here evin said but androl welyn says logain will come back soonand that hes met with taim and they have reconciled their differences welyn is promising that logain will come tomorrow to prove it androl thats it we have to admit it now they have him pevara could feel androls agreement and his horror it mirrored her own aviendha moved through the darkened camps silently so many groups there had to be at least a hundred thousand people gathered here at the field of merrilor all waiting like a breath taken in and held before a great leap the aiel saw her but she did not approach them the wetlanders didnt notice her save for a warder who spotted her as she skirted the aes sedai camp that camp was a place of motion and activity something had happened though she caught only fragments a trolloc attack somewhere she listened enough to determine that the attack was in andor in the city of caemlyn there was worry the trollocs would leave the city and rampage across the land she needed to know more would the spears be danced tonight perhaps elayne would share news with her aviendha moved silently out of the aes sedai camp stepping softly in these wet lands with their lush plants presented different challenges than the threefold land did there the dry ground was often dusty which could muffle footsteps here a dry twig could inexplicably be buried beneath wet grass she tried not to think about how dead that grass seemed once shed have considered those browns lush now she knew these wetland plants should not look so wan and and hollow hollow plants what was she thinking she shook her head and crept through the shadows out of the aes sedai camp she briefly contemplated sneaking back to surprise that warderhed been hiding in a mossworn cleft in the rubble of an old fallen building and watching the aes sedai perimeterbut discarded the idea she wanted to get to elayne and ask her for details on the attack aviendha approached another busy camp ducked beneath the leafless branches of a treeshe didnt know what type but its limbs spread wide and highand slipped inside the guard perimeter a pair of wetlanders in white and red stood on watch near a fire they didnt come close to spotting her though they did jump up and level polearms toward a thicket a good thirty feet away when an animal rustled in it aviendha shook her head and passed them forward she needed to keep moving forward what to do about rand althor what were his plans for tomorrow these were other questions she wanted to ask elayne the aiel needed a purpose once rand althor finished with them that was clear from the visions she had to find a way to give this to them perhaps they should return to the threefold land but no no it tore her heart but she had to admit that if the aiel did so they would be going to their graves their death as a people might not be immediate but it would come the changing world with new devices and new ways of fighting would overtake the aiel and the seanchan would never leave them alone not with women who could channel not with armies full of spears that could at any time invade a patrol approached aviendha drew some fallen brown undergrowth over herself for camouflage then lay down flat beside a dead shrub and remained perfectly still the guards walked two handspans from her we could attack the seanchan now she thought in my vision the aiel waited nearly a generation to attackand that let the seanchan strengthen their position the aiel already spoke of the seanchan and the confrontation that must inevitably come the seanchan would force it everyone whispered except in her vision years had passed with the seanchan failing to attack why what could possibly have held them back aviendha rose and crept across to the pathway the guards had taken she took out her knife and rammed it down into the ground she left it there right beside a lantern on a pole clearly visible even to wetlander eyes then she slipped back into the night hiding near the back of the large tent that was her goal she crouched low and practiced her silent breathing using the rhythm to calm herself there were hushed anxious voices inside the tent aviendha did her best not to pay attention to what they were saying it wouldnt be proper to eavesdrop as the patrol passed again she stood up when they cried out having found her dagger she slipped around to the front of the tent there avoiding the attention of guards distracted by the commotion she lifted the flap and stepped inside the tent behind them some people sat at a table on the far side of the very large tent huddled around a lamp they were so busy with their conversation that they did not see her so she settled down near some cushions to wait it was very hard not to listen in now that she was so close must send our forces back one man barked the fall of the capital is a symbol your majesty a symbol we cannot let caemlyn go or the entire nation will collapse into chaos you underestimate the strength of the andoran people said elayne she looked very much in control very strong her redgold hair practically glowing in the lamplight several of her battle commanders stood behind her lending authority and a sense of stability to the meeting aviendha was pleased to see the fire in her firstsisters eyes i have been to caemlyn lord lir elayne continued and i have left a small force of soldiers there to watch and give warning if the trollocs leave the city our spies will use gateways to sneak through the city and find where the remaining trollocs are herding captives and then we can mount rescue operations if the trollocs continue to hold the city but the city itself lord lir said caemlyn is lost lir lady dyelin snapped wed be fools to try to mount any kind of assault now elayne nodded i have held conference with the other high seats and they agree with my assessment for now the refugees who escaped are safei sent them on along toward whitebridge with guards if there are people alive within we will try to rescue them with gateways but i will not commit my forces to an allout attack on caemlyns walls but taking the city again would be fruitless elayne said voice hard i know full well the damage that can be done to an army assaulting those walls andor will not collapse because of the loss of one city no matter how important a city her face was a mask her voice as cold as good steel the trollocs will eventually leave the city elayne continued they gain nothing by holding itthey will starve themselves out if nothing else once they leave we can fight themand on far fairer ground if you wish lord lir you may visit the city yourself and see that what i say is true the soldiers there could use the inspiration of a high seat lir frowned but nodded i think i will then go knowing my plan we will begin sending in scouts before the night is through trying to find pens of civilians to save and aviendha what in the name of a bloody goats left stone are you doing aviendha looked up from trimming her fingernails with her second knife bloody goats left stone that was a new one elayne always knew the most interesting curses the three high seats at the table jumped up scrambling throwing down chairs and reaching for swords elayne sat in her place eyes and mouth wide it is a bad habit aviendha admitted slipping her knife back into her boot my nails were growing long but i should not have done it in your tent elayne i am sorry i hope i did not offend im not talking about your flaming nails aviendha elayne said how when did you arrive why didnt the guards announce you they didnt see me aviendha said i didnt wish to make a fuss and wetlanders can be touchy i thought they might turn me away now that you are queen she smiled as she said the last part elayne had much honor the way of becoming a leader among the wetlanders was different from proper waysthings could be so backward over herebut elayne had handled herself well and obtained her throne aviendha couldnt have been more proud of a spearsister who had taken a clan chief gaishain they didnt elayne said suddenly she was smiling you crept through the entire camp to my tent at the center and then slipped inside and sat down not five feet from me and nobody saw i didnt wish to make a fuss you have a strange way of not making a fuss elaynes companions did not react with such calm one of the three young lord perival gazed around him with worried eyes as if searching for other intruders my queen lir said we must punish this breach in security i will find the men who were lax in their duty and see that they peace elayne said i will speak to my guards and suggest they keep their eyes a little more open still guarding the front of a tent is a silly precautionand always has beenas someone can just cut their way into the back and ruin a good tent aviendha said lips turning down only if we had blood feud elayne lord lir you may go inspect the cityfrom a good distanceif you wish elayne said standing if any of the rest of you wish to accompany him you may dyelin i will see you in the morning very well the lords said in turn then walked from the tent both kept distrustful eyes on aviendha as they left dyelin just shook her head before following them and elayne sent her battle commanders out to coordinate scouting of the city that left elayne and aviendha alone in the tent light aviendha elayne said embracing her if the people who want me dead had half of your skill did i do something wrong aviendha said other than sneaking into my tent like an assassin but you are my firstsister aviendha said should i have asked but we are not under a roof or among wetlanders is a tent considered a roof as in a hold im sorry elayne do i have toh you are such an unpredictable people its hard to know what will offend you and what will not elayne just laughed aviendha youre a gem a complete and total gem light but its good to see your face i needed a friendly one tonight caemlyn has fallen aviendha asked near enough elayne said face growing colder it was that bloody waygate i thought it was safei had that thing all but bricked up with fifty guards at the door and the avendesora leaves taken and both put on the outside someone inside caemlyn let them in then darkfriends elayne said a dozen members of the guardwe were lucky enough that one man survived their betrayal and found his way out light i dont know why i should be surprised if theyre in the white tower theyre in andor but these were men who had rejected gaebril and who seemed loyal they waited all this time only to betray us now aviendha grimaced but took one of the chairs to join elayne at the table rather than staying on the floor her firstsister preferred sitting that way her stomach had swelled with the children she bore i sent birgitte with the soldiers to the city to see what can be done elayne said but weve done what we can for the night the city watched the refugees seen to light i wish i could do more the worst thing about being queen is not the things you must do but the things that you cannot we will bring the battle to them soon enough aviendha said we will elayne said eyes smoldering i will bring them fire and fury repayment in kind for the flames they brought to my people i heard you speak to those men of not attacking the city no elayne said i will not give them the satisfaction of holding my own walls against me i have given birgitte an orderthe trollocs will eventually abandon caemlyn of this we are sure birgitte will find a way to hasten that so we can fight them outside of the city do not let the enemy choose your battleground aviendha said with a nod a good strategy and rands meeting i will attend elayne said i must so it will be done he had better not give us theatrics and stalling my people die my city burns the world is two steps from the edge of a cliff i will stay through the afternoon only after that i go back to andor she hesitated will you come with me elayne aviendha said i cannot leave my people i am a wise one now you went to rhuidean elayne asked yes aviendha said though it pained her to keep secrets she said nothing of her visions there excellent i elayne began but was cut off my queen the tent guard called from outside messenger for you let them in the guard opened the flaps for a young guardswoman with a messengers ribbon on her coat she performed an ornate bow one hand removing her hat as the other held out a letter elayne took the letter but didnt open it the messenger retreated perhaps we can still fight together aviendha elayne said if i have my way i will have aiel at my side as i reclaim andor the trollocs in caemlyn present a serious threat to all of us even if i draw their main force out the shadow can continue to pour shadowspawn through that waygate im thinking that while my armies fight the main body of trollocs outside of caemlyni will have to make the city inhospitable to the shadowspawn somehowi will send a smaller force through a gateway to seize the waygate if i could gain the aid of aiel for that as she spoke she embraced the sourceaviendha could see the glow and absently sliced the letter open breaking the seal with a ribbon of air aviendha raised an eyebrow sorry elayne said ive reached the point in my pregnancy where i can channel again reliably and i keep finding excuses do not endanger the babes aviendha said im not going to endanger them elayne said youre as bad as birgitte at least no one has any goats milk here min says she trailed off eyes flickering back and forth as she read the letter elaynes expression darkened and aviendha prepared herself for a shock oh that man elayne said rand i think i may strangle him one of these days aviendha set her jaw if hes offended elayne turned the letter around he insists that i return to caemlyn to see to my people he gives a dozen reasons why going so far as to release me from my obligation to meet with him tomorrow he should not be insisting on anything with you particularly not so forcefully elayne said light this is clever hes obviously trying to bully me into staying theres a touch of daes daemar in this aviendha hesitated you seem proud yet i gather this letter is only one step away from being insulting i am proud elayne said and angry at him but proud because he knew to make me angry like that light well make a king out of you yet rand why does he want me at the meeting so badly does he think ill support his side just because of my affection for him you dont know what his plan is then no it obviously involves all of the rulers but i will attend even though im likely to do so without having had any sleep tonight i am meeting with birgitte and my other commanders in an hour to go over plans for drawing out then destroying the trollocs a fire still burned behind those eyes of hers elayne was a warrior as true a one as aviendha had ever known i must go to him aviendha said tonight tonight the last battle will soon begin as far as im concerned it started the moment those bloody trollocs set foot in caemlyn elayne said may the light favor us it is here then the day of dying will come aviendha said many of us will soon wake from this dream there may not be another night for rand and myself i came to you in part to ask you about this you have my blessing elayne said softly you are my firstsister have you spent time with min not enough and under other circumstances i would remedy that lack immediately there is no time elayne nodded i do think she feels better about me aviendha said she did me a great honor in helping me understand the last step to becoming a wise one it may be appropriate to bend some of the customs we have done well under the circumstances i would speak to her together with you if there is time elayne nodded i can spare a moment or two between meetings ill send for her chapter a dangerous place lord logain and taim have indeed patched up their differences welyn said sitting inside the common room of the great gathering he wore bells in his dark braids and he smiled widely he always had smiled too much both were worried about the division weve been suffering and agree it isnt good for morale we need to be focused on the last battle this isnt a time for squabbling androl stood just inside the door pevara beside him it was surprising how quickly this buildinga former warehousehad been transformed into a tavern lind had done her work well there were a respectable bar and stools and though the tables and chairs spread through the room didnt match yet the place could seat dozens she also had a library with a considerable number of books although she was very particular about who she allowed to use it on the second floor she planned private dining chambers and sleeping rooms for visitors to the black tower assuming taim started letting visitors in again the room was quite packed and the crowd included a large number of newer recruits men who didnt yet fall on either side of the growing dispute either with taim and his men or with those loyal to logain androl listened to welyn feeling chilled welyns aes sedai jenare sat beside him hand resting fondly on his arm androl didnt know her well but he did know welyn and this thing with welyns face and voice was not the same man we met with the lord dragon welyn continued surveying the borderlands preparing for humankinds assault against the shadow he has rallied the armies of all nations to his banner there are none who do not support him other than the seanchan of coursebut they have been driven back this is the time and we will soon be called upon to strike we need to focus one last time on our skills the sword and dragon will be awarded liberally in the next two weeks work hard and we will be the weapons that break the dark ones hold upon this land you say logain is coming a voice demanded why isnt he back yet androl turned jonneth dowtry stood near welyns table with his arms folded glowering at welyn jonneth was an intimidating sight the two rivers man often had a friendly way about him and it was easy to forget that he stood a head taller than you and had arms like those of a bear he wore his black ashaman coat though it had no pins on the high collar despite the fact that he was as strong in the one power as any dedicated why isnt he here jonneth demanded you said that you returned with him that he and taim have spoken well where is he dont push lad androl thought let him think we believe his lies he took the mhael to visit the lord dragon welyn said both should be back on the morrow the day after at the latest why did taim need logain to show him the way jonneth said stubbornly he could have gone on his own that boy is a fool pevara hissed hes honest androl replied quietly and he wants honest answers these two rivers lads were a good lotstraightforward and loyal they werent particularly practiced in subterfuge however pevara fell silent but androl could feel her as she considered channeling and hushing jonneth with some bindings of air they werent serious thoughts just idle fancies but androl could sense them light what had they done to one another shes in my head he thought theres an aes sedai inside my head pevara froze then glanced at him androl sought the void that old soldiers trick to help him seek clarity before a battle saidin was there too of course he didnt reach for it what did you do pevara whispered i can feel you there but sensing your thoughts is harder well that was something at least jonneth lind called across the common room interrupting the lads next question to welyn didnt you hear the man saying how much traveling hes been doing hes exhausted let him drink his ale and rest a spell before you pry stories out of him jonneth glanced at her looking hurt welyn smiled deeply as the lad withdrew pushing his way out of the common room welyn continued talking about how well the lord dragon was doing and about how much each of them would be needed androl released the void feeling more relaxed he looked around the room trying to judge who in here he could rely upon he liked many of these men and many werent completely for taim yet he still couldnt trust them taim had complete control of the tower now and private lessons with him and his chosen were coveted by the newcomers only the two rivers lads could be counted on to give any sort of support to androls cause and most of them other than jonneth were too unpracticed to be of use evin had joined nalaam on the other side of the room and androl nodded his head to him sending him out to follow jonneth into the storm nobody was to be alone that done androl listened to welyns boasting and noticed lind picking her way through the crowd toward him lind taglien was a short darkhaired woman her dress was covered in lovely embroidery she had always seemed to him a model of what the black tower could be civilized educated important men made way for her they knew not to spill their drinks or start fights in her inn linds anger was not something a wise man ever wanted to know it was a good thing she ran the place so tightly in a city full of male channelers a simple tavern brawl could potentially go very very wrong does this bother you as much as it does me lind asked softly as she stepped up beside him wasnt he the one who just a few weeks back was talking about how taim should be tried and executed for some of the things hed done androl didnt reply what could he say that he suspected that the man theyd known as welyn was dead that the entire black tower would soon be nothing but these monsters with the wrong eyes the false smiles the dead souls i dont believe him about logain lind said somethings going on here androl im going to have frask follow him tonight see where he no androl said no dont frask was her husband a man who had been hired to help henre haslin teach swordsmanship in the black tower taim thought that swordfighting was useless for ashaman but the lord dragon had insisted that the men be taught she eyed him youre not saying you believe im saying that were in great danger right now lind and i dont want frask making it worse do me a favor take note of what else welyn says tonight maybe some of it will be useful for me to know all right she said sounding skeptical androl nodded toward nalaam and canler who rose and headed over rain beat against the rooftop and the porch outside welyn kept right on talking and the men were listening yes it was incredible that hed swapped sides so quickly and that would make some suspicious but many people respected him and the way he was off just slightly wasnt noticeable unless you knew him lind androl said as she started to walk away she glanced back at him you lock this place up tightly tonight then maybe you and frask should find your way into the cellar with some supplies all right you have a sturdy cellar door yes she said for all the good it will do it wouldnt matter how thick a door was if someone with the one power came looking nalaam and canler reached them and androl turned to go only to run directly into a man standing in the doorway behind him someone he hadnt heard approach rain dripped from his ashaman coat with the sword and the dragon on the high collar atal mishraile had been one of taims from the start fie didnt have the hollow eyes his evil was all his own tall with long golden hair he had a smile that never seemed to reach his eyes pevara jumped when she saw him and nalaam cursed seizing the one power now now a voice said no need for strife mezar stepped in from the rain beside mishraile the short domani man had graying hair and an air of wisdom to him despite his transformation androl met mezars eyes and it was like looking into a deep cavern a place where light had never shone hello androl mezar said putting a hand on mishrailes shoulder as if the two had been friends for a long time why is it that goodwoman lind would need to fear and shut herself in her cellar surely the black tower is as safe a place as there is i dont trust a dark night full of storms androl said perhaps that is wise mezar replied yet you go out into it why not stay where it is warm nalaam i should like to hear one of your stories perhaps you could tell me of the time your father and you visited shara its not that good a story nalaam said i dont know if i remember it that well mezar laughed and androl heard welyn stand up behind him ah there you are i was telling them youd talk about defenses in arafel come listen mezar said this will be important for the last battle maybe i will return androl said voice cool once my other work is done the two stared at one another to the side nalaam still held the one power he was as strong as mezar but would never be able to face both him and mishraileparticularly not in a room crammed with people who would probably take the side of the two full ashaman dont waste your time with the pageboy welyn coteren said from behind mishraile stepped aside to make room for this third newcomer the bulky beadyeyed man pressed a hand against androls chest and shoved him aside as he passed oh wait you cant play pageboy anymore can you androl entered the void and seized the source shadows immediately started moving in the room lengthening there werent enough lights why didnt they light more lamps the darkness invited those shadows in and he could see them these were real each one a tendril of blackness reaching for him to pull him into them to destroy him oh light im mad im mad the void shattered and the shadowsthankfullyretreated he found himself shaking pulling back against the wall panting pevara watched him with an expressionless face but he could feel her concern oh by the way coteren said he was one of taims most influential toadies have you heard heard what androl managed to force out youve been demoted pageboy coteren said pointing toward the sword pin taims orders as of today back to soldier you go androl oh yes welyn called from the center of the room im sorry i forgot to mention it it has been cleared with the lord dragon im afraid you never should have been promoted androl sorry androl reached to his neck to the pin there it shouldnt matter to him what did it really mean but it did matter hed spent his entire life searching hed apprenticed to a dozen different professions hed fought in revolts sailed two seas all the while searching searching for something he hadnt been able to define hed found it when hed come to the black tower he pushed through the fear shadows be burned he seized saidin again the power flooding him he straightened up going eyetoeye with coteren the larger man smiled and seized the one power as well mezar joined him and in the middle of the room welyn stood nalaam was whispering to himself in worry eyes darting back and forth canler seized saidin and looked resigned everything androl could holdall of the one power he could muster flooded into him it was minuscule compared to the others he was the weakest man in the room the newest of recruits could manage more than he could are you going to make a go of it then coteren asked softly i asked them to leave you because i knew youd try it eventually i wanted the satisfaction pageboy come on strike lets see it androl reached out trying to do the one thing he could do form a gateway to him this was something beyond weaves it was just him and the power something intimate something instinctive trying to make a gateway now felt like trying to scramble up a hundredfoot glass wall with only his fingernails to give him purchase he leaped scrambled tried nothing happened he felt so close if he could just push a little harder he could the shadows lengthened the panic rose in him again teeth gritted androl reached to his collar and ripped the pin free he dropped it on the floorboards before coteren with a clink nobody in the room spoke then burying his shame under a mountain of determination he released the one power and pushed past mezar into the night nalaam canler and pevara followed with anxious steps the rain washed over androl he felt the loss of that pin as he might have felt the loss of a hand androl nalaam said im sorry thunder rumbled they splashed through muddy puddles on the unpaved street it doesnt matter androl said maybe we should have fought nalaam said some of the lads in there would have supported us theyre not all in his pocket once father and i we fought down six darkhoundslight upon my grave we did if we survived that we can deal with a few ashaman dogs wed have been slaughtered androl said but wed have been slaughtered androl said we dont let them pick the battlefield nalaam but there will be a battle canler asked catching up to androl on the other side they have logain androl said they wouldnt make the promises theyre making unless they did everything diesour rebellion our chances at a unified black towerif we lose him so so were going to rescue him androl said continuing forward tonight rand worked by the soft steady light of a saidin globe before dragonmount hed begun avoiding this kind of common use of the one power seizing it had made him sick and using it had revolted him more and more that had changed saidin was part of him and he needed to fear it no longer now that the taint was gone more importantly he had to stop thinking of itand of himselfas merely a weapon he would work by globes of light whenever he could he intended to go to flinn to learn healing he had little skill in it but a little skill could save the life of someone wounded all too often rand had used this wonderthis giftonly to destroy or kill was it any wonder that people looked upon him with fear what would tam say i guess i could ask him rand thought idly as he made a notation to himself on a piece of paper it was still hard to get used to the idea of tam being there just one camp over rand had dined with him earlier it had been awkward but no more so than expected for a king inviting his father from a rural village to dine they had laughed about it which had made him feel much better rand had let tam return to perrins camp rather than seeing him given honors and wealth tam didnt want to be hailed as the dragon reborns father he wanted to be what hed always beentam althor a solid dependable man by anyones measure but not a lord rand went back to the document in front of him clerks in tear had advised him on the proper language but he had done the actual writing he hadnt trusted any other handor any other eyeswith this document was he being too careful what his enemies could not anticipate they could not work against he had grown too distrustful after semirhage had nearly captured him he recognized this however hed been holding secrets close to him for so long it was difficult to let them out he started at the top of the document rereading once tam had sent rand to examine a fence for weak spots rand had done so but when hed returned tam had sent him on the same duty again it hadnt been until the third pass that rand had found the loose post that needed replacing he still didnt know if tam had known about the post or if his father had just been being his careful self this document was far more important than a fence rand would look it over a dozen more times this night searching for problems he had not foreseen unfortunately it was hard to concentrate the women were up to something he could feel them through the balls of emotion in the back of his mind there were four of thosealanna was still there somewhere to the north the other three had been near to one another all night now theyd made their way almost to his tent what were they up to it wait one of them had split off from the others she was nearly here aviendha rand stood up walking to the front of his tent and throwing back the flaps she froze in place just outside as if shed been intending to sneak into his tent she raised her chin meeting his eyes suddenly shouts rose in the night for the first time he noticed that his guards were not in attendance however the maidens made camp near his tent and they appeared to be shouting at him not with joy as hed expected insults terrible ones several were screaming about what theyd do to certain parts of his body when they caught him what is this he murmured they dont mean it aviendha said it is a symbol to them of you taking me away from their ranksbut i have already left their ranks to join the wise ones it is a thing of the maidens it is actually a sign of respect if they did not like you they would not act this way aiel wait he said how have i taken you from them aviendha looked him in the eyes but color rose in her cheeks aviendha blushing that was unexpected you should understand already she said if youd paid attention to what i told you about us unfortunately you had a complete woolhead of a student it is fortunate for him that i have decided to extend my training she took a step closer there are many things i still need to teach her blush deepened light she was beautiful but so was elayne and so was min and he was a fool a lightblinded fool aviendha he said i love you i truly do but thats a problem burn it i love all three of you i dont think i could accept this and choose suddenly she was laughing you are a fool arent you rand althor often but what we are firstsisters rand althor elayne and i when we get to know her better min will join us we three will share in all things firstsisters he should have suspected following that odd bonding he raised a hand to his head we will share you they had said to him leaving four bonded women to their pains was bad enough but three bonded women who loved him light he did not want to bring them pain they say you have changed aviendha said so many have spoken of it in the short time since my return that almost i grow weary of hearing about you well your face may be calm but your emotions are not is this so terrible a thing to consider being with the three of us i want it aviendha i should hide myself because i do but the pain you have embraced it have you not it is not my pain i fear it is yours are we so weak then that we cannot bear what you can that look in her eyes was unnerving of course not rand said but how can i hope for pain in those i love the pain is ours to accept she said raising her chin rand althor your decision is simple though you strive to make it difficult choose yes or no be warned it is all three of us or none of us we will not let you come between us he hesitated thenfeeling a complete lecherhe kissed her behind him maidens he hadnt realized were watching began to yell louder insults though he could now hear an incongruous joy to them he pulled back from the kiss then reached out cupping the side of aviendhas face with his hand youre bloody fools all three of you then it is well we are your equals you should know that i am a wise one now then perhaps we are not equals rand said for ive only just begun to understand how little wisdom i possess aviendha sniffed enough talk you will bed me now light he said a little forward arent you is that the aiel way of doing things no she said blushing again i just i am not very skilled with this you three decided this didnt you which of you came to me she hesitated then nodded im never going to get to choose am i she shook her head he laughed and pulled her close she was stiff initially but then melted against him so do i go fight them first he nodded toward the maidens that is only for the wedding if we decide you are worth marriage fool man and it would be our families not members of our society you really did ignore your lessons didnt you he looked down at her well im glad theres no fighting to do im not sure how much time we have and i was hoping to get some sleep tonight still he trailed off at the look in her eyes im not getting any sleep am i she shook her head ah well at least i dont have to worry about you freezing to death this time yes but it may happen that i die of boredom rand althor if you do not stop rambling she took him by the arm and gently but firmly pulled him back into his tentthe calls of the maidens growing louder more insulting and more exuberant all at the same time i suspect the reason is some kind of terangreal pevara said she crouched with androl in the back room of one of the black towers general storehouses and she did not find the position terribly comfortable the room smelled of dust grain and wood most buildings in the black tower were new and this was no exception the cedar boards still fresh you know of a terangreal that could prevent gateways androl asked not specifically no pevara replied shifting to a better position but it is generally accepted that what we know of terangreal comprises only the smallest portion of what was once known there must be thousands of different types of terangreal and if taim is a darkfriend he has access to the forsakenwho could likely explain to him the use and construction of things we can only dream about so we need to find this terangreal androl said block it or at least figure out how it functions and escape pevara asked havent you already determined that leaving would be a poor choice well yes androl admitted she concentrated and could catch glimmers of what he was thinking shed heard that the warder bond allowed an empathic connection this seemed deeper he was yes he really wished he could make gateways he felt disarmed without them its my talent he said begrudgingly he knew shed sift out the reason eventually i can make gateways at least i could really with your level of strength in the one power or lack of it he asked she could sense a little of what he was thinking though he accepted his weakness he worried that it made him unfit to lead a curious mix of selfconfidence and selfconsciousness yes he continued traveling requires great strength in the one power but i can make large gateways before this all went wrong the largest i ever made was a gateway thirty feet across pevara blinked surely youre exaggerating id show you if i could he seemed completely honest either he was telling the truth or his belief was due to his madness she remained quiet uncertain how to approach that its all right he said i know that there are things wrong with me with most of us you can ask the others about my gateways theres a reason coteren calls me pageboy its because the only thing im good at is delivering people from one place to another thats a remarkable talent androl im certain the tower would love to study it i wonder how many people were born with it but never knew because the weaves for traveling were unknown im not going to the white tower pevara he said putting an emphasis on the white she changed the topic you long for traveling yet you dont want to leave the black tower so what does this terangreal matter gateways would be useful androl said he thought something but she couldnt catch hold of it a quick flash of images and impressions but if were not going anywhere she protested youd be surprised he said raising his head to peer out over the windowsill at the alleyway it was drizzling outside the rain had finally let up the sky was still dark though dawn wouldnt come for a few hours yet ive been experimenting trying a few things i dont think anyone else has ever tried i doubt they are things that havent ever been tried she said the forsaken had access to the knowledge of ages you really think one might be involved here why not she asked if you were preparing for the last battle and wanted to make certain your enemies couldnt resist you would you let a crop of channelers train together teach one another and become strong yes he said softly i would and then id steal them pevara closed her mouth that was probably right talking of the forsaken troubled androl she could feel his thoughts clearer than before this bond was unnatural she needed to be rid of it after that she wouldnt mind having him properly bonded to her i will not take responsibility for this situation pevara androl said again looking out you bonded me first after you betrayed the trust i gave you by offering a circle i didnt hurt you what did you expect to happen wasnt the purpose of a circle to allow us to join our powers this argument is pointless you only say that because youre losing he said it calmly and he felt calm as well she was coming to realize that androl was a difficult man to rile i say it because its true she said do you disagree she felt his amusement he saw how she took control of the conversation and beside his amusement he actually seemed impressed he was thinking that he needed to learn to do what she did the inner door to the room creaked open and leish peered in she was a whitehaired woman round and pleasant an odd match for the surly ashaman canler to whom she was married she nodded to pevara indicating that half an hour had passed then shut the door canler had reportedly bonded the woman making her some kind of what female warder everything was backward with these men pevara supposed she could see the reason for bonding ones spouse if only so that each could have the comfort of knowing where the other was but it felt wrong to use the bond in such a mundane way this was a thing for aes sedai and warders not wives and husbands androl regarded her obviously trying to figure out what she was thinkingthough these thoughts were complex enough to give him trouble such an odd man this androl genhald how did he so fully mix determination and diffidence like two threads woven together he did what needed to be done all the while worrying that he shouldnt be the one doing it i dont understand myself either he said he was also infuriating how had he grown so good at understanding what she was thinking she still had to fish to figure out his thoughts can you think that again he asked i didnt catch it idiot pevara muttered androl smiled then peeked over the windowsill again its not time pevara said youre sure yes she said and if you keep peeking you might scare him off when he actually comes androl reluctantly crouched down again now pevara said when he comes you have to let me take the lead we should link no she would not put herself in his hands again not after what had happened last time she shivered and androl glanced at her there are very good reasons she said for not linking i dont mean to insult you androl but your ability isnt great enough to make the trade worthwhile better that there be two of us you must accept this on a battlefield which would you rather have one soldier or twowith one being only slightly less skilledthat you can send on different tasks and duties he thought about it then sighed all right fine you talk sense this time i always talk sense she said rising its time be ready the two of them moved to either side of the doorway that led out into the alley it stood open a crack by intention the sturdy lock on the outside left hanging as if someone had forgotten to close it they waited silently and pevara began to worry that her calculations had been off androl would have a good laugh about that and the door pushed open the rest of the way dobser poked his head in lured by evins offhanded comment that hed nicked a bottle of wine from the back room after finding that leish had forgotten to lock the door according to androl dobser was a known drunkard and taim had beaten him senseless more than once for getting into the wine she could feel androls reaction to the man sadness deep crushing sadness dobser had the darkness behind his eyes pevara struck quickly tying dobser in air and slamming a shield into place between the unsuspecting man and the source androl hefted a cudgel but it wasnt needed dobser grew wideeyed as he was hoisted into the air pevara put her hands behind her back regarding him critically are you certain about this androl asked softly too late now regardless pevara replied tying off the weaves of air the accounts seem to agree the more dedicated a person was to the light before being taken the more dedicated they be to the shadow after falling and so and so this man who had always been rather lukewarm should be easier to break bribe or convert than others that was important as taims lackeys would likely realize what had happened as soon as dobser a voice asked two figures darkened the doorway do you have the wine no need to watch the front the woman isnt welyn and another of taims favored leems stood in the doorway pevara reacted immediately throwing weaves at the two men while forming a thread of spirit they rebuffed her attempts at shielding themit was tough to get a shield between the source and a person holding the one powerbut her gags snapped into place stopping their yells she felt air wrapping around her a shield trying to come between her and the source she lashed out with spirit slicing down the weaves by guessing where they would be leems stumbled back looking surprised as his weaves vanished pevara threw herself forward weaving another shield and smashing it between him and the source as she slammed her body into him throwing him back against the wall the distraction worked and her shield cut him off from the one power she flung a second shield at welyn but he hit her with his own threads of air they hurled her backward across the room she wove air as she crashed into the wall grunting her vision swam but she kept hold of that single thread of air and by instinct sweeping it forward grabbed welyns foot as he tried to run out of the building she felt the ground tremble from someone falling hed tripped hadnt he dizzy she couldnt see straight she sat up aching all over but clung to the threads of air shed woven as gags let those go and taims men would be able to scream if they did that she died they all died or worse she blinked the tears of pain from her eyes to find androl standing over the two ashaman cudgel in his hand hed knocked them both out it appeared not trusting in shields he couldnt see good thing too as her second shield hadnt gotten into place she set it now dobser still hung where shed put him his eyes wider now androl looked at pevara light he said pevara that was incredible you brought down two ashaman practically by yourself she smiled in satisfaction and woozily took androls hand letting him help her to her feet what did you think the red ajah does with its time androl sit around and complain about men we train to fight other channeled she felt androls respect as he busied himself pulling welyn into the building and shutting the door then checking at the windows to make certain they hadnt been seen he drew the shades quickly then channeled to make a light pevara took a breath then raised a hand and steadied herself against the wall androl looked up sharply we need to take you to one of the others for healing ill be fine she said just took a thump to the head and it has the room shaking it will wear off let me see androl said walking overhis light hovering beside him pevara allowed him to putter about for a moment checking her eyes feeling her head for lumps he moved his light closer to her eyes does it hurt to look at this yes she admitted glancing away nausea slight he grunted then took a handkerchief out of his pocket and poured some water on it from his flask he adopted a look of concentration and his light winked out the handkerchief crackled softly and when he handed it to her it was frozen hold this to the wound he said tell me if you start to feel drowsy it could grow worse if you fall asleep are you worried for me she asked amused doing as he said just what was it you told me earlier keeping watch over our assets im sure she said pressing the iced bandanna to her head so you know field medicine as well i apprenticed with a towns wise woman once he said absently as he knelt to bind the fallen men pevara was glad to release the weaves of air on them though she did keep the shields up a wise woman took on a male apprentice not at first androl said its a long story excellent a long story will keep me from falling asleep until the others come for us emarin and the others had been instructed to go and be seen establishing an alibi for the group in case dobsers disappearance was noted androl eyed her replacing his light then he shrugged continuing his work it started when i lost a friend to the fevers during a silverpike run out of mayene when i came back to the mainland i started thinking that we could have saved sayer if any of us had known what to do so i went looking for someone who could teach me chapter advantages to a bond and that was the end of it pevara said sitting against the wall androl could feel her emotions they sat in the store room where theyd fought taims men waiting for emarinwho claimed he could make dobser talk androl himself had little skill in interrogation the scent of grain had changed to a rancid stench it spoiled suddenly sometimes pevara had grown quiet both outside and in as shed spoken of the murder of her family by longtime friends i still hate them she said i can think about my family without pain but the darkfriends i hate them at least i have some vengeance as the dark one certainly didnt defend them they spent all their lives following him hoping for a place in his new world only to have the last battle come long after their deaths i suppose the ones living now wont be any better off once we win the last battle he will have their souls i hope their punishment is lengthy youre so certain we will win androl asked of course we will win its not a question androl we cant afford to make it one he nodded youre right continue theres no more to say odd to tell the story after all these years for a long while i couldnt speak of it the room fell silent dobser hung in his bonds facing the wall his ears plugged by pevaras weaves the other two were still unconscious androl had hit them hard and he intended to see that they didnt awaken anytime soon pevara had shielded them but she couldnt possibly maintain three shields at once if the men tried to break free aes sedai usually used more than one sister to hold one man three would be impossible for any single channeler strong or not she could tie off those shields but taim had set the ashaman at practicing how to escape a tiedoff shield yes best to make certain the other two didnt wake useful though it would be just to cut their throats he didnt have the stomach for it instead he sent a tiny thread of spirit and air to touch each of their eyelids he had to use a single weave and a weak one but he managed to touch all of their eyes if the lids cracked a tiny bit hed know that would have to be enough pevara was still thinking about her family she had been telling the truth she did hate the darkfriends all of them it was a measured hate not out of control but it was still strong after all of these years he would not have suspected that in this woman who seemed so often to smile he could sense that she hurt and oddly that she felt lonely my father killed himself androl said without really intending to she looked at him my mother pretended it was an accident for years androl continued he did it out in the woods leaped from a cliff hed sat down with her the night before and explained what he was going to do she didnt try to stop him pevara asked aghast no androl said only a few years before she found the mothers last embrace i was able to pry some answers out of her she was frightened of him that was shocking to me hed always been so gentle what had changed in those last few years to make her fear him androl turned to pevara she said that he saw things in the shadows that hed started to go mad ah you asked me why i came to the black tower you wanted to know why i asked to be tested well this thing that i am it answers a question for me it tells me who my father was and why he did what he felt he needed to do i can see the signs now our business did too well father could find quarries of stone and veins of metal when nobody else could men hired him to find valuable deposits for them he was the best uncannily good i could see it in him at the end pevara i was only ten but i remember the fear in his eyes i know that fear now he hesitated my father jumped off that cliff to save his familys lives im sorry pevara said knowing what i am what he was helps it had started raining again fat drops hitting the window like pebbles the door into the shop opened and emarin finally peered in he saw dobser hanging there and looked relieved then he saw the other two and started what have you two done what needed to be done androl said standing what took you so long i nearly started another confrontation with coteren emarin said still staring at the two captive ashaman i think our time is short androl we didnt let them goad us but coteren seemed annoyedmore so than normal i dont think theyre going to tolerate us much longer well these captives put us on a countdown anyway pevara said moving dobser over to make room for emarin you really think you can make this man talk ive tried interrogating darkfriends before they can be tough to crack ah emarin said but this is not a darkfriend this is dobser i dont think its really him androl said studying the man floating in his bonds i cant accept that someone can be made to serve the dark one he could sense pevaras disagreement she really did think that was how it happened anyone who could channel could be turned shed explained the old texts spoke of it the idea made androl want to sick up forcing someone to be evil that shouldnt be possible fate moved people about put them in terrible positions cost them their lives sometimes their sanity but the choice to serve the dark one or the light surely that one choice could not be taken from a person the shadow he saw behind dobsers eyes was enough proof for androl the man hed known was gone killed and something elsesomething evilhad been put into his body a new soul it had to be that whatever he is pevara said im still skeptical that you can force him to speak the best persuasions emarin said hands clasped behind his back are those that arent forced pevara sedai if you would be so kind as to remove the weaves blocking his ears so that he can start to hearbut only remove them in the most minor way as if the weave has been tied off and is failing i want him to overhear what im about to say she complied at least androl assumed she did being doublebonded didnt mean they could see one anothers weaves he could feel her anxiety however she was thinking of darkfriends shed interrogated was wishing for something a tool shed used against them i do think we can hide at my estates emarin said in a haughty voice androl blinked the man held himself taller more proudly more authoritatively his voice became powerful dismissive just like that he had become a nobleman no one will think to look for us there emarin continued i will accept you as my associates and the lesser among usyoung evin for instance can enter my employ as servants if we play our hand correctly we can build up a rival black tower i dont know how wise that would be androl said playing along silence emarin said i will ask your opinion when it is required aes sedai the only way we will rival the white and black towers is if we create a place where male and female channelers work together a gray tower if you will it is an interesting proposal it is the only thing that makes sense emarin said then turned to their captive he cannot hear what we say no pevara said release him then i would speak to him pevara hesitantly did as instructed dobser dropped to the floor barely catching himself he stumbled for a moment unsteady on his feet then immediately glanced toward the exit emarin reached behind his back pulled something from his belt and tossed it to the floor a small sack it clinked as it hit master dobser emarin said whats this dobser asked tentatively crouching down taking the sack he peeked into it and his eyes widened noticeably payment emarin said dobser narrowed his eyes to do what you mistake me master dobser emarin said im not asking you to do anything im paying you in apology i sent androl here to request your aid and he seems to have overstepped the bounds of his instructions i merely wished to speak with you i did not intend to see you wrapped up in air and tormented dobser glanced about himself suspicious whered you find money like this emarin what makes you think you can start giving orders youre just a soldier he looked at the pouchs contents again i see that we understand each other emarin said smiling youll maintain my front for me then i dobser frowned he looked at welyn and leems lying unconscious on the floor yes emarin said that is going to be a problem isnt it you dont suppose we could just give androl to taim and blame him for this androl dobser said snorting the pageboy taking down two ashaman nobody would believe it nobody a valid point master dobser emarin said just give em the aes sedai dobser said jerking a finger toward her alas i have need of her a mess this is a pure mess well dobser said maybe i could talk to the mhael for you you know straighten it out that would be much appreciated emarin said taking a chair from beside the wall and setting it down then placing another before it he sat waving for dobser to sit down androl make yourself useful find something for master dobser and me to drink tea you like sugar no dobser said actually i heard there was wine round here somewhere wine androl emarin said snapping his fingers well androl thought best to play the part he bowed shooting dobser a calculated glare then fetched some cups and wine from the storeroom when he returned dobser and emarin were chatting amicably i understand emarin said i have had such trouble finding proper help inside the black tower you see the need to preserve my identity is imperative i can see that mlord dobser said why if anyone else knew a high lord of tear was among our ranks thered be no end to the boot licking that i can tell you and the mhael well he wouldnt like someone with so much authority being here no not at all you see why i had to maintain my distance emarin explained holding out a hand and accepting a cup of wine as androl poured it a high lord of tear androl thought amused dobser seemed to be drinking it in as he did strong liquor and we all thought you were fawning over logain because you was stupid dobser said alas the lot ive been given taim would see through me in a moment if i were to spend too much time around him so i was forced to go with logain he and that dragon fellow both are obviously farmers and wouldnt recognize a highborn man ill say mlord dobser said i was suspicious as i thought emarin said taking a sip of the wine to prove its not poisoned he explained before passing the cup to dobser s all right mlord dobser said i trust you he gulped down the wine if you cant trust a high lord himself who can you trust right quite right emarin said i can tell you this dobser said holding out his cup and wagging it for androl to refill youll need to find a better way of keeping away from taim following logain wont work anymore emarin took a long contemplative sip from his cup of wine taim has him i see i did guess it would be so welyn and the others showing up tells the tale yeah dobser said letting androl refill his cup again logain is a strong one though takes a lot of work to turn a man like him willpower you know it will be a day or two to turn him anyway you might as well come out to taim explain what youre up to hell understand and he keeps saying men are more useful to him if he doesnt have to turn them dont know why no choice but to turn logain though awful process dobser shivered ill go and speak with him then master dobser would you vouch for me by chance ill see you paid for the effort sure sure dobser said why not he downed his wine then lurched to his feet hell be checking on logain always does this time of night and that would be where emarin said the hidden rooms dobser said in the foundations were building you know the eastern section where the collapse made all of that extra digging that was no collapse just an excuse for covering up extra work being done and dobser hesitated and thats enough pevara said tying the man up in air again and stopping his ears she folded her arms looking at emarin im impressed emarin spread his hands apart in a gesture of humility i have always had a talent for making men feel at ease in truth i didnt suggest picking dobser because i thought hed be easy to bribe i picked him because of his well understated powers of cognitive expression turning someone to the shadow doesnt make him any less stupid androl said but if you could do this why did we have to jump him in the first place its a matter of controlling the situation androl emarin said a man like dobser mustnt be confronted in his element surrounded by friends with more wits than he we had to scare him make him writhe then offer him a way to wiggle out emarin hesitated glancing at dobser besides i dont think we wanted to risk him going to taim which he very well might have done if id approached him in private without the threat of violence and now pevara asked now androl said we douse these three with something that will keep them sleeping until bel tine we gather nalaam canler evin and jonneth we wait for taim to finish his inspection of logain we break in rescue him and seize the tower back from the shadow they stood in silence for a moment the room lit only by the single flickering lamp rain sprayed the window well pevara said so long as its not a difficult task youre proposing androl rand opened his eyes to the dream somewhat surprised to find that he had fallen asleep aviendha had finally let him doze in truth she was probably letting herself doze as well shed seemed as tired as he had more perhaps he climbed to his feet in the meadow of dead grass he had been able to sense her concern not only through the bond but in the way she had held him aviendha was a fighter a warrior but even a warrior needed something to hold on to once in a while light knew that he did he looked about this didnt feel like telaranrhiod not completely the dead field extended into the distance on all sides presumably into infinity this wasnt the true world of dreams it was a dreamshard a world created by a powerful dreamer or dreamwalker rand began walking feet crunching on dead leaves though there were no trees he could probably have sent himself back to his own dreams though he had never been as good as many of the forsaken at walking dreams he could manage that much curiosity drove him forward i shouldnt be here he thought i set wards how had he come to this place and who had created it he had a suspicion there was one person who had often made use of dreamshards rand felt a presence nearby he continued walking not turning but knew that someone was now walking beside him elan rand said lews therin elan still wore his newest body the tall handsome man who wore red and black it dies and the dust soon will rule the dust then nothing how did you pass my wards i dont know moridin said i knew that if i created this place you would join me in it you cant keep away from me the pattern wont allow it we are drawn together you and i time after time after time two ships moored on the same beach beating against one another with each new tide poetic rand said youve finally let mierin off her leash ive seen moridin stopped and rand paused looking at him the mans rage seemed to come off him in waves of heat she came to you moridin demanded rand said nothing do not pretend that you knew she still lived you didnt know you couldnt have known rand kept still his emotions regarding lanfearor whatever she called herself nowwere complicated lews therin had despised her but rand had known her primarily as selene and had been fond of heruntil at least she tried to kill egwene and aviendha thinking of her made him think of moiraine made him hope for things he shouldnt hope for if lanfear still lives might moiraine as well he faced moridin with calm confidence loosing her is pointless now rand said she no longer holds any power over me yes moridin said i believe you she does not but i do think she still harbors something of a grievance with the woman you chose what is her name again the one who calls herself aiel but carries weapons rand did not rise to the attempt to rile him mierin hates you now anyway moridin continued i think she blames you for what happened to her you should call her cyndane she has been forbidden to use the name she took upon herself cyndane rand said trying out the word last chance your master has gained humor i see it was not meant to be humorous moridin said no i suppose that it was not rand looked at the endless landscape of dead grass and leaves it is hard to think that i was so afraid of you during those early days did you invade my dreams then or bring me into one of these dreamshards i was never able to figure it out moridin said nothing i remember one time rand said sitting up by the fire surrounded by nightmares that felt like telaranrhiod you would not have been able to pull someone fully into the world of dreams yet im no dreamwalker able to enter on my own moridin like many of the forsaken had usually entered telaranrhiod in the flesh which was dangerous some said that entering in the flesh was an evil thing that it lost you a part of your humanity it also made you more powerful moridin gave no clue as to what had happened on that night rand remembered those days faintly traveling toward tear he remembered visions in the night visions of his friends or family that would try to kill him moridin ishamael had been pulling him against his will into dreams intersecting telaranrhiod you were mad during those days rand said softly looking into moridins eyes he could almost see the fires burning there youre still mad arent you you just have it contained no one could serve him without being at least a little mad moridin stepped forward taunt as you wish lews therin the ending dawns all will be given to the great suffocation of the shadow to be stretched ripped strangled rand took a step forward as well right up to moridin they were the same height you hate yourself rand whispered i can feel it in you elan once you served him for power now you do it because his victoryand an end to all thingsis the only release youll ever know youd rather not exist than continue to be you you must know that he will not release you not ever not you moridin sneered hell let me kill you before this ends lews therin you and the goldenhaired one and the aiel woman and the little darkhaired you act as if this is a contest between you and me elan rand interrupted moridin laughed throwing his head back of course it is havent you seen that yeti by the blood falls lews therin it is about us two just as in ages past over and over we fight one another you and i no rand said not this time im done with you i have a greater battle to fight dont try to sunlight exploded through the clouds above there was often no sunlight in the world of dreams but now it bathed the area around rand moridin stumbled back he looked up at the light then gazed at rand and narrowed his eyes dont think dont think i will believe your simple tricks lews therin weiramon was shaken by what you did to him but its not such a difficult thing holding saidin and listening for peoples heartbeats to speed up rand exerted his will the crackling dead leaves began to transform at his feet turning green again and shoots of grass broke through the leaves the green spread from him like spilled paint and clouds above boiled away moridins eyes opened wider he stumbled staring at the sky as the clouds retreated rand could feel his shock this was moridins dreamshard however to draw another in he had had to place it close to telaranrhiod those rules applied there was something else too something about the connection between the two of them rand strode forward lifting his arms out to the sides grass sprouted in waves red blossoms burst from the ground like a blush upon the land the storm stilled the dark clouds burned away by light tell your master rand commanded tell him this fight is not like the others tell him ive tired of minions that im finished with his petty movement of pawns tell him that im coming for him this is wrong moridin said visibly shaken this isnt he looked at rand for a moment standing beneath the blazing sun then vanished rand let out a deep breath the grass died around him the clouds sprang back the sunlight faded though moridin was gone holding on to that transformation of the landscape had been difficult rand sagged panting recovering from the exertion here willing something to be true could make it so if only things were that simple in the real world he closed his eyes and sent himself away to sleep for the short time before he had to rise rise and save the world if he could pevara crouched beside androl in the rainy night her cloak was soaked completely through she knew a couple of weaves that would have been useful for that but she didnt dare channel she and the others would be facing turned aes sedai and women of the black ajah they could sense it if she channeled theyre definitely guarding the area androl whispered ahead of them the ground broke away into a large sequence of mazelike brickworks and trenches these were the foundation rooms of what would eventually become the black tower proper if dobser was right other rooms had been created within the foundationhidden chambers already complete that would continue to be secret as the tower itself was constructed a pair of taims ashaman stood chatting nearby though they tried to appear nonchalant the effect was spoiled by the weather who would choose to stand outside on a night like this one despite a warm brazier lighting them and a weave of air to send the rain streaming away their presence was suspicious guards pevara tried sending the thought to androl directly it worked she could feel his surprise as the thought intruded onto his own something returned fuzzy we should take advantage yes she sent back the next thought was too complex though so she whispered it how have you never before noticed that he left the foundation guarded at night if there really are secret rooms then the work on them would be done at night as well taim set a curfew androl whispered he lets us ignore it only when convenient to himsuch as for welyns return tonight besides this area is dangerous with those pits and trenches it would be a good enough reason to set guards except except pevara said taim isnt exactly the type to care if a child or two break their necks poking around androl nodded pevara and androl waited in the rain counting their breaths until three ribbons of fire flew from the night and struck the guards directly in their heads the two ashaman dropped like sacks of grain nalaam emarin and jonneth had done their work perfectly quick channeling with luck it either wouldnt be noticed or would be thought the work of taims men on guard light pevara thought androl and the others really are weapons she hadnt stopped to consider that emarin and the others would lead with lethal attacks it was completely outside her experience as an aes sedai aes sedai didnt even kill false dragons if they could help it gentling kills androl said eyes forward albeit slowly light yes there might be advantages to their bondbut it was also blasted inconvenient she would have to practice shielding her thoughts emarin and the others came in from the darkness joining pevara and androl at the brazier canler remained behind with the other two rivers lads ready to lead them from the black tower in an escape attempt if something went wrong tonight it made sense to leave him despite his protests he had a family they dragged the corpses into the shadows but left the brazier burning someone looking for the guards would see that the light was still there but the night was so misty and rainy one would have to draw close to realize that its attendants had vanished though he often complained that he didnt know why the others followed him androl immediately took charge of this group sending nalaam and jonneth to watch at the edge of the foundation jonneth carried his bow unstrung in the wet night they were hoping the rain would let up and that hed be able to use it when they couldnt risk channeling androl pevara and emarin slid down one of the muddy slopes into the foundation pits that had been dug mud splashed over her as she landed but she was already soaked and the rain washed away the grime the foundation was made of stones built up to form walls between rooms and hallways down here this became a labyrinth with a steady stream of rain falling from above in the morning the ashaman soldiers would be set to drying out the foundation how do we find the entrance pevara sent androl knelt a very small globe of light hovering above his hand drops of rain passed through the light looking like tiny meteorites for a moment as they flashed and vanished he rested fingers in the pooling water on the ground he looked up then pointed it runs this way he whispered its going somewhere that is where well find taim emarin grunted appreciatively androl raised a hand summoning jonneth and nalaam down into the foundation with them then led the way stepping softly you quietly move well she sent trained as scout he sent back in woods mountains of mist how many jobs had he done in his life she had worried about him a life such as he had led could indicate a dissatisfaction with the world an impatience the way he spoke of the black tower though the passion with which he was willing to fight that said something different this wasnt just about a loyalty to logain yes androl and the others respected logain but to them he represented something far greater a place where men like them were accepted a life like androls could indicate a man who would not commit or be satisfied but it could also indicate something else a man who searched a man who knew that the life he wanted existed out there he just had to find it they teach you to analyze people like that in the white tower androl whispered to her as he stopped beside a doorway and moved his globe of light in then waved the others to follow no she sent back trying to practice this method of communicating to make her thoughts smoother is something a woman picks up after her first century of life he sent back tense amusement they passed into a series of unfinished rooms none of them roofed before reaching a section of unworked earth some barrels here held pitch but they had been shifted to the side and the boards they normally sat upon had been pulled away a pit opened in the ground here the water trailed over the lip of the pit and down into darkness androl knelt and listened then nodded to the others before slipping down into it his splash came a second later pevara followed him dropping only a few feet the water was cold on her feet but she was already soaked androl hunched leading the way under an earthen overhang then stood up on the other side his little globe of light revealed a tunnel a trench had been dug here to hold the rainwater pevara judged theyd been standing directly above this when theyd taken down the guards dobser right she sent as the others splashed down behind taim building secret tunnels and chambers they crossed the trench and continued on a short distance down the tunnel they reached an intersection where the earthen walls were shored up like the shafts of a mine the five of them gathered there looking in one direction then another two paths that way slopes upward emarin whispered pointing left perhaps to another entrance into these tunnels we should probably move deeper nalaam said dont you think yes androl said licking his finger and testing the air the wind is blowing right well go that way first be careful there will be other guards the group slipped further down into the tunnels how long had taim been working on this complex it didnt seem terribly extensivethey didnt pass other branchingsbut still it was impressive suddenly androl stopped and the others pulled to a halt a grumbling voice echoed up the tunnel too soft for them to make out the words accompanied by a flickering light on the walls pevara embraced the source and prepared weaves if she channeled would someone in the foundation notice androl was obviously hesitant as well channeling above to kill the guards had been suspicious enough if taims men down here sensed the one power being used the figure was approaching the light illuminating him a creak came from beside her as jonneth drew his restrung two rivers bow there was barely room in the tunnel for it he loosed with a snap the air whistling the grumbling cut off and the light fell the group scrambled forward to find coteren down on the ground eyes staring up glassily the arrow through his chest his lantern burned fitfully on the ground beside him jonneth retrieved his arrow then wiped it on the dead mans clothing thats why i still carry a bow you bloody son of a goat here emarin said pointing at a thick door coteren was guarding it prepare yourselves androl whispered then shoved open the thick wooden door beyond they found a line of crude cells built into the earthen walleach one little more than a roofed cubbyhole burrowed into the earth with a door set in the opening pevara peeked in one which was empty the cubby didnt have enough room for a man to stand up inside and the room was unlit being locked in those cells would mean being trapped in blackness squeezed into a space like a grave light nalaam said androl hes in here its logain the others hurried to join him and androl picked the doors lock with a surprisingly adept hand they pulled open the cell door and logain rolled out with a groan he looked horrible covered in grime once that curling dark hair and strong face might have made him handsome he looked as weak as a beggar he coughed then rose to his knees with nalaams help androl knelt immediately but not in reverence he looked logain in the eyes as emarin gave the ashaman leader his flask for a drink well pevara asked its him androl thought a wave of relief coming through the bond its still him theyd have let him go if theyd turned him pevara sent back growing increasingly comfortable with this method of communicating maybe unless this is a trap my lord logain androl logains voice was raspy jonneth nalaam and an aes sedai he inspected pevara for a man who had apparently suffered days perhaps weeks of incarceration he looked remarkably lucid i remember you what ajah are you woman does it matter she replied greatly logain said trying to stand he was too weak and nalaam had to support him how did you find me that is a story for once we are safe my lord androl said he peeked out the doorway lets move we still have a difficult night ahead of us i androl froze then slammed the door what is it pevara asked channeling jonneth said powerful yells muffled by the door and the dirt walls sounded outside in the hallway someone found the guards emarin said my lord logain can you fight logain tried to stand on his own then sagged again his face grew determined but pevara felt androls disappointment logain had been given forkroot either that or he was simply too tired to channel not surprising pevara had seen women in better shape than this who were too worn out to embrace the source back androl shouted stepping to the side of the dooragainst the earthen wall the door exploded in a weave of fire and destruction pevara didnt wait for the debris to settle she wove fire and released a column of destruction down the corridor beyond she knew she was facing darkfriends or worse the three oaths did not hinder her here she heard shouts but something deflected the fire immediately a shield tried to slam between her and the source she fought it off barely and ducked to the side breathing deeply whoever it is theyre strong pevara said a voice called orders distantly echoing in the tunnels jonneth knelt down beside her bow out light thats taims voice we cannot stand here logain said androl a gateway im trying androl said light im trying bah nalaam set logain down beside the wall ive been in tighter spots before he joined the others at the doorway flinging weaves down the corridor blasts shook the side walls and dirt rained down from the roof above pevara jumped in front of the doorway releasing a weave then knelt down beside androl he stared ahead not seeing face a mask of concentration she could feel determination and frustration pulsing through the bond she took his hand you can do it she whispered the doorway erupted and jonneth fell back arm burned the ground trembled the walls started to break apart sweat dripped down the sides of androls face he gritted his teeth his face going red eyes opening wide smoke poured through the doorway making emarin cough as nalaam healed jonneth androl yelled and he neared the top of that wall in his mind he was almost there he could a weave thumped against the room a ripple in the earth and the strained roof finally gave out earth poured down atop them and all went black chapter to require a boon rand althor awoke and drew in a deep breath he slipped from the blankets in his tent leaving aviendha slumbering there and threw on a robe the air smelled wet he was reminded in passing of mornings during his youth rising before dawn to milk the cow which would need milking twice a day eyes closed he remembered the sounds of tamalready upcutting new fence posts in the barn remembering the chilly air stomping his feet into his boots washing his face with water left to warm beside the stove on any morning a farmer could open his door and look out on a world that was still new crisp frost the first tentative calls of birds sunlight breaking the horizon like the morning yawn of the world rand stepped up to the flaps of his tent and drew them back nodding to katerin a short goldenhaired maiden who was on guard he looked out on a world that was far from new this world was old and tired like a peddler who had been to the spine of the world and back on foot tents crowded the field of merrilor cook fires trailing pillars of smoke toward the stilldark morning sky everywhere men worked soldiers oiled armor smiths sharpened spearheads women prepared feathers for fletching arrows breakfasts were served from meal wagons to men who should have slept better than they had everyone knew these were their last moments before the storm arrived rand closed his eyes he could feel it the land itself like a faint warder bond beneath his feet grubs crawled through the soil the roots of the grasses continued to spread ever so slowly seeking nutrients the skeletal trees were not dead for water seeped through them they slumbered bluebirds clustered in a nearby tree they did not call out with the arrival of dawn they huddled together as if for warmth the land still lived it lived like a man clinging to the edge of a cliff by his fingertips rand opened his eyes have my clerks returned from tear yes rand althor said katerin send word to the other rulers rand said i will meet with them in one hour at the center of the field where i commanded no tents be placed katerin went off to relay his command leaving three other maidens nearby to guard rand let the tent flaps close in front of him and turned around then jumped as he found aviendhaas bare as the day shed been bornstanding in the tent it is very difficult to sneak up on you rand althor she announced with a smile the bond gives you too much of an advantage i have to move very slowly like a lizard at midnight so that your sense of where i am does not change too quickly light aviendha why do you need to sneak up on me in the first place for this she said then jumped forward snatching his head and kissing him her body pressed against his he relaxed letting the kiss linger unsurprisingly he mumbled around her lips this is much more fun now that i dont have to worry about freezing my bits off while doing it aviendha pulled back you should not speak of that event rand althor but my toh is paid and i am now firstsister to elayne do not remind me of a shame that is forgotten shame why would she be ashamed of that when just now he shook his head he could hear the land breathing could sense a beetle on a leaf half a league away but sometimes he could not fathom aiel or maybe it was just women in this case it was probably both aviendha hesitated beside the tents barrel of fresh water i suppose that we will not have time for a bath oh you like baths now i have accepted them as a part of life she said if i am going to live in the wetlands then i will adopt some wetlander customs when they are not foolish her tone indicated that most of them were whats wrong rand asked stepping up to her wrong something bothers you aviendha i can see it in you feel it in you she looked him over with a critical eye light but she was beautiful you were much easier to manage before you received the ancient wisdom of your former self rand althor i was he asked smiling you didnt act that way at the time that was when i was as a new child inexperienced in rand althors boundless capacity to be frustrating she dipped her hands into the water and washed her face it is well if i had known some of what was to come with you i might have put on the white and never removed it he smiled then channeled weaving water and drawing the liquid from the barrel in a stream aviendha stepped back watching with curiosity you no longer seem bothered by the idea of a man channeling he noted as he fanned the water out into the air and heated it with a thread of fire there is no longer a reason to be bothered if i were to be uncomfortable with you channeling i would be behaving like a man refusing to forget a womans shame after her toh has been met she eyed him i cant imagine anyone being that crass he said tossing aside his robe and stepping up to her here this is a relic from that ancient wisdom you apparently find so frustrating he brought the water in warmed perfectly and shattered it into a thick misting spray that wove about them in a rush aviendha gasped clutching his arm she might be growing more comfortable with wetlander ways but water still made her both uncomfortable and reverent rand snatched some soap with air and shaved it into part of the mix of water sending a spinning whirl of bubbles around them swirling up their bodies and pulling their hair into the air twisting aviendhas about like a column before dropping it back lightly to her shoulders he used another wave of warm water to remove the soap then pulled most of the wetness away leaving them damp but not soaked he dumped the water back into the barrel and with a hint of reluctance released saidin aviendha was panting that that was completely crackbrained and irresponsible thank you he said fetching a towel and tossing it to her you would consider most of what we did during the age of legends to be crackbrained and irresponsible that was a different time aviendha there were many more channelers and we were trained from a young age we didnt need to know things like warfare or how to kill we had eliminated pain hunger suffering war instead we used the one power for things that might seem common youd only assumed that youd eliminated war aviendha said with a sniff you were wrong your ignorance left you weak it did i cant decide if i would have changed things though there were many good years good decades good centuries we believed we were living in paradise perhaps that was our downfall we wanted our lives to be perfect so we ignored imperfections problems were magnified through inattention and war might have become inevitable if the bore hadnt ever been made he toweled himself dry rand aviendha said stepping up to him today i will require a boon she laid her hand on his arm the skin of her hand was rough callused from her days as a maiden aviendha would never be a milksoftened lady like those from the courts of cairhien and tear rand liked that just fine hers were hands that had known work what boon he asked im not certain i could deny you anything today aviendha im not yet certain what it will be i dont understand you neednt understand she said and you neednt promise me you will agree i felt i needed to give you warning as one does not ambush a lover my boon will require you to change your plans perhaps in a drastic way and it will be important all right she nodded as mystifying as ever and began gathering up her clothing to dress for the day egwene strode around a frozen pillar of glass in her dream it almost looked like a column of light what did it mean she could not interpret it the vision changed and she found a sphere the world she knew somehow cracking frantic she tied it with cords striving to hold it together she could keep it from breaking but it took so much effort she faded from the dream and started awake she embraced the source immediately and wove a light where was she she was wearing a nightgown and lying in bed back in the white tower not her own rooms which were still in disrepair following the assassins attack her study had a small sleeping chamber and shed bedded down in that her head pounded she could vaguely remember growing blearyeyed the night before listening in her tent at the field of merrilor to reports of caemlyns fall at some point during the late hours of the night gawyn had insisted that nynaeve make a gateway back to the white tower so egwene could sleep in a bed rather than on a pallet on the ground she grumbled to herself rising hed probably been right though she could remember feeling distinctly annoyed at his tone nobody had corrected him on it not even nynaeve she rubbed at her temples the headache wasnt as bad as those shed had when halima had been caring for her but it did hurt mightily undoubtedly her body was expressing displeasure at the lack of sleep shed given it in recent weeks a short time laterdressed washed and feeling a little bettershe left her rooms to find gawyn sitting at silvianas desk looking over a report ignoring a novice who was lingering near the doorway shed hang you out the window by your toes if she saw you doing that egwene said dryly gawyn jumped its not a report from her stack he protested its the latest news from my sister about caemlyn it came by gateway for you just a few minutes ago and youre reading it he blushed burn me egwene its my home it wasnt sealed i thought its all right gawyn she said with a sigh lets see what it says theres not much he said with a grimace handing it to her at a nod from him the novice scurried away a short time later the girl came back with a tray of wizened bellfruit bread and a pitcher of milk egwene sat down at her desk in the study to eat feeling guilty as the novice left the bulk of the towers aes sedai and soldiers camped in tents on the field of merrilor while she dined on fruit no matter how old and slept in a comfortable bed still gawyns arguments had made sense if everyone thought she was in her tent on the field then potential killers would strike there after her neardeath at the hands of the seanchan assassins she was willing to accept a few extra precautions particularly those that helped her get a good nights sleep that seanchan woman egwene said staring into her cup the one with the illianer did you speak with her he nodded i have some tower guards watching the pair nynaeve vouched for them in a way in a way she called the woman several variations of woolheaded but said she probably wouldnt do you any intentional harm wonderful well egwene could make use of a seanchan who was willing to talk light what if she had to fight them and the trollocs at the same time you didnt take your own advice she said noting gawyns red eyes as he sat down in the chair in front of her desk someone had to watch the door he said calling for guards would have let everyone know that you were not at the field she took a bite of her breadwhat had it been made of and looked over the report he was right but she didnt like the idea of him going without sleep on a day like this the warder bond would only help him so far so the city is truly gone she said walls breached palace seized the trollocs didnt burn all of the city i see much of it but not all yes gawyn said but it is obvious that caemlyn is lost she felt his tension through the bond im sorry many people escaped but its hard to say what the city population was before the attack with so many refugees hundreds of thousands are likely dead egwene breathed out a large armys worth of people wiped out in one night that was probably only the start of the brutality to come how many had died in kandor so far they could only guess caemlyn had held much of the andoran armys food supply she felt sick thinking of so many peoplehundreds of thousands of them stumbling across the landscape away from the burning city yet that thought was less terrifying than the risk of starvation to elaynes troops she drew up a note to silviana requiring her to send all sisters strong enough to provide healing for the refugees and gateways to carry them to whitebridge perhaps she could deliver supplies there though the white tower was strained as it was did you see the note at the bottom gawyn asked she had not she frowned then scanned a sentence added at the bottom in silvianas hand rand althor had demanded that everyone meet with him by she looked up at the rooms old freestanding wooden clock the meeting was in a halfhour she groaned then began shoveling the rest of her breakfast into her mouth it wasnt dignified but light burn her if she was going to meet with rand on an empty stomach im going to throttle that boy she said wiping her face come on lets move we could always be last gawyn said rising show him he doesnt order us about and allow him the chance to meet with everyone else while im not there to counter what he has to say i dont like it but rand holds the reins right now everyones too curious to see what hes going to do she made a gateway back to her tent into the corner that shed set aside for traveling she and gawyn stepped through and left the tent into the clamor of the field of merrilor people shouted outside with a distant thunder of hooves troops cantered and galloped as they took positions for the meeting did rand realize what hed done here putting soldiers together like this leaving them edgy and uncertain was like tossing a handful of fireworks into a stewpot and setting it onto the stove eventually things were going to start exploding egwene needed to manage the chaos she strode out of her tent gawyn a step behind and to her left and smoothed her face the world needed an amyrlin silviana waited outside dressed formally with stole and staff as if she were going to a meeting of the hall of the tower see to this once the meeting starts egwene said handing her the note yes mother the woman said then fell into step just behind egwene and to her right egwene didnt need to look to know that silviana and gawyn were pointedly ignoring each other at the west side of her camp egwene found a cluster of aes sedai arguing with one another she passed through them and pulled silence in her wake a groom brought her horse sifter a testy dapple gelding and as she mounted she looked at the aes sedai sitters only that produced a sea of calm orderly complaints each made with an aes sedai sense of authority each woman thought she had a right to be at the meeting egwene stared at them and the women slowly came into line they were aes sedai they knew that squabbling was beneath them the sitters gathered and egwene looked out over the field of merrilor as she waited it was a large triangular area of shienaran grassland bounded on two sides by converging riversthe mora and the erininand on the other by woods the grass was broken by dashar knob a rocky outcrop about a hundred feet high with cliff walls and on the arafellin side of the mora by polov heights a flattopped hill about forty feet high with gradual slopes on three sides and a steeper slope on the river side southwest of polov heights lay an area of bogs and nearby the river moras shallows known as hawval ford a convenient crossing place between arafel and shienar there was an ogier stedding nearby opposite some old stone ruins to the north egwene had paid her respects soon after arriving but rand had not invited the ogier to his meeting armies were converging borderlander flags came in from the west where rand had made his camp perrins own flag flew among those odd that perrin should have a flag from the south elaynes procession wound its way toward the meeting place smack in the middle of the field the queen rode at the front her palace had burned but she kept her eyes forward between perrin and elayne the tairens and illianerslight who had let those armies camp so near one another marched in separate columns both bringing almost their entire forces best to be quick her presence would calm the rulers perhaps prevent problems they wouldnt like being near so many aiel each clan but the shaido was represented she still didnt know if theyd support rand or her some of the wise ones seemed to have listened to egwenes pleas but she had received no commitments look there saerin said pulling up beside egwene did you invite the sea folk egwene shook her head no i thought there was little chance theyd side against rand in truth after her meeting with the windfinders in telaranrhiod she hadnt wanted to swim in negotiations with them again she was afraid shed wake up and find that shed traded away not only her firstborn but the white tower itself they put up quite a show appearing through gateways near rands camp wearing their colorful clothing wavemistresses and swordmasters as proud as monarchs light egwene thought i wonder how long its been since a meeting of this scale occurred nearly every nation was represented and then some considering the sea folk and the aiel only murandy arad doman and the seanchanheld lands were missing the last of the sitters finally mounted and pulled up beside her eager to move forward but not daring to show it egwene started a slow ride toward the meeting place brynes soldiers fell in and formed an escort of tromping boots and pikes held high their white tabards were emblazoned with the flame of tar valon but they did not outshine the aes sedai the way they marched accented the women at their center other armies relied on the strength of arms the white tower had something better each army converged on the meeting place the center of the field where rand had ordered no tents erected so many armies together on ground perfect for a charge this had better not go wrong elayne set precedent by leaving the vast bulk of her force halfway there continuing on with a smaller guard of about a hundred men egwene did the same other leaders began to trickle forward their retinues coming to rest in a large ring around the central field sunlight shone down upon egwene as she approached the center she couldnt help but notice the large perfectly broken circle of clouds above the field rand did affect things in strange ways he needed no announcement to say that he was in attendance no banner the clouds pulled back and sunlight shone down when he was near it did not seem that hed arrived at the center yet however she met up with elayne elayne im sorry she said not for the first time the goldenhaired woman kept her eyes forward the city is lost but the city is not the nation we must have this meeting but do so quickly so that i can return to andor where is rand taking his time egwene said hes always been like that i have spoken to aviendha elayne said her bay horse shifting and snorting she spent last night with him but he wouldnt tell her what he intends this day he has mentioned demands egwene said watching the rulers gather with their retinues darlin sisnera king of tear was first he would support her for all the fact that he owed rand his crown the seanchan threat still bothered him deeply the middleaged man with a dark pointed beard was not particularly handsome but selfcomposed and sure of himself he bowed from horseback to egwene and she held out her ring he hesitated then dismounted and came forward bowing his head and kissing the ring the light illumine you mother i am glad to see you here darlin so long as your promise holds gateways to my homeland should the moment require it it will be done he bowed again eyeing a man riding up toward egwene from the other side gregorin steward of illian was darlins equal in many ways but not all rand had named darlin steward of tear but the high lords had asked for him to be crowned king gregorin remained merely a steward the tall man had lost weight recently his round facewith its customary illianer beardstarting to look sunken he didnt wait for egwene to prod him he swung from his horse and seized her hand executing a flourishing bow and a kiss to the ring im pleased the two of you could put aside differences to join me in this endeavor egwene said drawing their attention away from glares at one another the lord dragons intentions are troubling darlin said he chose me to lead tear because i opposed him when i felt it necessary i believe he will listen to reason if i present it to him gregorin snorted the lord dragon do be perfectly reasonable we do need to offer a good argument and i do think he will listen my keeper has some words for each of you egwene said please listen to what she has to say your cooperation will be remembered silviana rode forward and drew gregorin aside to speak to him there wasnt much of importance to say but egwene had feared these two would end up chipping at one another silvianas instruction was to keep them apart darlin regarded her with a discerning gaze he seemed to understand what she was doing but didnt complain as he mounted his horse you seem troubled king darlin she said some old rivalries run deeper than the oceans depths mother i can almost wonder if this meeting was the work of the dark one hoping that we would end up destroying one another and doing his work for him i understand egwene said perhaps it would be best if you advised your menagain if youve already done sothat there are to be no accidents this day a wise suggestion he bowed pulling back they were both with her as was elayne ghealdan would stand for rand if what elayne said about queen alliandre was true ghealdan wasnt so powerful that alliandre worried herthe borderlanders were another matter rand seemed to have won them over each of their flags flew over their respective armies and each ruler was in attendance save queen ethenielle who was in kandor trying to organize the refugees fleeing her homeland she had left a sizable contingent for this meetingincluding antol her eldest sonas if to state that what happened here was as important to kandors survival as fighting on the border kandor the first casualty of the last battle the entire country was said to be aflame would andor be next the two rivers steady egwene thought it felt awful to have to consider who was for whom but it was her duty to do so rand could not direct the last battle personally as he would undoubtedly wish to do his mission would be to fight the dark one he would have neither the presence of mind nor the time to act as a commanding general as well she intended to come from this meeting with the white tower acknowledged as leading the collected forces against the shadow and she would not give up responsibility for the seals how much could she trust this man rand had become he wasnt the rand shed grown up with he was more akin to the rand shed come to know out in the aiel waste only more confident and perhaps more cunning he had grown quite proficient at the game of houses none of these changes in him were terrible things assuming he could still be reasoned with is that the flag of arad doman she thought surprised it wasnt just the flag it was the kings flag indicating he was riding with those forces that had just arrived on the field had rodel ituralde finally ascended to the throne or had rand picked someone else the domani kings flag flew next to that of davram bashere uncle to the queen of saldaea light gawyn nudged his horse up beside hers that flag i see it egwene said ill have to pin down siuan have her sources mentioned who took the throne i was afraid the domani would ride into battle without a leader the domani i was talking about that she followed his eyes a new force was approaching moving with apparent haste under the banner of the red bull murandy egwene said curious roedran has finally decided to join the rest of the world the newly arrived murandians made more show than they probably deserved their apparel at least was pretty yellow and red tunics over mail brass helmets with wide brims the wide red belts bore the symbol of the charging bull they kept their distance from the andorans wrapping around behind the aiel forces and coming in from the northwest egwene looked toward rands camp still no sign of the dragon himself come she said nudging sifter into motion toward the murandian force gawyn fell in beside her and chubain brought a force of twenty soldiers as a guard roedran was a corpulent man swathed in red and gold she could practically hear the mans horse groaning with each step his thinning hair was more white than black and he watched her with an unexpectedly keen expression the king of murandy was little more than ruler of one city lugard but her reports indicated that this man wasnt doing a bad job of expanding his rule given a few years he might actually have a full kingdom to call his own roedran held up a meaty hand stopping his procession she reined in her horse and waited for him to approach her as would be customary he didnt gawyn muttered a curse egwene let a smile tug at the edges of her lips warders could be useful if only to express what she should not finally she nudged her horse forward so roedran looked her over youre the new amyrlin an andoran the amyrlin has no nationality egwene said coolly i am curious to find you here roedran when did the dragon extend an invitation to you he didnt roedran waved for a cupbearer to bring him some wine i thought it was high time murandy stopped being left out of events and through whose gateways did you arrive surely you didnt cross andor to reach here roedran hesitated you came from the south egwene said studying him andor elayne sent for you she did not send for me roedran snapped the bloody queen promised me if i supported her cause shed release a proclamation of intention promising not to invade murandy he hesitated besides ive been curious to see this false dragon everybody in the world seems to have taken leave of their senses regarding him you do know what this meeting is about dont you egwene said he waved a hand talking this man out of his conquering ways or something like that good enough egwene leaned forward i hear your rule is consolidating nicely and that lugard may actually have some real authority in murandy for once yes roedran said sitting up a bit straighten that is true egwene leaned forward further you re welcome she said softly then smiled she turned sifter and led her retinue away egwene gawyn said softly trotting his horse beside hers did you really just do that does he look troubled gawyn glanced over his shoulder very excellent gawyn continued riding for a moment then broke into a deep grin that was positively evil hes as boorishly rude as reports have made him out to be egwene said he can suffer a few nights spent wondering how the white tower has been pulling strings in his realm if im feeling particularly vengeful ill set up some good secrets for him to unearth now where is that sheepherder he has the audacity to demand that we she trailed off as she saw him coming rand strode across the browning grass of the field wearing red and gold a tremendous bundle hovered in the air beside him held up by weaves she could not see the grass greened at his feet it wasnt a large change where he trod the turf recovered spreading from him like a soft wave of light through opening shutters men stepped back horses stamped their hooves within minutes the entire ring of troops stood on grass that lived again how long had it been since shed seen a simple field of green egwene breathed out some of the gloom to the day had been lightened id give good coin to know how he does that she murmured under her breath a weave gawyn asked ive seen aes sedai make flowers bloom in winter i know of no weave that would be so extensive egwene said it feels so natural go see if you can find out how hes doing it maybe one of the aes sedai with ashaman warders will let the truth out gawyn nodded slipping away rand continued his walk trailed by that large floating bundle ashaman in black and an honor guard of aiel the aiel spurned regular ranks sweeping the land like a swarm fanning out even soldiers who followed rand shied back from the aiel for many of the older soldiers a wave of browns and tans like that meant death rand walked calmly purposefully the cloth bundle he carried with air began to unravel in front of him large swaths of canvas rippled in the wind before rand braiding with one another leaving long trails behind themselves wooden poles and metal stakes fell from inside them and rand caught those in unseen threads of air spinning them he never broke stride he didnt look at the maelstrom of cloth wood and iron as canvas rippled in front of him like fish from the depths small clods of soil erupted from the ground some soldiers jumped hes grown into quite the showman egwene thought as the poles spun and came down in the holes sweeping bands of cloth wrapped around them tying themselves in seconds a massive pavilion settled into place the dragon banner flapping from one end the banner with the ancient symbol of the aes sedai on the other rand didnt break stride as he reached the pavilion cloth sides parting for him you may each bring five he announced as he stepped inside silviana egwene said saerin romanda lelaine gawyn will be our fifth when he returns sitters behind suffered the decision in silence they couldnt complain about her taking her warder for protection or her keeper for support the other three shed chosen were widely considered among the most influential in the tower and together the four she brought included two aes sedai each from salidar and the white tower loyalists the other rulers allowed egwene to enter before them all understood that this confrontation was at its core between rand and egwene or rather the dragon and the amyrlin seat there were no chairs inside the pavilion though rand hung saidin globes of light at the corners and one of the ashaman deposited a small table at the center she did a quick count thirteen glowing globes rand stood facing her arms behind his back hand clasping his other forearm as had become his habit min stood at his side one hand on his arm mother he said nodding his head so he would pretend respect would he egwene nodded back lord dragon the other rulers and their small retinues filed in many doing so with timidity until elayne swept in the sorrow on her face lightening as rand smiled warmly at her the woolheaded woman was still impressed with rand pleased with how hed managed to bully everyone into coming here elayne considered it a matter of pride when he did well and you dont feel a small measure of pride egwene asked herself rand althor once simple village boy and your nearbetrothed now the most powerful man in the world you dont feel proud of what hes done perhaps a little the borderlanders entered led by king easar of shienar and there was nothing timid about them the domani were led by an older man that egwene did not know alsalam silviana whispered sounding surprised he has returned egwene frowned why hadnt any of her informants told her he had shown up light did rand know that the white tower had tried to take him into custody egwene herself had discovered that fact only a few days before buried in a pile of elaidas papers cadsuane entered and rand nodded to her as if giving permission she didnt bring five but neither did he seem to require her to be counted among egwenes five that struck her as a bothersome precedent perrin stepped in with his wife and they stayed to the side perrin folded his treetrunk arms wearing his new hammer at his belt he was far easier to read than rand was he was worried but he trusted rand nynaeve did too burn her she took her position near perrin and faile the aiel clan chiefs and wise ones entered in a large massrands bring only five probably meant that each clan chief could bring five some wise ones including sorilea and amys made their way to egwenes side of the tent light bless them egwene thought releasing a held breath rands eyes flickered toward the women and egwene caught a tightening of his lips he was surprised that all the aiel didnt back him each and every one king roedran of murandy was one of the last to enter the tent and egwene noticed something curious as he did several of rands ashaman narishma flinn naeffmoved in behind roedran others near rand looked as alert as cats who had seen a wolf wander by rand stepped over to the shorter wider man and looked down into his eyes roedran stuttered for a moment then started wiping his brow with a handkerchief rand continued to stare at him what is it roedran demanded youre the dragon reborn so they say i do not know that id have let you stop rand said raising a finger roedran quieted immediately light burn me rand said youre not him are you who roedran asked rand turned away from him waving his hand to make narishma and the others stand down they did so reluctantly i thought for certain rand said shaking his head where are you who roedran asked loudly almost squeaking rand ignored him the flaps to the pavilion had finally stilled everyone inside so rand said we are all here thank you for coming its not like we did have much of a bloody choice gregorin grumbled hed brought a handful of illianer nobility with him as his five all members of the council of nine we did be caught between you and the white tower itself light burn us you know by now rand continued that kandor has fallen and caemlyn has been taken by the shadow the last remnants of malkier are under assault at tarwins gap the end is upon us then why are we standing here rand althor demanded king paitar of arafel the aging man had only a thin ribbon of gray hair remaining on his head but he was still broadshouldered and intimidating let us put an end to this posturing and be to it man there is fighting to be done i promise you fighting paitar rand said softly all that you can stomach and then some three thousand years ago i met the dark ones forces in battle we had the wonders of the age of legends aes sedai who could do things that would make your mind reel terangreal that could enable people to fly and make them immune to blows we still barely won have you considered that we face the shadow in much the same state as it was then with forsaken who have not aged but we are not the same people not by far the tent fell silent flaps blew in the breeze what are you saying rand althor egwene said folding her arms that we are doomed im saying we need to plan rand said and present a unified attack that we did poorly last time and it nearly cost us the war we each thought we knew the best way to go he met egwenes eyes in those days every man and woman considered themselves to be the leader on the field an army of generals that is why we nearly lost that is what left us with the taint the breaking the madness i was as guilty of it as anyone perhaps the most guilty i will not have that happen again i will not save this world only to have it broken a second time i will not die for the nations of humanity only to have them turn upon one another the moment the last trolloc falls youre planning it light burn me i know that you are it would have been easy to miss the glances that gregorin and darlin shot at one another or the covetous way roedran watched elayne which nations would be broken by this conflict and which would step inout of altruismto help its neighbors how quickly would altruism become greed the chance to hold another throne many of the rulers here were decent people it took more than a decent person to hold that much power and not look afield even elayne had gobbled up another country when the opportunity presented itself she would do so again it was the nature of rulers the nature of nations in elaynes case it even seemed appropriate as cairhien would be better off beneath her rule than it had been how many would assume the same that they of course could rule betteror restore orderin another land nobody wants war egwene said drawing the crowds attention however i think what you are trying to do here is beyond your calling rand althor you cannot change human nature and you cannot bend the world to your whims let people live their lives and choose their own paths i will not egwene rand said there was a fire in his eyes like the one shed seen when he first sought to bring the aiel to his cause yes that emotion seemed very like randfrustration that people didnt see the world as clearly as he thought he did i dont see what else you can do egwene said would you appoint an emperor someone to rule over us all would you become a true tyrant rand althor he didnt snap back a retort he held out his hand to the side and one of his ashaman slipped a rolled paper into it rand took it and placed it on the table he used the power to unroll it and to keep it flat the oversized document was filled with tight cramped letters i call it the dragons peace rand said softly and it is one of the three things which i will require of you your payment to me in exchange for my life let me see that elayne reached for it and rand obviously let it go because she was able to snatch it off the table before any of the other surprised rulers it locks the borders of your nations to their current positions rand said arms behind his back again it forbids country from attacking country and it requires the opening of a great school in each capitalfully funded and with doors open to those who wish to learn it does more than that elayne said one finger to the document as she read attack another land or enter into a minor armed border dispute and the other nations of the world have an obligation to defend the country attacked light tariff restrictions to prevent the strangling of economies barriers on marriage between rulers of nations unless the two lines of rule are clearly divided provisions for stripping the land from a lord who starts a conflict rand you really expect us to sign this yes the outrage from the rulers was immediate though egwene stood calmly and shot a few glances at the other aes sedai they seemed troubled as well they should beand this was only part of rands price the rulers muttered each wanting a chance at the document but not wanting to shoulder in and look over elaynes shoulder fortunately rand had thought ahead and smaller versions of the document were distributed but there are very good reasons for conflict sometimes darlin said looking over his document such as creating a buffer between you and an aggressive neighbor or what if some people from our country do be living across the border gregorin added do we not have the mandate to step in and protect them if they do be oppressed or what if someone like the seanchan do claim land that is ours forbidding war do seem ridiculous i agree darlin said lord dragon we should have the mandate to defend land that is rightfully ours i egwene said cutting through the arguments am more interested to hear his other two requirements you know one of them rand said the seals egwene said signing this document would mean nothing to the white tower rand said apparently ignoring the comment i cant very well forbid all of you to influence the others that would be foolishness its already foolishness elayne said elayne was not feeling so proud of him any longer egwene thought and as long as there are political games to be played rand continued to egwene the aes sedai will master them in fact this document benefits you the white tower always has believed war to be as they say shortsighted instead i demand something else of you the seals i am their watcher in name only they were only just discovered and i possess them it is out of respect for your traditional title that i approached you about them first approached me you didnt make a request she said you didnt make a demand you came told me what you were going to do and walked away i have the seals he repeated and i will break them i wont allow anything not even you to come between me and protecting this world all around them arguments over the document continued rulers muttering with their confidants and neighbors egwene stepped forward facing rand across the small table the two of them ignored for the moment you wont break them if i stop you rand why would you want to stop me egwene give me a single reason why it would be a bad idea a single reason other than that it will let the dark one loose on the world he was not loose during the war of power rand said he could touch the world but the bore being opened will not loose him not immediately and what was the cost of letting him touch the world what are they now horrors terrors destruction you know what is happening to the land the dead walking the strange twisting of the pattern this is what happens with the seals only weakened what happens if we actually break them the light only knows it is a risk that must be taken i dont agree rand you dont know what releasing his seals will do you don t know if it might let him escape you dont know how close he was to getting out when the bore was last secured shattering those seals could destroy the world itself what if our only hope lies in the fact that hes hindered this time not completely free it wont work egwene you dont know that how can you he hesitated many things in life are uncertain so you dont know she said well i have been looking reading listening have you read the works of those who have studied this thought about it aes sedai speculation the only information we have rand open the dark ones prison and all could be lost we have to be more careful this is what the amyrlin seat is for this is part of why the white tower was founded in the first place he actually hesitated light he was thinking could she be getting through to him i dont like it egwene rand said softly if i go up against him and the seals are not broken my only choice will be to create another imperfect solution a patch even worse than the one last timebecause with the old weakened seals there ill just be spreading new plaster over deep cracks who knows how long the seals would last this time in a few centuries we could have this same fight all over again is that so bad egwene said at least its sure you sealed the bore last time you know how to do it we could end up with the taint again were ready for it this time no it wouldnt be ideal but rand do we really want to risk this risk the fate of every living being why not take the simple path the known path mend the seals again shore up the prison no egwene rand backed away light is this what its about you want saidin to be tainted again you aes sedai youre threatened by the idea of men who can channel undermining your authority rand althor dont you dare be that level of a fool he met her eyes the rulers seemed to be paying little attention to this conversation despite the fact that the world depended on it they pored over rands document muttering in outrage perhaps that was what he had intended to distract them with the document then pounce for the real fight slowly the rage melted from his face and he raised his hand to the side of his head light egwene you can still do it like the sister i never hadtie my mind in knots and have me raving at you and loving you at the same time at least im consistent she said they were now speaking very softly leaning across the table toward one another to the side perrin and nynaeve were probably close enough to hear and min had joined them gawyn had returned but he kept his distance cadsuane rounded the room looking in the other directiontoo pointedly she was listening in i am not making this argument in some fool hope to restore the taint egwene said you know im better than that this is about protecting humankind i cant believe you are willing to risk everything on a slender chance a slender chance rand said were talking about entering darkness instead of founding another age of legends we could have peace an end to suffering or we could have another breaking light egwene i dont know for certain if i could mend the seals or make new ones in the same way the dark one has to be ready for that plan and you have another one ive been telling it to you i break the seals to get rid of the old imperfect plug and try again in a new way the world itself is the cost of failure rand she thought a moment theres more here what arent you telling me rand looked hesitant and for a moment he seemed the child shed once caught sneaking bites of mistress cauthons pies with mat im going to kill him egwene who moridin the dark one she drew back in shock im sorry what did you im going to kill him rand said passionately leaning in im going to end the dark one we will never have true peace so long as he is there lurking ill rip open the prison ill enter it and ill face him ill build a new prison if i have to but first im going to try to end all of this protect the pattern the wheel for good light rand youre insane yes that is part of the price i have paid fortunately only a man with shaken wits would be daring enough to try this ill fight you rand she whispered i wont let you pull all of us into this listen to reason the white tower should be guiding you here ive known the white towers guidance egwene he replied in a box beaten each day the two locked eyes across the table nearby other arguments continued i dont mind signing this tenobia said it looks fine to me bah gregorin snarled you borderlanders never care anything for southern politics youll sign it well good for you i however wont chain my country to the wall curious easar said the calm man shook his head pure white topknot bobbing as i understand its not your country gregorin unless youre assuming that the lord dragon will die and that mattin stepaneos will not demand his throne back he may be willing for the lord dragon to wear the laurel crown but not you im sure isnt all of this meaningless alliandre asked the seanchan are our worry now arent they peace can never exist so long as they are there yes gregorin said the seanchan and those cursed whitecloaks we will sign it galad said somehow the lord captain commander of the children of the light had ended up holding the official copy of the document egwene didnt look at him it was hard not to stare she loved gawyn and not galad but well it was hard not to stare mayene will sign it as well berelain said i find the lord dragons will to be perfectly just of course youd sign it darlin sniffed my lord dragon this document seems designed to protect the interests of some nations more than others i want to hear what his third requirement is roedran said i dont care anything for talk of the seals that is aes sedai business he claimed there were three requirements and we have heard only two rand raised an eyebrow the third and final pricethe last thing you will pay me in exchange for my life on the slopes of shayol ghulis this i command your armies for the last battle utterly and completely you do as i say go where i say fight where i say this caused a larger eruption of arguments it was obviously the least outrageous of the three demands though it was impossible for reasons egwene had already determined the rulers treated it as an attack on their sovereignty gregorin glowered at rand through the din only maintaining the most threadbare respect amusing since he had the least authority of them all darlin shook his head and elaynes face was livid those on rands side argued back primarily the borderlanders theyre desperate egwene thought theyre being overrun they probably thought that if command were given to the dragon he would immediately march to the defense of the borderlands darlin and gregorin would never agree to that not with the seanchan breathing down their necks light what a mess egwene listened to the arguments hoping they would set rand on edge once they might have now he stood and watched arms folded behind his back his face became serene though she was increasingly certain that was a mask shed seen flashes of his temper inside rand certainly was more in control of himself now but he was by no means emotionless egwene actually found herself smiling for all of his complaints about aes sedai for all of his insistence that he wouldnt be controlled by them he was acting more and more like one of them himself she prepared to speak and take control but something in the tent changed a feeling to the air her eyes seemed drawn to rand sounds came from outside sounds she couldnt place a faint cracking sound what was he doing the arguments trailed off one by one the rulers turned toward him the sunlight outside dimmed and she was glad for those spheres of light he had made i need you rand said softly to them the land itself needs you you argue i knew that you would but we no longer have time for arguments know this you cannot talk me out of my designs you cannot make me obey you no force of arms nor weave of the one power can make me face the dark one for you i must do it of my own choice you would really toss the world for this lord dragon berelain asked egwene smiled the lightskirt suddenly didnt seem so certain of the side she had chosen i wont have to rand said youll sign it to fail to do so means death so its extortion darlin snapped no rand said smiling toward the sea folk who had said little as they stood near perrin they had simply read the document and nodded among themselves as if impressed no darlin its not extortion its an arrangement i have something you want something you need me my blood i will die weve all known this from the start the prophecies demand it as you wish this of me i will sell it to you in exchange for a legacy of peace to balance out the legacy of destruction i gave the world last time he scanned the meeting looking at each ruler in turn egwene felt his determination almost like a physical thing perhaps it was his taveren nature or perhaps it was just the weight of the moment a pressure rose inside the pavilion making it difficult to breathe hes going do it she thought theyll complain but theyll bend no egwene said loudly her voice breaking the air no rand althor we will not be bullied into signing your document into giving you sole control of this battle and youre an utter fool if you think i believe youd let the worldyour father your friends all those you love all of humanity be slaughtered by trollocs if we defy you he met her eyes and suddenly she wasnt certain light he wouldnt really refuse would he would he really sacrifice the world you dare call the lord dragon foolish demanded narishma the amyrlin is not to be spoken to that way silviana said stepping up beside egwene the arguments began again this time louder rand kept egwenes eyes and she saw the flush of anger rise in his face the shouting rose tension mounting unrest anger old hatreds flaring anew fueled by terror rand rested his hand on the sword he wore these daysthe one with the dragons on the scabbardhis other arm folded behind his back i will have my price egwene he growled require if you wish rand you are not the creator if you go to the last battle with this foolishness were all dead anyway if i fight you then there is a chance i can change your mind ever the white tower has been a spear at my throat rand snapped ever egwene and now you really have become one of them she met his stare inside however she was beginning to lose certainty what if these negotiations did break down would she really drive her soldiers to fight rands she felt as if she had tripped over a rock at the top of a cliff and was tipping toward the fall there had to be a way to stop this to salvage it rand started to turn away if he left the pavilion that would be the end of it rand she said he froze i will not budge egwene dont do this she said dont throw it all away it cannot be helped yes it can all you have to do is stop being such a lightburned woolheaded stubborn fool for once egwene drew herself back how could she have spoken to him as if they were back in emonds field at their beginning rand stared at her for a moment well you could certainly stop being a spoiled selfcertain unmitigated brat for once egwene he threw up his arms blood and ashes this was a waste of time he was very nearly right egwene didnt notice someone new entering the tent rand did however and he spun as the flaps parted and let in light he frowned at the interloper his frown died as soon as he saw the person who entered moiraine chapter a knack the pavilion grew quiet again perrin hated a racket and the peoples scents werent any better frustration anger fear terror much of it was directed at the woman standing just inside the entrance to the pavilion mat you blessed fool perrin thought breaking into a grin you did it you actually did it for the first time in a while thinking of mat made the colors swirl in his vision he saw mat on a horse riding along a dusty road tinkering with something he held perrin dismissed the image where had mat gotten to now why hadnt he come back with moiraine it didnt matter moiraine was back light moiraine perrin started toward her to give her an embrace but faile caught him by the sleeve he followed her eyes rand his face had grown pale he stumbled away from the table as if all else had been forgotten and pushed his way to moiraine he hesitantly reached out and touched her face by my mothers grave rand whispered then fell to his knees before her how moiraine smiled resting a hand on his shoulder the wheel weaves as the wheel wills rand have you forgotten that i not as you will dragon reborn she said gently not as any of us will perhaps one day it will weave itself out of existence i do not believe that day is today nor a day soon who is this woman roedran said and what is she blathering about i he cut off as something unseen flicked him on the side of the head causing him to jump perrin glanced at rand then noticed the smile on egwenes lips he caught the scent of her satisfaction despite all of the people in the pavilion nynaeve and min standing nearby smelled utterly shocked the light willing nynaeve would stay that way for a little while shouting at moiraine wouldnt help right now you havent answered my question rand said but i have moiraine replied fondly it just was not the answer you wanted rand knelt then threw his head back and laughed light moiraine you havent changed have you we all change day by day she replied then smiled me more than some lately stand up it is i who should be kneeling before you lord dragon we all should rand rose and stepped back to allow moiraine farther into the pavilion perrin caught another scent and smiled as thom merrilin slipped into the tent behind her the old gleeman winked at perrin moiraine egwene said stepping forward the white tower welcomes you back with open arms your service has not been forgotten hmm moiraine said yes i should think that having discovered a future amyrlin would reflect well upon me that is a relief as i believe i was on a path to stilling if not execution before things have changed obviously moiraine nodded mother she passed perrin and gave him a squeeze on the arm eyes twinkling one by one the borderlander rulers took swords in hands and bowed or curtsied toward her each one seemed to know her personally many of the others in the tent still looked baffled though darlin obviously knew who she was he was more thoughtful than confused moiraine hesitated beside nynaeve perrin couldnt catch nynaeves scent right then that seemed ominous to him oh light here it comes nynaeve enfolded moiraine in a powerful embrace moiraine stood for a moment smelling distinctly shocked hands out to the sides finally she returned the embrace in a somewhat maternal way patting nynaeve on the back nynaeve released her pulling back then wiped a tear from her eye dont you dare tell lan about this she growled i would not dream of it moiraine said moving on to stand in the center of the pavilion insufferable woman nynaeve grumbled as she wiped a tear from the other eye moiraine egwene said youve come at just the right time i have a knack for that well egwene continued as rand stepped back up to the table rand the dragon reborn has decided to hold this land for ransom to his demands refusing to do his duty unless we agree to his whims moiraine pursed her lips taking up the contract for the dragons peace as galad set it on the table for her she scanned it who is this woman roedran said and why do we would you stop that he raised a hand as if hed been smacked by a thread of air then glared at egwenehowever this time one of the nearby ashaman was the one who smelled satisfied nice shot grady perrin whispered thank you lord perrin grady would know her only by legend of course but tales of moiraine had spread among those who followed rand well egwene said and it shall come to pass that what men made shall be shattered moiraine whispered the shadow shall lie across the pattern of the age and the dark one shall once more lay his hand upon the world of man women shall weep and men quail as the nations of the earth are rent like rotting cloth neither shall anything stand nor abide the people shuffled their feet perrin looked questioningly at rand yet one shall be born to face the shadow moiraine said more loudly born once more as he was born before and shall be born again time without end the dragon shall be reborn and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth at his rebirth in sackcloth and ashes shall he clothe the people and he shall break the world again by his coming tearing apart all ties that bind like the unfettered dawn shall he blind us and burn us yet shall the dragon reborn confront the shadow at the last battle and his blood shall give us the light let tears flow o ye people of the world weep for your salvation aes sedai darlin said pardon but that is very ominous a knack at least it shall be a salvation moiraine said tell me your majesty that prophecy commands you to shed tears are you to weep because your salvation comes with such pain and worry or instead are you to weep for your salvation for the man who will suffer for you the only one we know for certain will not walk away from this fight she turned to rand these demands are unfair gregorin said he requires us to keep our borders as they are he shall slay his people with the sword of peace moiraine said and destroy them with the leaf its the karaethon cycle ive heard these words before the seals moiraine egwene said hes planning to break them he defies the authority of the amyrlin seat moiraine did not look surprised perrin suspected shed been listening outside before entering it was very like her oh egwene moiraine said have you forgotten the unstained tower breaks and bends knee to the forgotten sign egwene blushed there can be no health in us nor any good thing grow moiraine quoted for the land is one with the dragon reborn and he one with the land soul of fire heart of stone she looked to gregorin in pride he conquers forcing the proud to yield to the borderlanders he calls upon the mountains to kneel to the sea folk and the seas to give way to perrin then berelain and the very skies to bow to darlin pray that the heart of stone remembers tears then finally to elayne and the soul of fire love you cannot fight this none of you can i am sorry you think he came to this on his own she held up the document the pattern is balance it is not good nor evil not wisdom nor foolishness to the pattern these things matter not yet it will find balance the last age ended with a breaking and so the next one will begin with peaceeven if it must be shoved down your throats like medicine given to a screaming babe if i may speak an aes sedai wearing a brown shawl stepped forward you may rand said this is a wise document lord dragon the brown said she was a stout woman more direct of tone than perrin expected from a brown but i see an enormous flaw to it one that was raised earlier so long as the seanchan are exempt from it it will be meaningless there will be no peace so long as they conquer thats an issue elayne said arms folded but not the only one rand i see what youre trying to do and i love you for it that does not remove the fact that this document is fundamentally untenable for a peace treaty to work both sides must continue to wish for peace because of the benefits presented this grants no way to settle disputes they will arise they always do any document like this must give a way to settle such things you must set up a way to punish an infraction save for the other countries to enter allout war without that change little grievances will mount and build pressure over years until they explode as this is it all but requires the nations to fall upon the first that breaks the peace it doesnt stop them from setting up a puppet regime in the fallen kingdom or even in another kingdom over time i fear this treaty will be viewed as null what good is it if it protects only on paper the end result of this will be war massive overpowering war you will have peace for a time particularly while those who revere you live but for every year of peace you gain you will earn one of greater destruction once the thing falls apart rand rested his fingers on the document i will make peace with the seanchan we will add a provision if their ruler does not sign then the document is voided will you all agree to it then that fixes the lesser problem elayne said softly but not the larger one rand there is yet a greater issue here a new voice said perrin turned surprised aviendha she and the other aiel had not participated in the arguments theyd only watched perrin had almost forgotten they were there you too rand said come to walk on the shards of my dreams aviendha dont be a child rand althor the woman said striding up to place her finger on the document you have toh i left you out of it rand protested i trust you and all of the aiel the aiel arent in it easar said light how did we miss that it is an insult aviendha said perrin frowned she smelled very serious from any other aiel hed expect that sharp scent to be followed by a pulledup veil and a raised spear aviendha rand said smiling the others are about to hang me for putting them in it and you are angry for being left out i demand my boon of you she said this is it place the aiel in your document your dragons peace we will leave you otherwise you dont speak for all of them aviendha rand said you cant all of the tents wise ones stepped up behind aviendha as if in rhythm together rand blinked aviendha carries our honor sorilea said do not be foolish rand althor melaine added this is a thing of the women sarinde added we will not be satisfied until we are treated equally with the wetlanders is this thing too difficult for us amys asked do you insult us by implying we are weaker than the others youre all insane rand said do you realize that this would forbid you from fighting one another not from fighting aviendha said from fighting without cause war is your purpose rand said if you believe that rand althor she said voice cold i have trained you poorly indeed she speaks wisdom rhuarc said stepping up to the front of the crowd our purpose was to prepare for your need of us at this last battleour purpose was to be strong enough to be preserved we will need another purpose i have buried blood feuds for you rand althor i would not take them up again i have friends now that i would rather not kill madness rand said shaking his head all right ill put you in aviendha seemed satisfied but something bothered perrin he didnt understand the aiellight he didnt understand gaul who had been with him for so long still hed noticed that the aiel liked to be doing something even when they lounged they were alert when other men gamed or diced the aiel were often quietly doing something of use rand perrin said stepping up taking him by the arm a moment please rand hesitated then nodded to him and waved his hand were sealed off they cant hear us now what is this about well i just noticed something the aiel are like tools all right and tools that arent used grow rusty perrin said which is why they raid one another rand said rubbing his temple to keep up their skills that is why i exempted them light perrin i think this is going to be a disaster if we include them in this document i dont think you have a choice now perrin said the others will never sign it if the aiel are left out i dont know if theyll sign it anyway rand said he looked longingly at the sheet on the table it was such a beautiful dream perrin a dream of good for humanity i thought i had them right up until egwene called my bluff i thought i had them it was a good thing others couldnt smell rands emotions or everyone there would have known that hed never refuse to go against the dark one rand showed not a hint of it on his face but inside perrin knew he had been as nervous as a boy at his first shearing rand dont you see perrin said the solution rand frowned at him the aiel perrin said the tool that needs to be used a treaty that needs to be enforced rand hesitated then grinned widely youre a genius perrin so long as its about blacksmithing i suppose i know a thing or two but this this isnt about blacksmithing perrin of course it is perrin said how could rand not see that rand turned no doubt ending his weave he strode up to the document then held it up toward one of his clerks in the back of the pavilion i want two provisions added first this document is void if not signed by either the seanchan daughter of the nine moons or the empress second the aielall but the shaidoare to be written into the document as enforcers of the peace and mediators of disputes between nations any nation may call upon them if they feel abused and the aielnot enemy armieswill provide redress they can hunt criminals across national borders they are to be subject to the laws of the nations in which they reside at the time but they are not subjects of that nation he turned to elayne there is your enforcement elayne the way to keep your small pressures from building the aiel she asked skeptically will you agree to this rhuarc rand asked bael jheran the rest of you you claim to be left without purpose and perrin sees you as a tool that needs to be worked will you take this charge to prevent war to punish those who do wrong to work with the rulers of nations to see justice served justice as we see it rand althor rhuarc said or as they see it it will have to be according to the conscience of the aiel rand said if they call for you they will have to know that theyll receive your justice this will not work if the aiel simply become pawns your autonomy will be what makes this effective gregorin and darlin began to complain but rand silenced them with a look perrin nodded to himself arms folded their complaints were weaker now than they had been before he smelled thoughtfulness from many of them they see this as an opportunity he realized they view the aiel as savages and think theyll be easy to manipulate once rand is gone perrin grinned imagining their defeat should they attempt that course this is very sudden rhuarc said welcome to the dinner party elayne added still staring daggers at rand try the soup oddly she smelled proud strange woman i warn you rhuarc rand said you will need to change your ways the aiel will have to act together on these matters the chiefs and wise ones will need to hold council to make decisions together one clan cannot fight a battle while other clans disagree and fight for the other side we will speak of it rhuarc said nodding to the other aiel chiefs this will mean an end to the aiel a beginning as well rand said the aiel clan chiefs and the wise ones gathered separately to one side and spoke in soft voices aviendha lingered with rand staring away troubled perrin heard him whisper something so soft perrins ears barely made it out your dream now when you wake from this life we will be no more rands clerks smelling frantic came forward to begin working on the documents additions the woman cadsuane watched all events with a stern expression she smelled extremely proud add a provision rand said the aiel can call upon other nations to aid them in their enforcement if they decide that their own numbers will not be enough give formal methods by which nations can petition the aiel for redress or for permission to attack a foe the clerks nodded working harder you act as if this were settled egwene said eyes on rand oh it is far from that moiraine said rand i have some words for you are they words i will like he asked i suspect not tell me why do you need to command the armies yourself you will be traveling to shayol ghul where you will no doubt be unable to contact anyone somebody needs to be in command moiraine on this point i believe all would agree rand folded his arms behind his back smelling troubled i have taken responsibility for this people moiraine i want to see that theyre cared for that the brutalities of this battle are minimized i fear that is a poor reason to lead a battle moiraine said softly you do not fight to preserve your troops you fight to win this leader need not be you rand it should not be you i wont have this battle turn into a tangle moiraine he said if you could see the mistakes we made last time the confusion that can result when everyone thinks they are in control battle is turmoil but we still need an ultimate commander to make decisions to hold everything together what of the white tower romanda asked steppinghalf shoving her way up beside egwene we have the resources for efficient travel between battlefronts we are coolheaded in times that would crush others and we are trusted by all nations that last bit prompted a raised eyebrow from darlin the white tower does seem the optimal choice lord dragon tenobia added no rand said the amyrlin is many things but a leader of war i do not think it a wise choice egwene oddly said nothing perrin studied her hed have thought that shed jump at the chance to lead the war herself it should be one of us darlin said chosen from those who would go to battle here i suppose rand said so long as you all know who is in command i will cede this point you must meet my other demands however you still insist that you must break the seals egwene said do not worry egwene moiraine said smiling he is not going to break the seals rands face darkened egwene smiled you are going to break them moiraine said to egwene what of course im not you are the watcher of the seals mother moiraine said did you not hear what i said earlier it shall come to pass that what men made shall be shattered and the shadow shall lie across the pattern of the age and the dark one shall once more lay his hand upon the world of man it must happen egwene seemed troubled you have seen this have you not moiraine whispered what have you dreamed mother a knack egwene didnt respond at first what did you see moiraine pressed stepping closer to her his feet crunching egwene said staring moiraine in the eyes as he strode forward rands feet stepped on the shards of the dark ones prison i saw him in another dream hacking away at it to open it but i never actually saw him opening it moiraine the shards were there mother moiraine said the seals had been broken dreams are subject to interpretation you know the truth of this one it does need to be done and the seals are yours you will break them when the time is right rand lord dragon reborn it is time to give them to her i dont like this moiraine he said then not much has changed has it she asked lightly i believe you have often resisted doing what you are supposed to particularly when i am the one to point it out to you he paused for a moment then laughed reaching into the pocket of his coat he slipped out three discs of cuendillar each split by a sinuous line down the center he set them on the table how will she know the time he asked she will moiraine said egwene smelled skeptical and perrin didnt blame her moiraine always had believed in following the weave of the pattern and bowing to the wheels turnings perrin didnt see it that way he figured you made your own path and trusted in your own arms to do what needed to be done the pattern wasnt a thing to depend on egwene was aes sedai it seemed that she felt she should see it as moiraine did either that or she was willing to agree and just take those seals into her hands ill break them when i feel it must be done she said taking the seals you sign then rand took the document as the clerks protested the hastiness with which theyd had to work it now had several additions on the back one of the clerks cried out reaching for the sand but rand did something with the one power drying the ink instantly as he placed the document before egwene i will she said holding out a hand for a pen she read the provisions carefully the other sisters looking over her shoulders they nodded one at a time egwene put pen to paper and now the rest rand said turning to measure reactions light hes grown clever faile whispered beside perrin do you realize what he did what perrin said scratching his beard he brought with him all he knew would support him faile whispered the borderlanders who would sign practically anything to garner help for their homelands arad doman which he helped most recently the aiel well all right who knows what the aiel will do at a given time but the idea stands then he let egwene gather the others its genius perrin that way with her bringing this coalition against him all he really had to do was convince her once he swayed her to his side the others would look foolish to stand apart indeed as the rulers began to signberelain going first and most eagerlythose who had supported egwene started to fidget darlin stepped up and took the pen he hesitated for a moment then signed gregorin followed then the borderlanders each in turn followed by the king of arad doman even roedran who still seemed to find this entire thing a fiasco signed perrin found that curious he blusters a lot perrin said to faile but he knows this is good for his kingdom yes she said hes been acting a buffoon partially to throw everyone off make them dismiss him the document outlines current borders of nations to remain as they are faile said thats a huge boon to someone trying to stabilize his rule but but the seanchan faile said softly if rand persuades them does that allow them to keep the countries they have now the women who are damane are they allowed to slap one of those collars on any woman who passes their border the tent stilled perhaps faile had spoken more loudly than shed intended perrin sometimes had trouble remembering what ordinary people could and couldnt hear i will deal with the seanchan rand said he stood over the table watching as each ruler looked over the document spoke with the counselors theyd brought then signed how darlin asked they do not wish to make peace with you lord dragon i do think theyll make this document meaningless once we are done here rand said softly i will go to them they will sign and if they do not gregorin demanded rand rested his hand on the table fingers spread i may have to destroy them or at least their ability to make war in the near future the pavilion grew still could you do that darlin asked i m not certain rand admitted if i can it may leave me weakened in a time when i need all of my strength light it may be my only choice a terrible choice when i left them last time we cannot have them striking at our backs while we fight the shadow he shook his head and min stepped up to take his arm i will find a way to deal with them somehow ill find a way the signing progressed some did it with great flourish others in more casual fashion rand had perrin gawyn faile and gareth bryne sign as well he seemed to want anyone here who might rise to a position of leadership to have their names on the document finally only elayne remained rand held out the quill to her this is a difficult thing you ask of me rand elayne said arms folded golden hair gleaming in the light of his globes why had the sky gone dim outside rand didnt seem worried but perrin feared that the clouds had consumed the sky a dangerous sign if they now held sway where rand had once kept them back i know it is difficult rand said perhaps if i gave you something in return what the war rand said he turned to the rulers you wanted one of you to lead the last battle will you accept andor and its queen in this role too young darlin said too new no offense your majesty alsalam snorted youre one to talk darlin half the monarchs present have held their thrones for a year or less what of the borderlanders alliandre asked theyve fought against the blight all of their lives we are overrun paitar said he shook his head one of us cannot coordinate this andor is as good a choice as any andor is suffering an invasion of its own darlin noted you all are or soon will be rand said elayne trakand is a leader to her core she taught me much of what i know about leadership she has learned tactics from a great captain and im certain she will rely upon all the great captains for advice someone must lead will you all accept her in this position the others reluctantly nodded agreement rand turned to elayne all right rand she said ill do this and i will sign but you had better find a way to deal with the seanchan i want to see their rulers name on this document none of us will be safe until its there what of the women held by the seanchan rhuarc asked i will admit rand althor our intention was to declare a blood feud with these invaders the moment more pressing battles were won if their ruler signs it rand said i will ask about trading for goods to retrieve those channelers they have stolen i will try to persuade them to release the lands they hold and return to their own country what if they refuse egwene asked shaking her head will you let them sign it without giving on those points thousands are enslaved rand we cannot defeat them aviendha said speaking softly perrin eyed her she smelled frustrated but determined if we go to war with them we will fall aviendha is right amys said the aiel will not fight the seanchan rhuarc startled looked back and forth between the two they have done horrible things rand said but so far the lands they have taken have benefited from strong leadership if forced to it i am content to allow them the lands they have so long as they do not spread further as for the women what is done is done let us worry about the world itself first then do what we can for those held captive elayne held the document for a moment perhaps for the drama of it then bent down and added her name to the bottom with a flourish it is done moiraine said as rand picked up the document you will have peace this time lord dragon we must survive first he said holding the document with reverence i will leave you to make your battle preparations i need to complete some tasks seanchan included before i travel to shayol ghul i do have a request for you however there is a dear friend who needs us angry lightning blistered the clouded sky despite the shade sweat lined lans neck matting his hair underneath his helmet hed not worn one in years much of his time with moiraine had required them to be nondescript and helmets were anything but how how bad is it andere grimaced holding his side and leaning back against a rock lan looked to the battle the shadowspawn were amassing again the monsters almost seemed to blend and shift together one enormous dark force of howling miasmic hatred as thick as the airwhich seemed to hold in the heat and the humidity like a merchant hoarding fine rugs its bad lan said knew it would be andere said breathing in and out quickly blood seeping between his fingers nazar gone lan said the whitehaired man had gone down in the same setto that had nearly taken andere lans rescue had not been quick enough i saw him gut a trolloc as it killed him may the last embrace of the mother andere spasmed in pain may the may the last embrace of the mother welcome you home lan said softly dont look at me that way lan andere said we all knew what this was going to be when we when we joined you that is why i tried to stop you andere scowled i peace andere lan said rising what i wished was selfish i came to die for malkier i have no right to deny that privilege to others lord mandragoran prince kaisel rode up his oncefine armor bloodstained and dented the kandori prince still looked too young for this battle but hed proven himself to be as coolheaded as any grizzled veteran theyre forming up again lan walked across the rocky ground to where a groom held mandarb the black stallion bore cuts on his flanks from trolloc weapons thank the light they were superficial lan rested a hand on the horses neck as mandarb snorted nearby his standardbearer a bald man named jophil raised the flag of malkier the golden crane this was his fifth standardbearer since yesterday lans forces had seized the gap with their initial charge shoving the shadowspawn back before they were able to emerge into the valley that was more than lan had expected the gap was a long narrow piece of rocky ground nestled between craggy rises and peaks holding this position required nothing clever you stood you died and you killedas long as you could lan commanded a cavalry it wasnt ideal for this kind of work cavalries did best where they could spread out and had room to chargebut the passage through tarwins gap was narrow enough that only a small number of trollocs could come through at once that gave lan a chance at least it was more difficult for the trollocs to take advantage of their superior numbers they would have to pay a butchers bill for every yard they gained trolloc carcasses had formed an almost furlike blanket leading through the canyon each time the creatures tried to push through the gorge lans men had resisted them with lances and polearms swords and arrows eventually slaughtering thousands and leaving them heaped for their fellows to climb over but each clash similarly reduced lans numbers each assault forced his men to withdraw a little farther toward the mouth of the gap they were less than a hundred feet from it now lan felt the fatigue pressing deep into his bones our forces lan asked prince kaisel maybe six thousand still able to ride dai shan less than half of what theyd started with a day before tell them to mount up kaisel looked shocked were going to retreat lan turned to the lad kaisel paled lan had been told that his gaze could unnerve any man moiraine had liked to joke that he could outstare rocks and had the patience of an oak well he didnt feel as sure of himself as people thought but this boy should have known better than to ask if they were retreating of course lan said and then were going to attack attack kaisel said we are on the defensive theyll sweep us out lan said pulling himself into mandarbs saddle were exhausted worn out and nearly broken if we stand here and let them come at us again well fall without a whimper lan knew an ending when he saw one pass these orders lan said to prince kaisel we will slowly pull out of the pass you have the rest of the troops assemble on the plain mounted and ready to attack the shadowspawn as they come out of the gap a charge will do great damage they wont know what hit them wont we be surrounded and overrun if we leave the pass kaisel asked this is the best we can do with the resources we have and then and then they eventually break through slice our force into pieces and overrun us kaisel sat for a moment then nodded again lan was impressed hed assumed this boy had come with him to find the glory of battle to fight at the side of dai shan and sweep their enemies away but no kaisel was a borderlander to the core he hadnt come for glory hed come because hed had to good lad give the order now the men will be glad to get back on their horses again too many of them had been forced to fight on foot because of the lack of maneuverability in the narrow confines kaisel gave the orders and those orders burned through lans men like an autumn fire lan saw andere being helped into his saddle by bulen andere lan said heeling mandarb toward him you are in no condition to ride go join the wounded at the back camp so i lie back there and let the trollocs butcher me after finishing you lot andere leaned forward in the saddle teetering slightly and bulen looked up with concern andere waved him off and forced himself upright weve already moved the mountain lan lets budge this feather and be through with it lan could offer no argument he called the retreat to the men ahead of him in the pass his remaining men bunched around him slowly backing out toward the plain the trollocs hooted and yelled in excitement they knew that once they were free of the walls that restricted their movement they would win this fight easily lan and his small force left the narrow confines of the gap those on foot running toward their horses tethered near the mouth of the canyon the trollocsfor onceneeded no push from the myrddraal to charge their footfalls were a low rumble on the stony ground several hundred yards out of the gap lan slowed mandarb and turned andere brought his horse up beside lans with difficulty and they were joined by the other riders who formed long lines of cavalry bulen cantered up to the other side of lan the storm of shadowspawn neared the mouth of the gap a charging force of thousands of trollocs that would soon burst out into the open and try to consume them lans forces were silently lined up around him many were old men the last remnants of their fallen kingdom this force that had managed to plug the narrow gap now seemed tiny on the much larger plain bulen lan said yes lord mandragoran you claim to have failed me years ago yes my lord it any failing on your part is forgotten lan said eyes forward i am proud to have given you your hadoru kaisel rode up nodding to lan we are ready dai shan this is for the best andere said grimacing still holding to his wound barely able to remain in the saddle it is what must be lan said not an argument not exactly no andere said it is more than that lan malkier is like a tree that lost its roots to whiteworms the branches withering slowly id rather be burned away in a flash id rather charge bulen said voice growing firm id rather charge now than let them overrun us let us die on the attack with swords pointed home lan nodded turning and raising his sword high above his head he gave no speeches he had given those already the men knew what this was one more charge while they still had some strength would mean something fewer shadowspawn to flood into civilized lands fewer trollocs to kill those who could not fight back the enemy seemed endless a slavering rampaging horde without battle line or discipline anger destruction incarnate thousands upon thousands of them they came forward like floodwaters suddenly released surging out of the canyon lans little force was but a pebble before them the men silently raised their swords to him a final salute now lan yelled now as they begin to spread out it will do the most damage lan kicked mandarb forward leading the way andere galloped beside lan clinging to his pommel with both hands he didnt try to raise a weapon hed have fallen from his saddle if he had nynaeve was too far away for lan to feel much of her through the bond but sometimes very powerful emotions could stand out despite the distance he tried to project confidence in case it reached her pride in his men love for her he wished deeply for those to be the last things she remembered of him my arm will be the sword hooves clattered on the ground the trollocs ahead hooted in delight realizing that their prey had transformed a retreat into a charge of men rushing right into their grasp my breast itself a shield lan could hear a voice his fathers voice speaking these words that was foolish of course lan had been a baby when malkier had fallen to defend the seven towers he had never seen the seven towers stand against the blight hed only heard stories to hold back the darkness the horses hooves were becoming a thunder so loud louder than hed have thought possible he held himself straight sword out i will stand when all others fall the oncoming trollocs leveled spears as the distance between the two opposing forces narrowed al chalidholara malkier for my sweet land malkier it was the oath a malkieri soldier took during their first posting to the border lan had never spoken it he did so now in his heart al chalidholara malkier lan screamed lances set light but those hoofbeats were loud could six thousand make so much noise he turned to look at those behind him at least ten thousand rode there what he pressed mandarb forward through his surprise forward the golden crane voices shouts screams of power and joy the air ahead to the left split with a sudden vertical slash a gateway three dozen paces wideas large as lan had ever seenopened as if into the sun itself from the other side the brightness spilled out exploded out charging men in full armor burst from the gateway falling into place at lans flank they flew the flag of arafel more gateways three then four then a dozen each broke the field in coordination charging horsemen bursting forth with lances leveled flying the flags of saldaea shienar kandor in seconds his charge of six thousand had become a hundred thousand trollocs in the front lines screamed and some of them stopped running some held steady spears angled to impale oncoming horses bunching up behind themnot being able to see clearly what was happening in frontother enraged hordes pushed eagerly forward waving large swords with scythelike blades and doublebitted battleaxes those trollocs at the front holding spears exploded from somewhere behind lan ashaman began to send weaves to rip the earth completely destroying the front ranks of trollocs as the carcasses collapsed to the ground the middle ranks found themselves completely exposed facing a storm of hooves swords and lances lan hit swinging crashing mandarb through the snarling trollocs andere was laughing back you fool lan yelled to him as he lashed out at the nearby trollocs direct the ashaman to our wounded have them protect the camp i want to see you smile lan andere shouted clinging to his horses saddle show more emotion than a stone for once surely this deserves it lan looked at the battle hed never thought to win seeing a last stand instead become a promising fight and couldnt help himself he didnt just smile he laughed andere obeyed his order riding off to seek healing and organize the back lines jophil lan called raise my banner high malkier lives on this day chapter into the thick of it elayne stepped out of the pavilion after the meetingand entered a grove of a dozen or so trees and not just any trees they were towering healthy hugelimbed beautiful trees hundreds of feet tall with massive trunks the way she froze and gaped would have been embarrassing if everyone else hadnt been doing the same she looked to the side where egwene stood mouth open as she stared up into the huge trees the sun still shone above but the green leaves shaded the area explaining why the light had dimmed inside the tent these trees perrin said stepping forward and resting his hand on the thick ribbed bark ive seen great trees like this before inside a stedding elayne embraced the source the glow of saidar was there a warmth alongside that of the sun she breathed in the power and was amused to notice that most of the women who could channel had done as she had the moment a stedding was mentioned well whatever rand is now egwene said folding her arms he cant just make stedding appear she seemed to find the thought comforting where did he go elayne asked he strolled out there perrin said waving toward the trees and vanished people were walking among the massive trunks soldiers from the various camps staring upward she heard a shienaran talking to lord agelmar close by we watched them grow my lord they burst from the ground it took less than five minutes for them to become so tall i swear it my lord or may i never draw blade again all right elayne said releasing the source lets begin nations are burning maps we need maps the other rulers turned toward her in the meeting with rand standing there few of them had objected to her being chosen to lead them that was how it could be around him a person was swept up in the tides of rands will things seemed so logical when he spoke of them many now looked displeased to have her put above them best to give them no time to dwell on it where is master norry she said to dyelin could he have i have maps your majesty gareth bryne said as he left the pavilion siuan at his side he seemed grayer than she remembered him he wore a stiff white coat and trousers the breast marked with the flame of tar valon he bowed in respect but did not step too close his uniform made his allegiance plain as did siuans protective hand on his arm elayne remembered him standing with that same quiet expression behind her mother never presuming always protecting the queen that queen had put him out to pasture that event hadnt been elaynes fault but she could read the breached trust in brynes face elayne could not change what had come and gone she could look only to the future if you have maps of this area and the potential battlefields presented to us lord bryne we would love to see them i would like maps for the area between here and caemlyn a detailed map of kandor and your best maps of the other borderland areas to the rulers she continued gather your commanders and advisors we must meet immediately with the other great captains to discuss our next course of action it didnt take long though the confusion was pervasive as two dozen different factions set to work servants pulled open the sides of the pavilion and elayne ordered sumeko to gather kinswomen and guards to fetch tables and some chairs through a gateway from her camp elayne also sent for specific reports of what was happening at the gap where rand had asked the bulk of the borderlander armies to go and rescue lan the rulers and great captains had remained behind for the planning shortly elayne and egwene stood surveying brynes detailed maps which had been spread out across four tables the rulers stood back and allowed the commanders to deliberate this is good work bryne lord agelmar said the shienaran was one of the four remaining great captains bryne was another the final two great captainsdavram bashere and rodel ituraldestood side by side at the end of another table making corrections to a map of the western borderlands ituralde had bags under his eyes and his hands sometimes shook from what elayne had heard he had suffered quite an ordeal in maradon having been rescued only very recently she was surprised he was here actually all right elayne said to the assembly we must fight but how where large forces of shadowspawn have invaded three locations bryne said caemlyn kandor and tarwins gap the gap should not be abandoned assuming our armies are enough to help lord mandragoran stabilize there the likely result of our push there today will be the shadowspawn pulling back into the pass keeping the enemy plugged up there is an unsuitable task for the malkieri heavy cavalry alone perhaps we would best send him some pike companies if he continues to plug that breach we can devote the majority of our forces to combat in andor and kandor agelmar nodded yes that should be viable if we give dai shan the proper support but we cannot risk letting shienar become overrun as kandor was if they push out of the gap we are prepared for an extended battle lord easar said kandors resistance and lans fight at the gap have given us the time we need our people are pulling into our fortresses we can hold even if we lose the gap brave words your majesty gareth bryne said but it would be best if we did not have to test the shienarans in that way let us plan to hold the gap with whatever force it takes to do so and caemlyn elayne asked ituralde nodded an enemy force that deep behind our lines with a waygate to use for reinforcements that is trouble early reports from this morning elayne said indicate theyre staying put for the time being they burned large quarters of the city but left other sections aloneand now that they have the city the trollocs have been set to work smothering the flames they will have to leave eventually bryne said but it will be better if we can flush them out sooner rather than later why not consider a siege agelmar asked i think the bulk of our armies should go to kandor i would not let the throne of clouds and the three halls of trade fall as did the seven towers kandor already has fallen prince antol said softly the great captains looked at the eldest son of the kandori queen a tall man he had a silent way about him now he spoke boldly my mother fights for our country he said but it is a fight of vengeance and redemption kandor burns and it rips my heart to know it but we cannot stop that give andor your greatest attention it is too tactically important to ignore and i would not see another land fall as mine has the others nodded wise advice highness bashere said thank you also do not forget shayol ghul rhuarc said from the periphery where he stood alongside perrin some aes sedai and several other aiel chiefs the great captains turned toward rhuarc as if having forgotten he was there the caracarn soon will assault shayol ghul rhuarc said he will need spears at his back when he does so he will have them elayne said though that means four battlefronts shayol ghul tarwins gap kandor and caemlyn let us focus on caemlyn first ituralde said i dont like the idea of a siege there we need to flush the trollocs out if we simply besiege them it gives them more time to reinforce their numbers through that waygate we have to take them out now on our terms agelmar nodded with a grunt looking at the map of caemlyn an aide had put on the table can we stanch that flow retake the waygate ive tried elayne said this morning we sent three separate forces through a gateway into the basement with the waygate but the shadow is prepared and entrenched none of the forces returned i dont know if we can take the waygate back or even destroy it what if we tried from the other side agelmar asked the other side elayne asked you mean from inside the ways agelmar nodded nobody travels the ways ituralde said aghast the trollocs do agelmar said ive been through them perrin said approaching the table and im sorry my lords but i dont think that taking the waygate from the other side would work from what i understand we couldnt destroy iteven with the one power and we couldnt hold it inside not with the black wind in there our best choice is to somehow get those trollocs out of caemlyn and then hold this side of the waygate if it is properly guarded the shadow would never be able to use it against us very well elayne said we will consider other options though it occurs to me that we should send to the black tower for their ashaman also how many are there perrin cleared his throat i think you might want to be careful about that place your majesty somethings going on there elayne frowned something i dont know perrin said i spoke to rand about it and he was worried and said he was going to investigate anyway just be careful im always careful elayne said absently so how do we get those trollocs out of caemlyn perhaps we can hide a large assault force in braem wood its here almost fifty leagues north of caemlyn bryne pointed at the map if a smaller company of soldiers were to go up to the city gates and get the trollocs to chase them back to the wood as bait in the trap i always worried that an invading army would use the wood for cover as a base for attacking the city i never thought id be considering the same option myself interesting agelmar said studying a map of the terrain around caemlyn that seems like a solid prospect but what of kandor bashere asked the prince is right that the country is beyond rescue but we cannot simply let the trollocs pour out into other lands ituralde scratched at his chin this entire matter is going to be difficult three trolloc armies with us forced to divide our attention between them yes more and more i realize that the right move is to focus on one of them and set delaying forces against the other two the shadows army at caemlyn is likely the smallest agelmar said as the size of the waygate has restricted their entry into the city yes bashere agreed our chance for a quick victory on one of the battlefronts is best at caemlyn we should strike hard there with the largest of our assault forces if we can win in andor it will reduce the number of fronts we have to fight onand that will be extremely advantageous yes elayne said we reinforce lan but tell him that his job will be to hold there as long as he can we place a second force at the border of kandor with the purpose of delaying there as wellperhaps a slow withdrawal as conditions dictate while those two fronts are held we can focus our true attentionand our largest armyat breaking the trollocs in caemlyn good agelmar said i like it but what force do we place in kandor what army can slow the trollocs but wont require a large commitment of troops the white tower elayne asked if we send the aes sedai to kandor they can slow the trollocs advance across the border that will let the rest of us concentrate on caemlyn yes bryne said i like it and what of the fourth battlefront ituralde asked shayol ghul does anyone know what the lord dragon plans there nobody spoke the aiel will see to his needs amys said from beside the clan chiefs you neednt worry about us make your battle plans and we will make ours no elayne said elayne aviendha said we this is precisely what rand wished to avoid elayne said forcefully the aiel will work with the rest of us the battle at shayol ghul could be the most important of all i wont have one group presuming to keep to themselves and fight alone youll accept our help and she added to herself our direction the aiel were excellent warriors but there were some things they just wouldnt admit the usefulness of cavalry for one the aiel obviously did not like the prospect of wetlander command they bristled eyes narrowing the aiel are excellent irregulars bryne said looking to them i faced you on the blood snow and i know how deadly you can be however if the lord dragon attacks shayol ghul we will likely need to seize the valley and then hold it for as long as it takes him to battle with the dark one i dont know how long that will take but it could take hours days tell me have you ever had to entrench and fight a protracted defensive war we will do what needs to be done rhuarc said rhuarc elayne said you yourselves insisted on signing the dragons peace you yourselves insisted that you be part of our coalition i expect you to live up to your word you will do as you are told brynes and ituraldes questions had set them off but being told directly what to do made them back down rhuarc nodded of course he said i have toh meet it by listening elayne said and offering your opinion if were going to fight on four different fronts at once well need a lot of coordination she looked at the gathered generals it occurs to me we have four battlefronts and four great captains bashere nodded no coincidence that well it might be one there are no coincidences highness bashere said if ive learned one thing traveling with the lord dragon that is it four of us four battlefronts we each take one with queen elayne coordinating among us and overseeing the war effort as a whole i will go to the malkieri agelmar said most of the borderlanders fight there now what of kandor elayne said if the aes sedai are to fight there bryne said so will i my place is with the white tower he doesnt want to fight in andor elayne thought he doesnt want to fight alongside me he wishes the break to be clean who comes to andor with me then ill go bashere said and i to shayol ghul then ituralde said nodding to fight alongside aiel a day i never thought id see in truth good elayne said pulling over a chair then lets dig into the thick of it and get to details we need a central location for me to work from and caemlyn is lost for now i will use merrilor it is central and has plenty of room to move troops and supplies around in perrin do you think you could take charge of the logistics of this camp set up a traveling ground and organize the channelers to help with communications and supply operations perrin nodded the rest of you she said lets get to dividing the forces in detail and fleshing out the plans we need a firm idea of how we are going to push those trollocs out of caemlyn so we can fight them on even ground hours later elayne stepped from the pavilion her mind spinning with details of tactics supply needs and troop placements when she blinked she could see maps in her minds eye covered with gareth brynes cramped notations the others from the meeting began trailing away to their separate camps to begin executing their battle plans the dimming sky had required lanterns to be set up around the pavilion she vaguely remembered both lunch and dinner being brought to the meeting shed eaten hadnt she there had simply been so much to do she nodded to those rulers who passed her giving farewells most of the initial planning details had been worked out on the morrow elayne would take her troops to andor and begin the first leg of the counterattack against the shadow the ground here was now soft and springy with deep green grass rands influence lingered though he had departed as elayne inspected those towering trees gareth bryne stepped up beside her she turned surprised he hadnt left the pavilion already the only ones still here now were the servants and elaynes guards lord bryne she asked i just wanted to say that im proud bryne told her softly you did well in there i had hardly anything to add you added leadership bryne said you arent a general elayne and nobody expects you to be one but when tenobia complained about saldaea being left exposed you were the one who diverted her back to what matters tensions are high but you kept us together smoothed over bad feelings prevented us from snapping at one another good work your majesty very good work she grinned light but it was hard not to positively beam at his words he wasnt her father but in many ways he was as close to one as she had thank you and bryne the crown apologizes for not a word of that he said the wheel weaves as it wills i dont blame andor for what happened to me he hesitated im still going to fight together with the white tower elayne i understand he bowed to her and strode off toward egwenes section of camp birgitte stepped up to elayne back to our camp then the woman asked i elayne hesitated hearing something a faint sound yet somehow deep and powerful she frowned walking toward it holding up a hand to still birgitte as she started to ask what was happening the two of them rounded the pavilion crossing green grass and blossoming mornings breath walking toward the sound which grew stronger and stronger a song a beautiful song unlike any she had ever heard that made her tremble with its striking sonority it washed over her enveloped her vibrated through her a joyful song a song of awe and wonder though she could not understand the words she approached a group of towering creatures like trees themselves standing with their hands on the gnarled trunks of the trees rand had grown their eyes closed three dozen ogier of various ages from those with eyebrows as white as new snow to those as young as loial he stood there with them a smile raising the sides of his mouth as he sang perrin arms folded stood nearby with his wife your talk of going to the ashaman had me thinkingif we need allies what about the ogier i was going to see if i could find loial but before i could set out i found them already here among these trees elayne nodded listening to the ogier song reach its climax then fade the ogier bowing their heads for a moment all was peaceful finally an ancient ogier opened his eyes and turned toward elayne his white beard reached low on his chest below the white mustaches that drooped on either side of his mouth he stepped forward other ancients both male and female joining him with them came loial you are the queen the ancient ogier said bowing to her the one who leads this journey i am haman son of dal son of morel we have come to lend our axes to your fight i am pleased elayne said nodding to him three dozen ogier will add strength to our battle three dozen young one haman laughed a rumbling laugh the great stump did not meet did not debate this long time to send you three dozen of our numbers the ogier will fight alongside humans all of us every one of us who can hold an axe or long knife wonderful elayne said i will put you to good use an older ogier woman shook her head so hasty so quick know this young one there were some who would have abandoned you and the world to the shadow elayne blinked in shock you would have actually done it just left us alone to fight some argued for it haman said i myself took that position the woman said i made the argument though i did not truly believe it was right what loial asked stumbling forward this seemed news to him you didnt the woman looked to him trees will not grow if the dark one claims this world loial looked surprised but why did you an argument must have opposition if it is to prove itself my son she said one who argues truly learns the depth of his commitment through adversity did you not learn that trees grow roots most strongly when winds blow through them she shook her head though she did seem fond that is not to say you should have left the stedding when you did not alone fortunately that has been taken care of taken care of perrin asked loial blushed well you see perrin i am married now you didnt mention this earlier everything has come so quickly i am married to erith though you see shes just over there did you hear her singing isnt her song beautiful being married is not so bad perrin why didnt you tell me it was not so bad i think i am rather fond of it i am pleased for you loial elayne cut in ogier could talk quite long on tangents if one was not careful and thankful to all of you for joining us it is worth the price perhaps haman said just to see these trees in all my life men have only cut great trees to see someone growing them instead we made the correct decision yes yes we did the others will need to see this loial waved to perrin apparently wanting to catch up allow me to borrow him for a moment loial elayne said steering perrin toward the center of the grove faile and birgitte joined her and loial waited behind he seemed distracted by the mighty trees i have a duty i want to assign you elayne said softly to perrin losing caemlyn threatens to send our armies into a supply crisis despite complaints of food prices we had been keeping everyone fed as well as accumulating stores for the battle ahead those stores are now gone what of cairhien perrin asked it still has some food elayne said as do the white tower and tear baerlon has good supplies of metals and powderi need to find what we can draw from the other nations and discover their food situation it will be a massive task to coordinate stores and rations for all the armies id like one person in charge of it all you were thinking of me perrin said yes im sorry perrin said elayne rand needs me rand needs us all he needs me more perrin said min saw it he said without me at the last battle hell die besides i have a few fights to finish ill do it faile said elayne turned toward her frowning it is my duty to manage the affairs of my husbands army faile said you are his liege lady your majesty so your needs are his needs if andor is to command the last battle then the two rivers will see it fed give me access to gateways large enough for wagons to drive through give me troops to protect my movements and give me access to the quartermaster records of anyone i want i will see it done it was logical and rational but not what elayne needed how far did she trust this woman faile had proven herself deft at politics that was useful but did she really consider herself part of andor elayne studied the woman there is nobody better you can trust with this task elayne perrin said faile will see it done perrin elayne said there is a different matter involved in this may we speak privately for a moment ill just tell her what it is when were done your majesty perrin said i dont keep secrets from my wife faile smiled elayne eyed the two of them then sighed softly egwene came to me during our battle preparations there is a certain item of importance to the last battle that she needs to be delivered the horn of valere perrin said you still have it i hope we do in the tower hidden we moved it from the strongroom none too quickly last night that room was broken into i know only because of certain wards we set the shadow knows we have the horn perrin and the dark ones minions are looking for it they cant use it its tied to mat until he dies but if the shadows minions can capture it he can keep mat from using it or worsekill him then blow it themselves you want to mask moving it faile said using the supply runs to hide where youre taking it wed rather just give it to mat straight out elayne said but he can be difficult sometimes i had hoped he would be here at this meeting hes in ebou dar perrin said doing something with the seanchan he told you elayne asked not exactly perrin said looking uncomfortable we have some kind of connection i sometimes see where he is and what hes doing that man elayne said is never where he needs to be and yet perrin said he always arrives there eventually the seanchan are the enemy elayne said mat doesnt seem to understand that considering what hes done light i hope that man isnt putting himself in trouble somehow i will do this faile said ill care for the horn of valere ill see it gets to mat guard it no offense to either of you elayne said but i am hesitant to trust this to someone i dont know well that is why i came to you perrin thats going to be a problem elayne perrin said if they really are watching for the horn then theyll expect you and egwene to give it to someone you know well choose faile there is nobody i trust more than her but she wont be suspected as she has no direct relationship with the white tower elayne nodded slowly very well ill send word to you on how it will be delivered for now begin running supplies to establish precedent too many people know about the horn after we give it to you i will send five suspect envoys from the white tower and seed the right rumors we hope that the shadow will assume the horn is being carried by one of those envoys i want it to be where nobody expects at least until we can put it into matrims hands four battlefronts lord mandragoran bulen repeated thats what the messengers are saying caemlyn shayol ghul kandor and here they want to try to bottle up the trollocs here and in kandor while trying hard to defeat those in andor first lan grunted guiding mandarb around the reeking heap of dead trollocs the carcasses served as a bulwark now that his five ashaman had pushed them up into mounds like dark bloody hills before the blight where the shadowspawn gathered the stench was horrible of course many of the guards he passed in his rounds had thrown sprigleaf onto their fires to cover up the smell evening approached bringing its most dangerous hours fortunately those black clouds above made nights so dark that trollocs had trouble seeing anything dusk however was a time of strength to thema time when the eyes of humans were hampered but the eyes of shadowspawn were not the power of the united borderlander attack had pushed the trollocs back toward the mouth of the gap lan was getting reinforced by the hour with pikemen and other foot to help him hold position all in all it looked far better here now than it had just a day before still grim though if what bulen said was right his army would be stationed here as a stalling force that meant fewer troops for him than he would have liked he could not fault the tactics presented however lan passed into the area where the shienaran lancers cared for their horses a figure emerged from them and rode up beside lan king easar was a compact man with a white topknot recently arrived from the field of merrilor following a long day making battle plans lan began a horseback bow but stopped as king easar bowed to him your majesty lan asked agelmar has brought his plans for this battlefront dai shan king easar said falling in beside him he would like to go over them with us it is important that you are there we fight beneath the banner of malkier we all agreed to it tenobia lan asked genuinely surprised in her case a little encouragement was required she came around i also have word that queen ethenielle will leave kandor and come here the borderlands fight together in this battle and we do it with you at our head they rode on in the fading light row upon row of lancers saluting easar the shienarans were the finest heavy cavalry in the world and they had foughtand diedupon these rocks countless times defending the lush lands to the south i will come lan agreed the weight of what you have given me feels like three mountains i know easar said but we shall follow you dai shan until the sky is rent asunder until the rocks split underfoot and until the wheel itself stops turning or light send its blessing until every sword is favored with peace what of kandor if the queen comes here who will lead that battle the white tower rides to fight the shadowspawn there easar said you raised the golden crane we were sworn to come to your aid so we have he hesitated and then his voice grew grim kandor is beyond recovery now dai shan the queen admits it the white towers job is not to recover it but to stop the shadowspawn from taking more territory they turned and rode through the ranks of lancers the men were required to spend dusk within a few paces of their mounts and they made themselves busy caring for armor weapons and horses each man wore a longsword sometimes two strapped to his back and all had maces and daggers at their belts the shienarans did not rely solely upon their lances an enemy who thought to pin them without room to charge soon discovered that they could be very dangerous in close quarters most of the men wore yellow surcoats over their plateandmail bearing the black hawk they gave their salutes with stiff backs and serious faces indeed the shienarans were a serious people living in the borderlands did that lan hesitated then spoke in a loud voice why do we mourn the soldiers nearby turned toward him is this not what we have trained for lan shouted is this not our purpose our very lives this war is not a thing to mourn other men may have been lax but we have not been we are prepared and so this is a time of glory let there be laughter let there be joy let us cheer the fallen and drink to our forefathers who taught us well if you die on the morrow awaiting your rebirth be proud the last battle is upon us and we are ready lan wasnt sure exactly what had made him say it his words inspired a round of dai shan dai shan forward the golden crane he saw that some of the men were writing the speech down to pass among the other men you do have the soul of a leader dai shan easar said as they rode on it is not that lan said eyes forward i cannot stand selfpity too many of the men looked as if they were preparing their own shrouds a drum with no head easar said softly flicking his horses reins a pump with no grip a song with no voice still it is mine still it is mine lan turned frowning but the king gave no explanation for the poem if his people were a serious people their king was more so easar had wounds deep within that he chose not to share lan did not fault him in this lan himself had done the same tonight however he caught easar smiling as he considered whatever it was that had brought the poem to his lips was that anasai of ryddingwood lan asked easar looked surprised you have read anasais work she was a favorite of moiraine sedai it sounded as though it might be hers each of her poems was written as an elegy easar said this was for her father she left instructions it can be read but should not be spoken out loud except when it was right to do so she did not explain when it would be right to do so they reached the war tents and dismounted no sooner had they done so however than the horns of alarm began to sound both men reacted and lan unconsciously touched the sword on his hip let us go to lord agelmar lan shouted as men began to yell and equipment to rattle if you fight beneath my banner then i will accept the role of leader gladly no hesitation at all easar said what am i lan asked swinging into the saddle some sheepherder from a forgotten village i will do my duty if men are foolish enough to put me in charge of them ill send them about theirs as well easar nodded then saluted the corners of his mouth rising in another smile lan returned the salute then galloped mandarb through the center of the camp the men at the outskirts were lighting bonfires ashaman had created gateways to one of the many dying forests in the south for soldiers to gather wood if lan had his way those five channelers would never waste their strength killing trollocs they were far too useful otherwise narishma saluted lan as he passed lan could not be certain that the great captains had chosen borderlander ashaman for him on purpose but it seemed not to be a coincidence he had at least one from each borderlander nationeven one born to malkieri parents we fight together chapter that smoldering city atop moonshadow her deep brown mare from the royal stables elayne trakand rode through a gateway of her own making those stables were now in the hands of trollocs and moonshadows stablemates had undoubtedly found their way into cookpots by now elayne did not think too hard about what elsewho elsemight have ended up in those same pots she set her face in determination her troops would not see their queen look uncertain she had chosen to come to a hill about a thousand paces to the northwest of caemlyn well out of bow range but close enough to see the city several mercenary bands had made their camp in these hills during the weeks following the succession war those had all either joined the armies of light or had disbanded becoming roving thieves and brigands the foreguard had already secured the area and captain guybon saluted as members of the queens guardboth male and femalesurrounded elaynes horse the air still smelled of smoke and seeing caemlyn smoldering like dragonmount itself tossed a handful of bitter powder into the stew of emotions churning inside of her the onceproud city was dead a pyre that pitched a hundred different columns of smoke toward the storm clouds above the smoke reminded her of the spring burnings when farmers would occasionally fire their fields to help clear them for planting she hadnt ruled caemlyn for a hundred days and already it was lost if dragons can do that to a city she thought surveying the hole that talmanes had made in the nearest wall the world will need to change everything we know about warfare will change how many would you say she asked the man who rode up beside her talmanes was only one day of rest away from the ordeal that should have cost him his life he probably should have remained at merrilor he certainly wouldnt be doing any frontline fighting in the near future it is impossible to count their numbers hidden as they are in the city your majesty he said bowing respectfully tens of thousands but probably not hundreds of thousands the fellow was nervous around her and he manifested it in a very cairhienin wayby speaking with flowery respect he was said to be one of mats most trusted officers she would have assumed that by now mat would have corrupted the fellow far more he didnt curse once pity other gateways opened nearby onto the yellow grass and her forces came through filling the fields and topping the hills she had taken charge of a large army of warriors which included many of the siswaiaman to bolster her queens guard and the andoran regulars under the command of birgitte and captain guybon a second contingent of aielmaidens wise ones and the remaining warriorshad been chosen to travel north to shayol ghul with rand only a handful of wise ones had come with elayne the ones who followed perrin elayne would have liked more channelers than that still she did have the band and their dragons which should make up for the fact that her only other channelers were the kinswomen many of whom were on the weaker side of strength in the power perrin and his force had come with her that included mayenes winged guards the ghealdanin cavalry the whitecloaksshe still wasnt sure what she thought of thatand a company of two rivers archers with tam filling out her army was the group who called themselves the wolf guard mostly refugees turned soldiers some of whom had received combat training and of course she had captain bashere and his legion of the dragon she had approved basheres plan for the battle at caemlyn we will need to draw the fighting into the woods he had explained the archers will be deadly loosing at the trollocs upon their approach if these lads can move as well as i am told they can in the forest theyll be just as dangerous once theyve pulled back the aiel too would be deadly in a forest where the trollocs wouldnt be able to use their masses to overrun their opponents bashere himself rode nearby apparently rand had specifically told him to watch over her as if she didnt have birgitte jumping every time she moved rand had better stay safe so i can tell him what i think of him she thought as bashere approached in quiet conversation with birgitte bashere was a bowlegged man with a thick mustache he didnt talk to elayne the way a man should a queen but then the queen of saldaea was his niece so perhaps he was just very comfortable around royalty he is first in line for the throne elayne reminded herself working with him would offer opportunities to further secure her ties to saldaea she still liked the idea of seeing one of her children on that throne she lowered a hand to her stomach the babes kicked and elbowed frequently now nobody had told her it would feel so much like well indigestion unfortunately melfane had against all expectation found some goats milk what word elayne asked as birgitte and bashere arrived talmanes moving his horse aside to make room scout reports of the city are in bashere said bashere was right birgitte said the trollocs have been reined in and the burning has mostly died out a good half of the city still stands much of that smoke you see is from cook fires not buildings trollocs are stupid bashere said but halfmen are not the trollocs would have gleefully ransacked the city and lit fires all across it but that would have threatened to let the fires get away from them either way the truth is we dont know what the shadow is planning here but they at least have the option of trying to hold the city for a time should they desire will they try that elayne asked i cant say honestly bashere replied we dont know their goals was this attack on caemlyn intended to sow chaos and bring fear to our armies or is it intended to take a stronghold and hold it longterm as a base from which to harry our forces back during the trolloc wars the fades did hold cities for that purpose elayne nodded pardon your majesty a voice said she turned to see one of the two rivers men stepping up one of their leaders tams secondincommand dannil she thought thats his name your majesty dannil repeated he fumbled a little but actually spoke with some polish lord goldeneyes has his men set up in the forest lord talmanes do you have your dragons in position almost talmanes said pardon your majesty but im not certain the bows will be needed once those weapons fire are you certain you dont want to lead with the dragons we need to goad the trollocs into battle elayne said the placement i outlined will work best bashere what of my plan for the city itself i think everything is almost ready but ill want to check bashere said knuckling his mustache in thought those women of yours made gateways well enough and mayene gave us the oil youre sure you want to go through with something so drastic yes bashere waited for more of a response perhaps an explanation when she didnt give one he moved off issuing the last orders elayne turned moonshadow to ride down the ranks of soldiers here at the front lines where theyd set up near the forests there wasnt much she could do now in these last moments as her commanders gave orders but she could be seen riding with confidence where she passed the men raised their pikes higher lifted their chins elayne kept her own eyes on that smoldering city she would not look away and she would not let anger control her she would use the anger bashere returned to her a short time later its done the basements of many buildings that are still standing have been filled with oil talmanes and the others are in place once your warder returns with word that the kinswomen are prepared to open another round of gateways we can proceed elayne nodded and then removed her hand from her belly as bashere glanced at it she hadnt realized shed been holding it again what do you think of me going to battle while pregnant is it a mistake he shook his head no it proves just how desperate our situation is it will make the soldiers think make them more serious besides what bashere shrugged perhaps it will remind them that not everything in this world is dying elayne turned back looking at the distant city farmers burned their fields in the spring to prepare them for new life maybe that was what andor was suffering now tell me bashere said are you going to tell the men that youre carrying the lord dragons child children elayne corrected in her head you presume to know something that may or may not be true lord bashere i have a wife and a daughter i recognize the look in your eyes when you see the lord dragon no woman with child touches her hand to her womb so reverently when looking on a man who is not the father elayne drew her lips into a line why do you hide it bashere asked ive heard what some of the men think they talk of some other man a darkfriend named mellar once captain of your guardswomen i can see that the rumors are false but others are not so wise you could kill those rumors if you wished rands children will be targets she said ah he replied he knuckled his mustache for a moment if you disagree with the reasoning bashere speak your mind i will not suffer a toady im no toady woman he said with a huff but regardless i hardly doubt your child could be a greater target than he or she already is youre high commander of the armies of the light i think your men deserve to know what exactly theyre fighting for it is not your business to know elayne said nor is it theirs bashere raised an eyebrow at her the heir to the realm he said flatly is not the business of its subjects i believe you are overstepping your bounds general perhaps i am he said maybe spending so much time with the lord dragon has warped the way i do things that man you could never tell what he was thinking half of the time he wanted to hear my mind as raw as i could lay it out the other half of the time it seemed like hed break me in two just for commenting that the sky looked a little dark bashere shook his head just give it some thought your majesty you remind me of my daughter she might have done something similar and this is the advice id give her your men will fight more bravely if they know that you carry the dragon reborns heir men elayne thought the young ones try to impress me with every stunt that comes into their fool heads the old ones assume every young woman is in need of a lecture she turned her eyes toward the city again as birgitte rode up and gave her a nod the basements were filled with oil and pitch burn it elayne said loudly birgitte waved a hand the kinswomen opened their round of gateways and men hurled lit torches through into the basements of caemlyn it didnt take long for the smoke rising above the city to grow darker more ominous they wont soon put that out birgitte said softly not with the dry weather weve been having the entire city will go up like a haystack the army gathered to stare at the city particularly the members of the queens guard and the andoran military a few of them saluted as one might salute the pyre of a fallen hero elayne ground her teeth then said birgitte make it known among the guards the children i carry were fathered by the dragon reborn basheres smile deepened insufferable man birgitte was smiling as she went to spread the word she was insufferable too the men of andor seemed to stand taller prouder as they watched their capital burn trollocs started pouring from the gates driven by the fires elayne made sure the trollocs saw her army then announced northward she turned moonshadow caemlyn is dead we take to the forests let the shadowspawn follow androl awoke with dirt in his mouth he groaned trying to roll over but found himself bound in some way he spat licked his lips and blinked crusty eyes he lay with jonneth and emarin against an earthen wall tied by ropes he remembered light the roof had fallen in pevara he sent incredible how natural that method of communication was beginning to feel he was rewarded with a groggy sensation from her the bond let him know that she was nearby probably tied up as well the one power was also lost to him he clawed at it but ran up against a shield his bonds were tied to some kind of hook in the ground behind him hindering his movement androl shoved panic down with some effort he couldnt see nalaam was he here the group of them lay tied in a large chamber and the air smelled of damp earth they were still underground in a part of taims secret complex if the roof fell in androl thought the cells were probably destroyed that explained why he and the others were tied up but not locked away someone was sobbing he strained around and found evin tied nearby the younger man wept shaking its all right evin androl whispered well find a way out of this evin glanced at him shocked the youth was tied in a different way in a seated position hands behind his back androl androl im sorry androl felt a twisting emotion for what evin they came right after the rest of you left they wanted emarin i think to turn him when he wasnt there they began asking questions demands they broke me androl i broke so easily im sorry so taim hadnt discovered the fallen guards its not your fault evin footsteps sounded on the ground nearby androl feigned unconsciousness but someone kicked him i saw you talking pageboy mishraile said leaning down his goldenhaired head im going to enjoy killing you for what you did to coteren androl opened his eyes and saw logain sagging in the grip of mezar and welyn they dragged him near and dropped him roughly to the ground logain stirred and groaned as they tied him up they stood and one spat on androl before moving over to emarin no taim said from somewhere near the youth is next the great lord demands results logain is taking too long evins sobs grew louder as mezar and welyn moved over to seize him under the arms no androl said twisting no taim burn you leave him alone take me taim stood nearby hands clasped behind his back in a sharp black uniform that resembled those of the ashaman but trimmed with silver he wore no pins at his neck he turned toward androl then sneered take you i am to present to the great lord a man who couldnt channel enough to break a pebble i should have culled you long ago taim followed the other two who were dragging away the frantic evin androl screamed at them yelling until he was hoarse they took evin somewhere on the other side of the chamberit was very largeand androl could not see them because of the angle at which he was tied androl dropped his head back against the floor closing his eyes that didnt prevent him from hearing poor evins screams of terror androl pevara whispered quiet mishrailes voice was followed by a thump and a grunt from pevara i am really starting to hate that one pevara sent to him androl didnt reply they took the effort to dig us out of the collapsed room pevara continued i remember some of it before they shielded me and knocked me unconscious it seems to have been less than a day since then i guess taim hasnt yet hit his quota of dreadlords turned to the shadow she sent it almost with levity behind them evins screams stopped oh light pevara sent was that evin all wryness vanished from her tone whats happening theyre turning him androl sent back strength of will has something to do with resisting that is why logain hasnt been turned yet pevaras concern was a warmth through the bond were all aes sedai like her hed assumed they had no emotions but pevara felt the full rangealthough she accompanied it with an almost inhuman control over how those emotions affected her another result of decades of practice how do we escape she sent im trying to untie my bonds my fingers are stiff i can see the knot its a hefty one but i might be able to guide you he nodded and they began pevara describing the turns of the knot as androl tried to twist his fingers around them he failed to get enough purchase on the bonds he tried pulling his hands free and wiggling them out but the ropes were too tight by the time he accepted defeat his fingers were numb from the lack of circulation its not going to work he sent ive been trying to push out of this shield pevara replied its possible and i think our shields might be tied off tiedoff shields fail androl sent back agreement though he couldnt keep from feeling frustrated how long could evin hold out the silence taunted him why couldnt he hear any sounds then he sensed something channeling could that be thirteen men light if there were thirteen myrddraal as well the situation was dire what would they do if they escaped they couldnt fight so many which cliff did you choose pevara sent him what you said that when you were among the sea folk they jumped off cliffs to prove their bravery the higher the cliff the braver the jumper which cliff did you choose the highest he admitted why i figured that once youve decided to jump off a cliff you might as well pick the highest one why accept the risk if not for the greatest prize pevara sent back approval we will escape androl somehow he nodded mostly for himself and set back at his knot a few moments later taims cronies returned evin squatted down beside androl behind his eyes lurked something different something awful he smiled well that was certainly not as bad as i had assumed it would be androl oh evin dont worry about me evin said resting a hand on androls shoulder i feel great no more fear no more worry we shouldnt have been fighting all of this time we are the black tower we need to work together you are not my friend androl thought you might have his face but evin oh light evin is dead where is nalaam androl asked died in the cavein im afraid evin shook his head he leaned in theyre planning to kill you androl but i think i can convince them that youre worth turning instead youll thank me eventually the terrible thing inside of evins eyes smiled patted androl on the shoulder then rose and began chatting with mezar and welyn behind them androl could barely see thirteen shadows trailing over to grab emarin and drag him away to be turned next fades with cloaks that did not move androl thought how lucky nalaam was to be crushed in the collapse chapter to die well lan split the head of the myrddraal in half down to the neck he danced mandarb back letting the fade thrash as it died its convulsions twisting the pieces of its skull from the neck putrid black blood poured onto the rock which had already been bloodied a dozen times lord mandragoran lan wheeled toward the call one of his men pointed back toward their camp where a spout of bright red light was shooting into the air noon already lan thought raising his sword and signaling for his malkieri to retreat the kandori and arafellin troops were swinging in light cavalry with bows sending wave after wave of arrows into the mass of trollocs the stench was tremendous lan and his men rode away from the front lines passing two ashaman and an aes sedaicoladara who had insisted on staying on as king paitars advisorchanneling to set the trolloc corpses aflame that would make it more difficult for the next wave of shadowspawn lans armies had continued their brutal work holding the trollocs at the gap like pitch holding back the spray of water in a leaking boat the army fought in short rotations an hour at a time bonfires and ashaman lit the way at night never giving the shadowspawn the opportunity to advance after two days of grueling battle lan knew that this tactic would eventually favor the trollocs humans were killing them by the wagonload but the shadow had been building its forces for years each night the trollocs fed upon the dead they didnt have to worry about mess supplies lan kept his shoulders from sagging as he rode away from the front lines making way for the next group of his troops but he wanted to collapse and sleep for days despite the greater numbers given him by the dragon reborn every man was required to take several shifts on the front lines each day lan always joined a few extra finding sleep was not easy for his troops while also caring for their equipment gathering wood for the bonfires and bringing supplies through gateways as he surveyed those leaving the front lines with him lan sought for what he could do to strengthen them nearby faithful bulen was sagging lan would need to make sure the man slept more or bulen slid from the saddle lan cursed stopping mandarb and leaped down he dashed to bulens side and found the man staring blankly into the sky bulen had a massive wound in his side the mail there ripped like a sail that had seen too much wind bulen had covered the wound by putting his coat on over his armor lan hadnt seen him hit nor had he seen the man covering up the wound fool lan thought feeling at bulens neck no pulse fie was gone fool lan thought again bowing his head you wouldnt leave my side would you thats why you hid it you were afraid id die out there while you came back for healing either that or you didnt want to demand strength from the channelers you knew they were pushed to their limits with teeth clenched lan picked up bulens corpse and slung it over his shoulder fie hefted the body onto bulens horse and tied it across the saddle andere and prince kaiselthe kandori youth and his squad of a hundred usually rode with lansat nearby watching solemnly conscious of their eyes lan put his hand on the corpses shoulder you did well my friend he said your praises will be sung for generations may you shelter in the palm of the creators hand and may the last embrace of the mother welcome you home he turned to the others i will not mourn mourning is for those who regret and i do not regret what we do here bulen could not have died a better death i do not cry for him i cheer he swung up into mandarbs saddle holding the reins of bulens horse and sat tall he would not let them see his fatigue or his sorrow did any of you see bakh fall he asked those riding near him he had a crossbow tied to the back of his horse he always carried that thing with him i swore that if it ever went off by accident id have the ashaman hang him by his toes from the top of a cliff he died yesterday when his sword caught in a trollocs armor he left it and reached for his spare but two more trollocs pulled his horse out from underneath him i thought he was dead then and was trying to reach him only to see him come up with that lightburned crossbow of his and shoot a trolloc right in the eye from two feet away the bolt went clear through its head the second trolloc gutted him but not before he put his boot knife in its neck lan nodded i remember you bakh you died well they rode for a few moments and then prince kaisel added ragon he died well too charged his horse straight at a group of thirty trollocs that were coming in at us from the side probably saved a dozen men with that move buying us time he kicked one in the face as they pulled him down yes ragon was a right insane man andere said im one of the men he saved he smiled he did die well light but he did of course the craziest thing ive seen these last few days is what kragil did when fighting that fade did any of you see it by the time they reached the camp the men were laughing and toasting the fallen with words lan split off from them and took bulen to the ashaman narishma was holding open a gateway for a supply cart he nodded to lan lord mandragoran i need to put him someplace cold lan said dismounting when this is done and malkier is reclaimed we will want a proper resting place for the noble fallen until then i will not have him burned or left to rot he was the first malkieri to return to malkiers king narishma nodded arafellin bells tinkling on the ends of his braids he ushered a cart through the gateway then held up a hand for the others to stop he closed that gateway then opened one to the top of a mountain icy air blew through lan took bulen off his horse narishma moved to help but lan waved him away grunting as he heaved the corpse up onto his shoulder he stepped through into the snows the biting wind sharp on his cheeks as if someone had taken a knife to them he laid bulen down then knelt and gently took the hadori from bulens head lan would carry it into battleso that bulen could continue to fightthen return it to the body when the battle was through an old malkieri tradition you did well bulen lan said softly thank you for not giving up on me he stood up boots crunching the snow and strode out through the gateway hadori in hand narishma let the gateway close and lan asked for the location of the mountainin case narishma died in the fightingso he could locate bulen again they wouldnt be able to preserve all of the malkieri corpses this way but one was better than none lan wrapped the leather hadori about the hilt of his sword just below the crossguard and tied it tight he handed mandarb off to a groom holding up a finger to the horse and meeting his dark liquid eyes no more biting grooms he growled at the stallion after that lan went looking for lord agelmar he found the commander speaking with tenobia outside the saldaean section of camp men stood with bows nearby in lines of two hundred watching the skies there had already been a number of draghkar attacks as lan stepped up the ground started to shake and rumble the soldiers didnt cry out they were growing used to this the land groaned the bare rock ground near lan split he jumped back in alarm as the shaking continued watching tiny rents appear in the rockhairline cracks there was something profoundly wrong about the cracks they were too dark too deep though the area was still shaking he stepped up looking at the tiny cracks trying to make them out in detail through the rumbling earthquake they seemed to be cracks into nothingness they drew the light in sucked it away it was as if he was looking at fractures in the nature of reality itself the quakes subsided the darkness within the cracks lingered for a few breaths then faded away the hairline fractures becoming just ordinary breaks in stone wary lan knelt down inspecting them closely had he seen what hed thought what did it mean chilled he rose to his feet and continued on his way it is not men alone who grow tired he thought the mother is weakening he hastened through the saldaean camp of those fighting at the gap the saldaeans had the most wellkept camp run by the stern hands of the officers wives lan had left most of the malkieri noncombatants in fal dara and the other forces had come with few others except the warriors that wasnt the saldaean way though they normally didnt go into the blight the women otherwise marched with their husbands each one could fight with knives and would hold their camp to the death if the need arose they had been extremely useful here in gathering and distributing supplies and tending the wounded tenobia was arguing tactics with agelmar again lan listened as the shienaran great captain nodded to her demands she didnt have a bad grasp of things but she was too bold she wanted them to push into the blight and take the fight to the trolloc spawning grounds eventually she noticed lan lord mandragoran she said eyeing him she was a pretty enough woman with fire in her eyes and long black hair your latest sortie was a success more trollocs are dead lan said we fight a glorious battle she said with pride i lost a good friend tenobia paused then looked at his eyes perhaps searching for emotion in them lan didnt give any bulen had died well the men who fight have glory lan said to her but the battle itself is not glory it simply is lord agelmar a word tenobia stepped aside and lan drew agelmar away the aged general gave lan a grateful look tenobia watched for a moment then stalked off with two guards following hastily at her heels shell be off into battle herself at some point if we dont watch her lan thought her head is full of songs and stories hadnt he just encouraged his men to tell those same stories no there was a difference he could feel a difference teaching the men to accept that they might die and to revere the honor of the fallen that was different from singing songs about how wonderful it was to fight on the front lines unfortunately it took actual fighting to teach the difference the light send tenobia wouldnt do anything too rash lan had seen many a young man with that look in his eyes the solution then was to work them to exhaustion for a few weeks drilling them to the point that they thought only of their bed not of the glories they would someday find he doubted that would be appropriate for the queen herself she has been growing more rash ever since kalyan married ethenielle lord agelmar said quietly joining lan as they walked the back lines nodding to passing soldiers i think that he was able to dampen her a featherweight or two but nowwithout him or bashere watching her he sighed well regardless what is it you wished of me dai shan we fight well here lan said but im worried about how tired the men are will we be able to keep holding back the trollocs you are right the enemy will force its way through eventually agelmar said what do we do then lan asked we will fight here agelmar said and then once we cannot hold we will retreat to buy time lan stiffened retreat agelmar nodded we are here to slow the trollocs down we will accomplish that by holding here for a time then slowly pulling back across shienar i did not come to tarwins gap to retreat agelmar dai shan im led to believe you came here to die that was nothing but the truth i will not abandon malkier to the shadow a second time agelmar i came to the gapthe malkieri followed me hereto show the dark one that we had not been beaten to leave after weve actually been able to gain a footing dai shan lord agelmar said in a softer voice as they walked i respect your decision to fight we all do your march here alone inspired thousands that may not have been your purpose but it is the purpose the wheel wove for you the determination of a man set upon justice is a thing not lightly ignored however there is a time to put yourself aside and see the greater importance lan stopped eyeing the aged general take care lord agelmar it almost sounds as if you are calling me selfish i am lan agelmar said and you are lan did not flinch you came to throw your life away for malkier that in itself is noble however with the last battle upon us its also stupid we need you men will die because of your stubbornness i did not ask for them to follow me light i did all that i could to stop them duty is heavier than a mountain dai shan that time lan did flinch how long had it been since someone had been able to do that to him with mere words he remembered teaching that same concept to a youth out of the two rivers a sheepherder innocent of the world fearful of the fate laid out before him by the pattern some men agelmar said are destined to die and they fear it others are destined to live and to lead and they find it a burden if you wished to keep fighting here until the last man fell you could do it and theyd die singing the glory of the fight or you could do what we both need to do retreat when were forced to it adapt continuing delaying and stalling the shadow as long as we can until the other armies can send us aid we have an exceptionally mobile force each army sent you their finest cavalry ive seen nine thousand saldaean light horse perform complex maneuvers with precision we can hurt the shadow here but their numbers are proving too great greater than i thought they would be we will hurt more of them as we withdraw we will find ways to punish them with every step we take backward yes lan you made me commanding general of the field that is my advice to you it wont be today or perhaps for another week but we will need to fall back lan walked on in silence before he could formulate a reply he saw a blue light exploding in the air the emergency signal from the gap the units that had just rotated onto the field needed help i will consider it lan thought pushing aside his fatigue he dashed for the horselines where the groom would have delivered mandarb he didnt need to ride on this sortie he had just gotten off one he decided to go anyway and caught himself yelling for bulen to prepare a horse and felt a fool light but lan had grown accustomed to the mans help agelmar is right lan thought as the grooms fell over themselves saddling mandarb the stallion was skittish sensing his mood they will follow me like bulen did leading them to death in the name of a fallen kingdom leading myself to the same death how is that any different from tenobias attitude before long he was galloping back toward the defensive lines to find the trollocs almost breaking through he joined the rally and this night they held eventually they would fail to do so what then then then he would abandon malkier again and do what had to be done egwenes force had gathered at the southern portion of the field of merrilor they had been slated to travel to kandor once elaynes force had been dispatched to caemlyn rands armies had not yet entered thakandar but had instead moved to staging areas on the northern part of the field where supplies could be assembled more easily he claimed the time wasnt quite right for his assault the light send he was making progress with the seanchan moving so many people was a tremendous headache aes sedai created gateways in a huge line like the doorways along one side of a grand feast hall soldiers bunched up waiting their turn to pass through many of the strongest channelers were not involved in this task they would be channeling in combat soon enough and creating gateways would only consume needed strength before the important work had begun the soldiers made way for the amyrlin of course with the foreguard in place and a camp established on the other side it was time for her to cross she had spent the morning meeting with the hall as they went over the supply reports and terrain assessments she was glad she had allowed the hall to take a larger role in the war there was a great deal of wisdom to the sitters many of whom had lived well over a century i dont like being forced to wait this long gawyn said riding beside her she eyed him i trust general brynes battlefield assessment as does the hall egwene said as they rode past the illianer companions each mans brilliant breastplate worked with the nine bees of illian on the front they saluted her faces hidden behind their conical helmets barred at the front she wasnt certain she liked having them in her armythey would be more loyal to rand than to herbut bryne had insisted on it he said that her force though enormous lacked an elite group like the companions i still say we should have left sooner gawyn said as the two of them passed through the gateway to the border of kandor it has only been a few days a few days while kandor burns she could sense his frustration she could also feel that he loved her fiercely he was her husband now the marriage had been performed by silviana in a simple ceremony the night before it still felt odd to know that egwene had authorized her own wedding when you were the highest authority what else could you do as they moved into the camp on the kandori border bryne rode by giving terse orders to scouting patrols when he reached egwene he climbed out of the saddle and bowed low kissing her ring he then remounted and continued he was very respectful considering that hed essentially been bullied into leading this army of course hed made his demands and they had been met so perhaps hed bullied them as well leading the white towers armies had been an opportunity for him no man liked being put out to pasture the great captain shouldnt have found himself there in the first place egwene noted siuan riding at brynes side and smiled in satisfaction he is bound tightly to us now egwene surveyed the hills on the southeastern border of kandor though they lacked greenerylike most places in the world nowtheir peaceful serenity gave no hint that the country beyond them burned the capital chachin was now little more than rubble before withdrawing to join the fight with the other borderlanders queen ethenielle had turned over rescue operations to egwene and the hall they had done what they could sending scouts through gateways along major roadways looking for refugees then bringing them away to safetyif anywhere could be called safe now the main trolloc army had left the burning cities and was now moving southeast toward the hills and the river that made up kandors border with arafel silviana rode up beside egwene opposite gawyn she spared him only a glarethose two really would have to stop snapping at one another it was growing tiresomebefore kissing egwenes ring mother silviana we have received an update from elayne sedai egwene allowed herself a smile both of them independently had taken to calling elayne by her white tower title as opposed to her civil title and she suggests that we set up a location where the wounded can be sent for healing wed talked about having the yellows move from battlefield to battlefield egwene said elayne sedai is worried about exposing the yellows to attack silviana said she wants a stationary hospital that would be more efficient mother gawyn said rubbing his chin finding the wounded after a battle is a brutal affair i dont know what id think of sending sisters to comb through the dead this war could stretch weeks even months if the great captains are right eventually the shadow is going to start picking off aes sedai on the field elayne sedai was quite insistent silviana said her face was a mask her tone steady yet she also managed to convey severe displeasure silviana was proficient at that i helped put elayne in charge egwene reminded herself refusing her would set a bad precedent as would obeying her perhaps they could remain friends through it elayne sedai shows wisdom egwene said tell romanda that it must be done this way have the entire yellow ajah gather for healing but not at the white tower mother silviana asked the seanchan egwene said she had to smother the serpent deep inside of her that writhed whenever she thought of them i will not risk the yellows being attacked while alone and exhausted from healing the white tower is exposed and is a focus for the enemyif not the seanchan then the shadow a valid point silviana sounded reluctant but where else caemlyn has fallen and the borderlands are too exposed tear hardly egwene said that was rands territory and it seemed too obvious send back to elayne with a suggestion perhaps the first of mayene will be willing to provide a suitable building a very large one egwene tapped the side of her saddle send the accepted and the novices with the yellows i dont want those women on the battlefield but their strength can be put to use in healing linked to a yellow the weakest of novices could lend a trickle of strength and save lives many would be disappointed they imagined slaying trollocs well this would be a way for them to fight without getting underfoot untrained in combat as they were egwene glanced over her shoulder movement through the gateways would not be finished any time soon silviana relay my words to elayne sedai egwene said gawyn i have something i want to do they found chubain supervising the setup of a command camp in a valley west of the river that formed the boundary between kandor and arafel theyd press forward into this hilly country to meet the oncoming trollocs deploying harrying forces in the adjoining valleys with archers atop the hills alongside defensive units the plan would be to strike hard at trollocs as they tried to take the hills doing as much damage as possible the harrying units could swipe at enemy flanks while the defenders held the hills as long as they could the odds were good that they would eventually be pushed out of those hills and across the border into arafel but on the wide plains of arafel their cavalries could be used to better advantage egwenes force like lans was meant to delay and slow the trollocs until elayne could defeat those in the south ideally they would hold until reinforcements could arrive chubain saluted and led them to a tent that had already been erected nearby egwene dismounted and started to enter but gawyn laid a hand on her arm she sighed nodded and let him enter first inside on the floor with legs folded sat the seanchan woman that nynaeve had called egeanin although the woman insisted on being called leilwin three members of the tower guard watched over her and her illianer husband leilwin looked up as egwene entered then immediately rose to her knees and performed a graceful bow forehead touching the tent floor her husband did as she did though his motions seemed more reluctant perhaps he was merely a worse actor than she was out egwene said to the three guards they did not argue though their withdrawal was slow as if she couldnt handle herself with her warder against two people who could not channel men gawyn took up position at the side of the tent leaving her to address the two prisoners nynaeve tells me you are marginally trustworthy egwene said to leilwin oh sit up nobody bows that low in the white tower not even the lowest of servants leilwin sat up but kept her eyes lowered i have failed greatly in the duty assigned me and in so doing have endangered the pattern itself yes egwene said the bracelets im aware would you like a chance to repay that debt the woman bowed herself forehead to the ground again egwene sighed but before she could order the woman to rise leilwin spoke by the light and my hope for salvation and rebirth leilwin said i vow to serve you and protect you amyrlin ruler of the white tower by the crystal throne and the blood of the empress i bind myself to you to do as commanded in all things and to put your life before my own under the light may it be so she kissed the floor egwene looked at her stunned only a darkfriend would betray an oath such as that one of course every seanchan was close to being a darkfriend you think i m not well protected egwene asked you think that i need another servant i think only of repaying my debt leilwin said in her tone egwene sensed a stiffness a bitterness that rang of authenticity this woman did not like humbling herself in this manner egwene folded her arms troubled what can you tell me of the seanchan military its arms and strength and of the plans of the empress i know some things amyrlin leilwin said but i was a ships captain what i do know is of the seanchan navy and that will be of little use to you of course egwene thought she glanced at gawyn who shrugged please leilwin said softly allow me to prove myself to you somehow i have little left to me my name itself is no longer my own first egwene said you will talk of the seanchan i dont care if you think its irrelevant anything you tell me might be helpful or it might reveal leilwin as a liar which would be equally useful gawyn fetch me a chair im going to listen to what she says after that well see rand rifled through the pile of maps notes and reports he stood with his arm folded behind his back a single lamp burning on the desk sheathed in glass the flame danced as breezes eddied through the tent where he stood alone was the flame alive it ate it moved on its own you could smother it so in a way it breathed what was it to be alive could an idea live a world without the dark one a world without evil rand turned back to the maps what he saw impressed him elayne was preparing well he had not attended the meetings planning each battle his attention was directed toward the north toward shayol ghul his destiny his grave he hated the way these battle maps with notes for formations and groups reduced mens lives to scribbles on a page numbers and statistics oh he admitted that the claritythe distancewas essential for a battlefield commander he hated it nonetheless here before him was a flame that lived yet here were also men who were dead now that he could not lead the war himself he hoped to stay away from maps such as this one he knew seeing these preparations would make him grieve for the soldiers he could not save a sudden chill ran across him the hairs on his arms standing on enda distinct shiver halfway between excitement and terror a woman was channeling rand raised his head and found elayne frozen in the tent doorway light she said rand what are you doing here are you trying to kill me with fright he turned settling his fingers on the battle maps taking her in now here was life flushed cheeks golden hair with a hint of honey and rose eyes that burned like a bonfire her dress of crimson showed the swell of the children she bore light she was beautiful rand althor elayne asked are you going to talk to me or do you wish to ogle me further if i cant ogle you whom can i ogle rand asked dont grin at me like that farmboy she said sneaking into my tent really what would people say theyd say that i wanted to see you besides i didnt sneak in the guards let me in she folded her arms they didnt tell me i asked them not to then for all intents and purposes you were sneaking elayne brushed by him she smelled wonderful honestly as if aviendha werent enough i didnt want the regular soldiers to see me rand said i worried it would disturb your camp i asked the guards not to mention that i was here he stepped up to her resting his hand on her shoulder i had to see you again before you saw me at merrilor elayne im sorry she said turning back to him i am happy to see you and i am glad you came im just trying to get into my head how you fit into all of this how we fit into all of this i dont know rand said ive never figured it out im sorry she sighed sitting down in the chair beside her desk i suppose it is good to find there are some things you cant fix with a wave of your hand there is much i cant fix elayne he glanced at the desk and the maps so much dont think about that he knelt before her getting a cocked eyebrow until he placed his hand on her bellyhesitantly at first i didnt know he said not until just recently the night before the meeting twins it is said yes so tam will be a grandfather rand said and i will be how was a man supposed to react to this news was it supposed to shake him upend him rand had been given his share of surprises in life it seemed he could no longer take two steps without the world changing on him but this this wasnt a surprise he found that deep down hed hoped that someday he would be a father it had happened that gave him warmth one thing was going right in the world even if so many had gone wrong children his children he closed his eyes breathing in enjoying the thought he would never know them he would leave them fatherless before they were even born but then janduin had left rand fatherlessand he had turned out all right just a few rough edges here and there what will you name them rand asked if there is a boy ive been thinking of naming him rand rand let himself go still as he felt her womb was that motion a kick no rand said softly please do not name either child after me elayne let them live their own lives my shadow will be long enough as it is very well he looked up to meet her eyes and he found her smiling with fondness she rested a smooth hand on his cheek you will be a fine father elayne not a word of it she said raising a finger no talk of death of duty we cannot ignore what will happen we neednt dwell on it either she said i taught you so much about being a monarch rand i seem to have forgotten one lesson it is all right to plan for the worst possibilities but you must not bask in them you must not fixate on them a queen must have hope before all else i do hope rand said i hope for the world for you for everyone who must fight that does not change the fact that i have accepted my own death enough she said no more talk of this tonight i will have a quiet dinner with the man i love rand sighed but rose seating himself in the chair beside hers as she called to the guards at the tent flap for their meal can we at least discuss tactics rand asked i am truly impressed by what youve done here i dont think i could have done a better job the great captains did most of it i saw your annotations rand said bashere and the others are wonderful generals geniuses even but they think only of their specific battles someone needs to coordinate them and you are doing that marvelously you have a head for this no i dont elayne said what i do have is a lifetime spent as the daughterheir of andor being trained for wars that might come thank general bryne and my mother for what you see in me did you find anything in my notes that you would change there is more than a hundred and fifty miles between caemlyn and braem wood where you plan to ambush the shadow rand noted thats risky what if your forces get overrun before they reach the wood everything depends on them beating the trollocs to the wood our harrying forces will be using the strongest fastest mounts available it will be a grueling race theres no question and the horses will be near death by the time they reach the wood but we are hoping that the trollocs will be the worse for wear by then as well which should make our job easier they talked tactics and evening became night servants arrived with dinner broth and wild boar rand had wished to keep his presence in the camp quiet but there was nothing for that now that the servants knew he settled himself to dine and let himself flow into the conversation with elayne which battlefield was in the most danger which of the great captains should she champion when they disagreed which they often did how would this all work with rands army which still waited for the right time to attack shayol ghul the conversation reminded him of their time in tear stealing hidden kisses in the stone between sessions of political training rand had fallen in love with her during those days real love not the admiration of a boy falling off a wall looking at a princessback then he hadnt understood love any more than a farmboy swinging a sword understood war their love was born of the things they shared with elayne he could speak of politics and the burden of rule she understood she truly did better than anyone he knew she knew what it was to make decisions that changed the lives of thousands she understood what it was to be owned by the people of a nation rand found it remarkable that though they had often been apart their connection held in fact it felt even stronger now that elayne was queen now that they shared the children growing within her you wince elayne said rand looked up from his broth elaynes dinner was halffinishedhe had been making her speak a great deal she seemed through anyway and held a warm cup of tea i what rand asked you wince when i mentioned the contingents fighting for andor you flinched just a little it was not surprising she had noticedelayne had been the one to teach him to watch for minor tells in the expressions of those with whom he spoke all of these people fight under my name rand said so many people i do not even know will die for me that has ever been the burden of a ruler at war i should be able to protect them rand said if you think you can protect everyone rand althor you are far less wise than you pretend he looked at her meeting her eyes i dont believe i can but their deaths weigh on me i feel as if i should be able to do more now that i remember he tried to break me and he failed is that what happened that day atop dragonmount he hadnt spoken of it to anyone he pulled his seat closer to hers up there i realized that i had been thinking too much on strength i wanted to be hard so hard in driving myself so i risked losing the ability to care that was wrong for me to win i must care that unfortunately means i must allow myself pain at their deaths and you remember lews therin now she whispered everything he knew that is not just an air you put on i am him i always was i remember it now elayne breathed out eyes widening what an advantage of all the people he had told that to only she had responded in such a way what a wonderful woman i have all of this knowledge yet it doesnt tell me what to do he stood up pacing i should be able to fix it elayne no more should need to die for me this is my fight why must everyone else go through such suffering you deny us the right to fight she said sitting up straight no of course not rand said i could deny you nothing i just wish that somehow somehow i could make this all stop shouldnt my sacrifice be enough she stood taking his arm he turned to her then she kissed him i love you she said you are a king but if you would try to deny the good people of andor the right to defend themselves the right to stand in the last battle her eyes flared her cheeks flushed light his comments had truly made her angry he never quite knew what she was going to say or do and that excited him like the excitement of watching nightflowers knowing that what was to come would be beautiful but never knowing the exact form that beauty would take i said i wouldnt deny you the right to fight rand said its about more than just me rand its about everyone can you understand that i suppose that i can good elayne settled back down and took a sip of her tea then grimaced its gone bad rand asked yes but im used to it still its almost worse than drinking nothing at all with how spoiled everything is rand walked to her and took the cup from her fingers he held it for a moment but did not channel i brought you something i forgot to mention it tea no this is just an aside he handed the cup back to her and she took a sip her eyes widened its wonderful how do you do it i dont rand said sitting the pattern does but i am taveren rand said things happen around me unpredictable things for the longest time there was a balance in one town someone would discover a great treasure unexpectedly under the stairs in the next i visited people would discover that their coins were fakes passed to them by a clever counterfeiter people died in terrible ways others were saved by a miracle of chance deaths and births marriages and divisions i once saw a feather drift down from the sky and fall pointfirst into the mud so it stuck there the next ten that fell did the same thing it was all random two sides to a flipping coin this tea is not random yes it is rand said but you see i get only one side of the coin these days someone else is doing the bad the dark one injects horrors into the world causing death evil madness but the pattern the pattern is balance so it works through me to provide the other side the harder the dark one works the more powerful the effect around me becomes the growing grass elayne said the splitting clouds the food unspoiled yes well some other tricks helped on occasion but he didnt mention them he fished in his pocket for a small pouch if what you say is true elayne replied then there can never be good in the world of course there can will the pattern not balance it out he hesitated that line of reasoning cut too close to the way he had begun thinking before dragonmountthat he had no options that his life was planned for him so long as we care rand said there can be good the pattern is not about emotionsit is not even about good or evil the dark one is a force from outside of it influencing it by force and rand would end that if he could here rand said the gift i mentioned he pushed the pouch toward her she looked at him curious she untied the strings and took from it a small statue of a woman she stood upright with a shawl about her shoulders though she did not look like an aes sedai she had a mature face aged and wise with a wise look about her and a smile on her face an angreal elayne asked no a seed a seed you have the talent of creating terangreal rand said creating angreal requires a different process it begins with one of these an object created to draw your power and instill it into something else it takes time and will weaken you for several months so you should not attempt it while we are at war but when i found it forgotten i thought of you i had wondered what i could give you oh rand i have something for you as well she hurried over to an ivory jewelry chest that rested on a camp table and took a small object from it it was a dagger with a short dull blade and a handle made of deerhorn wrapped in gold wire rand glanced at the dagger quizzically no offense but that looks like a poor weapon elayne its a terangreal something that may be of use when you go to shayol ghul with it the shadow cannot see you she reached up to touch his face he placed his hand on hers they stayed together long into the night chapter the use of dragons perrin rode stayer light cavalry from elaynes forces following behind him whitecloaks mayeners ghealdanin joined by some of the band of the red hand only a fraction of their armies that was the point they swept along diagonally toward the trollocs camped outside of caemlyn the city still smoldered elaynes plan with the oil had driven the creatures out for the most part but some still held the walls above archers arganda yelled loose his voice would be lost to most in the roar of the charge the snorting of horses the gallop of hooves enough would hear to start shooting and the rest knew what to do anyway perrin leaned low hoping his hammer would not be needed on this sortie they charged past the trollocs sweeping in front of them launching arrows then they turned away from the city perrin glanced over his shoulder as he rode and he was rewarded with the sight of trollocs falling the band followed after perrins cavalry getting close enough to launch arrows trolloc arrows followedthick and black almost like spears loosed from enormous bows some of perrins riders fell but his attack had been swift the trollocs didnt break from their position outside the city walls the riders slowed arganda coming up beside perrin watching over his shoulder they still arent charging arganda said then well hit them again and again perrin said until they break our attacks are continuing your majesty the messenger said riding through a gateway made by a pair of kinswomen to where elayne had her camp in the wood lord goldeneyes sends word theyll continue through the day if need be she nodded and the messenger rode back the way he had come braem wood slumbered trees bare as if in winter it takes too much work to relay information back and forth to me elayne said with dissatisfaction i wish we could have made those terangreal work aviendha said that one let you see over distance and another talk that way but wish and want trip the feet as lini says still if i could see the fighting with my own eyes birgitte said nothing eyes forward the goldenhaired warder gave no sign at all that shed heard the comment after all elayne said i can defend myself as i have proven on a number of occasions no response the two horses walked softly beside one another hooves on soft earth the camp around them had been designed to be broken down and moved on the run the soldiers tents were canvas tarps set over ropes pulled tight between trees the only travel furniture was that of her own pavilion and the battle pavilion the kinswomen had one group ready with gateways to move elayne and her commanders further into the woods most of her forces waited at the ready like a taut bow with the arrow nocked she would not engage the trollocs on their terms however by report some of their fists still topped the city walls and attacking directly would be a disaster with them raining death on her from above she would draw them out if that required patience so be it ive decided elayne continued to birgitte ill just hop through a gateway to take a look at the trolloc army myself from a safe distance i could birgitte reached beneath her shirt and removed the foxhead medallion she wore one of the three imperfect copies elayne had made mat had the original and a copy mellar had escaped with the other copy you try anything like that birgitte said eyes still forward and ill throw you over my bloody shoulder like a drunken man with a barmaid on a rowdy night and carry you back to camp light help me ill do it elayne elayne frowned remind me why exactly i gave you one of those medallions im not sure birgitte said it showed remarkable foresight and an actual sense of selfpreservation completely unlike you i hardly think that is fair birgitte i know it is extremely unfair for me to have to deal with you i wasnt certain youd noticed are all young aes sedai as reckless as you are or did i just end up with the pick of this particular litter stop whining elayne muttered maintaining a smile and a nod for the men who saluted as she passed im beginning to wish i had a towertrained warder then at least i wouldnt hear so much sauce birgitte laughed i dont think you understand warders half as well as you think you do elayne elayne let the matter die as they passed the traveling ground where sumeko and the other kinswomen were shuttling messengers back and forth from the battlefields for now elaynes agreement with them held in her dress pocket elayne carried egwenesthe amyrlin seats official reply regarding the kin and what elayne had done elayne could almost sense heat radiating from the letter but it was hidden behind official language and an agreement that now wasnt the time to worry about such things elayne would have to do more work there egwene would eventually see the logic of letting the kinswomen work in andor beneath elaynes supervision just beyond the traveling ground she noticed a tiredlooking shienaran accepting a waterskin from one of the two rivers men the topknotted man had an eyepatch and familiar features uno elayne asked with shock pulling moonshadow to a halt fie started nearly spilling water over himself as he drank elayne he asked wiping his brow with his sleeve id heard that youre the flaming the queen now i guess thats what should have happened with you being the bloody daughterheir sorry the daughterheir not bloody at all the shienaran man grimaced you can swear all you want uno elayne said dryly nynaeve isnt around what are you doing here the amyrlin he said she flaming wanted a messenger and i was bloody chosen already gave egwenes bloody report to your commanders for all the bloody good it will do weve set up our flaming battle positions and started scouting out kandor and the place is a bloody mess you want details elayne smiled ill hear the report from my commanders uno she said have a rest and go have a flaming bath you son of a shepherds boil uno blew a mouthful of water out at the comment elayne smiled shed heard that last curse from a soldier just the day before and still didnt know why it was considered to be so vile it had the proper effect i no flaming bath for me uno said er your majesty ive had my five minutes of rest the trollocs could attack soon up in bloody kandor and i wont have the others fighting without me he saluted her hand across chest and bowed before hurrying back toward the traveling ground pity birgitte said he was a good drinking companion id have liked him to stay a little while through the bond elayne felt a different reaction from her as she watched unos backside elayne blushed theres no time for that right now either of those things just looking birgitte said innocently i suppose we should go listen to the reports from the other battlefields we should elayne said firmly birgitte didnt voice her annoyance but elayne could feel it birgitte hated battle planning something elayne found odd in a woman who had fought in thousands of battles a hero who had saved countless lives during some of the great moments in history they came to the battle pavilion one of the few fullsized tents the army carried inside she found bashere conferring with several of the commanders abell cauthon gallenne and trom secondincommand of the whitecloaks galad himself like perrin was with the harrying forces at caemlyn elayne found trom surprisingly agreeablemuch more so than galad himself well she asked your majesty trom said bowing he didnt like the fact that she was aes sedai but he hid it well the others in the room saluted though bashere gave merely a friendly wave then pointed at their battle maps reports from all fronts are in bashere said refugees from kandor are flocking to the amyrlin and her soldiers and that includes a fair number of fighting men house soldiers or merchant guards for the most part lord ituraldes forces still await the lord dragon before moving on shayol ghul bashere knuckled his mustache once they move into that valley there wont be any retreat available and the borderlander army elayne asked holding bashere said pointing to another map showing shienar elayne wondered idly if uno wished he were fighting with the rest of his people at the gap last messenger said they feared being overwhelmed and were considering a controlled retreat elayne frowned are things so bad there they were supposed to hold until i could finish the trollocs in andor and join them that was the plan it was bashere agreed youre going to tell me that a plan in warfare lasts only until the first sword is drawn elayne said or maybe until the first arrow falls first lance is raised bashere said under his breath i realize that elayne said stabbing a finger at the map but i also know that lord agelmar is a good enough general to hold a pack of trollocs especially with the borderlander armies there to back him up they are holding for now bashere said but theyre still being mightily pressed he held up a hand to her objection i know youre worried about a retreat but i counsel that you shouldnt try to overrule agelmar he deserves his reputation as a great captain and hes there while we are far away he will know what to do she took a deep breath yes you are right do see if egwene can send him any troops meanwhile we need to win our battle here quickly fighting on four fronts was going to drain resources quickly elayne had not only familiar terrain to fight on but also the best odds if the other armies could hold steady while she obliterated the trollocs in andor she could join lan and agelmar and turn the gap from a stalemate into a victory from there she could reinforce egwene and reclaim kandor elaynes army was the linchpin of the entire operation if she didnt win in andor the other armies would have no eventual reinforcement lan and ituralde would waste away losing wars of attrition egwene might have a chance depending on what the shadow hurled her direction elayne didnt want to find out we need the trollocs to charge us she said now bashere nodded step up the harrying elayne said hit them with constant waves of arrows make it clear that if they dont charge were going to wear them down to nothing and if they just retreat back into the city trom asked the fires are dying down then like it or not well bring those dragons in to start leveling caemlyn we cannot wait any longer androl struggled to stay awake the drink they had given him it made him drowsy what was the purpose of that something to do with channeling androl thought in a daze the one power was lost to him though there was no shield what kind of drink could do that to a man poor emarin lay weeping in his bonds they had not managed to turn him yet but as the hours wore on he seemed closer and closer to breaking androl stretched twisting his head he could barely make out the thirteen men taim had been using for the process they slumped as they sat around a table in the dim room they were exhausted androl remembered taim yelling the day before he railed against the men claiming their work went too slowly they had expended much strength on the first men and women theyd turned and now they were apparently having a more difficult time pevara slept the tea had knocked her out theyd given it to androl after her but almost as an afterthought they seemed to forget about him much of the time taim had actually been angry when hed found his minions had given the tea to pevara hed wanted to turn her next apparently and the process required the victim to be able to channel release me androl twisted at the new voice abors and mishraile pulled someone in through the door a short woman with coppery skin toveine one of the aes sedai that logain had bonded nearby logaineyes closed looking as if hed been beaten by a mob of angry menstirred what are you doing toveine demanded light i she cut off as abors gagged her the thickbrowed man was one of those who had gone to taim willingly during the days before turning had begun androl tried thoughts still cloudy to pull his hands free from the bonds the ropes were bound more tightly that was right evin had noticed the bonds and retied them he felt so helpless useless he hated that feeling if there was one thing androl had dedicated his life to it was to never being useless always knowing something about the situation turn her next taims voice said androl twisted craning his neck taim sat at the table he liked to be there for the turnings but he wasnt watching toveine he fondled something in his hands some kind of disc he stood up suddenly tucking the object into a pouch at his waist the others complain about exhaustion from so much turning well if they turn this one she can join their ranks and lend her strength mishraile you come with me its time mishraile and several others joined taim theyd been standing where androl couldnt see them taim stalked toward the door i want that woman turned by the time i get back he said lan galloped across the rocky ground riding toward the gap for what seemed like the hundredth time though he had been fighting here less than a week prince kaisel and king easar fell in beside him riding hard what is it dai shan kaisel yelled another attack i did not see the emergency signal lan leaned down grimly in the dusk bonfires made of carcasses and wood blazing to either side of him as he led the charge of several hundred malkieri burning carcasses was difficult but not only did they need the light they wanted to deny the trollocs some meals lan heard something ahead something that horrified him something he had been dreading explosions the distant eruptions sounded like boulders crashing against one another each one made the air shake light queen ethenielle of kandor joined them galloping on her white gelding she yelled to him is that what i think it is lan nodded enemy channelers ethenielle called back to her retinue yelling something he did not catch she was a plump woman somewhat matronly for a borderlander her retinue included lord baldhereher swordbearerand the grizzled kalyan ramsin her new husband they approached the gap where warriors fought to keep the beasts contained a group of kandori riders near the bonfires at the front were suddenly thrown into the air lord mandragoran a figure in a black coat waved to them narishma hurried up his aes sedai accompanying him lan always had one channeler at the front lines but had given them orders not to fight he needed them fresh for emergencies like this one channeling lan asked slowing mandarb dreadlords dai shan narishma said panting maybe as many as two dozen twenty or more channelers agelmar said theyll cut through us like a sword through a spring lamb lan looked across the bitter landscape once his homeland a homeland hed never known he would have to abandon malkier admitting it felt like a knife twisting inside him but he would do it you have your retreat lord agelmar lan said narishma can you channelers do anything we can try to cut their weaves from the air if we ride up close enough narishma said but that will be hard perhaps impossible with them using just ribbons of fire and earth besides with so many on their side well theyll target us i fear we would be cut down a nearby blast rocked the earth and mandarb reared nearly throwing lan to the ground lan fought the horse nearly blind from the flash of light dai shan narishmas voice lan blinked tears from his eyes go to queen elayne lan bellowed bring back channelers to cover our retreat well be cut to ribbons without them go man agelmar was yelling the retreat bringing forward archers to target the channelers and drive them beneath cover lan unsheathed his sword galloping to bring the horsemen back light protect us lan thought yelling himself ragged and salvaging what he could of his cavalry the gap was lost elayne waited nervously just inside braem wood it was an old forest the type that seemed to have a soul of its own the ancient trees were its gnarled fingers reaching out of the earth to feel the wind it was difficult not to feel tiny in a wood like braem though many of the trees were bare elayne could feel a thousand eyes watching her from the depths of the forest she found herself thinking of the stories told to her as a child stories of the wood being full of brigandssome goodly others with hearts as twisted as those of darkfriends in fact elayne thought remembering one of the stories she turned to birgitte didnt you once lead a band of thieves out of this forest birgitte grimaced i was hoping you hadnt heard that one you robbed the queen of aldeshar elayne said i was very polite about it birgitte said she wasnt a good queen many claimed she wasnt the rightful one its the principle thats exactly why i did it birgitte frowned at least i think it was elayne didnt push the topic any farther birgitte always grew anxious when reminded that her memories of past lives were fading at times she had no recollection of her past lives at all at other times certain incidents would come flooding back to her only to disappear the next moment elayne led the rear guard which wouldin theorydo the bulk of the damage to the enemy dry leaves crunched as a winded messenger arrived from the traveling ground ive come from caemlyn your majesty the woman said with a bobbing bow from her mount lord aybara has successfully engaged the trollocs they are on their way light they took the bait elayne said now we make our preparations go get some rest youll be needing all your strength soon enough the messenger nodded galloping away elayne relayed the latest news to talmanes the aiel and tam althor as elayne heard something in the forest she raised a hand stopping a guardswomans report moonshadow danced forward anxious past the men who crouched in the underbrush around elayne no one spoke the soldiers barely seemed to be drawing breath elayne embraced the source power flooded her and with it the sweetness of a world expanded the dying wood seemed more colorful within the embrace of saidar yes there was something climbing over the hills in the near distance her soldiers thousands of them whipping at horses past the point of exhaustion were fast approaching the wood elayne raised her spyglass to make out the twisting mass of trollocs chasing behind like black waves flooding onto an already shadowed land finally elayne exclaimed archers to the front the two rivers men scrambled out of the woods before her forming up just inside the tree line they were one of the smallest forces in her army but if reports on their prowess werent exaggerations theyd be as useful as an ordinary force of archers three times their size a few of the younger men began nocking arrows to bows hold elayne yelled those are our men coming toward you tam and his leaders repeated the order the men lowered their bows nervously your majesty tam said stepping up to her horse the lads can hit them at this range our soldiers are still too close elayne said we need to wait for them to break to the sides pardon my lady tam said but no two rivers man would miss a shot like this those riders are safe and the trollocs have bows of their own he was right on that last count some of the trollocs were pausing in their pursuit long enough to draw their massive blackwood bows perrins men were riding with their backs exposed and more than a few had darkfletched arrows protruding from their limbs or their horses loose elayne said archers loose birgitte relayed the orders as she rode down the line tam barked orders to those nearby elayne lowered the spyglass as a breeze blew through the forest crackling dried leaves rattling skeletal branches the two rivers men drew light could they really shoot that far and still be accurate the trollocs were hundreds of paces away arrows flew high like hawks breaking from their roosts shed heard rand brag about his bow and shed seen a two rivers longbow used on occasion but this so many arrows climbing into the air with incredible precision the arrows arced and dropped not a one falling too short they rained onto the trolloc ranks especially on the trolloc archers a few straggling trolloc arrows returned but the two rivers men had handily broken up their lines thats some fine archery birgitte said riding back up fine indeed the two rivers men loosed more volleys in quick succession as perrins riders entered the forest crossbowmen elayne ordered drawing her sword and raising it high forward the legion of the dragon the two rivers men fell back into the trees and the crossbowmen came out she had two full banners of them from the legion of the dragon and bashere had drilled them well they formed three ranks one standing at a time to loose while the others reloaded while kneeling the death they sent at the trollocs hit like a crashing wave driving a tremble through the advancing army thousands falling dead elayne leveled her sword at the trollocs the two rivers men had climbed the branches of the first line of trees and were loosing arrows from them the men werent nearly as accurate from the precarious perches but they didnt need to be the trollocs faced death from the front and from above and the creatures began to stumble over their dead come on elayne thought the trollocs advanced forcing their way toward the archers a large contingent of trollocs broke off from the advance and headed to the east the roadway that bordered braem wood was that way and it would make sense for the trollocs to seize it then push along it to surround elaynes forces or so the fades would think fall back into the wood elayne said waving the sword hurry the crossbowmen each loosed one more bolt then melted into the forest pushing through the underbrush the two rivers men dropped to the ground then moved carefully through the trees elayne turned and rode in at a cautious trot a short distance into the forest she reached a banner of alliandres ghealdanin standing in ranks with pikes and halberds be sure to fall back as soon as they hit elayne yelled to them we want to draw them deeper deeper into the forest where the siswataman awaited their arrival the soldiers nodded elayne passed alliandre herself sitting her horse with a small guard surrounding her the darkhaired queen did a horseback curtsy to elayne her men had wanted their queen to join berelain at mayenes hospital but alliandre had refused perhaps seeing elayne lead her troops directly had spurred the womans decision elayne left them behind as the first trollocs hit the wood grunting and yelling theyd have a difficult time fighting in the forest the humans could use the forest cover far more effectively ambushing the huge trollocs barreling through the woods skewering and hamstringing them from behind mobile forces of bowmen and crossbowmen could shoot from coverif they did it right the trollocs wouldnt even know which direction the arrows were coming from as elayne led her queens guard toward the roadway she heard distant explosions and screams from trollocs the slingmen were tossing aludras explosive roarsticks at the trollocs through the trees flashes of light reflected off dim tree trunks elayne reached the roadway just in time to see the trollocs led by several myrddraal in deep black cloaks come pouring onto it they could quickly flank elaynes forcebut the band of the red hand had already set up the dragons on the road talmanes stood with hands clasped behind his back atop a pile of boxes overlooking his force the banner of the red hand flapped behind him a bloody palm stamped on a field of redfringed white with aludra yelling out measurements aiming instructions and the occasional curse at dragoners making mistakes or moving too slowly arrayed in front of talmanes were the dragons nearly a hundred of them strung across the broad roadway in four ranks spilling out into the fields around the roadway here elayne was too far away to hear him give the order to fire that was perhaps a good thing for the thunder that followed shook her as if dragonmount itself had decided to erupt moonshadow bucked neighing and elayne had to fight to keep the animal from tossing her on her backside in the end she plugged the horses ears with a weave of air as the dragoners rolled their weapons to the side and let the second rank open fire elayne plugged her own ears as she calmed moonshadow birgitte continued fighting her own terrified mount eventually leaping free but elayne paid little attention she peered through the smoke that choked the roadway the third line of dragons was rolling up to fire despite having her ears plugged she could feel the blast jolt the ground shake the trees the fourth round followed rattling her to the bones elayne breathed in and out stilling her heart waiting for the smoke to clear first she made out talmanes standing tall the first line of dragons had rolled back into place reloaded the other three ranks were hastily doing their own reloads slipping powder and the large metal spheres into place a strong breeze from the west cleared the smoke enough for her to see elayne gasped softly thousands of trollocs lay in smoldering pieces many blown off the road completely arms legs strands of coarse hair pieces lay scattered amid holes in the ground fully two paces wide where there had once been many thousands of trollocs only blood broken bones and smoke remained many of the trees had been shattered into splintered trunks of the myrddraal that had been at the front there was no sign at all the dragoners lowered their flamesticks not firing their reloaded rounds a few surviving trollocs near the back scrambled away into the forest elayne looked at birgitte and grinned the warder looked on solemn while several guardswomen ran to chase down her horse well elayne asked unstopping her ears i think birgitte said those things are messy and imprecise and bloody effective yes elayne said proudly birgitte shook her head her horse was returned to her and she remounted i used to think that a man and his bow were the most dangerous combination this land would ever know elayne nowas if it werent bad enough that men channel openly and the seanchan use channelers in combatwe have those things i dont like the way this is going if any boy with a tube of metal can destroy an entire army dont you see elayne said there wont be war any more we win this and there will be peace as rand intends nobody but trollocs would go into battle knowing they face weapons like these perhaps birgitte said she shook her head maybe i have less faith in the wisdom of people than you do elayne sniffed raising her sword to talmanes who drew his and raised it back the first step in destroying this trolloc army had been taken chapter just another sellsword i realize there have been disagreements between us in the past adelorna bastine said riding beside egwene as they passed through camp adelorna was a slim regal woman her tilted eyes and dark hair bespoke her saldaean heritage i would not have you consider us enemies i have not egwene said carefully and do not she did not ask what adelorna meant by using the word us she was green and egwene had suspected for a time that she was the captaingeneral the name the greens gave to the head of their ajah that is well adelorna said some within the ajah have acted in foolishness they have been informed of their mistakes you will find no further resistance from those who should have loved you best mother whatever has passed let it be buried let it be buried egwene agreed amused now she thought after all of this the greens try to claim me well she would use them she had been worried that her relationship with them was beyond repair choosing silviana as her keeper had made many determine to treat her as an enemy egwene had heard whispers that many thought she would have chosen the red as her ajah despite the fact that she not only had a warder but had married him if i may ask egwene said is there a particular incident which has brought about this bridge across our difficulties some are willfully ignorant of what you did during the seanchan invasion mother adelorna said you proved to have the spirit of a warrior of a general this is something the green ajah must not ignore indeed we must embrace it as an example so it has been decided and so those who lead the ajah have spoken adelorna met egwenes eyes then bowed her head the implication was obvious adelorna was the head of the green ajah to speak it outright would not be appropriate but to give egwene this knowledge was to give a measure of trust and respect if you had truly been raised from us the action said you would have known who led us you would have known our secrets i give them to you there was also gratitude to the motion egwene had saved adelornas life during the seanchan assault of the white tower the amyrlin was of no ajahand egwene actually expressed this virtue more than any before her for she never had belonged to an ajah still this gesture was moving she rested her hand on adelornas arm in thanks then gave her leave to depart gawyn silviana and leilwin rode off to the side where egwene had sent them after adelorna asked for a private word that seanchan egwene vacillated between keeping her close to watch her and sending her far far away leilwins information about the seanchan had been useful so far as she could determine leilwin had told her the exact truth for now egwene kept her closeif only because she frequently thought of more questions about the seanchan leilwin acted more like a bodyguard than a prisoner as if egwene would trust her safety to one of the seanchan she shook her head riding among the gathered tents and campfires of the army most were empty as bryne had the men forming battle lines he expected the trolloc approach within the hour egwene found bryne calmly organizing his maps and papers in a tent near the center of the camp yukiri was there arms folded egwene dismounted and went in bryne looked up sharply mother he exclaimed causing her to freeze she looked down there was a hole in the floor of the tent and she had nearly stepped into it it was a gateway the other side appeared to open into the air itself looking down on the trolloc army which was crossing the hills the recent week had involved many skirmishes with egwenes archers and riders slaughtering trollocs who marched in force toward the hills and the border into arafel egwene peered through this gateway in the floor it was high up well outside of bow range but looking down through it at the trollocs made her dizzy im not sure if this is brilliant she said to bryne or incredibly foolhardy bryne smiled turning back to his maps winning wars is about information mother if i can see exactly what they are doingwhere they are trying to envelop us and how they are bringing in reservesi can prepare this is better than a battle tower i should have thought of it ages ago the shadow has dreadlords who can channel general egwene said peeking through this gateway could get you burned to a crisp thats not to mention draghkar if a flock of them tried to fly through this draghkar are shadowspawn bryne said ive been told that theyd die passing through the gateway i guess thats true egwene said but youd have a flock of dead draghkar in here regardless channelers can still attack through it i will take that chance the advantage offered is incredible id still rather you use scouts to look through the gateway egwene said not your own eyes you are a resource one of our most valuable risks are unavoidable but please take care to minimize them yes mother he said she inspected the weaves then eyed yukiri i volunteered mother yukiri said before egwene could ask how a sitter ended up doing simple gateway duty he sent to us asking if forming a gateway like thishorizontal instead of verticalwas possible i thought it an interesting puzzle she was not surprised he had sent to the grays there was a growing sentiment among them that just as the yellows specialized in healing weaves and the greens specialized in battle weaves the grays should take particular interest in weaves for traveling they seemed to consider travel part of their calling as mediators and ambassadors can you show me our own lines egwene asked certainly mother yukiri said closing the gateway she opened another letting egwene look down on the battle lines of her army as they formed up in defensive positions on the hills this was more efficient than maps no map could completely convey the lay of a land the way that troops moved egwene felt as if she were looking at an exact replica of the landscape in miniature vertigo hit her suddenly she was standing at the edge of a drop of hundreds of feet her mind reeled and she stepped back taking a deep breath you need to put a rope up around this thing egwene said someone could step right off or pitch headfirst while staring down bryne grunted i sent siuan for something like that he hesitated she didnt much like being sent though so she might come back with something completely useless i keep wondering yukiri said shouldnt there be a way to create a gateway like this but make it so it can only let light through like a window you could stand on it and look down without fearing that you could slip through with the right weaves you might be able to make it invisible from the other side stand on it light youd have to be mad lord bryne egwene said your battle lines seem very solid thank you mother they are also lacking bryne raised his head other men might have risen to the challenge but he did not perhaps it was all of that practice in dealing with morgase how so you form up the troops as usual egwene said archers at the front and on the hills to slow the enemy advance heavy cavalry to charge and hit then withdraw pikes to hold the line light cavalry to protect our flanks and keep us from being surrounded the soundest battle strategies are often those that are timetested bryne said we may have a large force with all of those dragonsworn but were still outnumbered we cant be more aggressive than ive been here yes you can be egwene said calmly she met his eyes this is unlike any battle youve ever fought and your army is not like any youve ever led general you have a major advantage that you are not taking into account you mean the aes sedai bloody right i do she thought light shed been spending too much time around elayne i did account for you mother bryne said i had planned for the aes sedai to be a reserve force to aid companies in disengaging so we can rotate in fresh troops pardon lord bryne egwene said your plans are wise and certainly some of the aes sedai should be used that way however the white tower did not prepare and train for thousands of years to sit out the last battle as a reserve force bryne nodded slipping a new set of documents out from underneath his pile i did consider other more dynamic possibilities but i did not want to overstep my authority he handed her the documents egwene scanned them raising an eyebrow then she smiled mat had not remembered so many tinkers around ebou dar brilliantly colored wagons grew like vibrant mushrooms on an otherwise dun field there were enough of them to make a bloody city a city of tinkers that would be like like a city of aiel it was just wrong mat trotted pips along the roadway of course there was an aiel city maybe there would be a tinker city someday too they would buy up all of the colored dye and everyone else in the world would have to wear brown there would be no fighting in the city so it would be downright boring but there also would not be a single bloody pot with a hole in the bottom for thirty leagues mat smiled patting pips he had covered over his ashandarei as best he could to make it look like a walking pole strapped to the side of the horse his hat lay inside the pack he had hung from the saddlebags along with all of his nice coats he had ripped the lace off the one he wore it was a shame but he did not want to be recognized he wore a crude bandage wrapped around the side of his head covering his missing eye as he approached the dal eira gate he fell into line behind the others awaiting permission to enter he should look just like another wounded sellsword riding into the city seeking refuge or perhaps work he made certain to slump in the saddle keep your head down good advice on the battlefield and when entering a city where people knew you he could not be matrim cauthon here matrim cauthon had left the queen of this city tied up to be murdered many would suspect him of the murder light he would have suspected himself beslan would hate him now and there was no telling how tuon would feel about him now that they had had some time apart yes best to keep his head down and stay quiet he would feel the place out if that was he ever reached the front of this bloody line who ever heard of a line to enter a city eventually he reached the gate the bored soldier there had a face like an old shovelit was halfcovered in dirt and would be better off locked in a shed somewhere he looked mat up and down you have sworn the oaths traveler the guard asked in a lazy seanchan drawl on the other side of the gate a different soldier waved over the next person in line yes i have indeed mat said the oaths to the great seanchan empire and the empress herself may she live forever im just a poor traveling sellsword once attendant to house haak a noble family in murandy i lost my eye to some bandits in the tween forest two years back while protecting a young child i discovered in the woods i raised her as my own but the soldier waved him on the fellow did not look as if he had been listening mat considered staying put out of principle why would the soldiers force people to wait in such a long line and give them time to think of a cover story only to not hear it out that could offend a man not matrim cauthon who was always lighthearted and never offended but someone else surely he rode on containing his annoyance now he just needed to make his way to the right tavern pity setalles place was not an option any longer that had mat stiffened in the saddle though pips continued his leisurely pace forward mat had just taken a moment to look at the other guard at the gate it was petra the strongman from valan lucas menagerie mat looked the other way and slumped again in his saddle then shot another glance over his shoulder that was petra all right there was no mistaking those log arms and that treestump neck petra was not a tall man but he was so wide an entire army could have taken shade in his shadow what was he doing back in ebou dar why was he wearing a seanchan uniform mat almost went over to talk to him as they had always been amiable but that seanchan uniform made him reconsider well at least his luck was with him if he had been sent to petra instead of the guard he had ended up talking to he would have been recognized for sure mat breathed out then climbed down to lead pips the city was crowded and he did not want the horse pushing someone over besides pips was laden down enough to look like a packhorseif the looker knew nothing of horsesand walking might make mat less memorable perhaps he should have started his search for a tavern in the rahad rumors were always easy to find in the rahad as was a game of dice it was also the easiest place to find a knife in your gut and that was saying something in ebou dar in the rahad people were as likely to take out their knives and begin killing as they were to say hello in the morning he did not go into the rahad the place looked different now there were soldiers camped outside it generations of successive rulers in ebou dar had allowed the rahad to fester unchecked but the seanchan were not so inclined mat wished them luck the rahad had fought off every invasion so far light rand should have just hidden there instead of going up to fight the last battle the trollocs and darkfriends would have come for him and the rahad would have left them all unconscious in an alley their pockets turned inside out and their shoes sold for soup money mat caught a glimpse of rand shaving but he squashed the image mat shouldered his way over a crowded canal bridge keeping a close eye on his saddlebags but so far not a single cutpurse had tried for them with a seanchan patrol on every other corner he could see why as he passed a man yelling out the days news with hints that he had good gossip for a little coin mat found himself smiling he was surprised at how familiar even comfortable this city felt he had liked it here though he could vaguely remember grumbling about wanting to be awayprobably just after the wall fell on him as matrim cauthon was not often one for grumblinghe now realized that his time in ebou dar had been among the best of his life plenty of cards and dice in the city tylin bloody ashes but that had been a fun game she had had the better of him time and again light send him plenty of women who could do that though not in rapid succession and always when he knew how to find the back door tuon was one come to think of it he would probably never need another she was enough of a handful for any man mat smiled patting pips on the neck the horse blew down mats neck in return strangely this place felt more like home to him than the two rivers did yes the ebou dari were prickly but all peoples had their quirks in fact as mat thought about it he had never met a people who were not prickly about one thing or another the borderlanders were baffling and so were the aielthat went without saying the cairhienin and their strange games the tairens and their ridiculous hierarchies the seanchan and their seanchanness that was the truth of it everyone outside the two rivers and to a lesser extent andor was bloody insane a man just had to be ready for that he strolled along careful to be polite lest he find a knife in his gut the air smelled of a hundred sweetmeats the chattering crowd a low roar in his ears the ebou dari still wore their colorful outfitsmaybe that was why the tinkers had come here drawn to the bright colors like soldiers drawn to dinneranyway the ebou dari women wore dresses with tight laced tops that showed plenty of bosom not that mat looked their skirts had colorful petticoats underneath and they pinned up the side or front to show them off that never had made sense to him why put the colorful parts underneath and if you did why take such pains to cover them over then go around with the outside pinned up the men wore long vests that were equally colorful perhaps to hide the bloodstains when they were stabbed no point in throwing away a good vest just because the fellow wearing it was murdered for inquiring after the weather though as mat walked along he found fewer duels than he had expected they never had been as common in this part of the city as in the rahad but some days he had hardly been able to take two steps without passing a pair of men with knives out this day he saw not a single one some of the ebou dariyou could often tell them by their olive skinwere parading around in seanchan dress everyone was very polite as polite as a sixyearold boy who had just heard that you had a fresh apple pie back in the kitchen the city was the same but different the feel was off a shade or two and it was not just that there were no sea folk ships in the harbor any longer it was the seanchan obviously theyd made rules since hed left what kind mat took pips to a stable that seemed reputable enough a quick glance at their stock told him that they were caring well for the animals and many were very fine it was best to trust a stable with fine horses though it cost you a little more he left pips took his bundle and used the stillwrapped ashandarei as a walking staff choosing the right tavern was as tough as choosing a good wine you wanted one that was old but not broken down clean but not too cleana spotless tavern was one that never saw any real use mat could not stand the types of places where people sat around quietly and drank tea coming there primarily to be seen no a good tavern was worn and used like good boots it was also sturdy again like good boots so long as the ale did not taste like good boots you would have a winner the best places for information were over in the rahad but his clothing was too nice to visit and he did not want to run into whatever the seanchan were doing there he stuck his head into an inn named the winter blossom and immediately turned around and stalked away deathwatch guards in uniform he did not want to take any slight chance of running into furyk karede the next inn was too well lit and the next too dark after about an hour of huntingand not a duel to be seenhe began to despair of ever finding the right place then he heard dice tumbling in a cup at first he jumped thinking that it was those blasted dice in his head fortunately it was just ordinary dice blessed wonderful dice the sound was gone in a moment carried on the wind through the throng of people in the streets hand on his coin purse pack over his shoulder he pushed through the crowd muttering a few apologies in a nearby alleyway he saw a sign hanging from a wall he stepped up to it reading the words the yearly brawl in copper on its face it had a picture of clapping people and the sounds of dice mixed with the smells of wine and ale mat stepped inside a roundfaced seanchan stood just inside the door leaning casually against the wall a sword on his belt he gave mat a distrustful stare well mat had never met a shoulderthumper who did not give that look to every man who entered mat reached up to tip his hat to the man but of course he was not wearing it bloody ashes he felt naked without it sometimes jame a woman called from beside the bar you arent glaring at customers again are you only the ones that deserve it kathana the man called back with a seanchan slur im sure this one does im just a humble traveler mat said looking for some dicing and some wine nothing more certainly not trouble and thats why youre carrying a polearm jame asked wrapped up like that oh stop it the woman kathana said she had crossed the common room and took mat by the sleeve of his coat dragging him toward the bar she was a short thing darkhaired and fairskinned she was not that much older than he was but she had an unmistakable motherly air dont mind him just dont make trouble and he wont be forced to stab you kill you or anything in between she plunked mat down on a bar stool and started busying herself behind the bar the common room was dim but in a friendly way people diced at one side the good kind of dicing the kind that had people laughing or clapping their friends on the back at a goodnatured loss no haunted eyes of men gambling their last coin here you need food kathana declared you have the look of a man who hasnt eaten anything hearty in a week howd you lose that eye i was a lords guard in murandy mat said lost it in an ambush thats a great lie kathana said slapping a plate down in front of him full of slices of pork and gravy better than most you said it really straight too i almost believe you jame you want food i have to guard the door he called back light man you expect someone to walk off with it get over here jame grumbled but made his way over to the bar beside mat settling down on a stool kathana put a mug of ale down and he took it up to his lips staring straight ahead im watching you he muttered to mat mat was not certain this was the right inn for him but he also was not certain he would be able to escape with his head unless he ate the womans food as instructed he took a taste it was pretty good she had moved over and was wagging a finger while lecturing a man at one of the tables she seemed the type who would lecture a tree for growing in the wrong spot this woman mat thought must never be allowed to enter the same room as nynaeve at least not when im within shouting distance kathana came bustling back she wore a marriage knife at her neck though mat did not stare for more than a few seconds on account of him being a married man she had her skirt pinned up on the side after the fashion of ebou dari commoners as she came back to the bar and readied a plate of food for jame mat noticed him watching her fondly and made a guess you two been married long mat asked jame eyed him no he finally said havent been on this side of the ocean for long i suppose that would make sense mat said taking a drink of the ale she set before him it was not bad considering how awful most things tasted these days this was only a little awful kathana walked over to the dicing men and demanded they eat more food as they were looking pale it was a wonder this jame fellow did not weigh as much as two horses she did talk some though so perhaps he could wiggle the information he needed out of her there dont seem to be as many duels as there used to be mat said to her as she passed thats because of a seanchan rule kathana said from the new empress may she live forever she didnt forbid duels entirely and a bloody good thing she didnt the ebou dari wont riot at something as unimportant as being conquered but take away our duels then youll see something anyway duels now have to be witnessed by an official of the government you cant duel without answering a hundred different questions and paying a fee its drained the whole life out of it all it has saved lives jame said men can still die by each others knives if they are determined they simply have to give themselves time to cool down and think duels arent about thinking kathana said but i suppose it does mean that i dont have to worry about your pretty face being cut up on the street jame snorted resting his hand on his sword the hilt mat noticed for the first time was marked with heronsthough he could not see if the blade was or not before mat could ask another question kathana marched away and began squawking at some men who had spilled ale on their table she did not seem the type to stand in one place for very long hows the weather to the north jame asked eyes still straight ahead dreary mat replied honestly as everywhere men say its the last battle jame said it is jame grunted if it is it would be a bad time for interfering with politics wouldnt you think bloody right it would be mat said people need to stop playing games and have a look at the sky jame eyed him thats the truth you should listen to what you are saying light mat thought he must think im a spy of some sort its not my choice mat said sometimes people will only listen to what they want to hear he took another bite of his meat which tasted as good as could be expected eating a meal these days was like going to a dance where there were only ugly girls this however was among the better of the bad that he had had the misfortune of eating lately a wise man might just learn the truth jame said you have to find the truth first mat said its harder than most men think from behind kathana snorted bustling past the truth is something men debate in bars when theyre too drunk to remember their names that means its not in good company i wouldnt put too much stock in it traveler the names mandevwin mat said im sure it is kathana said she looked him over then has anyone ever told you that you should wear a hat it would fit the missing eye quite well is that so mat said dryly you give fashion advice as well as forcefeeding men she swatted him on the back of the head with her cleaning rag eat your food look friend jame said turning toward him i know what you are and why you are here the fake eye bandage is not fooling me you have throwing knives tucked into your sleeves and six more on your belt that i can count ive never met a man with one eye who could throw worth a dried bean shes not as easy a target as you foreigners think youll never make it into the palace let alone through her bodyguards go find some honest work instead mat gaped at the man he thought mat was an assassin mat reached up and took off the bandage exposing the hole where his eye had been jame started at that there are assassins mat said calmly after tuon dont use her name like that kathana said beginning to snap her cleaning rag at him again mat reached up beside his head without looking catching the tip of the rag he held james eyes with his single one not flinching there are assassins mat repeated calmly after tuon jame nodded mostly foreigners who dont know the right way of things several have moved through the inn only one admitted the reason he was here i saw that his blood fed the dusty earth of the dueling grounds then i count you a friend mat said standing he reached into his bundle and took out his hat and put it upon his head who is behind it who has brought them in put the bounty on her head nearby kathana inspected his hat and nodded in satisfaction then she hesitated and squinted at his face this isnt what you think jame said he isnt hiring the best assassins theyre foreigners so they arent meant to succeed i dont care how bloody likely their chances are mat said who is hiring them hes too important for you to who mat said softly general lunal galgan jame said head of the seanchan armies i cant make you out friend are you an assassin or are you here hunting assassins im no bloody assassin mat said pulling the brim of his hat down and picking up his bundle i never kill a man unless he demands it demands it with screams and thunder so loudly i figure it would be impolite not to agree to the request if i stab you friend youll know that it is coming and you will know why i promise you that jame kathana hissed its him what now jame asked as mat brushed past raising his covered ashandarei to his shoulder the one the guards have been looking for kathana said she looked to mat light every soldier in ebou dar has been told to watch for your face how did you make it through the city gates by luck mat said then stepped out into the alleyway what are you waiting for moiraine asked rand turned toward her they stood in lans command tent in shienar he could smell the smoke of burning fields set aflame by lan and lord agelmars troops as they withdrew from the gap they were burning the lands they would rather defend a desperate tactic but a good one it was the sort of allin tactic that lews therin and his people in the age of legends had been hesitant to try at least at first it had cost them dearly then the borderlanders showed no such timidity why are we here moiraine pressed stepping up to him his maidens guarded the tent from the inside better to not let the enemy know rand was here you should be at shayol ghul right now that is your destiny rand althor not these lesser fights my friends die here i thought you were beyond such weaknesses compassion is not a weakness is it not she said and if in sparing your enemy because of compassion you allow them to kill you what then rand althor he had no answer you cannot risk yourself moiraine said and regardless of whether or not you agree that compassion itself can be a weakness acting foolishly because of it certainly is he had often thought about the moment when he had lost moiraine he had agonized over her death and he still reveled in her return at times however he had forgotten how insistent she could be i will move against the dark one when the time is right rand said but not before he must think i am with the armies that i am waiting to seize more ground before striking at him we must coax his commanders to commit their forces southward lest we be overwhelmed at shayol ghul once i enter it will not matter moiraine said you will face him and that will be the time of determination all spins on that moment dragon reborn all threads in the pattern are woven around your meeting and the turning of the wheel pulls you toward it do not deny that you feel it i feel it then go not yet she took a deep breath stubborn as ever and a good thing rand said stubbornness is what brought me this far rand hesitated then fished in his pocket he came out with something bright and silverya tar valon mark here he said holding it out to her ive been saving this she pursed her lips it cannot be the same one no that is long lost i fear ive been carrying this one around as a token almost without realizing what id been doing she took the coin turning it over in her fingers she was still inspecting it when the maidens looked with alertness toward the tent flap a second later lan lifted the flap and strode in flanked by two malkieri men the three could have been brothers with those grim expressions and hard faces rand stepped up resting his hand on lans shoulder the man did not look tireda stone could not look tiredbut he did look worn rand understood that feeling lan nodded to him then looked at moiraine have you two been arguing moiraine tucked the mark away face becoming impassive rand didnt know what to make of the interaction between the two of them since moiraines return they were civil but there was a distance between them that he had not expected you should listen to moiraine lan said turning back to rand she has prepared for these days longer than you have been alive let her guide you she wants me to leave this battlefield rand said and strike immediately for shayol ghul instead of trying to fight those channelers for you so you can retake the gap lan hesitated then perhaps you should do as she no rand said your position here is dire old friend i can do something and so i will if we cant stop those dreadlords theyll have you retreating all the way back to tar valon i have heard what you did at maradon lan said i will not turn away a miracle here if one is determined to find us maradon was a mistake moiraine said tersely you cannot afford to expose yourself rand i cannot afford not to either i wont just sit back and let people die not when i can protect them the borderlanders do not need to be sheltered lan said no rand replied but ive never known one who would refuse a sword when one was offered in a time of need lan met his eyes then nodded do what you can rand nodded to the two maidens who nodded back sheepherder lan said rand raised an eyebrow lan saluted him arm across his chest bowing his head rand nodded back there is something for you on the floor over there dai shan lan frowned then walked to a pile of blankets there were no tables in this tent lan knelt then raised a bright silvery crownthin yet strong the crown of malkier he whispered this was lost my smiths did what they could with old drawings rand said the other is for nynaeve i think it will suit her you have ever been a king my friend elayne taught me to rule but you you taught me how to stand thank you he turned to moiraine keep a space clear for my return rand seized the one power and opened a gateway he left lan kneeling holding the crown and followed his maidens out onto a black field burned stalks crunched beneath his boots and smoke wreathed the air the maidens immediately sought shelter in a small depression in the field huddling against the blackened earth prepared to weather the storm because one was certainly brewing trollocs milled in a large mass before rand prodding at the soil and at the remains of farmhouses the river mora rushed nearby this was the first cultivated land south of tarwins gap lans forces had burned it before preparing to retreat downriver ahead of the trolloc advance there were tens of thousands of the beasts here perhaps more rand raised his arms forming a fist drawing in a deep breath in the pouch at his belt he carried a familiar object the small fat man with the sword the angreal he had recently found at dumais wells he had returned there for one last look and found it buried in the mud it had been useful at maradon nobody knew he had it that was important but there was more to what he would do here than tricks trollocs shouted as the winds whipped up around rand this was not the result of channeling not yet it was rand being here confronting him seas grew choppy when different streams of water crashed into one another winds grew powerful when hot air and cool mixed and where light confronted shadow storms grew rand shouted letting his nature stir the tempest the dark one pressed upon the land seeking to smother it the pattern needed equalization it needed balance it needed the dragon the winds grew more powerful lightning breaking the air black dust and burned stalks flipping up twisting about in the maelstrom rand finally channeled as myrddraal forced the trollocs to attack him the beasts charged against the wind and rand directed the lightning it was so much easier to direct than control with a storm already in place he didnt need to force the lightninghe needed only to cajole it strikes destroyed the front groups of trollocs a hundred bolts of lightning in succession the pungent scent of burned flesh soon swirled in the storm joining the charred stalks of grain rand roared as the trollocs kept coming deathgates sprang up around him gateways that zipped across the ground like water striders sweeping trollocs into death shadowspawn could not survive traveling the stormwinds rose around rand as he struck down those trollocs who tried to reach him the dark one thought to rule here he would see that this land already had a king he would see that the fight would not a shield tried to sever rand from the source he laughed spinning trying to pinpoint the shields origin taim he yelled though the storm captured his voice and overwhelmed it i had hoped you would come this was the fight that lews therin had constantly demanded of him a fight rand hadnt dared begin not until now not until he had control he summoned his strength but then another shield struck at him and another rand drew in more of the one power tapping nearly all that he could through the fat man angreal shields continued to snap at him like biting flies none were strong enough to sever him from the source but there were dozens of them rand calmed himself he sought peace the peace of destruction he was life but he was also death he was the manifestation of the land itself he struck destroying an unseen dreadlord hiding in the rubble of a burned building nearby he summoned fire and directed it at a second burning him to nothingness he could not see the weaves of the women out therehe could only feel their shields too weak each shield was too weak and yet their attacks had him worried they had come quickly at least three dozen dreadlords each trying to cut him off from the source this was dangerousthat they had anticipated him that was why they had hit lan so hard with channelers to draw rand out rand fought off the attacks but none of them were in danger of truly shielding him a single person could not cut off someone holding as much saidin as he was they should have he saw it right before it happened the other attacks were cover feints one that was coming would be created by a circle of men and women a man would be leading there a shield slammed against him but rand had had just enough time to prepare he channeled spirit in the tempest weaving by instinct from lews therins memories and rebuffed the shield he shoved it away but could not destroy it light that had to be a full circle rand grunted as the shield slipped closer to him it made a vibrant pattern in the sky motionless despite the tempest rand resisted it with his own surge of spirit and air holding it back as if it were a knife hanging above his throat he lost control of the tempest lightning crashed around him the other channelers wove to enhance the stormthey didnt try to control it for they didnt need to it being out of control served them as at any moment it could strike rand he roared again louder this time more determined i will beat you taim i will finally do what i should have months ago but he did not let the anger the wildness force him into conflict he couldnt afford to he had learned better than that this was not the place he could not fight here if he did he would lose rand pushed with a surge of strength throwing back taims shield then used the moment of respite to weave a gateway his maidens went through immediately and rand ducking his head against the wind reluctantly followed he leaped into lans tent where moiraine had done as he requested and kept space open for him he closed his gateway and the winds stilled the noise dampened rand formed a fist panting sweat running down the sides of his face here back with lans army the tempest was distant although rand could hear it rumbling and faint winds stirred the tent rand had to fight to keep from sinking to his knees he sucked in large breaths with difficulty he slowed his racing heart and brought calmness to his face he wanted to fight not run he could have beaten taim and in so doing would have weakened himself so far that the dark one would have taken him with ease he forced his fist to open and wrestled control of his emotions he looked up at moiraines calm knowing face it was a trap she asked not so much a trap rand said as a battlefield wellprepared with sentinels they know what i did at maradon they must have teams of dreadlords waiting to travel to wherever im spotted and attack me you have seen the error in this line of attack she asked error no inevitability yes he couldnt fight this war personally not this time he would have to find another way to protect his people chapter a shard of a moment birgitte dashed through the forest accompanied by a group of thirty aiel all with bows out they made soundthey couldnt help but make soundbut the aiel made less than they should they would leap up onto fallen logs and run deftly along them or would find stones to step upon they would writhe out of the way of hanging branches ducking twisting moving here she said in a hushed tone rounding the side of a broken hill fortunately the cave was still there overgrown with vines a small creek running past it the aiel ducked in the water removing any scent of their passage two of the men continued down the game trail now moving much more loudly scraping against every branch they passed birgitte joined the ones hiding in the cavern it was dark inside and smelled of mold and earth had she hidden in this cave centuries ago when shed lived in these woods as a bandit she didnt know she rarely remembered any of her past lives sometimes only fleeting memories of the inbetween years during her life in the world of dreams before being brought into this world unnaturally by moghedien she considered that with sickness it was all right to be reborn fresh and new but to have her memoriesher very sense of selfripped away if she lost her memories of her time in the world of dreams would she forget gaidai completely would she forget herself she clenched her teeth its the last battle fool woman she thought who cares about that but she did a question had begun to haunt her what if in being cast out of the world of dreams birgitte had been broken from the horn she didnt know if it was possible she no longer remembered enough to tell but if she had shed lose gaidai forever outside leaves crunched twigs cracking the clatter was so loud she would have sworn that a thousand soldiers were marching pastthough she knew the fist of trollocs was only fifty strong still fifty had her band outnumbered she didnt worry though she complained to elayne that she didnt know much about warfare this hiding in a forest with a team of welltrained companions this shed done before dozens of times perhaps hundreds though her memories were so fuzzy she couldnt say for certain when the trollocs were nearly all the way past she and her aiel burst from cover the brutes had started down the false trail made by the two aielmen earlier and birgitte attacked them from behind downing a number of trollocs with arrows before the rest were able to react trollocs did not die easily they could often take two or three arrows before slowing well that only happened when you missed the eyes or the throat she never did monster after monster dropped to her bow the trollocs had begun downslope of the cave which meant every one she or the aiel killed was another corpse the others had to try to climb over to reach her fifty became thirty in mere seconds as that thirty rushed upward half of the aiel pulled out spears and engaged them while birgitte and the others took a few steps downslope and flanked the trollocs twenty became ten who tried to flee despite the wooded landscape they were easy to pick offthough it meant hitting them in the legs or back of the neck taking them down so that spears could finish them off ten of the aiel saw to the trollocs sticking a spear in each one to make certain it was dead others gathered arrows birgitte pointed to nichil and ludin two of the aiel and they joined her to scout the area her steps felt familiar these woods felt familiar not just because of past lives she could no longer remember during her centuries spent living in the world of dreams she and gaidai had spent many a year in these forests she remembered his caress upon her cheek her neck i cant lose this she thought fighting down panic light i cant please she didnt know what was happening to her she could remember something a faint discussion about about what she had lost it people couldnt be unbound from the horn could they hawkwing might know shed have to ask him unless she had already burn me movement in the forest stopped her cold she crouched down next to a rock bow out in front of her underbrush crackled close at hand nichil and ludin had vanished at the first sound light but they were good it took her a moment to pick them out hiding nearby she raised a finger pointed at herself then pointed before her she would scout they would cover her birgitte moved silently shed show these aiel that they werent the only ones who knew how to avoid detection besides these were her woods she wouldnt be shown up by a bunch of desert folk she moved stealthily avoiding thickets of withered thorn bushes were there more of those around of late they seemed to be one of the only plants that hadnt died off completely the ground smelled stale in a way that no forest should though that was overpowered by the stench of death and rot she passed another group of fallen trollocs the blood on them was dry they were several days dead elayne ordered her forces to bring back their dead thousands upon thousands of trollocs moved through these woods like crawling beetles elayne wanted them to find only their own dead hoping it would give them reason to fear birgitte moved toward the sounds she saw large shadows approaching in the dim light trollocs sniffing at the air the creatures continued to press through the woods they were forced to avoid the roads where an ambush of dragons could prove deadly elaynes plan called for teams like the one birgitte led to hack away at the trollocs leading groups of them off into the woods whittling down their numbers this group was far too big for her team to take unfortunately birgitte withdrew waving for the aiel to follow and slipped quietly back toward camp that night following his failure with lans army rand fled to his dreams he sought out his valley of peace appearing amid a grove of wild cherry trees in full bloom their perfume lacing the air with those beautiful pinkthroated white blossoms the trees almost looked aflame rand wore simple two rivers clothing after months in a kings garments of brilliant colors and soft textures the loose wool trousers and linen felt very comfortable he placed sturdy boots on his feet like those hed worn growing up they fit him in a way that no new boot no matter how well made ever could he wasnt allowed old boots any longer if his boots showed a hint of wear one servant or another made them vanish rand stood up in the dream hills and made himself a walking staff he then began to walk upward through the mountains this wasnt a real place not any longer hed crafted it from memory and desire somehow mixing both familiarity and a sense of exploration it smelled fresh of overturned leaves and sap animals moved in the underbrush a hawk cried somewhere distant lews therin had known how to create dreamshards like this though he had not been a dreamer most aes sedai of that era had made use of telaranrhiod in one way or another one thing they learned was how to slice out a dream for themselves a haven within their own mind more controlled than regular dreams they learned how to enter a fragment like this while meditating somehow giving the body rest as real as sleep lews therin had known these things and more how to reach into someones mind if they entered his dreamshard how to tell if someone else had invaded his dreams how to expose his dreams to others lews therin had liked to know things like a traveler who wanted to have one of everything useful in his rucksack lews therin had rarely used these tools hed left them stored on a back shelf in his mind gathering dust would things have gone differently if hed taken time each night to wander a peaceful valley such as this rand didnt know and truth be told this valley was no longer safe he passed a deep cavern to his left he had not put it there another attempt by moridin to draw him rand passed it by without looking the forest didnt seem as alive as it had moments ago rand kept walking trying to enforce his will upon the land he had not practiced that enough howeverso as he walked the forest grayed looking washed out the cavern came again rand stopped at its mouth cold humid air blew out over him chilling his skin smelling of fungus rand cast aside his walking staff then strode into the cavern as he passed into darkness he wove a globe of whiteblue light and hung it beside his head the glow reflected from the wet stone shining on smooth knobs and clefts panting echoed from deep within the cavern it was followed by gasps and splashes rand walked forward though by now he had guessed what this was he had begun to wonder if she would try again he came to a small chamber perhaps ten paces wide at the end of the tunnel where the stone sank down into a clear pool of water perfectly circular the blue depths seemed to extend downward forever a woman in a white dress struggled to stay afloat in the center of it the fabric of her dress rippled in the water forming a circle her face and hair were wet as rand watched she gasped and sank flailing in the crystalline water she came up a moment later gasping hello mierin rand said softly his hand formed into a fist he would not jump into that water to rescue her this was a dreamshard that pool could actually be water but more likely it represented something else his arrival seemed to buoy her and her vigorous thrashings became more effective lews therin she said wiping her face with one hand panting light where was his peace he felt like a child again a boy who thought baerlon the grandest city ever built yes her face was different but faces were no longer of much matter to him she was still the same person of all the forsaken only lanfear had chosen her new name she had always wanted one of those he remembered he remembered walking into grand parties with her on his arm her laughter over the music their nights alone he had not wanted to remember making love to another woman particularly not to one of the forsaken but he could not pick and choose what was in his mind those memories mixed with his own when he had desired her as the lady selene a foolish youthful lust he no longer felt these things but the memories of them remained you can free me lews therin lanfear said he has claimed me must i beg he has claimed me you pledged yourself to the shadow mierin rand said this is your reward you expect pity from me a dark something reached up and wrapped around her legs yanking her down into the abyss again despite his words rand found himself stepping forward as if to leap into the pool he held himself back he finally felt like a whole person again after a long fight that gave him strength but in his peace was a weaknessthe weakness he had always feared the weakness that moiraine had rightfully spotted in him the weakness of compassion he needed it like a helmet needed a hole through which to see both could be exploited he admitted to himself that it was true lanfear surfaced sputtering looking helpless must i beg she said again i dont think you are capable of it she lowered her eyes please she whispered rands insides twisted he had fought through darkness himself in seeking the light he had given himself a second chance should he not give one to another light he wavered remembering what it had felt like in that moment seizing the true power that agony and that thrill that power and that horror lanfear had given herself to the dark one but in a way rand had as well he looked into her eyes searching them knowing them finally rand shook his head youve grown better at this kind of deception mierin but not good enough her expression darkened in a moment the pool was gone replaced by a stone floor lanfear sat there crosslegged in her silverwhite dress wearing her new face but still the same so you are back she said sounding not entirely pleased well i am no longer forced to deal with a simple farmboy that is some small blessing rand snorted entering the chamber she was still imprisonedhe could sense a darkening around her like a dome of shadow and he stayed outside of it the pool howeverthe act of drowninghad been mere theatrics she was prideful but was not above maintaining a weak front when the situation required it if hed been able to embrace lews therins memories earlier rand would never have been fooled so easily by her in the waste then i shall address you not as a damsel in need of a hero lanfear said eyeing him as he walked around her prison but as an equal seeking asylum an equal rand said laughing since when have you ever considered anyone your equal mierin you care nothing for my captivity it pains me rand said but no more than it pained me when you swore yourself to the shadow did you know i was there when you revealed it you did not see me as i did not want to be seen but i was watching light mierin you swore to kill me did i mean it she asked turning to look him in the eyes had she no she had not meant it not then lanfear did not kill people that she thought would be useful and she had always considered him useful we shared something special once she said you were my i was an ornament to you rand snapped he breathed deeply trying to calm himself light but it was hard around her the past is done i care nothing for it and would gladly give you a second chance at the light unfortunately i know you youre just doing it again playing us all including the dark one himself you care nothing for the light you care only for power mierin you honestly want me to believe that youve changed you do not know me so well as you think that you do she said watching him as he rounded the perimeter of her prison you never did then prove it to me rand said stopping show me your mind mierin open it to me completely give me control over you here in this place of mastered dreams if your intentions are pure i will free you what you ask is forbidden rand laughed when has that ever stopped you she seemed to consider it she must actually have been worried about her imprisonment once she would have laughed at a suggestion such as this since this was ostensibly a place where he had complete control if she gave him leave he could strip her down delve within her mind i lanfear said he stepped forward right to the lip of the prison that tremble in her voice that felt real the first genuine emotion from her light he thought searching her eyes is she actually going to do it i cannot she said i cannot she said it the second time more softly rand exhaled he found his hand shaking so close so close to the light like a feral cat in the night stalking back and forth before the firelit barn he found himself angry angrier than before always she did this flirting with what was right but always choosing her own path i am done with you mierin rand said turning away and walking from the chamber forever you mistake me she called out you have always mistaken me would you show yourself to someone in that way i cannot do it i have been slapped too many times by those i should have trusted betrayed by those who should have loved me you blame this on me rand asked spinning on his heel she did not look away she sat imperious as if her prison were a throne you really remember it that way dont you rand said you think i betrayed you for her you said that you loved me i never said that never i could not i did not know what love was centuries of life and i never discovered it until i met her he hesitated then continued speaking so softly his voice did not echo in the small cavern you have never really felt it have you but of course who could you love your heart is claimed already by the power you so strongly desire there is no room left rand let go he let go as lews therin never had been able to even after discovering ilyena even after realizing how lanfear had used him he had held on to hatred and scorn you expect me to pity you rand had asked her he now felt just that pity for a woman who had never known love a woman who would not let herself know it pity for a woman who could not choose a side other than her own i she said softly rand raised his hand and then he opened himself to her his intentions his mind his self appeared as a swirl of color emotions and power around him her eyes opened wide as the swirl played before her like pictures on a wall he could hold nothing back she saw his motives his desires his wishes for mankind she saw his intentions to go to shayol ghul to kill the dark one to leave a better world than he had the last time he did not fear revealing these things he had touched the true power and so the dark one knew his heart there were no surprises here at least nothing that should have been a surprise lanfear was surprised anyway her jaw dropped as she saw the truth the truth that down deep it was not lews therin who made up rands core it was the sheepherder raised by tam his lives played out in moments his memories and feelings exposed last he showed her his love for ilyenalike a glowing crystal set upon a shelf and admired then his love for min aviendha elayne like a burning bonfire warming comforting passionate there was no love for lanfear in what he exposed not a sliver he had squelched lews therins loathing of her as well and so to him she really was nothing she gasped the glow around rand faded im sorry he said i really did mean it i am finished with you mierin keep your head down during the storm to come if i win this fight you will no longer have reason to fear for your soul there will be no one left to torment you he turned from her again and walked from the cave leaving her silent evening in the braem wood was accompanied by the scent of fires smoldering in their pits and the sounds of men groaning softly as they settled into uneasy sleep swords ready at hand an unnatural chill to the summer air perrin walked through the camp among the men under his command the fighting had been hard in these woods his people were hurting the trollocs but light there always seemed to be more shadowspawn to replace those that fell after seeing that his people were properly fed that the watch had been set and the men knew what to do if awakened in the night by an assault of shadowspawn he went seeking the aiel the wise ones in particular nearly all of them had gathered to go with rand when he marched on shayol ghulfor now they waited his orderbut a few had remained with perrin including edarra she and the other wise ones did not march at his command and yet like gaul they stayed with him when their fellows went elsewhere perrin had not asked them why he didnt really care why having them with him was useful and he was grateful the aiel let him pass their perimeter he found edarra sitting beside a fire well rimmed with stones to prevent the chance of a stray spark escaping these woods dry as they were could go up easier than a barn full of last harvests hay she glanced at perrin as he settled down near her the aiel looked young but smelled of patience inquisitiveness and control wisdom she did not ask why perrin had come to her she waited for him to speak are you a dreamwalker perrin asked she studied him in the night he had the distinct impression this was not a question a manor an outsiderwas supposed to ask he was surprised then when she answered no do you know much of it perrin asked some i need to know of a way to enter the world of dreams physically not just in my dreams but in my real body have you heard of such a thing she inhaled sharply do not think of that perrin aybara it is evil perrin frowned strength in the wolf dreamin telaranrhiodwas a delicate thing the more strongly perrin put himself into the dreamthe more solidly there he wasthe easier he found it to change things there manipulate that world that came at a risk however going into the dream too strongly he risked cutting himself off from his sleeping body in the real world that apparently didnt bother slayer slayer was strong there so very strong the man was in the dream physically perrin was increasingly sure of it our contest will not end perrin thought until you are the prey slayer hunter of wolves i will end you in many ways edarra muttered looking at him you are still a child for all the honor you have found perrin had grown accustomed to though not fond ofwomen who looked not a year or two older than he addressing him so none of the dreamwalkers will teach you this thing it is evil why is it evil perrin said to enter into the world of dreams in the flesh costs you part of what makes you human whats more if you die while in that placeand you are in the fleshit can make you die forever no more rebirth perrin aybara your thread in the pattern could end forever you yourself destroyed this is not a thing you should contemplate the servants of the shadow do this edarra perrin said they take these risks to dominate we need to take the same risks in order to stop them edarra hissed softly shaking her head do not cut off your foot for fear that a snake will bite it perrin aybara do not make a terrible mistake because you fear something that seems worse this is all i will say on the topic she stood and left him sitting by the fire chapter what must be done the army split before egwene as she rode forward toward the hills in southeastern kandor where they would shortly engage the advancing enemy she led over a hundred aes sedai many of them from the green ajah brynes tactical revisions had been quick and efficient he had something better than archers for breaking a charge something more destructive than heavy cavalry for causing sheer damage it was time to use it two other smaller forces of aes sedai made their way to the flanks of the army these hills might once have been lush and green now they were yellow and brown as if burned by sunlight she tried to see the advantages at least they would have sure footing and though the sky broke with periodic lightning rain seemed unlikely the approaching trollocs seemed to extend forever in either direction though egwenes army was enormous it suddenly felt tiny fortunately egwene had a single advantage the trolloc army was driven by a need to continue moving forward trolloc armies fell apart if they were not constantly advancing theyd start bickering theyd run out of food egwenes army was a barrier in their way and bait the shadowspawn couldnt afford to leave such a force as theirs at large and so egwene would draw them along a course she determined her aes sedai reached the battlefront bryne had split his army into large highly mobile strike units to hit the trollocs wherever and whenever they showed vulnerability the offensive structure of brynes forces seemed to confuse the trollocs at least that was how egwene read the shuffling in their ranks the churning movement the increase of noise trollocs rarely had to worry about being on the defensive trollocs attacked humans defended humans worried humans were food egwene reached the top of a low hill looking out at the plain in kandor where the trollocs amassed her aes sedai arraying in a long line to either side of her behind them the men of the army seemed uncertain they knew egwene and the others were aes sedai and no man was comfortable around aes sedai egwene reached to her side and slipped something long white and slender from the leather case tied to her belt a fluted rod voras saangreal it felt comfortable in her hand familiar though she had only used this saangreal once she felt as if it had claimed her and she it during the fight against the seanchan this had been her weapon for the first time she understood why a soldier might feel a bond with his sword the glow of the power winked on around the women in the line like a row of lanterns being lit egwene embraced the source and felt the one power flow into her like a waterfall filling her and opening her eyes the world became sweeter the scents of oil from armor and of beaten grass growing stronger within the embrace of saidar she could see the signs of color that the shadow wanted them to ignore the grass wasnt all dead there were tiny hints of green slivers where the grass clung to life there were voles beneath it she could now easily make out the ripples in the earth they ate at the dying roots and clung to life smiling widely she pulled the one power through the fluted rod within that torrent she was atop a sea of strength and energy riding a lone vessel and embracing the wind the trollocs finally surged into motion they roared a huge rush of weapons teeth stink and eyes that were too human perhaps the myrddraal had seen aes sedai up front and thought to attack and destroy the human channelers the other women waited for egwenes sign they were not in a circlea circle was best for one focused precise stream of the one power that wasnt the goal today the goal today was simply to destroy once the trollocs were halfway to the hills egwene began her offensive she had always been unusually strong in earth so she led with the most simple and destructive of weaves she sent threads of earth into the ground beneath the trollocs in a long line then heaved it up with the aid of voras saangreal it felt as easy as tossing a handful of pebbles into the air at this sign the entire line of women formed weaves the air rippled with glowing threads pure streams of fire of earth to heave of gusts of wind to blow the trollocs into one another and make them trip and tumble the trollocs that egwene had thrown into the air toppled back to the ground many of them missing legs or feet bones broke and trollocs screamed in agony as their fellows fell upon them egwene let the second rank stumble across the fallen then struck again this time she didnt focus on the earth but on metal metal in armor in weapons and on wrists she shattered axes and swords mail and the occasional breastplate this released fragments of metal with deadly speed the air grew red with spraying blood the next ranks tried to stop to avoid the shrapnel but the trollocs behind them had too much momentum they shoved their fellows forward into the zone of death and trampled them egwene also killed the next wave with exploding metal it was harder than casting up the earth but it also didnt give as much sign to the back ranks so she was able to continue killing without them realizing what they were doing by shoving their fellows forward then egwene returned to rupturing the earth there was something energizing about using raw power sending weaves in their most basic forms in that momentmaiming destroying bringing death upon the enemyshe felt as if she were one with the land itself that she was doing the work it had longed for someone to do for so long the blight and the shadowspawn it grew were a disease an infection egweneafire with the one power a blazing beacon of death and judgmentwas the cauterizing flame that would bring healing to the land the trollocs tried hard to push through the aes sedai weaves but that only put more and more of them into the white towers reach the greens lived up to their ajahs reputationreleasing wave after wave of destruction at the trollocsbut the other ajahs did well also the ground trembled and the air clogged with the howls of the dying bodies ripped flesh burned not a few of the soldiers in the front lines emptied their stomachs at the sight and still the aes sedai pounded the trolloc lines specific sisters sought out myrddraal as they had been ordered egwene struck one herself ripping its eyeless head from its neck with a weave of fire and air each fade they killed dropped fists of trollocs linked to them egwene doubled her attack she hit a rank with a wave of exploding earth then slammed a wave of air into the bodies as they fell pushing them back so they dropped onto the ranks behind she ripped holes in the earth and made the stones in the ground explode she butchered trollocs for what seemed like hours finally the shadowspawn broke the trollocs pulling back despite the whips of the myrddraal egwene took a deep breathshe was starting to feel limpand struck down more fades finally they too broke and fled back away from the hills egwene sagged in her saddle lowering her saangreal she wasnt sure exactly how much time had passed the soldiers nearby stared wide eyed their blood had not been required this day that was impressive gawyn said pulling his horse up beside hers it was as if they were assaulting city walls trying to run ladders to a siege only without the walls or the ladders theyll return egwene said tiredly we killed just a small percentage of them on the morrow or the day after at the latest they would try again new tactics perhapsthey might spread out waves of attackers to make it more difficult for the aes sedai to kill large batches of them at once we surprised them egwene said they will come stronger next time for now for this night weve held you didnt just hold egwene gawyn said with a smile you sent them running i dont know that ive ever seen an army so thoroughly trounced the rest of the army seemed to agree with gawyns assessment for they began to cheer raising weapons egwene forced back her fatigue and tucked away the fluted rod nearby other aes sedai lowered small statues bracelets brooches rings and rods they had emptied the white towers storehouse of every angreal and saangrealthe few of those they hadand distributed them among the sisters on the battlefront at the end of each day they would be collected and delivered to the women providing healing the aes sedai turned and rode back through the cheering army the time for sorrows would unfortunately come the aes sedai could not fight each battle for now however egwene was content to let the soldiers enjoy their victory for it was the very best kind the kind that left no holes in their ranks the lord dragon and his scouts have begun to reconnoiter shayol ghul bashere pointed to one of the shaded maps our resistance in kandor and shienar is forcing the shadow to commit more and more troops to those fights soon the blasted lands will be mostly empty save for a skeleton force of defenders he will be able to strike more easily then elayne nodded she could feel rand somewhere in the back of her mind he was worried about something though he was too distant for her to feel more than that he occasionally visited her at her camp in the braem wood but for now he was on one of the other battlefronts bashere continued the amyrlin should be able to hold in kandor considering the number of channelers she has im not worried about her but you are about the borderlanders elayne said yes theyve been pushed out of tarwins gap i wish they had been able to hold where they were but theyve been overwhelmed there is nothing to be done for it save siphon to them what aid we can bashere nodded perhaps lord mandragoran could reverse his retreat if he had more aes sedai or ashaman of which there were none to spare she had sent him some aes sedai from egwenes army to help him with his initial retreat and that had helped but if rand himself couldnt fight off the dreadlords there lord agelmar will know what to do elayne said the light willing hell be able to pull the trollocs away from more populated areas bashere grunted a retreat like thisalmost a routusually affords no chance for directing the course of battle bashere pointed toward the map of shienar elayne studied it the path of the trollocs would not avoid inhabited land fal dara mos shirare fal moran and with dreadlords city walls would be useless send word to lan and the lords of shienar she said quietly order fal dara and ankor dail burned along with fal moran and villages like medo theyre already burning what farmland they canemptying the cities as well evacuate the civilians to tar valon im sorry bashere said softly it is what must be done isnt it yes bashere said light what a mess well what did you expect neatness and simplicity footsteps on the leaves announced talmanes approaching with one of his commanders the cairhienin looked tired everyone did a week of battle was only the beginning but the thrill of the fight was dying now came the real work of the war days fighting or waiting to fight nights spent sleeping with sword in hand elaynes current location in the woodshed begun the morning a thousand paces further south but their constant retreat through the forest kept her movingwas ideal three small streams with easy access room for plenty of troops to camp trees atop the hill that worked as well as watchtowers a pity theyd have to leave this site behind in the morning the trollocs control the entire southern section of the forest bashere said knuckling his mustaches they are avoiding the clearings that means our cavalry wont be able to operate effectively the dragons are practically useless in here your majesty talmanes said entering the tent now that the trollocs are keeping off the roadways we have trouble doing any damage its nearly impossible to maneuver the dragon carts in the forest and when we do get a shot we kill more trees than we do shadowspawn what of that whatever it was that aludra was talking about her dragon teeth talmanes said its betterthe dragon shoots out a bunch of bits of metal rather than one ball it has a big spread to it and works reasonably well inside the forest but i maintain that the dragons are doing less damage than it is worth risking them to achieve i think that the forest has done us the good it can bashere said moving some trolloc tokens on their maps we have whittled down their numbers but theyre getting smart keeping to the thick woods and trying to surround us suggestions pull back bashere said head out to the east of here make for the erinin theres no bridge this far north talmanes said bashere nodded so you know what im going to ask you have a company of men who can build bridges send them with some of your dragons for protection and have them build raft bridges directly east of us the rest of us wont be far behind the open terrain there will give our cavalry and the dragons the chance to do more damage we can rely on the erinin to slow the trollocs especially once we torch the bridges a few dragons placed there should slow their progress well continue east to the alguenya and repeat the process then well be on the road to cairhien well head north and when we find a suitable place to make a standi think i know just the spotwell turn and face the shadow with cairhien at our backs surely you dont think well need to go all that way elayne said bashere stared at the map squinting as if seeing through the parchment itself to the land it depicted were stirring this battle he said softly but we dont control it were riding it as a man might ride a stampeding horse i cant say where the gallop will stop ill divert it ill send it through patches of thorns but i cant stop it not so long as the trollocs keep coming elayne frowned she couldnt afford an endless retreat she needed to defeat these shadowspawn as soon and as thoroughly as possible so she could join the remainder of her forces to lans and egwenes armies to beat back the invasions from the north that was the only way theyd win otherwise it wouldnt matter what rand was able to do against the dark one light what a mess do it perrin rested his hammer on his shoulder listening as the sweating young messenger relayed elaynes orders a gentle breeze blew through the branches of the forest behind the ogier fought in there hed worried they would refuse to endanger the trees but their fighting light perrin had never seen savagery to rival it these tactics arent bad tam said reading the orders the queen has a good head for warfare perrin waved away the messenger boy he passed galad and several of his whitecloak commanders conferring nearby she listens well to those who know their tactics perrin said and she doesnt interfere thats what i meant lad tam said with a smile being in charge isnt always about telling people what to do sometimes its about knowing when to step out of the way of people who know what theyre doing wise words tam perrin said turning northward i suggest you adopt them as you have command now perrin could see rand the colors swam rand speaking with moiraine on a bleak rocky ridge he did not recognize they were almost ready for the invasion of shayol ghul perrin felt a tug from rand growing stronger soon rand would need him perrin tam asked whats this nonsense about command you have our forces tam perrin said the men are working together now let arganda gallenne and galad assist you nearby grady held open a gateway through which the wounded from the most recent skirmish were being sent for healing berelain ran the hospital on the other side which the yellow ajah had placed in mayene the air coming from the other side was warm i dont know if theyll listen to me perrin tam said im just a common farmer they listened to you well enough before that was when we were traveling the wilderness tam said you were always nearby they answered to me on your authority he rubbed his chin i have a feeling from the way you keep looking north that you dont intend to be here much longer rand needs me perrin said softly burn me tam i hate itbut i cant fight along with you here in andor someone needs to watch rands back and it well its going to be me i know it somehow tam nodded well just go to arganda or gallenne and tell them theyre in charge of our men queen elayne is giving most of the orders anyway and men perrin yelled looking toward the assembled soldiers arganda was consulting with gallenne they turned to perrin as did the nearby members of the wolf guard along with galad and his whitecloaks young bornhald regarded perrin through dark eyes that one grew more and more unpredictable lately the light send galad had been able to keep him from the brandy you all accept my authority as granted by the crown of andor perrin asked of course lord goldeneyes arganda called i thought that was established im hereby making tam althor a lord perrin called i am making him steward over the two rivers in the name of his son the dragon reborn he carries all of my authority which is the dragons own authority if i do not survive this battle tam succeeds me the camp grew still then the men nodded several saluting tam tam groaned so softly perrin doubted anyone else could hear is it too late to turn you over to the womens circle for a good talkingto tam asked maybe a sound swat on the behind and a week spent carrying water for widow althone sorry tam perrin said neald try making a gateway to the black tower the young ashaman adopted a look of concentration it still doesnt work lord goldeneyes perrin shook his head hed heard the reports from lans battlefront that members of the black tower were fighting for the shadow something had happened there something terrible all right back to merrilor then perrin said neald nodded concentrating as he worked perrin turned to the men i hate to leave you but i have these hooks in me pulling me north i have to go to rand and theres just no arguing with it ill try to come back if i cant well i want you all to know that im proud of you all of you youre welcome in my home when this is over well open a cask or two of master alveres best brandy well remember those who fell and well tell our children how we stood when the clouds turned black and the world started to die well tell them we stood shoulder to shoulder and there was just no space for the shadow to squeeze through he raised mahalleinir toward them and he bore their cheering not because he deserved it but because they certainly did neald opened the gateway perrin started toward it then hesitated as his name was called he frowned looking at dain bornhald as the man hurried over perrin rested his hand on his hammer wary this man had saved his life against the trollocs and against a fellow whitecloak but perrin saw the dislike the man had for him he might not blame perrin for the death of his father but that didnt mean he likedor even acceptedperrin a word aybara bornhald said looking toward gaul standing nearby in private perrin waved gaul away and the aiel reluctantly retreated he stepped with bornhald away from the open gateway what is this about if its because of your father light just be quiet bornhald said glancing away i dont want to say this i hate saying this but you need to know light burn me you need to know know what aybara bornhald said taking a deep breath it wasnt trollocs who killed your family a shock went through perrins body im sorry bornhald said looking away it was ordeith your father insulted him he tore apart the family and we blamed the trollocs i didnt kill them but i didnt say anything so much blood what perrin grabbed the whitecloak by the shoulder but they said i mean light hed dealt with this already the look in bornhalds eyes when his met perrins dredged it all up again the pain the horror the loss the fury bornhald reached up and took perrins wrist then yanked it free of his shoulder this is an awful time to tell you this i know bornhald said but i couldnt keep it in i just we may fall light it might all fall i had to speak say it he pulled away moving back toward the other whitecloaks with eyes downcast perrin stood alone his entire world shaking then he pulled it back together he had dealt with this he had mourned his family it was over through he could and would go on light the old hurts returned but he shoved them down and turned his eyes toward the gateway toward rand and his duty he had work to do but ordeith padan fain this only added to that mans terrible crimes perrin would see that he paid one way or another he approached the gateway to travel to find rand where he was joined by gaul im going to a place you cannot my friend perrin said softly his pain subsiding im sorry youll go to the dream within a dream gaul said then yawned turns out im tired but im coming perrin aybara kill me if you wish me to remain behind perrin didnt dare push him on it he nodded perrin glanced behind him raising his hammer once more as he did so he caught a glimpse through the other gateway the one to mayene that grady still held open inside two whiterobed forms watched gaul he raised a spear to them how must it feel for a pair of warriors to wait out this the last battle perhaps rand should have tried to have the gaishain released from their vows for a few weeks well that would probably have turned every single aiel against him light protect the wetlander who dared tamper with jietoh perrin ducked through the gateway stepping onto the ground of merrilor from there he and gaul packed as if for a long tripfoodstuffs and water aplenty as much as they dared carry it took perrin the better part of a half hour to convince rands ashaman to tell him where their leader had gone finally a grudging naeff opened a gateway for perrin he left merrilor and stepped out into what seemed to be the blight only the rocks were cold the air smelled of death of desolation the fetor took perrin aback and it was minutes before he could sort out normal scents from the stench rand stood just ahead at the edge of a ridge arms folded behind his back a group of his advisors commanders and guards stood behind including moiraine aviendha and cadsuane at this moment though rand stood alone at the end of the ridge distant in front of them rose the peak of shayol ghul perrin felt a shiver it was distant but perrin could not mistake the intense determination in rands expression as he regarded the peak light perrin said is it time no rand said softly this is a test to see if he senses me perrin nynaeve asked from the hillside behind she had been speaking with moiraine and for once she didnt smell a twinge hateful something had happened between those two women i only need him for a moment perrin said walking up to join rand at the end of the outcropping of rock there were some aiel back there and perrin didnt want themparticularly any wise onesto hear what he was going to ask rand you have this moment and many perrin rand said i owe you dearly what is it you want well perrin looked over his shoulder would moiraine or nynaeve know enough to try to stop him probably women were always trying to keep a man from doing what he must as if worried hed break his neck never mind that it was the last battle perrin rand asked rand i need to enter the wolf dream telaranrhiod rand said perrin i dont know what you do there youve told me little i figured that you would know how to i know how to enter it one way perrin said whispering so that the wise ones and the others behind couldnt hear the easy way i need something else you know things you remember things is there anything in that ancient brain of yours that remembers how to enter into the world of dreams in the flesh rand grew solemn its a dangerous thing you ask as dangerous as going to do what youre about to do perhaps rand frowned if id known back when i well lets just say that some would call your request very very evil its not evil rand perrin said i know something evil when i smell it this isnt evil its just incredibly stupid rand smiled and still you ask the good options are gone rand better to do something desperate than to do nothing at all rand didnt reply look perrin said weve spoken of the black tower i know youre worried about it i will need to go there rand said expression darkening and yet its obviously a trap i think i know part of what is to blame perrin said theres someone i need to face and i cant beat him without being able to face him on equal terms there in the dream rand nodded slowly the wheel weaves as the wheel wills we will have to leave the blasted lands you cannot enter the dream from he trailed off then did something crafting a weave a gateway opened beside him something about it was different from ordinary ones i see rand said the worlds are drawing together compressing what was once separate is no longer so this gateway will take you into the dream take care perrin if you die in that place while in the flesh it can have ramifications what you face could be worse than death itself particularly now at this time i know perrin said i will need a way out can you have one of your ashaman make one of these gateways once a day at dawn say at the traveling grounds of merrilor dangerous rand whispered but i will do it perrin nodded in thanks the light willing we will see one another again rand said he held out his hand to perrin watch out for mat im honestly not sure what hes going to do but i have a feeling it will be highly dangerous for all involved not like us perrin said clasping rands forearm you and i were much better at keeping to the safe paths rand smiled may the light shelter you perrin aybara and you rand althor perrin hesitated and realized what was happening they were saying goodbye he took rand in an embrace you take care of him you two perrin said looking toward nynaeve and moiraine as he pulled back from the embrace you hear me oh now you want me to watch after rand nynaeve said hands on hips i dont believe i ever stopped perrin aybara dont think i didnt hear you two whispering over there youre doing something foolish arent you always perrin said raising a hand in farewell to thom gaul you certain you want to do this i am the aielman said loosening his spears and looking through rands gateway without another word the two hefted their heavy packs and stepped into the world of dreams chapter doses of forkroot light perrin whispered to gaul looking across the landscape its dying the boiling thrashing churning black sky of the wolf dream was nothing new but the storm that the sky had been foreshadowing for months had finally arrived wind blew in enormous gusts moving this way then that in unnatural patterns perrin closed his cloak then strengthened it with a thought imagining the ties holding it to be fixed strongly in place a little bubble of calmness extended out from him deflecting the worst of the winds it was easier than he anticipated as if hed reached for a heavy piece of oak and found it as light as pine the landscape seemed less real than it usually did the raging winds actually smoothed out hills like erosion at high speed in other places the land swelled up forming ripples of rock and new hillsides chunks of earth sprayed into the air shattering the land itself was coming apart he grabbed gauls shoulder and shifted the two of them away from the place it was too close to rand perrin suspected indeed as they appeared on the familiar plain to the souththe place where hed hunted with hopperthey found the storm less powerful they stowed their heavy packs laden with food and water in a thicket of bushes perrin didnt know if they could survive on food or water found in the dream but he didnt want to have to find out they should have enough here for a week or so and as long as they had a gateway waiting for them he felt comfortableor at least satisfiedwith the risks he was taking here the landscape here wasnt coming apart in the same way as it had been near shayol ghul however if he watched a section long enough he could catch bits of well everything being pulled up in the winds stalks of dead grain fragments of tree trunks gobs of mud and slivers of rockall were slowly being pulled toward those gluttonous black clouds after the way of the wolf dream when he looked back things that had been broken apart would often be whole again he understood this place was being consumed slowly as was the waking world here it was simply easier to see the winds whipped at them but werent so strong that he had to keep them at bay they felt like the winds at the beginning of a storm right before the rain and lightning the heralds of oncoming destruction gaul had pulled the shoufa over his face and looked about suspiciously his clothing had changed in shade to match the grasses you have to be very careful here gaul perrin said your idle thoughts can become reality gaul nodded then hesitantly unveiled his face i will listen and do as instructed it was encouraging that gauls clothing didnt change too much as they walked through the field just try to keep your mind clear perrin said free of thought act by instinct and follow my lead i will hunt like the gara gaul said nodding my spear is yours perrin aybara perrin walked through the field worried that gaul would accidentally send himself somewhere by thinking of it the man barely suffered any effects of the wolf dream however his clothing would change a little if he was startled his veil snapping into place without him reaching for it but that seemed to be the extent of it all right perrin said im going to take us to the black tower we hunt a dangerous prey a man named slayer you remember lord luc the lopinginny gaul said perrin frowned it is a type of bird gaul said from the threefold land i did not see this man often but he seemed to be the type who talked big but was inwardly a coward well that was a front perrin said and either way he is a very different person in the dreamhere he is a predator named slayer who hunts wolves and men hes powerful if he decides to kill you he can appear behind you in an eyeblink and imagine you captured by vines and unable to move youll be trapped as he slits your throat gaul laughed thats funny perrin asked you act as if it is something new gaul explained yet in the first dream wherever i go i am surrounded by women and men who could tie me in air with a thought and kill me at any time i am accustomed to being powerless around some perrin aybara it is the way of the world in all things still perrin said sternly if we find slayerhes a squarefaced fellow with eyes that dont seem totally alive and he dresses in dark leatheri want you to stay away from him let me fight him but you said youd obey gaul perrin said this is important he took hopper i wont have him taking you as well you dont fight slayer very well gaul said i give my oath on it i will not dance the spears with this man unless you order it perrin sighed imagining gaul standing with his spears put away letting slayer kill him because of this oath light but aiel could be prickly you can fight him if he attacks you perrin said but only as a means of escape dont hunt him and if im fighting him stay out of the way understand gaul nodded perrin put a hand on the aiels shoulder then shifted them in the direction of the black tower perrin had never been there before so he had to guess and try to find it the first shift was off taking them to a section of andor where grasscovered hills seemed to dance in the churning winds perrin would have preferred to just leap from hilltop to hilltop but he didnt think gaul was ready for that he used shifting instead after four or five tries perrin took them to a place where he spotted a translucent faintly purple dome rising in the distance what is it gaul asked our goal perrin said that is the thing keeping grady and neald from creating gateways to the black tower just as we were afflicted in ghealdan yes seeing that dome brought back memories vivid ones of wolves dying perrin suppressed them memories like that could lead to idle thoughts here he allowed himself a burning anger deep within like the warmth of his hammer but that was all lets go perrin said shifting them down in front of the dome it looked like glass pull me free if i collapse he said to gaul then stepped into the barrier it felt as if hed hit something incredibly cold it sucked away his strength he stumbled but kept his mind on his goal slayer killer of wolves hoppers murderer perrin straightened as his strength returned this was easier than it had been last time being in the wolf dream in the flesh did make him stronger he didnt have to worry about pulling himself into the dream too strongly and leaving his body to die in the real world he moved slowly through the barrier as if through water and stepped out onto the other side behind gaul reached out with a curious expression on his face then tapped the dome wall with his index finger gaul immediately dropped to the ground going limp like a doll his spears and arrows tumbled away from his body and he lay perfectly still his chest not rising perrin reached throughhis arm slowand seized gaul by the leg to pull him through once on the other side gaul gasped then rolled over groaning he sat up holding his head perrin quietly fetched the mans arrows and spears for him this is going to be a good experience for building our gaul said he stood up and rubbed his arm where hed hit the ground the wise ones call coming to this place as we do evil it seems to me they would enjoy bringing men here to teach them perrin eyed gaul he hadnt realized that the man had heard him speaking to edarra of the wolf dream what did i do to deserve your loyalty gaul perrin said mostly to himself gaul laughed it is not anything you did what do you mean i cut you down from that cage thats why you follow me thats why i began following you gaul said it is not why i remained come is there not a danger that we hunt perrin nodded and gaul veiled his face together they walked beneath the dome approaching the structure within it was a goodly distance from the edge of one of these domes to the center but perrin didnt want to jump and be surprised so they continued on foot crossing a landscape of open grasslands patched with groves of trees they walked for about an hour before they spotted the walls tall and imposing they looked like those around a large city perrin and gaul walked up to them gaul scouting with great care as if he expected to be fired upon at any moment however in the wolf dream these walls wouldnt be guarded if slayer were in here he would lurk at the heart of the dome at the center and hed probably have laid a trap perrin rested his hand on gauls shoulder and brought them to the top of the wall in an instant gaul prowled to one side crouching low and peeking into one of the covered guard posts perrin went to the inner edge of the wall looking in the black tower wasnt as imposing as the outside implied a distant village of huts and small houses and beyond that a large building project theyre arrogant wouldnt you say a feminine voice asked perrin jumped spinning summoning his hammer to his hands and readying a brick wall around himself for protection a short young woman with silver hair stood next to him standing straight as if to try to appear taller than she was she wore white clothing tied at the waist with a silver belt he didnt recognize the face but he did know her scent moonhunter perrin said almost a growl lanfear fm not allowed to use that name any longer she said tapping one finger on the wall hes so strict with names perrin backed away glancing from side to side was she working with slayer gaul appeared out of the guard post and froze seeing her perrin held out a hand to stop him could he jump to gaul and be away before she attacked moonhunter lanfear asked is that what the wolves call me thats not right not at all i dont hunt the moon the moon is mine already she leaned down resting her arms on the chesthigh battlement what do you want perrin demanded vengeance she whispered then she looked at him the same as you perrin im to believe you want slayer dead too slayer that orphan errand boy of moridins he doesnt interest me my vengeance will be against another who the one who caused my imprisonment she said softly passionately suddenly she looked toward the skies her eyes widened in alarm and she vanished perrin passed his hammer from one hand to the other as gaul crept forward trying to watch all directions at once what was that he whispered aes sedai worse perrin said with a grimace do the aiel have a name for lanfear gaul drew in a sharp breath i dont know what she wants perrin said shes never made any sense to me with any luck we merely crossed paths and she will go on with what she was about he didnt believe that not after what the wolves had told him earlier moonhunter wanted him light as if i didnt have enough trouble he shifted them down to the bottom of the wall and they continued toveine knelt beside logain androl was forced to watch as she caressed his chin his wearied eyes open and watching her with horror its all right she said sweetly you can stop resisting relax logain give in she had been turned easily apparently linked with thirteen halfmen it was easier for male channelers to turn female channelers and vice versa that was why they were having so much trouble with logain take him toveine said pointing at logain lets see this done once and for all he deserves the peace of the great lords bounty taims minions dragged logain away androl watched with despair taim obviously considered logain a prize turn him and the rest of the black tower would go easily many of the boys up above would come willingly to their fate if logain ordered them to it how can he keep fighting androl thought stately emarin had been reduced to a whimpering wreck after only two sessions though he hadnt yet been turned logain had suffered nearly a dozen and still he resisted that would change for taim now had women soon after toveines turning others had arrived sisters of the black ajah led by a horridly ugly woman who spoke with authority the other reds who had come with pevara had joined them drowsy concern flowed through pevaras bond to androl she was awake but full of that drink that stopped her from channeling androls own mind felt relatively clear how long had it been since theyd forced him to drink the dregs out of the cup theyd first given to emarin logain will not last much longer pevaras sending was laced with fatigue and growing resignation what are she cut off thoughts growing muddled burn me what are we going to do logain screamed in pain he hadnt done that before it seemed a very bad sign by the doorway evin stood and watched he looked over his shoulder suddenly jumping at something light androl thought could it be his madness caused by the taint is it still there androl noticed for the first time that he was shielded which they never did to captives unless letting their dose of forkroot wane so they could be turned that sent a spike of panic through him were they coming for him next androl pevara sent i have an idea what androl started coughing through his gag evin jumped then came over bringing out his water flask and pouring water on the gag aborsone of taims flunkieslounged against the wall he was holding the shield he glanced at androl but something at the other side of the room drew his attention androl coughed worse so evin untied the gag and rolled him to the side letting him spit out the water quiet now evin said glancing back at abors who was too far away to hear dont make them angry at you androl the turning of a man to the shadow was not perfect while it changed their allegiance it did not change everything about them the thing in evins head had his memories his personality andthe light sendhis failings have you convinced them androl whispered not to kill me i have evin said leaning low eyes frenzied they keep saying youre useless since you cant channel very well but none of them like making gateways to shuffle people about i told them youd do it for them you will wont you of course androl said its better than dying evin nodded they stopped your dose of forkroot theyll take you next after logain mhael was finally sent new women from the great lord women who arent tired from channeling all the time them and toveine and the reds mean it should go quickly now mhael should have logain by the end of the day ill serve them androl said ill swear to the great lord thats good androl evin said but we cant let you go until youve been turned mhael wont accept just an oath it will be all right i told them that youd turn easily you will wont you not resisting i wont resist thank the great lord evin said relaxing oh evin you never were terribly bright evin androl said softly you need to watch out for abors you know that right im one of them now androl evin said i dont have to worry about them thats good androl whispered what i heard him say about you must have been nothing evin fidgeted that look in his eyes it was fright the taint had been cleansed jonneth emarin and the other new ashaman would never have to suffer the madness it manifested differently in different ashaman and at different rates however the fear was the most common it came in waves it had been consuming evin when the cleansing happened androl had seen ashaman need to be put down as the taint overwhelmed them he knew that look in evins eyes well though the lad had been turned he still carried the madness with him he would do so forever what did he say evin said he didnt like it that you had been turned androl said he thinks youll take his place oh evin he might be planning to kill you take care evin stood up thank you androl he walked away leaving androl ungagged that cant possibly work pevara sent drowsily she hadnt lived among them long enough she hadnt seen what the madness could do and didnt know to recognize it in the eyes of the ashaman normally when one of them became like this they would take him and confine him until he rode it out if that didnt work taim added something to their wine and they didnt wake up if they werent stopped they would descend to destruction they would kill those closest to them lashing out first at people they should have loved androl knew that madness he knew it was inside of him too that is a mistake taim he thought you use our own friends against us but we know them better than you do evin struck at abors it came in a burst of the one power a second later androls shield dropped androl embraced the source he was not very strong but he had enough power to burn away a few ropes he rolled free of his bindings hands bloodied and took stock of the room he hadnt been able to see it before not entirely the room was bigger than hed assumed the size of a small throne room a wide circular dais dominated the far end topped by a double ring of myrddraal and women he shivered as he saw the fades light but that eyeless gaze was awful taims exhausted men stood by the far wall the ashaman who had failed to turn logain he sat on the dais slouching and tied to a chair in the center of the double ring like a throne logains head rolled to the side his eyes closed he appeared to be whispering something taim had spun furious toward evin who fought with mishraile beside abors smoking corpse evin and mishraile each held the one power wrestling on the floor a knife in evins hands androl scrambled toward emarin then nearly fell on his face as his legs gave out light he was weak but he did manage to burn away emarins bonds then pevaras she shook her head trying to clear it emarin nodded in gratitude can you weave androl whispered taims attention was on evins fight emarin shook his head the drink they gave us androl clung to the one power shadows began to lengthen around him no he thought no not now a gateway he needed a gateway androl sucked in the one power forming the weave for traveling and yet as before he hit some kind of barrierlike a wall preventing him from opening the gateway frustrated he tried to make one to a closer destination perhaps distance mattered could he make a gateway to canlers store above them he struggled against that wall fighting with everything he had he strained inching closer he could almost do it he felt as if something was happening please he whispered please open we need to get out of here evin fell to taims weave what was that taim bellowed i dont know mishraile said evin attacked us he had been talking to the pageboy and both spun toward androl androl stopped trying to make the gateway instead flinging a weave of fire in desperation toward taim taim smiled by the time androls tongue of fire reached him it vanished into a weave of air and water that dissipated it you are a persistent one taim said slamming androl against the wall with a weave of air androl gasped in pain emarin stumbled dizzily to his feet but a second weave of air knocked him down dazed androl felt himself hoisted up and pulled across the room the ugly woman wearing black stepped out of the circle of aes sedai and walked up beside taim so mhael she said you are not nearly as in control of this place as you indicated i have inferior tools taim said i should have been given more women earlier you ran your ashaman to exhaustion the woman replied you squandered their strength i will take charge here taim stood on the dais beside logains slumped form the women and the fades he seemed to consider this woman perhaps one of the forsaken a greater threat than anyone else in the room you think that will work do you taim asked when the naeblis hears of how you are bungling the naeblis i care not for moridin i have already provided a gift to the great lord himself beware i am in his favor i hold the keys in my hands hessalam you mean you actually did it you stole them taim smiled he turned back to androl who hung in the air struggling without success he wasnt shielded he flung another weave at taim but the man blocked it indifferently androl wasnt even worth shielding taim dropped him from the weaves of air androl hit the ground hard he grunted how long have you trained here androl taim asked you shame me that is the best you can do when trying to kill androl struggled to his knees he felt pain and worry from pevara behind her mind clouded with forkroot in front of him logain sat on his throne locked in place surrounded by the enemy the mans eyes were closed he was barely conscious we are done here taim said mishraile kill these captives we will take those above and carry them to shayol ghul the great lord has promised me more resources for my work there taims lackeys approached androl looked up from his knees the darkness grew all around shapes moving in the shadows the darkness it terrified him he had to let go of saidin he had to and yet he could not he had to begin weaving taim glanced at him then smiled and wove balefire shadows all around androl clung to the power the dead they come for me he wove by instinct the best weave he knew a gateway he hit that wall that blasted wall so tired shadows shadows will take me a whitehot bar of light sprang from taims fingers pointed right at androl androl shouted straining thrusting his hands forward and snapping his weave into place he hit that wall and heaved a gateway the width of a coin opened in front of him he caught the stream of balefire in it taim frowned and the room grew still stunned ashaman pausing their weaves at that moment the door to the room exploded inward canler holding the one power roared in he was followed by the twenty or so two rivers boys who had come to train in the black tower taim yelled embracing the source we are attacked the dome seemed to be centered on the building project hed noted that was bad with those foundations and pits slayer would have plenty of places to hide and ambush him once they reached the village perrin pointed to a particularly large building two stories built like an inn with a solid wooden roof im going to take you up there perrin whispered ready your bow yell if you spot anyone trying to sneak up on me all right gaul nodded perrin shifted them up onto the top of the building and gaul took position by the chimney his clothing blended to match the color of the clay bricks and he stayed low bow out it wouldnt have the range of a longbow but from here hed be deadly perrin dropped to the ground floating softly the last inch or so in order to keep from making noise he crouched and shifted to the side of a building just ahead he shifted again to the edge of the last building in the row before the excavation then looked over his shoulder gaul hidden quite well up above raised his fingers he had tracked perrin from here perrin crept forward on his belly not wanting to shift to a place he couldnt see directly he reached the lip of the first cavernous foundation hole and looked down on a dirt floor the wind still blew and dust swirled down below obscuring any tracks that might have been left perrin rose to a crouch and began to make his way around the perimeter of the large foundation where would the exact center of the dome be he couldnt tell it was too large he kept his eyes open his attention was so focused on the foundation holes that he nearly walked right into the guards a quiet chuckle from one of them alerted him and he shifted immediately jumping to the other side of the foundation and dropping to his knees two rivers longbow appearing in his hands he scanned the area hed left now distant fool he thought finally spotting them the two men lounged in a shack built beside the foundations the shack was the type of structure youd expect workers to take meals in perrin looked about anxiously but slayer did not rise out of hiding to attack him and the two guards failed to spot him he couldnt make out many details so he cautiously shifted back to near where hed been he dropped down into the foundation and created an earthen ledge on its side to stand on while peering over the lip of the hole into the shack yes there were two of them men in black coats ashaman he thought he recognized them from the aftermath of dumais wells where they had rescued rand they were loyal to him werent they had rand sent help for perrin light burn that man perrin thought couldnt he just be upfront with everyone for once of course even ashaman could be darkfriends perrin debated climbing out of the pit and confronting them broken tools lanfear said idly perrin jumped cursing to find her standing on the ledge beside him peeking up at the two men theyve been turned she said ive always found that to be a wasteful business you lose something in the transformationthey will never serve as well as if theyd come willingly oh theyll be loyal but the light is gone the selfmotivation the spark of ingenuity that makes people into people be quiet perrin said turned what do you mean is that thirteen myrddraal and thirteen dreadlords lanfear sneered such crudeness such a waste i dont understand lanfear sighed speaking as if she were explaining to a child those who can channel can be turned to the shadow by force in the right circumstances mhael has been having trouble here making the process work as easily as he should he needs women if hes going to turn men easily light perrin thought did rand know this could happen to people were they planning to do the same thing to him id be careful around those two lanfear said theyre powerful then you should be speaking more softly perrin whispered bah its easy to bend sound in this place i could shout for all im worth and they wouldnt hear theyre drinking you see they brought the wine through with them theyre here in the flesh of course i doubt their leader warned them of the dangers of that perrin looked up at the guards the two men sipped at their wine chuckling to one another as perrin watched the first slumped to the side then the other did as well they slipped out of their seats and hit the ground what did you do forkroot in the wine lanfear said why are you helping me perrin demanded fm fond of you perrin youre one of the forsaken i was lanfear said that privilege has been removed from me the dark one discovered i was planning to help lews therin win now i she froze looking toward the sky again what did she see in those clouds something that made her grow pale she vanished a moment later perrin tried to decide what to do he couldnt trust her of course however she was good with the wolf dream she managed to appear next to him without making any sound at all that was tougher than it seemed she had to still the air as it was moved out of the way when she arrived she had to land just precisely so that she didnt make noise and had to mute her clothings rustle with a start perrin realized that this time shed also been masking her scent hed only been able to smell herher scent was that of soft night lilyafter shed begun speaking to him uncertainly he crawled out of the pit and approached the shack both men were asleep what happened to men who slept in the dream normally this would have sent them back to the waking worldbut they were here in the flesh he shivered thinking of what had been done to them turned was that the word shed used light it seemed unfair not that the pattern is ever fair perrin acknowledged quickly searching through the hut he found the dreamspike driven into the ground under the table the silvery piece of metal looked like a long tent spike carved with designs down its length it was similar to the other one hed seen but not exactly the same he pulled it free then waited hand on his hammer expecting slayer to come for him hes not here lanfear said light perrin jumped hammer raised he turned why do you keep appearing like that woman he searches for me she said glancing skyward im not supposed to be able to do this and hes grown suspicious if he finds me hell know for certain and i will be destroyed captured and burned for an eternity you expect me to feel sorry for you one of the forsaken perrin snapped i chose my master she said studying him this is my priceunless i can find a way free of it what i think you have the best chance she said i need you to win perrin and i need to be at your side when you do he snorted you havent learned any new tricks have you take your offers elsewhere im not interested he turned the dreamspike over in his fingers he had never been able to figure out how the other one worked you have to twist it at the top lanfear held out a hand perrin eyed her you dont think i could have taken it on my own if id wanted she asked amused who was it who put mhaels little pets down for you he hesitated then handed it over she ran her thumb from tip to midlength and something clicked inside it she reached up and twisted the head about outside the faint wall of violet shrank and vanished she handed it back twist it again to set up the fieldthe longer you twist the larger it will growthen slide your finger in the reverse of what i did to lock it be careful wherever you set it will have ramifications in the waking world as well as this world and it will stop even your allies from moving in or out you can get through with a key but i do not know it for this spike thank you perrin said grudgingly at his feet one of the slumbering men grunted then rolled to his side is there is there really no way to resist being turned nothing they can do a person can resist for a short time she said a short time only the strongest will fail eventually if you are a man facing women they will beat you quickly it shouldnt be possible perrin said kneeling nobody should be able to force a man to turn to the shadow when all else is taken from us this choice should remain oh they have the choice lanfear said idly nudging one with her foot they could have chosen to be gentled that would have removed the weakness from them and they could never have been turned thats not much of a choice this is the weave of the pattern perrin aybara not all options will be good ones sometimes you have to make the best of a bad lot and ride the storm he looked at her sharply and you imply thats what you did you joined the shadow because it was the best option i dont buy it for a moment you joined for power everyone knows it think what you will wolf pup she said eyes growing hard ive suffered for my decisions ive borne pain agony excruciating sorrow because of what ive done in my life my suffering goes beyond what you could conceive and of all of the forsaken perrin said you chose your place and accepted it most readily she sniffed you think you can believe stories three thousand years old better to trust them than the words of one such as yourself as you wish she said then looked down again at the sleeping men if it helps you to understand wolf pup you should know that many think men like these are killed when the turning happens and then something else invades the body some think that at least she vanished perrin sighed then tucked the dreamspike away and shifted back to the rooftop as soon as he appeared gaul spun about drawing an arrow is it you perrin aybara its me i wonder if i should ask for proof gaul said arrow still drawn it seems to me that in this place one could easily change ones appearance perrin smiled appearance isnt all i know that you have two gaishain one you want one you do not neither seems content to act as proper gaishain if we live through this one might marry you one might gaul agreed lowering his bow its looking like ill have to take both or neither perhaps it is punishment for making them put away their spears though it is not my choice that makes them do so but their own he shook his head the dome is gone perrin held up the dreamspike it is what is our next task to wait perrin said settling down on the rooftop and see if removing the dome draws slayers attention what if it does not then we go to the next likely place to find him perrin said rubbing his chin and that is wherever there are wolves to kill we heard you canler yelled to androl amid the firefight burn me if it isnt true we were in my shop above and we heard you speak begging we decided we had to attack now or never weaves exploded through the room earth erupted and fire shot from taims people at the dais toward the two rivers men fades slunk across the room with cloaks that did not move unsheathing swords androl scrambled away from canler head low making for pevara jonneth and emarin at the side of the room canler had heard him the gateway hed made just before taim heaved him in air it must have opened so small he hadnt been able to see it he could make gateways again but only very small ones what good was that enough to stop taims balefire he thought reaching pevara and the others none of the three were in a state to fight he wove a gateway hitting the wall pushing to something changed the wall vanished androl sat stunned for a moment blasts and explosions in the room assaulted his ears canler and the others fought well but the two rivers lads faced fully trained aes sedai and maybe one of the forsaken they were dropping one by one the wall was gone androl stood up slowly then walked back toward the center of the room taim and his people fought on the dais the weaves coming from canler and his lads were flagging androl looked to taim and felt a powerful overwhelming surge of anger the black tower belonged to the ashaman not this man it was time for the ashaman to reclaim it androl roared raising his hands beside him and wove a gateway the power rushed through him as always his gateways snapped into place faster than any others growing larger than a man of his strength should be able to make he built this one the size of a large wagon he opened it facing taims channelers snapping it in place right as they released their next round of deadly weaves the gateway only covered the distance of a few paces and opened behind them weaves crafted by taims women and men hit the open gatewaywhich hung before androl like a haze in the airthen exploded out behind them weaves killed their own masters burning away aes sedai killing ashaman and the few remaining myrddraal straining at the exertion androl bellowed louder and opened small gateways on logains bonds snapping them he opened another one directly in the floor beneath logains chair dropping it from the room to a place far away from the black tower one that was the light send safe the woman called hessalam fled as she darted through a gateway of her own taim followed with a couple of others the rest were not so wise for a moment later androl opened a gateway as wide as the floor dropping the other women and ashaman through it to plummet hundreds of feet chapter your neck in a cord the tarasin palace of ebou dar was far from the most difficult place that mat had broken into he told himself that over and over again as he dangled outside a balcony three stories above the gardens he clung to a marble ledge with one hand while holding his hat on his head with the other his ashandarei strapped to his back hed stowed his bundle in the gardens below the night air was cool against the sweat running down the sides of his face above a pair of deathwatch guards clanked as they moved on the balcony blood and bloody ashes did those fellows never take off their armor they looked like beetles he could barely make them out the balcony was surrounded by an ironwork screen to keep people from looking in at the occupants from below but mat was close enough to see the guards moving inside through it light they were spending a long time in there mats arm started to ache the two men murmured to one another perhaps they were going to sit down and have some tea pull out a book start reading into the night tuon really needed to dismiss these two why were they having a leisurely conversation on a balcony there could be assassins out here eventually thank the light the two moved on mat tried to count to ten before swinging up but only lasted to seven he pushed open one of the unlatched screens and scrambled over the balcony railing mat exhaled softly arms aching this palacethose two guards notwithstandingwas nowhere near as impregnable as the stone had been and mat had gotten in there he had another advantage here of course he had lived in this palace free to come and go for the most part he scratched at his neck and the scarf he wore there for a moment it felt like a ribbon that felt like a chain mats father had an adage always know which way you are going to ride there never was a man as honest as abell cauthon and everyone knew it but some folklike those up in taren ferrycould not be trusted farther than they could spit in trading horses abell had always said you needed to be ready to ride and you always had to know which way you were going to go in his two months living in this palace mat had learned every way out every crack and passage every loose window which balcony screens were easy to open which were usually locked tight if you could sneak out you could sneak in he rested a moment on the balcony but did not enter the room it was attached to he was on the third floor where guests stayed he might have been able to sneak in this way but the guts of a building were always better guarded than the skin best to go up the outside doing so involved a lot of not looking down fortunately the side of the building was not difficult to scale stonework and wood with plenty of handholds he remembered chastising tylin about that once sweat crept down mats brow like ants down a hill as he crawled out onto the screen pulled himself upward and started toward the fourth level the ashandarei occasionally banged his legs from behind he could smell the sea on the breeze things always smelled better when one was up high perhaps that was because heads smelled better than feet did stupid thought that mat told himself anything to keep from thinking about the height he pulled himself up onto a piece of stonework slipping with one foot below and lurching he breathed in and out panting then continued on there above he could see tylins balcony her quarters had several of course he went for the one at her bedroom not the one attached to her sitting room that one was on the mol hara square and climbing there he would be as obvious as a fly in a white pudding he looked up again at the arabesquecovered iron balcony he had always wondered if he could climb to it he had certainly considered climbing out of it well he would not be a fool and try this sort of thing again that was for certain just this once and grudgingly matrim cauthon knew to look out for his own neck he had not survived this long by taking fool chances luck or no luck if tuon wanted to live in a city where the head of her armies was trying to have her assassinated that was her choice he nodded to himself he would climb up explain to her in very rational tones that she needed to leave the city and that this general galgan was betraying her then he could saunter on his way and find himself some games of dice that was why he had come to the city after all if rand was up north where all the trollocs were then mat wanted to be as far from the man as possible he felt bad for rand but any sane person would see that mats choice was the only one the swirl of colors started to form but mat suppressed it rational he would be very rational sweating cursing his hands aching mat pulled himself up to the balcony on the fourth floor one of the screen latches was loose here as it had been when he lived in the palace quick work with a small wire hook was all he needed to get in he entered the enclosed balcony took off the ashandarei then lay down on his back panting as if he had just run all the way from andor to tear after a few minutes of that he hauled himself to his feet then looked out the unlatched screen down four stories mat felt pretty good about that climb he picked up the ashandarei and went to the balcony doors tuon would undoubtedly have moved in here to tylins rooms they were the finest in the palace mat cracked the doors open he would just peek and something shot from the shadows before him and slammed into the door just above his head mat dropped rolling pulling out a knife with one hand and holding the ashandarei with the other the door creaked open from the force of the crossbow bolt lodged in its wood selucia looked out a moment later she had the right side of her head shaven clean the other side covered in cloth her skin was the color of cream but any man who thought her soft would soon learn otherwise selucia could teach sandpaper a thing or two about being tough she leveled a small crossbow at him and mat found himself smiling i knew it he exclaimed youre a bodyguard you always were selucia scowled what are you doing here you fool oh just going for a stroll mat said picking himself up and sheathing his knife the night air is said to be good for a fellow the sea breeze that sort of thing did you climb up here selucia asked glancing over the side of the balcony as if looking for a rope or ladder what you dont climb up normally its very good for the arms improves grip she gave him a suffering look and mat found himself grinning if selucia was on the lookout for assassins then tuon was probably all right he nodded toward the crossbow which was still leveled toward him are you going to she paused then sighed and lowered it many thanks mat said you could put a mans eye out with that thing and normally i wouldnt mind but im running short on eyes these days what did you do selucia asked dryly go dicing with a bear selucia mat said walking past her to enter the rooms that was quite near to a joke i should think that with a little effort we might be able to grow you a sense of humor that would be so unexpected we could put you in a menagerie and charge money to see you come see the marvelous laughing sojhin two coppers only tonight you bet the eye on something didnt you mat stumbled pushing open the door he chuckled light that was strangely close to the truth very cute its a bet i won he thought no matter how it may seem matrim cauthon was the only man to have diced with the fate of the world itself in the prize pouch of course next time they could find some fool hero to take his place like rand or perrin those two were so full of heroism it was practically dripping out their mouths and down their chins he suppressed the images that tried to form light he had to stop thinking of those two where is she mat asked looking about the bedchamber the sheets of the bed were disturbedhe earnestly did not imagine pink ribbons tied to that headboardbut tuon was nowhere to be seen out selucia said out its the middle of the night yes a time when only assassins would visit you are lucky that my aim was off matrim cauthon never you bloody mind that mat said youre her bodyguard i dont know what you mean selucia said making the little crossbow vanish into her robes i am sojhin to the empress may she live forever i am her voice and her truthspeaker lovely mat said glancing at the bed youre decoying for her arent you lying in her bed with a crossbow ready should assassins try to sneak in selucia said nothing well where is she mat demanded bloody ashes woman this is serious general galgan himself has hired men to kill her that selucia asked youre worried about that bloody right i am galgan is nothing to worry about selucia said hes too good a soldier to jeopardize our current stabilization efforts krisa is the one you should be worried about she has brought in three assassins from seanchan selucia glanced at the balcony doorway mat noticed for the first time a stain on the floor that might have been blood i have caught two so far pity i assumed you were the third she eyed him as if considering that he might against all logicsomehow be that assassin youre bloody insane mat said tugging on his hat and fetching his ashandarei im going to tuon that is no longer her name may she live forever she is known as fortuona you should not address her by either name but instead as highest one or greatest one ill call her what i bloody well please mat said where is she selucia studied him im not an assassin he said i dont believe that you are i am trying to decide if she would like me to tell you her location im her husband am i not hush selucia said you just tried to convince me you werent an assassin now you bring up that fool man she is in the palace gardens its the middle of the night selucia said yes i know she does not always listen to logic he caught a hint of exasperation in her tone she has an entire squad of the deathwatch guard with her i dont care if she has the creator himself with her mat snapped walking back toward the balcony im going to go sit her down and explain some things to her selucia followed and leaned against the doorway raising a skeptical gaze to him well maybe i wont sit her down really mat said looking through the open screen at the gardens below but i will explain to herlogicallywhy she cant just go wandering in the night like this at least ill mention it to her blood and bloody ashes we really are high up arent we normal people use stairs every soldier in the city is looking for me mat said i think galgan is trying to make me vanish selucia pursed her lips you didnt know about this mat asked she hesitated then shook her head its not impossible that galgan would be on the watch for you the prince of the ravens would be competition under normal circumstances he is general of our armies but that is a task often assigned to the prince of the ravens prince of the ravens dont bloody remind me mat said i thought that was my title when i was married to the daughter of the nine moons it hasnt changed at her elevation no selucia said not yet mat nodded then sighed as he looked at the climb ahead of him he lifted one leg up onto the railing there is another way selucia said come before you break your fool neck i do not know yet what she wants with you but i doubt it involves you falling to your death mat gratefully hopped off the balcony railing following selucia into the room she opened a wardrobe and then opened the back into a dark passageway enclosed in the wood and stone of the palace blood and bloody ashes mat said sticking his head in this was here all along yes this might be how it got in mat murmured you need to board this thing up selucia ive done better when the empress sleepsmay she live forevershe sleeps in the attic she never slumbers in this room we have not forgotten how easily tylin was taken thats good mat said he shuddered i found the thing that did that he wont be ripping out any more throats tylin and nalesean can have a little dance together about that farewell selucia thank you for the passageway she asked or for failing to kill you with the crossbow for not bloody calling me highness like musenge and the others mat muttered entering the passage he found a lantern hung on the wall and lit it with his flint and tinder behind him selucia laughed if that bothers you cauthon you have a very irritating life ahead of you there is only one way to stop being the prince of the ravens and that is to find your neck in a cord she closed the door to the wardrobe what a pleasant woman she is mat thought he almost preferred the days when she would not talk to him shaking his head he started down the passage realizing she had never told him exactly where it led rand strode through elaynes camp at the eastern edge of braem wood accompanied by a pair of maidens the camp was dark evening upon them but few slept they were making preparations to break camp and move the army east toward cairhien the next morning only two guards for rand tonight he felt almost exposed with two guards though once he had thought any number of guards at all to be excessive the inevitable turning of the wheel had changed his perception as surely as it changed the seasons he walked a lanternlit pathway that had obviously once been a game trail this camp hadnt been here long enough to have pathways otherwise soft noises broke the nights calm supplies being loaded on to carts sword blades being ground on whetstones meals being distributed to hungry soldiers the men did not call to one another not only was it night but the shadows forces were near in the forest and trollocs had good ears best to be in the habit of speaking softly not shouting from one side of the camp to another the lanterns had shields to give only a soft light and cook fires were kept to a minimum rand left the trail carrying his long bundle passing through rustling high grass in the clearing on his way to tams tent this would be a quick trip he nodded to those soldiers who saluted as he passed on the path they were shocked to see him but not surprised that he walked the camp elayne had made her armies aware of his earlier visit i lead these armies she had said as they parted last time but you are their heart you gathered them rand they fight for you please let them see you when you come and so he did he wished he could protect them better but he would simply have to carry that burden the secret it turned out had not been to harden himself to the point of breaking it had not been to become numb it had been to walk in pain like the pain of the wounds at his side and accept that pain as part of him two men from emonds field guarded tams tent rand nodded to them as they straightened up saluting ban alseen and dav althone once he would never have thought to see them salute they did it well too you have a solemn task men rand said to them as important as any on this battlefield defending andor my lord dav asked confused no rand said watching over my father take care you do it well he pushed into the tent leaving the maidens outside tam stood over a travel table inspecting maps rand smiled it was the same look tam had worn when inspecting a sheep that had gotten caught in the thicket you seem to think ill need watching tam said responding to that comment rand decided would be like walking up to an archers nest and daring anyone inside to hit him instead he set his bundle down on the table tam regarded the long clothwrapped bundle then tugged at its covering the cloth came off revealing a majestic sword with a blacklacquered sheath painted with entwined dragons of red and gold tam looked up with a question in his eyes you gave me your sword rand said and i wasnt able to return it this is a replacement tam slid the sword from its sheath and his eyes widened this is too fine a gift son nothing is too fine for you rand whispered nothing tam shook his head slipping the blade back into the sheath it will just end up in a trunk forgotten like the last one i should never have brought that thing home you put too much care into that blade he moved to hand the sword back rand put his hand over tams please a blademaster deserves a fitting weapon take itthat will ease my conscience light knows any burden i can lighten now will help in the days to come tam grimaced thats a dirty trick rand i know ive been spending my time with all kinds of unsavory types lately kings clerks lords and ladies tam reluctantly took the sword back think of it as a thankyou rand said from all the world to you if you had not taught me of the flame and the void all those years ago light tam i wouldnt be here right now id be dead im sure of that rand looked down at the sword to think if you hadnt wanted me to be a good archer id have never learned the thing that kept me sane through the rough times tam sniffed the flame and the void arent about archery yes i know they are a swordsmans technique theyre not about swords either tam said strapping the sword onto his belt but the flame and the void are about center tam said and about peace i would teach it to each and every person in this land soldier or not if i could his expression softened but light what am i doing lecturing you tell me where did you get this weapon i found it its as fine a blade as ive ever seen tam pulled it out again looking at the folds of the metal its ancient and used wellused cared for certainly but this didnt just sit in some warlords trophy case men have swung this blade killed with it it belonged to a kindred soul tam looked at him searching his eyes well i suppose i should try it out then come on in the night its early evening still tam said this is a good time the practice grounds wont be clogged rand raised an eyebrow but stepped aside as tam rounded the table and left the tent rand followed the maidens falling in behind them and trailed his father to the nearby practice grounds where a few warders sparred lit by glowing lanterns on poles near the rack of wooden practice weapons tam took the new sword out and moved into a few forms though his hair was gray his face creased around the eyes tam althor moved like a ribbon of silk in the wind rand had never seen his father fight not even spar in truth a piece of him had had trouble imagining gentle tam althor killing anything other than a grouse for the firepit now he saw lit by flickering lantern light tam althor slipped into the sword forms like a comfortable pair of boots oddly rand found himself jealous not of his father specifically but of any who could know the peace of sword practice rand held up his hand then the stump of the other many of the forms required two hands to fight as tam did was not the same as fighting with shortsword and shield as many men in the infantry did this was something else rand might still be able to fight but he could never do this no more than a man missing one foot could dance tam completed hare finds its hole sliding the weapon into its sheath in one smooth motion orange lantern light reflected off of the blade as it slipped into its cover beautiful tam said light the weight the construction is it powerforged i dont know rand said hed never had a chance to fight with it tam took a cup of water from a serving boy a few newer recruits ran through pike formations in the distance working late into the night every moment of training was precious particularly for those who were not often on the front lines new recruits rand thought watching them these too are my burden every man who fights he would find a way to defeat the dark one if he did not these men fought in vain youre worried son tam said handing the cup back to the serving boy rand calmed himself finding peace turning to tam he remembered from his old memories something from a book the key to leadership is in the rippling waves you could not find stillness on a body of water if there was turmoil underneath likewise you could not find peace and focus in a group unless the leader himself had peace within tam eyed him but did not challenge rand on the sudden mask of control that he had adopted instead tam reached to the side and took one of the balanced wooden practice swords from the rack he tossed it to rand who caught it standing with his other arm folded behind his back father rand said warningly as his father picked up another sparring sword this is not a good idea ive heard you became quite the swordsman tam said taking a few swipes with the practice sword to test its balance id like to see what you can do call it a fathers pride rand sighed holding up his other arm displaying the stump peoples eyes tended to slide off it as if they were seeing a gray man they didnt like the idea that their dragon reborn was flawed he never let them know how tired he felt inside his body was worn like a millstone that had worked for generations he was still tough enough to do his job and he would but light he felt tired sometimes carrying the hopes of millions was heavier than lifting any mountain tam didnt pay any heed to the stump he took out a handkerchief and wrapped it around one of his hands then tied it tight using his teeth i wont be able to grip a thing with my offhand he said swinging the sword again it will be a fair fight come on son tams voice carried authoritythe authority of a father it was the same tone he had once used to get rand out of bed to go muck the milking shed rand couldnt disobey that voice not tams it was just built into him he sighed stepping forward i dont need the sword to fight any longer i have the one power that would be important tam said if sparring right now had anything to do with fighting rand frowned what tam came at him rand parried with a halfhearted swing tam moved into feathers in the wind spinning his sword and delivering a second blow rand stepped back parrying again something stirred inside of him an eagerness as tam attacked a second time rand lifted the sword andby instinct brought his hands together only he didnt have his other hand to grip the bottom of the sword that left his grip weak and when tam hit again it nearly twisted the sword out of rands grip rand set his teeth stepping back what would lan say if hed seen this shoddy performance by one of his students what would he say hed say rand dont get into swordfights you cant win them not any longer tams next attack feinted right then came around and hit rand on the thigh with a solid thump rand danced backward smarting tam had actually hit him and hard the man certainly wasnt holding back how long had it been since rand had sparred with someone who was actually willing to hurt him too many treated him like glass lan had never done that rand threw himself into the fight trying boar rushes down the mountain he beat at tam for a few moments but then a slap from tams weapon almost twisted the sword from rands hand again the long swords designed for swordmasters were difficult to stabilize correctly without a second hand rand growled again trying to fall into a twohanded stance again failing hed learned by now to deal with what he had lostin normal life at least he hadnt spent time sparring since the physical loss although hed intended to he felt like a chair that was missing one of its legs he could balance with effort but not very well he fought he tried form after form but he barely held on against tams attacks he couldnt do it not well so why was he bothering in this activity he was defective sparring made no sense he turned sweat streaming from his brow and threw his coat aside he tried again stepping carefully on the trampled grass but again tam got the better of him nearly knocking his feet out from under him this is pointless why fight onehanded why not find another way why tam was doing it rand continued to fight defensive but he directed his attention to tam his father must have practiced fighting onehanded rand could read it in his movements the way he didnt tryby instinctto keep grabbing the hilt with his bound hand upon consideration rand probably should have practiced sparring onehanded many wounds could hurt the hand and some forms focused on arm attacks lan had told him to practice reversing his grips perhaps fighting with one hand would have come next let go son tam said let go of what everything tam came rushing in throwing shadows in the lantern light and rand sought the void all emotion went into the flame leaving him empty and whole at once the next attack nearly cracked his head rand cursed coming into heron in the reeds as lan had taught him sword up to block the next blow again that missing hand of his tried to grip the hilt one could not unlearn years of training in an evening let go wind blew through across the field carrying with it the scents of a dying land moss mold rot moss lived mold was a living thing for a tree to rot life had to progress a man with one hand was still a man and if that hand held a sword he was still dangerous tam fell into hawk spots the hare a very aggressive form he charged rand swinging rand saw the next few moments before they happened he saw himself raising his sword in the proper form to blocka form that required him to expose his sword to bad balance now that he had no second hand he saw tam slicing down on the sword to twist it in rands grip he saw the next attack coming back and taking rand at the neck tam would freeze before hitting rand would lose the spar let go rand shifted his grip on the sword he didnt think about why he did what felt right when tam came near rand flung his left arm up to stabilize his hand while pivoting his sword to the side tam connected weapon sliding off rands sword but not unhanding it tams backswing came as expected but hit rands elbow the elbow of the useless arm not so useless after all it blocked the sword effectively though the crack of it hitting sent a shiver of pain down rands arm tam froze eyes wideningfirst in surprise that hed been blocked then in apparent worry over connecting with a solid blow on rands arm he had probably fractured the bone rand tam said i rand stepped back folded his wounded arm behind his back and lifted his sword he breathed in the deep scents of a world wounded but not dead he attacked kingfisher strikes in the nettles rand didnt choose it it happened perhaps it was his posture sword out other arm folded behind his back that led him easily into the offensive form tam blocked wary stepping to the side in the brown grass rand swung to the side flowing into his next form he stopped trying to turn off his instincts and his body adapted to the challenge safe within the void he didnt need to wonder how the contest continued in earnest now swords clacking with sharp blows rand keeping his hand behind his back and feeling what his next strike should be he did not fight as well as he once had he could not some forms were impossible for him and he could not strike with as much force as he once could he did match tam to an extent any swordsman could tell who was the better as they fought or at least they could tell who had the advantage tam had it here rand was younger and stronger but tam was just so solid he had practiced fighting with one hand rand was certain of it he did not care this focus he had missed this focus with so much to worry about so much to carry he had not been able to dedicate himself to something as simple as a duel he found it now and poured himself into it for a time he wasnt the dragon reborn he wasnt even a son with his father he was a student with his master in this he remembered that no matter how good he had become no matter how much he now remembered there was still much he could learn they continued to spar rand did not count who had won which exchange he just fought and enjoyed the peace of it eventually he found himself exhausted in the good waynot in the worndown way he had begun to feel lately it was the exhaustion of good work done sweating rand raised his practice sword to tam indicating that he was through tam stepped back raising his own sword the older man wore a grin nearby standing near the lanterns a handful of warders began clapping not a large audienceonly six menbut rand had not noticed them the maidens lifted their spears in salute it has been quite a weight hasnt it tam asked what weight rand replied that lost hand youve been carrying rand looked down at his stump yes i believe it has been at that tylins secret passage led to the gardens opening up in a very narrow hole not far from where mat had begun his climb he crawled out brushing the dust off of his shoulders and knees then craned his neck back and looked up to the balcony far above he had ascended to the buildings heights then crawled out through its bowels maybe there was a lesson in that somewhere maybe it was that matrim cauthon should look for secret passages before deciding to scale a bloody fourstory building he stepped softly into the gardens the plants were not doing well these ferns should have far more fronds and the trees were as bare as a maiden in the sweat tent not surprising the entire land wilted faster than a boy at bel tine with no dancing partners mat was pretty sure rand was to blame rand or the dark one mat could trace every bloody problem in his life to one or the other those flaming colors moss still lived mat had not ever heard of moss being used in a garden but he could have sworn that here it had been made to grow on rocks in patterns perhaps when everything died off the gardeners used what they could find it took him some searching poking through dried shrubs and past dead flower beds to find tuon he had expected to find her sitting peacefully in thought but he should have known better mat crouched beside a fern unseen by the dozen or so deathwatch guards who stood in a ring around tuon as she went through a series of fighting stances she was lit by a pair of lanterns that gave off a strange steady blue glow something burned within them but it was not a regular flame the light shone on her soft smooth skin which was the shade of good earth she wore a pale asolma a gown that was split at the sides showing blue leggings underneath tuon had a slight frame he had once made the mistake of assuming that meant she was frail not so she had shaved her head again properly now that she was no longer hiding baldness looked good on her strange though it was she moved in the blue glow running through a sequence of hand combat forms her eyes closed she seemed to be sparring with her own shadow mat preferred a good knifeor better his ashandareito fighting with his hands the more space he had between himself and a fellow trying to kill him the better tuon did not seem to need either watching her he realized how fortunate he had been the night he had taken her unarmed she was deadly she slowed waving her hands in front of her in a gentle pattern then thrusting them quickly to the side she breathed in and brought her arms to the other side her entire body twisting did he love her the question made mat uncomfortable it had been scratching at the edges of his mind for weeks now like a rat trying to have at the grain it was not the sort of question matrim cauthon was supposed to have to ask matrim cauthon worried only about the girl on his knee and the next toss of the dice questions about matters like love were best left to ogier who had time to sit and watch trees grow he had married her that was an accident was it not the bloody foxes had told him he would she had married him back he still did not know why something to do with those omens she talked about their courtship had been more of a game than a romance mat liked games and he always played to win tuons hand had been the prize now that he had it what did he do with it she continued her forms moving like a reed in the wind a tilt this way then a wave of motion that way the aiel called fighting a dance what would they think of this tuon moved as gracefully as any aiel if battle were a dance most of it was done to the music of a rowdy barroom this was done to the swaying melody of a master singer something moved over tuons shoulder mat tensed peering into that darkness ah it was just a gardener an ordinarylooking fellow with a cap on his head and freckled cheeks barely worth noticing mat put him out of his mind and leaned forward to take a better look at tuon he smiled at her beauty why would a gardener be out at this time he thought must be a strange type of fellow mat glanced at the man again but had trouble picking him out the gardener stepped between two members of the deathwatch guard they did not seem to care mat should not either they must trust the man mat reached into his sleeve and freed a knife he raised it without letting himself think about why in doing so his hand brushed one of the branches ever so softly tuons eyes snapped open and despite the dim light she focused directly on mat she saw the knife in his hand ready to throw then she looked over her shoulder mat threw the knife reflecting blue light as it spun it passed less than a fingers width from tuons chin hitting the gardener in the shoulder as he raised a knife of his own the man gasped stumbling back mat would have preferred to take him in the throat but he had not wanted to risk hitting tuon rather than doing the sensible thing and moving away tuon leaped for the man hands shooting toward his throat that made mat smile unfortunately the man had just enough timeand she was just enough offbalancethat he managed to push backward and scramble between the baffled deathwatch guards mats second dagger hit the ground behind the assassins heel as he vanished into the night a second later three meneach weighing roughly the same as a small buildingcrashed down on top of mat slamming his face against the dry ground one stepped on his wrist and another ripped his ashandarei away from him stop tuon barked release him go after the other one you fools other one majesty one of the guards asked there was no other one then to whom does that blood belong tuon asked pointing at the dark stain on the ground that the assassin had left behind the prince of the ravens saw what you did not search the area the deathwatch guards slowly climbed off mat he let out a groan what did they feed these men bricks he did not like being called highness but a little respect would have been nice here if it had prevented him from being sat upon that was he climbed to his feet then held out his hand to a sheepish deathwatch guard the fellows face had more scars than skin he handed mat the ashandarei then went off to help search the garden tuon folded her arms obviously unshaken you have chosen to delay your return to me matrim delay my i came to bloody warn you not return to you im my own man you may pretend whatever you wish tuon said looking over her shoulder as the deathwatch guards beat at the shrubbery but you must not stay away you are important to the empire and i have use for you sounds delightful mat grumbled what was it tuon asked softly i did not see the man until you drew attention these guards are the best of the empire i have seen daruo there catch an arrow in flight with his bare hand and barrin once stopped a man from breathing on me because he suspected an assassin whose mouth was filled with poisons he was right its called a gray man mat said shivering theres something freakishly ordinary about themtheyre hard to notice hard to fixate upon gray man tuon said idly more myths come to life like your trollocs trollocs are real tuon bloody of course trollocs are real she said why wouldnt i believe that they are she looked at him defiantly as if daring him to mention the times she had called them myths this gray man appears to be real as well there is no other explanation for why my guards let him pass i trust the deathwatch guards well enough mat said rubbing his shoulder where one of them had placed his knee but i dont know tuon general galgan is trying to have you killed he could be working with the enemy hes not serious about having me killed tuon said indifferently are you bloody insane mat asked are you bloody stupid she asked he hired assassins from this land only not true killers that gray man is from this land mat pointed out that quieted her with whom did you gamble away that eye light was everyone going to ask him about it that way i went through a rough patch he said i made it through alive which is all that matters hmm and did you save her the one you went to rescue how did you know about that she did not reply i have decided not to be jealous you are fortunate the missing eye suits you before you were too pretty too pretty light what did that mean good to see you by the way mat said he waited a few moments usually when a fellow says something like that its customary to tell them that youre happy to see them as well i am the empress now tuon said i do not wait upon others and do not find it good that someone has returned their return is expected as they serve me you know how to make a fellow feel loved well i know how you feel about me and how is that you looked over your shoulder she shook her head i had forgotten that you are supremely good at saying that which has no meaning matrim when you saw me mat explained with a dagger in handas if to throw at youyou didnt call for your guards you didnt fear i was here to kill you you looked over your shoulder to see what i was aiming at thats the most loving gesture i think a man could receive from a woman unless youd like to sit on my knee for a little while she did not reply light but she seemed cold was it all going to be different now that she was the empress he could not have lost her already could he furyk karede the captain of the deathwatch guard soon arrived with musenge walking behind him karede looked like he had just found his house on fire the other deathwatch guards saluted him and seemed to wither before him empress my eyes are lowered karede said going down on his belly before her i will join those who failed you in spilling our lives before you as soon as a new squad has arrived to see to your protection your lives are mine tuon said and you do not end them unless i give you leave this assassin was not of natural birth but a creation of the shadow your eyes are not lowered the prince of the ravens will teach you how to spot this kind of creature so you will not be so surprised again mat was fairly certain that gray men were of natural birth but then so were trollocs and fades it did not seem appropriate to point this out to tuon besides something else in her orders drew his attention im going to do what now mat asked teach them tuon said softly you are prince of the ravens this will be part of your duties we need to talk about that mat said everyone calling me highness is not going to do tuon it just wont she did not reply she waited as the search proceeded and made no move to retreat to the palace finally karede approached again highest one there is no sign of the thing in the gardens but one of my men has found blood on the wall i suspect the assassin fled into the city he is unlikely to try again tonight tuon said while we are alerted do not spread news of this to the common soldiers or guards inform my voice that our ruse has stopped being effective and that we will need to consider a new one yes empress karede said bowing low again for now tuon said clear out and secure the perimeter i will be spending time with my consort who has requested that i make him feel loved thats not exactly mat said as the members of the deathwatch guard faded into the darkness tuon studied mat for a moment then began to disrobe light mat said you meant it im not going to sit on your knee tuon said pulling one arm out of her robe exposing her breasts though i may allow you to sit on mine tonight you have saved my life that will earn you special privilege it she cut off as mat grabbed her and kissed her she was tense with surprise in the bloody garden he thought with soldiers standing all about well within earshot well if she expected matrim cauthon to be shy she had a surprise coming he released her lips from the kiss her body was pressed against his and he was pleased to find her breathless i wont be your toy mat said sternly i wont have it tuon if you intend it to be that way i will leave mark me sometimes i do play the fool with tylin i did for sure i wont have that with you she reached up and touched his face surprisingly tender i would not have said the words i did if i had found in you only a toy a man missing an eye is no toy anyway you have known battle everyone who sees you now will know that they will not mistake you for a fool and i have no use for a toy i shall have a prince instead and do you love me he asked forcing the words out an empress does not love she said i am sorry i am with you because the omens state it so and so with you i will bring the seanchan an heir mat had a sinking feeling however tuon said perhaps i can admit that it is good to see you well mat thought guess i can take that for now he kissed her again chapter a silence like screaming loial son of arent son of halan had secretly always wanted to be hasty humans fascinated him of that he made no secret he was sure most of his friends knew though he could not be certain it amazed him what humans didnt hear loial could speak to them all day then find that they had heard only part did they think that someone would speak without intending for others to listen loial listened when they spoke every word out of their mouths revealed more about them humans were like the lightning a flash an explosion power and energy then gone what would it be like hastiness there were things to learn from hastiness he was starting to wonder if he had learned that particular lesson too well loial strode through a forest of toosilent trees erith at his side other ogier surrounding them all held axes on shoulders or carried long knives as they marched toward the battlefront eriths ears twitched she was not a treesinger but she could sense that the trees did not feel right it was horrible horrible indeed he could not explain the sense of a healthy stand of trees any more than he could explain the sensation of wind on his skin there was a rightness like the scent of morning rain to healthy trees it was not a sound but it felt like a melody when he sang to them he found himself swimming in that rightness these trees had no such rightness if he drew close to them he felt he could hear something a silence like screaming it was not a sound but a feeling fighting raged ahead of them in the forest queen elaynes forces carefully withdrew eastward out of the trees they were nearly to the edge of braem wood now once out they would march for the bridges cross them and burn them behind then the soldiers would launch volleys of destruction at the trollocs trying to cross the river after them on their own bridges bashere hoped to reduce the enemys numbers considerably at the erinin before they continued east loial was certain this would all make fascinating information for his book once he wrote it if he was able to write it he laid his ears flat as the ogier began their war song he lent his voice to theirs glad for the terrible songthe call to blood to deathas it filled the silence left by the trees he started running with the others erith at his side loial drew out in front axe raised above his head thoughts left him as he found himself angry furious at the trollocs they didnt just kill trees they took the peace from the trees the call to blood to death bellowing his song loial laid into the trollocs with his axe erith and the other ogier joining him and stopping the brunt of this trolloc flanking force he had not intended to lead the ogier charge he did anyway he hacked at the shoulder of a ramfaced trolloc shearing its arm free the thing yelled and fell to its knees and erith kicked it in the face throwing it back into the legs of a trolloc behind loial did not stop his song the call to blood to death let them hear let them hear swing after swing chopping dead wood that was all this was dead rotting horrible wood he and erith fell into place with elder haman whowith ears laid backlooked utterly fierce placid elder haman he felt the rage too a beleaguered line of whitecloakswhom the ogier had relieved stumbled back making way for the ogier he sang and fought and roared and killed hacking at trollocs with an axe meant for cutting wood and never flesh working with wood was a reverent business this this was killing weeds poisonous weeds strangling weeds he continued to chop the trollocs losing himself in the call to blood to death the trollocs began to fear he saw terror in their beady eyes and he loved it they were used to fighting men who were smaller than themselves well let the trollocs fight someone their own size they snarled as the ogier line forced them back loial landed blow after blow shearing through arms hacking through torsos he shoved his way between two bear trollocs laying about him with his axe yelling in furyfury now for what the trollocs had done to the ogier they should be enjoying the peace of the stedding they should be able to build sing and grow they could not because of these these weeds they could not the ogier were forced to kill the trollocs made builders into destroyers they forced ogier and humans to be like themselves the call to blood to death well the shadow would see just how dangerous the ogier could be they would fight and they would kill and they would do it better than any human trolloc or myrddraal could imagine by the fear loial saw in the trollocsby their terrified eyesthey were beginning to understand light galad exclaimed falling back from the thick of the fight light the ogier attack was terrible and glorious the creatures fought with ears drawn back eyes wide broad faces flat as anvils they seemed to transform all placidity gone they cut through ranks of trollocs hacking the beasts to the ground the second row of ogier made up mostly of females sliced up trollocs with long knives bringing down any who made it through the first line galad had thought trollocs fearsome with their twisted mix of human and animal features but the ogier disturbed him more trollocs were simply horrible but ogier were gentle softspoken kindly seeing them enraged bellowing their terrible song and attacking with axes nearly as long as men were tall light galad waved the children back then ducked as a trolloc slammed into a tree nearby some of the ogier were seizing wounded trollocs by their arms and hurling them out of the way many of the other ogier were bloodsoaked to their waists hacking and chopping like butchers preparing meat now and then one of them fell but unarmored though they were their skin seemed tough light trom said moving up to galad have you ever seen anything like that galad shook his head it was the most honest answer he could think of if we had an army of those trom said theyre darkfriends golever said joining them shadowspawn for certain ogier are no more shadowspawn than i am galad said dryly look theyre slaughtering the trollocs any moment now theyll all turn on us golever said watch he trailed off listening to the ogier chant their war song one large group of trollocs broke fleeing back around cursing myrddraal the ogier didnt let them go enraged the giant builders chased after the trollocs longhandled axes chopping their legs dropping them in sprays of blood and cries of agony well trom asked maybe golever said maybe its a scheme of some kind to gain our trust dont be a fool golever trom said im not galad held up a hand gather our wounded lets head toward the bridge rand let the swirling colors fade from his vision it is nearly time for me to go he said to battle moiraine asked no to mat he is in ebou dar he had returned from elaynes camp to merrilor the conversation with tam still bounced around in his head let go it wasnt nearly so easy and yet something had lifted from him in speaking with his father let go there seemed a depth to tams words one far beyond the obvious rand shook his head he couldnt afford to waste time on such thoughts the last battle it had to claim his attention i have been able to draw close without drawing attention he thought fingering the deerhornhilted dagger at his belt it seems to be true the dark one cant sense me when i carry this before he could move against the dark one he had to do something about the seanchan if what thom said was true mat might be the key the seanchan had to join the dragons peace if they did not that is an expression i remember a soft voice said consternation you do it so well rand althor he turned toward moiraine beyond her on the table in his tent maps that aviendha had sent by messenger showed positions where his army could gather in the blight moiraine stepped up beside rand did you know that i used to spend hours in thought trying to discover what that mind of yours was conjuring it is a wonder i did not pull every hair from my head in frustration i was a fool for not trusting you rand said she laughed a soft laugh the laugh of an aes sedai who was in control you trusted me enough that was what made it all the more frustrating that you would not share rand breathed in deeply the air here at merrilor was sweeter than in other places he had coaxed the land here back to life grass grew flowers budded tree stumps and men he said to moiraine the two rivers has both and one is about as likely to budge as the other perhaps that is too harsh moiraine said it was not merely stubbornness that drove you it was a will to prove to yourself and to everyone else that you could do this on your own she touched his arm but you cannot do this on your own can you rand shook his head he reached up to callandor strapped on his back touching it the swords final secret lay bare to him now it was a trap and a clever one for this weapon was a saangreal not for just the one power but for the true power as well he had thrown away the access key but on his back he carried something so very tempting the true power the dark ones essence was the sweetest thing he had ever touched with callandor he could draw it forth in strength such as no man had ever before felt because callandor lacked the safety measures of most other angreal and saangreal there was no telling how much of the powers it could draw there it is again moiraine murmured what are you planning rand althor dragon reborn can you finally let go enough to tell me he eyed her did you set this entire conversation up to pull that secret from me you think very highly of my conversational abilities an answer that says nothing rand said yes moiraine said but might i point out that you did it first in deflecting my question rand thought back a few steps in the conversation and realized hed done just that im going to kill the dark one rand said im not just going to seal up the dark one im going to end him i thought you had grown up while i was away moiraine said only perrin grew up rand said mat and i have simply learned to pretend to be grown up he hesitated mat did not learn it so well the dark one is beyond killing moiraine said i think i can do it rand said i remember what lews therin did and there was a moment a brief moment it can happen moiraine im more confident that i can do that than i am that i could seal the dark one away that was true though he had no real confidence that he could manage either questions so many questions shouldnt he have some answers by now the dark one is part of the wheel moiraine said no the dark one is outside the pattern rand countered not part of the wheel at all of course the dark one is part of the wheel rand moiraine said we are the threads that make up the patterns substance and the dark one affects us you cannot kill him that is a fools task i have been a fool before rand said and i shall be one again at times moiraine my entire lifeall that ive donefeels like a fools task what is one more impossible challenge ive met all the others perhaps i can accomplish this one too she tightened her grip on his arm you have grown so much but you are still just a youth are you not rand immediately seized control of his emotions and did not lash back at her the surest way to be thought of as a youth was to act like one he stood straightbacked and spoke softly i have lived for four centuries he said perhaps i am still a youth in that all of us are compared to the timeless age of the wheel itself that said i am one of the oldest people in existence moiraine smiled very nice does that work on the others he hesitated then oddly he found himself grinning it worked pretty well on cadsuane moiraine sniffed that one well knowing her i doubt you fooled her as well as you assume you may have the memories of a man four centuries old rand althor but that does not make you ancient otherwise matrim cauthon would be the patriarch of us all mat why mat it is nothing moiraine said something i am not supposed to know you are still a wideeyed sheepherder at heart i would not have it any other way lews therin for all of his wisdom and power could not do what you must now if you would be kind fetch me some tea yes moiraine sedai he said immediately starting toward the teapot over the fire he froze then looked back at her she glanced at him slyly merely seeing if that still worked i never fetched you tea rand protested walking back to her as i remember i spent our last few weeks together ordering you around so you did moiraine said think about what i said regarding the dark one but now i ask you a different question what will you do now why go to ebou dar the seanchan rand said i must try to bring them to our side as i promised if i remember moiraine said you did not promise that you would try you promised that you would make it happen promises to try dont achieve much in political negotiations rand said no matter how sincere he held up his hand before him arm outstretched fingers up and looked out of his open tent flaps as if he were preparing to grab the lands to the south scoop them up claim them as his protect them the dragon on his arm shone gold and crimson once the dragon for remembrance lost he held up his other arm ending at the stump near the wrist twice the dragon for the price he must pay what will you do if the seanchan leader refuses again moiraine asked he hadnt told her that the empress had refused him the first time moiraine didnt need to be told things she simply discovered them i dont know rand said softly if they dont fight moiraine we will lose if they dont join the dragons peace then we have nothing you spent too much time on that pact moiraine said it distracted you from your goal the dragon does not bring peace but destruction you cannot change that with a piece of paper we shall see rand said thank you for your advice now and always i dont believe i have said that enough i owe you a debt moiraine well she said i am still in need of a cup of tea rand looked at her incredulous then he laughed and walked away to bring her some moiraine held her warm cup of tea which rand had fetched for her before leaving he had become ruler of so much since they had parted and he was as humble now as when she had first found him in the two rivers maybe more so humble toward me perhaps she thought he believes he can slay the dark one that is not the sign of a humble man rand althor such an odd mixture of selfeffacement and pride did he finally have the balance right despite what she had said his action toward her today proved he was no youth but a man a man could still make mistakes often they were of a more dangerous sort the wheel weaves as the wheel wills she murmured to herself sipping the tea prepared by rands hand and not someone elses it was as flavorful and vibrant as it had been during better days not touched in the least bit by the dark ones shadow yes the wheel wove as it willed sometimes she wished that weaving were easier to understand everyone knows what to do lan asked turning in mandarbs saddle andere nodded hed carried the word himself to the rulers and from them it had gone to their generals and commanders only at the last moments had it been passed to the soldiers themselves there would be darkfriends among them there always were it was impossible to exterminate rats from a city no matter how many cats you brought in the light willing this news would come too late for those rats to give warning to the shadow we ride lan said setting heels into mandarbs ribs andere raised his banner high the flag of malkier and galloped at his side he was joined by his ranks of malkieri many of those had only a little malkieri blood in them and were truly borderlanders of other nations they still chose to ride beneath his banner and had taken up the hadori thousands upon thousands of horsemen rode with him hooves shaking the soft earth it had been a long hard retreat for their army the trollocs had superior numbers and presented a serious threat of surrounding lans men lans mounted army was highly mobile but there was only so much speed you could force upon soldiers and trollocs could march quickly faster than people could particularly with those fades whipping them fortunately the fires in the countryside were slowing the shadows army without that lans men might not have been able to escape lan crouched in the saddle as the explosions from the dreadlords began to his left the ashaman deepe rode tied to his saddle because of his missing leg as a ball of fire crackled through the air and arced down toward lan deepe adopted a look of concentration and thrust his hands forward the fire exploded in the air above them burning embers fell like crimson rain trailing smoke one hit mandarbs neck and lan brushed it aside with a gauntleted hand the horse didnt seem to notice the ground here was of deep clay the terrain consisted of rolling hills covered with sere grass rocky outcrops and groves of defoliated trees the retreat followed the banks of the mora the river would prevent the trollocs flanking them from the west smoke bled from two distinct points on the horizon fal dara and fal moran the two grandest cities in shienar torched by their own people along with the lands of their farms and orchards everything that could provide even a handful of sustenance to the invading trollocs holding the cities had not been an option that meant they had to be destroyed it was time to start hitting back lan led a charge at the center of the mass and the trollocs set spears against the oncoming rush of malkieri and shienaran heavy cavalry lan brought his lance down setting it in position along mandarbs neck he leaned forward in his stirrups holding tightly with his knees and hoped that the channelerslan now had fourteen after a small reinforcement from egwenecould do their part the ground ripped up before the trollocs the front line of trollocs broke lan chose his target a massive boar trolloc that was yelling at its companions as they shied away from the explosions lan took the creature in the neck the lance pierced it and mandarb threw the trolloc to the side while trampling one of the cowering beasts nearby the roar of the cavalry became a crash as the riders hit hard letting momentum and weight carry them into the thick of the trollocs once they slowed lan tossed the lance to andere who caught it deftly lans guards moved in and he slipped his sword from its sheath woodsman tops the sapling apple blossom on the wind the trollocs made for easy targets when he was in the saddlethe trollocs height presented their necks shoulders and faces at just the right level it was quick brutal work deepe watched for attacks from the enemy dreadlords countering them andere moved up to lans side lans banner was a lodestone for the shadowspawn they began to roar and rage and he heard two trolloc words spoken over and over in their language murdru kar murdru kar murdru kar he laid about himself with his sword spilling their blood coldly within the void they had taken malkier from him twice now they would never be able to taste his sense of defeat his sense of loss at leaving his homeland again this time by choice but by the light he could bring them close to it his sword through their chests would do that best the battle descended into chaos as so many did the trollocs fell into frenzy his army had spent the last four days not engaging the beasts at all they had only retreated finally having gained some control over their withdrawal enough to avoid clashes at least which their fires had made possible four days without a conflict now this allout attack that was the first piece of the plan dai shan someone called prince kaisel he pointed to where the trollocs had managed to divide lans guard his banner was tipping andere the mans horse fell pulled down as lan urged mandarb between two trollocs prince kaisel and a handful of other soldiers joined him lan couldnt continue on horseback lest he accidentally trample his friend he threw himself from the saddle hit the ground and crouched beneath a trolloc swing kaisel took that beasts leg off at the knee lan dashed past the falling trolloc he saw his banner and a body beside it alive or dead lan did not know but there was a myrddraal raising a dark blade lan arrived in a rush of wind and spinning steel he blocked the thakandar blade with a swing of his own trampling his own banner as he fought within the void there was no time for thought there was only instinct and action there was there was a second myrddraal rising up from behind anderes fallen horse so a trap take down the banner draw lans attention the two fades attacked one from each side the void did not shake a sword could not feel fear and for that moment lan was the sword the heron spreads its wings slashing all around him blocking their blades with his own back and forth the myrddraal were like water flowing but lan was the wind itself he spun between their blades knocking back the attack to the right then the one to the left the fades began cursing in fury the one to his left rushed lan a sneer on its pale lips lan stepped to the side then parried the creatures thrust and lopped its arm off at the elbow he continued in a fluid stroke his swing continuing to where he knew the other fade would be attacking and took its hand off at the wrist both thakandar blades clanged to the ground the fades froze stupefied for a second lan cut the head of one from its neck then twisted and drove his sword through the neck of the other black pebbles on snow he stepped back and swiped his sword to the side to spray some of the deadly blood free of the blade both fades fell thrashing flailing at one another mindless dark blood staining the ground a good hundred and fifty trollocs nearby fell writhing to the ground theyd been linked to the fades lan stepped over to haul andere out of the mud the man looked dazed blinking and his arm hung at a strange angle lan tossed andere over his shoulder and kicked his banner by its staff up into his free hand he ran back toward mandarbthe area around him now clear of trollocsand handed the banner to one of prince kaisels men see that cleaned then raise it he slung andere across the front of his saddle mounted and wiped his sword on his saddle blanket the man didnt look mortally wounded he faintly heard prince kaisel behind by my fathers the man said id heard he was good but but light this will do lan said surveying the battlefield releasing the void send the signal deepe the ashaman complied sending a red streak of light into the air lan turned mandarb and pointed his sword back toward the camp his forces rallied around him their attack had always been meant to be a hit and retreat they hadnt maintained a solid battle line that was difficult with a cavalry charge his troops pulled back and the saldaeans and arafellin arrived riding in quick waves to break up the trolloc lines and protect the retreat mandarb was wet with sweat carrying two armored men was a difficult order for the horse following a charge lan slowed the pace now that they were out of direct harm deepe lan asked as they reached the back lines how is andere he has a few broken ribs a broken arm and a head injury deepe said id be surprised if he could count to ten on his own right now but ive seen worse ill heal the head wound the rest can wait lan nodded reining in one of his guardsa surly man named benish who wore a taraboner veil though he wore a hadori above ithelped take andere off mandarb they held him up beside deepes horse the onelegged ashaman leaned down from the arrangement of straps that supported him in the saddle placing his hand on anderes head and concentrating the dazed look left anderes eyes and awareness took over then he started swearing hell be fine lan thought looking at the battlefield the shadowspawn were now falling back it was near dusk prince kaisel cantered up beside lan that saldaean flag bears the red stripe of the queen he said shes riding with them again lan she is their queen she can do as she wishes you should talk to her kaisel said shaking his head its not right lan other women from the saldaean army are starting to ride with them as well ive seen saldaean women spar lan said still watching the battlefield if i were to place a bet on a contest between one of them and a man from any army in the south id bet on the saldaean any day but this war is everything or nothing if i could round up each woman in the borderlands and put a sword in her hands i would for now ill settle for not doing something stupidlike forbidding some trained and passionate soldiers from fighting if you however decide not to exercise that prudence you are free to tell them what you think i promise to give you a good burial once they let me take your head down off the pole i yes lord mandragoran kaisel said lan took out his spyglass and surveyed the field lord mandragoran kaisel said do you really think this plan will work there are too many trollocs lan said the leaders of the dark ones armies have been breeding them for years growing them like weeds trollocs eat a lot each one requires more food than a man to keep it going by now they must have eaten the blight out of anything that could sustain them the shadow expended every bit of food they could to create this army counting on the trollocs being able to eat the corpses of the fallen sure enough now that the battle had broken off the trollocs swarmed the field in their gruesome scavenging they preferred human meat but would eat their own fallen lan had spent four days running before their army not giving them any bodies to feast upon theyd managed it only because of the burning of fal dara and fal moran and other cities in western shienar scouring those cities for food had slowed the trollocs allowing lans army to get its feet underneath it and organize its retreat the shienarans had left nothing edible in any of the nearby cities four days without food the trollocs didnt use supply lines they ate what they came across theyd be starving ravenous lan studied them with his spyglass many did not wait for the cookpots they were far more animal than they were human theyre far more shadow than they are either one lan thought lowering his spyglass his plan was morbid but the light send it would be effective his men would fight and there would be casualties those casualties would become the bait for the real battle now lan whispered lord agelmar saw it too the horns blew and a yellow streak of light rose into the air lan turned mandarb the horse snorting at the command he was tired but so was lan both could stand another battle they had to taishar malkier lan roared lowering his sword and leading his force back onto the field all five borderlander armies converged on the fractured shadowspawn horde the trollocs had broken lines completely to fight over the corpses as lan thundered toward them he heard the myrddraal yelling trying to force the trollocs back into order it was far too late many of the famished beasts didnt look up until the armies were nearly upon them when lans forces hit this time the effect was very different from before earlier their attack had been slowed by the trollocs close ranks and they had managed to penetrate only a dozen paces before being forced to take up swords and axes this time the trollocs were spread out lan signaled the shienarans to hit first their line was so tight one would have been hardpressed to find an opening of more than two paces between the horses that left no room for the trollocs to run or dodge the riders trampled them in a thunder of hooves and clanking barding skewering trollocs on their lances firing horsebows laying about themselves with twohanded swords there seemed to be a special viciousness to the shienarans as they attacked wearing their openfronted helmets and armor made up of flat plates lan brought his malkieri cavalry in behind riding crossfield behind the shienarans to kill any trollocs that survived the initial onslaught once theyd passed the shienarans broke to the right to gather for another pass but the arafellin slammed in behind them slaying more shadowspawn that were attempting to form up after them came a wave of saldaeans crossing as the malkieri had then the kandori sweeping from the other direction sweatingswordarm tiredlan prepared again only then did he realize that prince kaisel himself was carrying the banner of malkier the lad was young but his heart was right though he was somewhat stupid about women light but we all are in one way or another lan thought nynaeves distant emotions in the bond comforted him he could not sense much over the distance but she seemed determined as lan began his second sweep the ground started exploding beneath his men the dreadlords had finally realized what was happening and had made their way back to the front lines lan directed mandarb around a crater that erupted in the ground just before him soil spraying across his chest the dreadlords appearance was his signal to stop the sweeps he wanted to ride in hit hard and ride out to fight the dreadlords hed have to commit all of his channelers which was something he didnt want to do blood and bloody ashes deepe swore as lan rounded another explosion lord mandragoran lan looked back deepe was slowing his horse keep moving man lan said reining in mandarb he signaled for his forces to keep riding though prince kaisel and lans battlefield guard stopped with him oh light deepe said concentrating lan surveyed the scene around them trollocs lay dead or dying howling or simply whimpering to his left the mass of shadowspawn was belatedly forming up theyd have a unified line soon and if lan and the others didnt move theyd find themselves alone on the field deepe had his eyes on a figure standing atop what appeared to be a large siege engine it had a flat bed and was perhaps twenty feet tall a group of trollocs were heaving it forward and it rolled on large wooden wheels yes there was a figure up there there were several of them balls of fire began to fall toward the borderlanders as they rode away and lighting flashed from the sky lan suddenly felt like a target on an archery practice field deepe its the mhael deepe explained taim had not been with the enemy army for the last week or sobut now the man had returned it seemed it was impossible to tell for sure because of the distance but the way the man flung weaves in rapid succession he seemed angry about something lets ride lan yelled i could take him deepe said i could lan saw a flash of light and suddenly mandarb reared lan cursed trying to blink the afterimage from his eyes there was something wrong with his ears too mandarb bucked and curvetted quivering it took a lot to shake the stallion but a lightning bolt that close would unnerve any horse a second flash of lightning threw lan to the ground he tumbled grunting but somethingdeep withinknew what to do when he came to himself he was already on his feet dizzy sword in hand he groaned staggering hands grabbed him hauling him up into a saddle prince kaisel face bloodied from fighting held the reins lans guard made sure he was steady on his mount as they rode away he caught sight of deepes corpse mangled and lying in pieces as they fled chapter older more weathered was not fruitful majesty the voice said through mats doze something was pricking mats face this mattress was the absolute worst he had ever slept on he was going to thrash the innkeeper until he got his money back the assassin is very difficult to follow that annoying voice continued people he passes do not remember him if the prince of the ravens has information on how the creature may be tracked i would very much like to hear it why would the innkeeper let these people into mats room he drifted toward consciousness leaving behind a lovely dream involving tuon and no cares in the world he opened a bleary eye looking up at a cloudy sky not an inns ceiling at all bloody ashes mat thought groaning they had fallen asleep in the gardens he sat up finding himself totally bare except for the scarf around his neck his and tuons clothing was spread out beneath them his face had been in a patch of weeds tuon sat beside him ignoring the fact that she was completely naked speaking with a member of the deathwatch guard musenge was on one knee head bowed face toward the ground but still light mat said reaching for his clothing tuon was sitting on his shirt and gave him an annoyed look as he tried to yank it free honored one the guard said to mat face still down greetings upon your waking tuon why are you just sitting there mat demanded finally retrieving his shirt from under that luscious rump as my consort tuon said sternly you may call me fortuona or majesty i would hate to have you executed before you give me a child as i am growing fond of you regarding this guard he is of the deathwatch they are needed to watch me at all times i have often had them with me when bathing this is their duty and his face is averted mat hurriedly began dressing she started to dress though not quickly enough for his taste he did not think much of a guard ogling his wife the place where they had slept was rimmed by small blue fir treesan oddity here in the south perhaps cultivated because they were exotic though the needles were browning they offered some measure of privacy beyond the firs was a ring of other treespeaches mat thought but it was hard to tell without the leaves he could barely hear the city waking up outside the garden and the air smelled faintly of the fir needles the air was warm enough that sleeping outside had not been uncomfortable though he was glad to be back in his clothing a deathwatch guard officer approached just as tuon finished dressing he crunched dried fir needles bowing low before her empress we may have caught another assassin it is not the creature from last night as he bears no wounds but he was trying to sneak into the palace we thought you might wish to see him before we begin our interrogation bring him forward tuon said straightening her gown and send for general karede the officer withdrew passing selucia who stood near the pathway that led to the clearing she walked in to stand beside tuon mat put his hat on his head and went up to her other side setting the ashandarei butt down in the dead grass mat felt sorry for this poor fool caught sneaking into the palace maybe the man was an assassin but he could just be a beggar or other fool looking for excitement or he could be the dragon reborn mat groaned yes that was rand they led along the path rand looked older more weathered than the last time mat had seen him in person of course he had seen the man recently in those blasted visions although mat had trained himself to stop thinking of rand to avoid those colors he still slipped on occasion anyway seeing rand in person was different it had been light how long had it been the last time i saw him with my own eyes was when he sent me to salidar after elayne that felt like an eternity ago it had been before he had come to ebou dar before he had seen the gholam for the first time before tylin before tuon mat frowned as rand was led up to tuon his arms bound behind his back she spoke with selucia wiggling her fingers in their handtalk rand did not seem the least bit worried his face was calm he wore a nice coat of red and black a white shirt underneath black trousers no gold or jewelry no weapon at all tuon mat began thats tuon turned from selucia to see rand damane tuon said cutting mat off bring my damane run musicar run the deathwatch guard stumbled backward then ran yelling for the damane and for bannergeneral karede rand watched the man go nonchalant though he was bound you know mat thought idly he kind of does look like a king of course rand was mad most likely that would explain why he had strolled up to tuon like this either that or rand was just planning on killing her bonds did not matter one bit to a man who could channel blood and ashes mat thought how did i end up in this situation he had done whatever he could to avoid rand rand met tuons stare mat took a big breath then jumped in front of her rand rand here now lets be calm hello mat rand said voice pleasant light he was mad thank you for leading me to her leading you what is this tuon demanded mat spun i really its just her stare could have drilled holes in steel you did this she said to mat you came you lured me to be affectionate then you brought him in is this true dont blame him rand said the two of us needed to meet again you know it is true mat stumbled out between them raising one hand either direction here now both of you stop you hear me something seized mat hauling him into the air stop that rand he said it isnt me rand said adopting a look of concentration ah i am shielded as mat hung in the air he felt at his chest the medallion where was his medallion mat stared at tuon she looked ashamed for a brief moment reaching into the pocket of her gown she brought out something silver in her hand perhaps intending to use the medallion as protection against rand brilliant mat thought groaning she had taken it off him while he slept and he had not noticed bloody brilliant the weaves of air set him down beside rand karede had returned with a suldam and damane all three were flushed as if having run quickly the damane had been doing the channeling tuon looked over rand and mat then began gesturing with handtalk at selucia with sharp motions thanks a bundle for this mat muttered to rand youre such a bloody good friend its good to see you too rand said a hint of a smile on his lips here we go mat said with a sigh youve pulled me into trouble again you always do this i do yes in rhuidean and the waste in the stone of tear back in the two rivers you do realize that i went south instead of coming to your little party with egwene in merrilor to escape you think you could stay away from me rand asked smiling you really think it would let you i could bloody try no offense rand but youre going to go mad and all i figured id give you one less friend nearby to kill you know save you some trouble what did you do to your hand by the way what did you do to your eye a little accident with a corkscrew and thirteen angry innkeepers the hand lost it capturing one of the forsaken capturing mat said youre growing soft rand snorted tell me youve done better i killed a gholam mat said i freed illian from sammael i married the empress of the seanchan mat rand said are you really trying to get into a bragging contest with the dragon reborn he paused for a moment besides i cleansed saidin i win ah thats not really worth much mat said not worth much its the single most important event to happen since the breaking bah you and your ashaman are already crazy mat said so what does it matter he glanced to the side you look nice by the way youve been taking better care of yourself lately so you do care rand said of course i do mat grumbled looking back at tuon i mean you have to keep yourself alive right go have your little duel with the dark one and keep us all safe its good to know youre looking up to it thats nice to hear rand said smiling no wisecracks about my nice coat what wisecracks you arent still sore because i teased you a little a couple of years ago teased rand said you spent weeks refusing to talk to me here now mat said it wasnt all that bad i remember that part easily rand shook his head as if bemused bloody ungrateful was what he was mat had gone off to fetch elayne as rand had asked and this was the thanks he was given sure mat had been a little sidetracked after that he had still done it had he not all right mat said very softly tugging at the bonds of air holding him ill get us out of this rand im married to her let me do the talking and daughter of artur hawkwing rand said to tuon time spins toward the end of all things the last battle has begun and the threads are being woven soon my final trial will begin tuon stepped forward selucia waving a few last fingertalk words toward her you will be taken to seanchan dragon reborn tuon said her voice was collected firm mat smiled light but she made a good empress there was no need to filch my medallion though he thought they were going to have words about that assuming he survived this she would not really execute him would she again he tried the invisible bonds tying him is that so rand asked you have delivered yourself to me tuon said it is an omen she seemed almost regretful you did not truly think that i would allow you to stroll away did you i must take you in chains as a ruler who resisted me as i have done to the others i found here you pay the price of your ancestors forgetfulness you should have remembered your oaths i see rand said you know mat thought he does a fair job of sounding like a king too light what kind of people had mat surrounded himself with what had happened to the fair barmaids and carousing soldiers tell me something empress rand said what would you all have done if youd returned to these shores and found artur hawkwings armies still ruling what if we hadnt forgotten our oaths what if we had stayed true what then we would have welcomed you as brothers tuon said oh rand said and you would have bowed to the throne here hawkwings throne if his empire still stood it would have been ruled over by his heir would you have tried to dominate them would you instead have accepted their rule over you that is not the case tuon said but she seemed to find his words intriguing no it is not rand said by your argument you must submit to us she smiled i did not make that argument rand said but let us do so how do you claim the right to these lands by being the only legitimate heir of artur hawkwing and why should that matter this is his empire he is the only one to have unified it he is the only leader to have ruled it in glory and greatness and there you are wrong rand said voice growing soft you accept me as the dragon reborn you must be tuon said slowly as if wary of a trap then you accept me for who i am rand said voice growing loud crisp like a battle horn i am lews therin telamon the dragon i ruled these lands unified during the age of legends i was leader of all the armies of the light i wore the ring of tamyrlin i stood first among the servants highest of the aes sedai and i could summon the nine rods of dominion rand stepped forward i held the loyalty and fealty of all seventeen generals of dawns gate fortuona athaem devi paendrag my authority supersedes your own artur hawkwing my authority supersedes that of hawkwing if you claim rule by the name of he who conquered then you must bow before my prior claim i conquered before hawkwing though i needed no sword to do so you are here on my land empress at my sufferance thunder broke in the distance mat found himself shaking light it was just rand just rand was it not tuon backed away eyes wide her lips parted her face was full of horror as if she had just seen her own parents executed green grass spread around rands feet the guards nearby jumped back hands to swords as a swath of life extended from rand the brown and yellow blades colored as if paint had been poured on them then came uprightstretching as if after long slumber the greenness filled the entire garden clearing hes still shielded the suldam cried honored one he is still shielded mat shivered and then noticed something very soft so easy to miss are you singing mat whispered to rand yes it was unmistakable rand was singing under his breath very softly mat tapped his foot i swear ive heard that tune somewhere once is it two maids at the waters edge youre not helping rand whispered quiet rand continued his song the green spread to the trees the firs strengthening their limbs the other trees began to shoot out leavesthey were indeed peach treesgrowing at great speed life flooding into them the guards looked about themselves spinning trying to watch all of the trees at once selucia had cringed tuon remained upright her eyes focused on rand nearby the frightened suldam and damane must have stopped concentrating for the bonds holding mat vanished do you deny my right rand demanded do you deny that my claim to this land precedes your own by thousands of years i tuon took a deep breath and stared at him defiantly you broke the land abandoned it i can deny your right behind her blossoms exploded onto the trees like fireworks white and deep pink the bursts of color surrounded them petals sprayed outward with their growth breaking from the trees catching in the wind and swirling through the clearing i allowed you to live rand said to tuon when i could have destroyed you in an instant this is because you have made life better for those under your rule though you are not without guilt for the way you have treated some your rule is as flimsy as paper you hold this land together only through the strength of steel and damane but your homeland burns i have not come here to destroy you i come to you now to offer you peace empress i have come without armies i have come without force i have come because i believe that you need me as i need you rand stepped forward and remarkably went down on one knee bowing his head his hand extended i extend my hand to you in alliance the last battle is upon us join me and fight the clearing fell still the wind stopped blowing the thunder stopped rumbling peach blossoms wafted to the nowgreen grass rand remained where he was hand extended tuon stared at that hand as if at a viper mat hurried forward nice trick he said under his breath to rand very nice trick he approached tuon taking her by the shoulders and turning her to the side nearby selucia looked stunned karede was not in much better shape they would not be any help hey look mat said to her softly hes a good fellow hes rough at the corners sometimes but you can trust his word if hes offering you a treaty hell make good on it that was a very impressive display tuon said softly she was trembling faintly what is he burn me if i know mat said listen tuon i grew up with rand i vouch for him there is a darkness in that man matrim i saw it when last he and i last met look at me tuon look at me she looked up meeting his gaze you can trust rand althor with the world itself mat said and if you cant trust him trust me hes our only choice we dont have time to take him back to seanchan ive been in the city long enough to have a little peek at your forces if youre going to fight the last battle and recapture your homeland youre going to need a stable base here in altara take his offer he just claimed this land well make him secure your borders as they are and announce it to the others they might listen take a little pressure off you unless that is you want to fight the trollocs the nations of this land and the rebels in seanchan at the same time tuon blinked our forces what you called them my forces she said they are our forces you are one of us now matrim well i guess i am at that listen tuon you have to do this please she turned looking at rand kneeling in the middle of a pattern of peach blossoms that seemed to have circled out from him not a one had fallen on him what is your offer tuon asked peace rand said standing hand still out peace for a hundred years longer if i can make it so i have persuaded the other rulers to sign a treaty and work together to fight the armies of the shadow i would have my borders secured tuon said altara and amadicia shall be yours tarabon and almoth plain as well tuon said i hold them now i will not be forced from them by your treaty you wish peace you will give me this tarabon and half of almoth plain rand said the half you already control i would have the all of the women this side of the aryth ocean who can channel as damane tuon said do not strain your luck empress rand said dryly i i will allow you to do what you will in seanchan but i will require you to relinquish any damane you have taken while in this land then we have no agreement tuon said mat held his breath rand hesitated hand lowering the fate of the world itself could hang on this fortuona please if it is that important she said firmly you can agree to my demand our property is our own you wish a treaty then you will get it with this clause we keep the damane we already have in exchange i will allow you to leave in freedom rand grimaced youre as bad as one of the sea folk i should hope im worse tuon said no emotion in her voice the world is your charge dragon not mine i care for my empire i will greatly need those damane choose now as i believe you said your time is short rands expression darkened then he thrust his hand outward let it be done light be merciful let it be done i will carry this weight too you may keep the damane you already have but you shall not take any from among my allies while we fight the last battle taking any afterward who are not in your own land will be seen as breaking the treaty and attacking the other nations tuon stepped forward then took rands hand in her own mat let out his breath i have documents for you to review and sign rand said selucia will take them tuon said matrim with me we must prepare the empire for war tuon walked away down the path her step controlled though mat suspected that she wanted to be away from rand as quickly as possible he understood the sentiment he followed but stopped beside rand seems you have a bit of the dark ones luck yourself he muttered to rand i cant believe that worked honestly rand said softly i cant either thank you for the good word sure mat said by the way i saved moiraine chew on that as you try to decide which of the two of us is winning mat followed tuon and behind him rose the laughter of the dragon reborn chapter to feel wasted gawyn stood on a field near the area where the aes sedai had first fought the trollocs theyd come off the hills and had moved deeper onto the kandor plain they continued to stem the trolloc advances and they even managed to push back the enemys main forces a few hundred paces all in all this battle was going better than could have been expected theyd fought here for a week on this open unnamed kandori field this place had been churned and torn as if in preparation for planting there were so many bodies herealmost all shadowspawnthat even trolloc appetites couldnt consume them all gawyn carried a sword in one hand shield in the other stationed in front of egwenes horse his job was to bring down the trollocs that came through the aes sedai attacks he preferred to fight twohanded but against trollocs he needed that shield some of the others thought him a fool for using the sword they preferred pikes or halberds anything to keep the trollocs at a distance you couldnt really duel with a pike though as a pikeman you were like a brick in a larger wall you werent so much a soldier as a barrier a halberd was betterat least it had a blade that required some skill to usebut nothing gave the same feel as a sword when gawyn fought with the sword he controlled the fight a trolloc came for him snorting face bearing the melded features of a ram and a man this one was more human than most including a sickeningly human mouth with bloodied teeth the thing brandished a mace that bore the flame of tar valon on its haft stolen from a fallen member of the tower guard though it was a twohanded weapon the creature wielded it easily in one gawyn dodged to the side then brought his shield up and to the right under the expected blow the shield shook with repeated impacts one two three standard trolloc berserkinghit hard hit fast and assume that the opponent would break many did they would trip or their arms would go numb from the pounding that was the value of pikewalls or halberd lines bryne used both and a newly improvised halfspear halfhalberd line gawyn had read of its like in history books brynes army used them for hamstringing trollocs the pike lines would keep them back and then the halberds would reach through and slice their legs gawyn ducked to the side and the trolloc wasnt ready for his burst of speed the thing turned too slow as gawyn separated its hand from its wrist using whirlwind on the mountain as it screamed gawyn spun about ramming his sword into the stomach of another trolloc that had plowed through the aes sedai defense he whipped his sword out of that body and sheathed it in the first trollocs neck the dead beast slid off his blade that was four that gawyn had killed today he carefully wiped his sword on the bloody cloth he wore tied at his waist he checked on egwene mounted she used the one power to rip apart trollocs in droves the aes sedai used a rotation with only a small portion of them on the field at a time using so few aes sedai at a time required the soldiers to take the brunt of the fighting but the aes sedai always came to the battle rested their job was to blast apart the groups of trollocs shattering lines and letting the soldiers work on the scattered remnants with the aes sedai keeping the trollocs from solid battle formations the fightthough gruelingwas proceeding well they hadnt had to fall back since leaving the hills behind and had effectively stalled the trolloc advance for a week here silviana sat atop a roan gelding beside egwene and did her best to keep the trollocs from coming too close the ground was ripped and furrowed just in front of them silvianas attacks having torn it asunder leaving trenchlike depressions all over the field despite that the occasional trolloc would crawl through the mire and come for gawyn gawyn saw movement in the nearest trench and strode forward a wolffeatured trolloc crouched inside it snarled at him scrambling up water flows downhill the trolloc fell back into the trench and gawyn wiped his blade on the bloody rag five not bad for one of his twohour shifts often the aes sedai were able to repel the trollocs and he just ended up standing beside egwene of course today she was accompanied by silvianathey always came to the battlefront in pairsand gawyn was halfconvinced the keeper let a few through now and then just to keep him working a sudden series of explosions nearby drove him backward and he glanced over his shoulder their relief had arrived gawyn raised his sword to sleete as the man took up position with piava sedais warder to guard the area gawyn joined egwene and silviana as they left the battlefield he could feel egwenes growing exhaustion she was pushing herself too hard insisting on joining too many shifts they made their way across the trampled grass passing a group of illianer companions charging into the fray gawyn didnt have a good enough view of the battle as a whole to know where specifically they were needed he watched them go with a hint of envy he knew egwene needed him now more than ever fades slipped into camp at night bringing thakandarforged blades to take the lives of aes sedai gawyn kept watch personally when egwene slept relying on her to wash his fatigue away when it overwhelmed him he slept when she was in conference with the hall of the tower he insisted that she sleep in a different tent each night once in a while he convinced her to travel to mayene and the beds in the palace she hadnt done that in a few days his arguments that she should check on the yellows and inspect the healing work were growing thin rosil sedai had things in hand there gawyn and the two women continued on into the camp some soldiers bowed the ones who were not currently on duty while others hastened toward the battlefield gawyn eyed some of these too young too new others were dragonsworn and who knew what to make of them there were aiel among the dragonsworn which made sense to him since all aiel seemed basically dragonsworn to him but there were also aes sedai among the dragonsworn ranks he didnt think much of their choice gawyn shook his head and continued on their camp was enormous though it contained virtually no camp followers food was brought in daily through gateways in wagonssome pulled by those unreliable metal machines from cairhien when those wagons left they carried away clothing for washing weapons to be repaired and boots to be mended it made for a very efficient camp one not heavily populated however as almost everyone spent long hours on the battlefield fighting everyone but gawyn he knew he was needed and that what he did was important but he couldnt help feeling wasted he was one of the finest swordsmen in the army and he stood on the battlefield for a few hours a day killing only the occasional trolloc stupid enough to charge two aes sedai what gawyn did was more like putting them out of their misery than fighting them egwene nodded farewell to silviana then turned her horse toward the command tent egwene gawyn said i only want to check on things she said calmly elayne was supposed to have sent new orders you need sleep it seems that all i do these days is sleep when you fight on the battlefield you are easily worth a thousand soldiers gawyn said if sleeping twentytwo hours a day were required to keep you in good enough shape to protect the men for two id suggest you do it fortunately that isnt requiredand neither is it required that you run yourself as hard as you do he could feel her annoyance through the bond but she snuffed it out you are right of course she eyed him and you neednt feel surprised to hear me admit it i wasnt surprised gawyn said i can feel your emotions gawyn that was from something else entirely he said i remembered something sleete said a few days back a joke i didnt understand until now he looked at her innocently that finally earned a smile a hint of one but that was enough she didnt smile much these days few of them did in addition he said taking her reins and helping her dismount as they reached the command tent id never given much thought to the fact that a warder can of course ignore the three oaths i wonder how often sisters have found that convenient i hope not too often egwene said a very diplomatic answer inside the command tent they found gareth bryne looking down through his now customary gateway it was being maintained by a mousy gray whom gawyn didnt know bryne stepped to his maplittered desk where siuan was attempting to bring order he made a few notes on a map nodding to himself then looked to see who had entered mother bryne said and took her hand to kiss her ring the battle seems to be going well egwene said nodding to siuan we have held here well you have plans to push forward it seems we cant loiter here forever mother bryne said queen elayne has asked me to consider an advance farther into kandor and i think she is wise to do so i worry that the trollocs will pull back into the hills and brace themselves you notice how theyve been pulling more of the bodies off the field each night yes gawyn could sense her displeasure she wished the aes sedai had the strength to burn the trolloc carcasses with the one power each day theyre gathering food bryne said they might decide to move eastward and try to get around us we need to keep them engaged here which might mean pushing into those hills it would be costly normally but now he shook his head walking over and looking down through his gateway onto the front lines your aes sedai dominate this battlefield mother ive never seen anything like it there is a reason she replied that the shadow did everything in its power to bring down the white tower it knew the white tower has the ability to rule this war well need to watch for dreadlords siuan said shuffling through papers scouting reports gawyn suspected he knew little of siuan sanche despite having spared her life but egwene commonly spoke of the womans greed for information yes egwene said they will come the black tower bryne said frowning do you trust the word from lord mandragoran with my life egwene said ashaman fighting for the enemy why wouldnt the dragon reborn have done something light if all of the remaining ashaman side with the shadow egwene shook her head bryne i want you to saddle up riders and send them to the area outside the black tower where gateways can still be made send them riding hard to the sisters still camped outside the black tower you want them to attack gawyn asked perking up no they are to retreat back as far as it takes to make gateways and then they are to join us here we cant afford any further delays i want them here she tapped the table with one finger taim and his dreadlords will come they have stayed away from this battlefield instead focusing on lord mandragoran that lets them dominate their battlefield as we have this one i will choose more sisters to send to the borderlander army we will have to confront them eventually gawyn said nothing but drew his lips tight fewer sisters here meant more work for egwene and the others and now egwene said i need to she trailed off seeing gawyns expression i suppose i need to sleep if i am needed send to light i dont know where im sleeping today gawyn i have you in maerin sedais tent shes on duty in the rotation after this so that should give you some hours of uninterrupted sleep unless im needed egwene reminded him she walked toward the tent flaps of course gawyn said following her out but shaking his head toward bryne and siuan bryne smiled back nodding on a battlefield there was little that would absolutely require the amyrlins attention the hall of the tower had been given direct oversight of their armies outside egwene sighed closing her eyes he put his arm around her and let her slump against him the moment lasted but a few seconds before she pulled back standing up straight and putting on the face of the amyrlin so young he thought to have so much required of her of course she wasnt much younger than althor himself gawyn was pleased and a little surprised that thinking of the man did not provoke any anger althor would fight his fight really what the man did was none of gawyns business gawyn led egwene to the green ajah section of camp the several warders at the perimeter greeting them with nods of respect maerin sedai had a large tent most of the aes sedai had been allowed to bring what housing and furniture they wished so long as they could make their own gateway for it and use their own warders to carry it if the army had to move quickly such things would be abandoned many aes sedai had chosen to bring very little but others well they were not accustomed to austerity maerin was one of those few had brought as much as she leilwin and bayle domon waited outside the tent they had been the ones to inform maerin sedai that her tent was being borrowed and that she wasnt to tell anyone that egwene was the one using it the secret could be discovered if anyone asked aroundthey hadnt hidden themselves while walking herebut at the same time someone asking where the amyrlin was sleeping would draw attention it was the best protection gawyn could arrange since egwene was unwilling to travel each day to sleep egwenes emotions immediately turned sour when she saw leilwin you did say you wanted to keep her close gawyn said softly i dont like her knowing where i sleep if their assassins do come looking for me in camp she might be the one to lead them to me gawyn fought down the instinct to argue egwene was a cunning insightful womanbut she had a blind spot regarding anything seanchan he on the other hand found himself trusting leilwin she seemed to be the type who dealt straight with people ill keep an eye on her he said egwene composed herself with a breath then walked to the tent and passed leilwin without saying a word gawyn didnt follow her inside the amyrlin seems intent on not letting me provide service leilwin said to gawyn in that telltale seanchan drawl she doesnt trust you gawyn said frankly is ones oath worth so little on this side of the ocean leilwin said i swore an oath to her that none would break not even a muyami a darkfriend will break any oath the woman eyed him coolly i begin to think she assumes all seanchan to be darkfriends gawyn shrugged you beat her and imprisoned her making her into an animal to be led by a collar i did not leilwin said if one baker made you foul bread would you assume all of them seek to poison you bah do not argue there is no point if i cannot serve her then i will serve you have you eaten today warder gawyn hesitated when had he last had something to eat this morning no hed been too eager for the fight his stomach grumbled loudly i know you will not leave her leilwin said particularly under the watch of a seanchan come bayle let us fetch this fool some food so that he does not faint if assassins do come she stalked off her large illianer husband following the fellow shot a glare over his shoulder that could have cured leather gawyn sighed and settled down on the ground from his pocket he pulled three black rings he selected one then shoved the others back into his pocket talk of assassins always made him think of the rings which hed taken off the seanchan who had come to kill egwene the rings were terangreal they were the means by which those bloodknives had moved quickly and blended into shadows he held up the ring toward the light it didnt look like any terangreal he had seen but an object of the power could look like anything the rings were of some heavy black stone he did not recognize the outside was carved like thorns though the inside surfacethe side that touched the skinwas smooth fie turned the ring over in his fingers he knew that he should go to egwene with it he also knew how the white tower treated terangreal they locked the objects away afraid to experiment with them but this was the last battle if there was ever a time to take risks you decided to stand in egwenes shadow gawyn he thought you decided you would protect her do what she needed of you she was winning this war she and the aes sedai would he let himself grow as jealous of her as he had been of althor is that what i believe it to be gawyn snapped his head up fist closing around the ring leilwin and bayle domon had been to the mess tent and returned with a bowl for him from the smell of it the meal was barley stew again the cooks used so much pepper it was almost sickening gawyn suspected they did so because the black flakes hid the bits of weevil i cant act like im doing something suspicious he thought immediately i cant let her go to egwene this he asked holding up the ring its one of the rings we recovered from the seanchan assassins who tried to kill egwene we assume its a terangreal of some sort though its not one the white tower has ever heard of leilwin hissed softly those are to be bestowed only by the empress may she she cut herself off and took a deep breath only one appointed as a bloodknife one who has given their life to the empress is allowed to wear such a ring for you to put one on would be very very wrong fortunately gawyn said im not wearing it the rings are dangerous leilwin said i do not know much of them but they are said to kill those who use them do not let your blood touch the ring or you will activate it and that could be deadly warder she handed him the bowl of stew then strode away domon didnt follow her the illianer scratched at his short beard she do not always be the most accommodating of women my wife he said to gawyn but she do be strong and wise you would do well to listen to her gawyn pocketed the ring egwene would never allow me to wear it in the first place that was true if she knew about it tell your wife that i appreciate the warning i should warn you that the subject of the assassins is still a very sore subject for the amyrlin id suggest avoiding the topic of the bloodknives or their terangreal domon nodded and then went after leilwin gawyn felt only a small prick of shame at the deception he hadnt said anything untrue he just didnt want egwene asking any awkward questions that ring and its brothers represented something they werent the way of the warder standing beside egwene watching for danger to her that was the way of the warder he would make a difference on the battlefield by serving her not by riding out like some hero he told himself that time and time again as he ate his stew by the time he was done he was nearly certain he believed it he still didnt tell egwene about the rings rand remembered the first time hed seen a trolloc not when they had attacked his farm in the two rivers the true first time hed seen them during the last age there will come a time when they no longer exist he thought weaving fire and air creating an explosive wall of flames that roared to life in the middle of a pack of trollocs nearby men of perrins wolf guard raised weapons in thanks rand nodded back he wore the face of jur grady in this fight for now once trollocs had not scourged the land they could return to that state if rand killed the dark one would it happen immediately the flames of his fire wall brought sweat on his forehead he drew carefully on the fatman angrealhe couldnt afford to seem too powerfuland struck down another group of trollocs here on the battlefield just west of the river alguenya elaynes forces had crossed the erinin and the countryside to the east and were waiting for their bridges across the alguenya to be constructed these were almost completed but meanwhile a vanguard of trollocs had caught up with them and elaynes army had formed up in defensive positions to hold them off until they could cross the river rand was happy to help the real jur grady rested back in his camp in kandor worn out from healing a convenient face that rand could wear and not draw the attention of the forsaken the trolloc screams were satisfying as they burned he had loved that sound near the end of the war of power it had always made him feel as if he were doing something he hadnt known what trollocs were the first time hed seen them oh hed known of aginors experiments lews therin had named him a madman on more than one occasion he hadnt understood so many of them hadnt aginor had loved his projects far too much lews therin had made the mistake of assuming that aginor like semirhage enjoyed the torture for its own sake and then the shadowspawn had come the monsters continued burning limbs twitching still rand worried that these things might be humans reborn aginor had used people to create the trollocs and myrddraal was this the fate of some to be reborn as twisted creations such as this the idea sickened him he checked the sky the clouds had begun to withdraw as they did near him he could force them to not do so but no men needed the light and he could not fight here too long lest it become obvious that one of the ashaman was too strong for the face he wore rand let the light come all across the battlefield near the river people glanced toward the sky as sunlight fell on them the dark clouds pulling back no more hiding rand thought removing his mask of mirrors and raising his hand in a fist above his head he wove air fire and water creating a column of light extending from himself high into the sky soldiers across the battlefield cheered he would not bring down the traps the dark one had waiting for him he moved through a gateway back to merrilor he never stayed long at a battlefront but he always revealed himself before he left he let the clouds break above proving he had been there then withdrew min waited for him at the merrilor traveling ground he looked behind himself as his gateway closed leaving the people to fight without him min placed a hand on his arm his maiden guards waited here they reluctantly allowed him to fight alone as they knew that their presence would give him away you look sad min said softly a hot breeze blew from somewhere north nearby soldiers saluted him most of what he had here were domani tairens and aiel the assault force led by rodel ituralde and king darlin that would try to hold the valley of thakandar while rand wrestled with the dark one the time had almost arrived for that the shadow had seen him fighting on all fronts he had joined lans fighting egwenes fighting and elaynes in turn by now the shadow had committed most of its armies to the fighting in the south the time for rand to strike shayol ghul was at hand he looked to min moiraine calls me a fool for these attacks she says that even a small risk to me is not worth what i accomplish moiraine is probably right min said she often is but i prefer you as the person who would do this that is the person who can defeat the dark one the man who cannot sit and plan while others die rand put his arm around her waist light what would he have done without her id have fallen he thought during the dark months id have fallen for certain over mins shoulder rand saw a grayhaired woman approaching and behind her a smaller figure in blue stopped and pointedly turned the other way cadsuane and moiraine gave one another wide berth in the camp he thought he caught a hint of a glare in moiraines eyes when she saw that cadsuane had spotted rand first cadsuane came up to him then walked around him looking him up and down she nodded to herself several times trying to decide if im up to the task rand said to cadsuane keeping emotionsin this case annoyancefrom his voice i never wondered cadsuane said even before i found you were reborn i never wondered if i would be able to make you into the man you needed to be wondering in that manner at least is for fools are you a fool rand althor an impossible question min replied if he says that he is then a fool he becomes if he says that he is not then he implies he does not seek further wisdom phaw youve been reading too much child cadsuane seemed fond as she said it she turned to rand i hope you give her something nice what do you mean rand asked youve been giving things to people cadsuane said in preparation for death its common for the elderly or for men riding into a battle they dont think they can win a sword for your father a terangreal for the queen of andor a crown for lan mandragoran jewelry for the aiel girl and for this one she nodded at min rand stiffened hed known what he was doing on some level but to hear it explained was disconcerting mins expression darkened her grip on him tightened walk with me cadsuane said just you and me lord dragon she glanced at him if you will min looked to rand but he patted her on the shoulder and nodded ill meet you at the tent she sighed but retreated cadsuane had already started on the path rand had to jog a few steps to catch up she probably enjoyed seeing that moiraine sedai grows restless with your delays cadsuane said and what are your thoughts i think she has a portion of wisdom to her however i do not find your plan to be complete idiocy you must not delay much longer however he purposely did not say when he would give the order to attack shayol ghul he wanted everyone guessing if nobody around him knew when he would strike then chances were good the dark one wouldnt know either regardless cadsuane said i am not here to speak about your delays i feel that moiraine sedai has your education in that matter well in hand something else worries me far more and that is that you expect to die that you are giving so much away that you do not even seek to live rand took a deep breath behind a group of maidens trailed him he passed the windfinders in their small camp huddled and speaking over the bowl of winds they looked toward him and cadsuane with placid faces leave me go to my fate cadsuane rand said i have embraced death i will take it when it comes i am pleased at that she said and do not thinkfor a moment that i would not trade your life for the world youve made that obvious from the start rand said so why worry now this fight will claim me so it must be you must not assume that you will die cadsuane said even if it is nearly inevitable you must not take it as completely inevitable elayne said much the same thing then she has spoken wisdom at least once in her life a better average than i had assumed of that one rand refused to rise to that comment and cadsuane let slip a smile she was pleased at how he controlled himself now that was why she tested him would the tests never end no he thought not until the final one the one that matters most cadsuane stopped in the path causing him to stop as well do you have a gift for me as well i am giving them to those i care about that actually made her smile more deeply our interactions have not always been smooth rand althor that would be one way to say it however she continued eyeing him i will have you know that i am pleased you have turned out well so i have your permission to save the world yes she looked upward where the dark clouds boiled they began to split at his presence as he did not try to mask it or keep them back yes cadsuane repeated you have my permission so long as you do it soon that darkness grows as if in concert with her words the ground rumbled it did that more and more lately the camp shook and men stumbled wary there will be forsaken rand said once i enter someone will need to face them i intend to ask aviendha to lead the resistance against them she could use your aid cadsuane nodded i will do my part bring alivia rand said she is strong but i worry about putting her with others she does not understand limits in the way that she should cadsuane nodded again and from the look in her eyes he wondered if shed already planned to do just that and the black tower rand set his jaw the black tower was a trap he knew it was a trap taim wanted to lure rand into a place where he couldnt escape through a gateway i sent perrin to help and your determination to go yourself i have to help them somehow i let taim gather them i cant just leave them to him you still arent certain cadsuane said dissatisfied youd risk yourself youd risk us all stepping into a trap i theyre free cadsuane turned to walk away taim and his men have been cast out of the black tower what rand demanded taking her by the arm your men there freed themselves cadsuane said though from what ive been told they took a beating doing it few know it queen elayne might not be able to use them in battle for some time i dont know the details they freed themselves rand said yes they did it or perrin did rand exulted but a wave of guilt slammed against him how many had been lost could he have saved them if hed gone hed known for days now of their predicament and yet hed left them obeying moiraines insistent counsel that this was a trap he could not afford to spring and now theyd escaped it i wish that id been able to draw an answer out of you cadsuane said about what you intended to do there she sighed then shook her head you have cracks in you rand althor but youll have to do she left him deepe was a good man antail said he survived the fall of maradon he was on the wall when it blew but he lived and kept fighting the dreadlords came for him eventually sending an explosion to finish the job deepe spent the last moments throwing weaves at them he died well the malkieri soldiers raised cups toward antail saluting the fallen lan raised his own cup though he stood just outside the ring of men around the fire he wished deepe had followed orders he shook his head downing his wine though it was night lans men were on rotation to be awake in case of an attack lan turned his cup between two fingers thinking of deepe again he found he couldnt drum up anger at the man deepe had wanted to kill one of the shadows most dangerous channelers lan couldnt say he would turn down a similar opportunity if it were given him the men continued their toasts to the fallen it had become a tradition every evening and had spread among all of the borderlander camps lan found it encouraging that the men here were starting to treat antail and narishma as fellows the ashaman were aloof but deepes death had forged a link between the ashaman and the ordinary soldiers now theyd all paid the butchers bill the men had seen antail grieving and had invited him to make a toast lan stepped away from the fire and walked through the camp stopping by the horselines to check on mandarb the stallion was holding up well though he bore a large wound on his left flank where his coat would never grow back it seemed to be healing well the grooms still spoke in hushed tones about how the wounded horse had appeared out of the night following the fight where deepe had died many riders had been killed or unhorsed in the fighting that day very few horses had escaped the trollocs and made their way back to camp lan patted mandarbs neck well rest soon my friend he said softly i promise mandarb snorted in the darkness and nearby several of the other horses nickered well make a home lan said the shadow defeated nynaeve and i will reclaim malkier well make the fields bloom again cleanse the lakes green pastures no more trollocs to fight children to ride on your back old friend you can spend your days in peace eating apples and having your pick of mares it had been a very long time since lan had thought of the future with anything resembling hope strange to find it now in this place in this war he was a hard man at times he felt he had more in common with the rocks and the sand than he did with the men who laughed together beside the fire that was what hed made of himself it was the person hed needed to be a person who could someday journey toward malkier and uphold the honor of his family rand althor had begun to crack that shell and then nynaeves love had ripped it apart completely i wonder if rand ever knew lan thought taking out the currycomb and working on mandarbs coat lan knew what it was like to be chosen from childhood to die he knew what it was like to be pointed toward the blight and told he would sacrifice his life there light but he did rand althor would probably never know how similar the two of them were lan brushed mandarb for a time though he was bone tired perhaps he should have slept nynaeve would have told him to sleep he played out the conversation in his head allowing himself a smile shed have won explaining that a general needed sleep and that there were plenty of grooms to care for the horses but nynaeve wasnt there he kept brushing someone approached the horselines lan heard the footsteps long before the person arrived of course lord baldhere retrieved a brush from the groom station nodding to one of the guards there and walked toward his own horse only then did he notice lan lord mandragoran he said lord baldhere lan said nodding toward the kandori queen ethenielles swordbearer was slender with streaks of white in his otherwise black hair though baldhere was not one of the great captains he was a fine commander and had served kandor well since his kings death many had assumed that the queen would marry baldhere that of course was foolish ethenielle looked at him as she would a brother besides anyone who paid attention would know that baldhere clearly preferred men to women i am sorry to disturb you dai shan baldhere said i had not realized that anyone else would be here he moved to withdraw i was nearly done lan said do not let me stop you the grooms do well enough baldhere said i wasnt here to check on their work i have found at times that doing something simple and familiar helps me think youre not the only one to have noticed that lan said continuing to brush mandarb baldhere chuckled then fell silent for a moment finally he spoke dai shan he said are you worried about lord agelmar in what regard i worry that hes pushing himself too hard baldhere said some of the choices he is making they confuse me its not that his battle decisions are bad they simply strike me as too aggressive it is war i dont know that one can be too aggressive in defeating ones enemy baldhere fell quiet for a time of course but did you notice the loss of lord yokatas two cavalry squadrons that was unfortunate but mistakes do happen this isnt one that lord agelmar should have made hes been in situations like this before dai shan he should have seen it had happened during a recent raid against the trollocs the ashaman had been setting fire to fal eisen and the surrounding countryside at agelmars orders yokata had taken his cavalry in a swing around a large hill to attack the right flank of the trolloc army advancing on the ashaman using a classic pincer movement agelmar was to send in more cavalry against the enemys left flank and the ashaman would turn to meet the trollocs headon but the shadows leaders had seen through the maneuver before agelmar and the ashaman could act a large contingent of trollocs had come over the hill to hit yokatas own right flank while the remainder hit yokata headon enveloping his cavalry the cavalry had been killed to the last man immediately after the trollocs went after the ashaman who had barely been able to save themselves he is tired dai shan baldhere said i know agelmar he would never have made a mistake like that if he were awake and alert baldhere anyone could have made a mistake like that lord agelmar is one of the great captains he should see the battle differently than ordinary men do are you certain you arent expecting too much of him lan asked agelmar is just a man we all are at the end of the day i perhaps you are right baldhere said hand on his sword as if worried he wasnt carrying the queens weapon of coursehe did that only when she was acting in her station i guess it comes down to an instinct lan an itch agelmar seems tired a lot and i worry its affecting his ability to plan please just watch him ill watch lan said thank you baldhere said he seemed less troubled now than when hed approached lan gave mandarb a final pat left baldhere to tend his horse and walked through camp to the command tent he went in the tent was lit and well guarded though the soldiers on guard werent allowed clear views of the battle maps lan moved around the hung cloths that obscured the entry and nodded to the two shienaran commanders subordinates to agelmar who attended this inner sanctum one was studying the maps spread out on the floor agelmar himself wasnt there a leader needed to sleep sometime lan squatted looking at the map after tomorrows retreat it appeared that they would reach a place called blood springs named for the way the rocks beneath the water made the river seem to run red at blood springs they would have a slight advantage of height because of the adjacent hills and agelmar wanted to stage an offensive against the trollocs with bowmen and cavalry lines working together and of course there would be more burning of the land lan knelt on one knee looking over agelmars notes about which army would fight where and how hed divide the attacks it was ambitious but nothing looked particularly troublesome to lan as he was studying the tent flaps rustled and agelmar himself entered speaking softly with lady ells of saldaea he stopped when he saw lan excusing himself quietly from his conversation he approached lan agelmar did not slump with exhaustion but lan had learned to read beyond a mans posture for signs of tiredness redness to the eyes breath that smelled faintly of flatwort an herb chewed to keep the mind alert when one had been up too long agelmar was tiredbut so was everyone else in camp do you approve of what you see dai shan agelmar asked kneeling it is very aggressive for a retreat can we afford any other action agelmar asked we leave a swath of burned land behind us destroying shienar almost as surely as if the shadow had taken her i will bring trolloc blood to quench those ashes lan nodded baldhere came to you agelmar asked lan looked up sharply agelmar smiled wanly i assume it was regarding the loss of yokata and his men yes it was a mistake to be certain agelmar said i wondered if anyone would confront me on it baldhere is one to believe i should never have made such an error he thinks youre pushing yourself too hard he is clever in tactics agelmar said but he does not know so much as he thinks his head is full of the stories of great captains i am not without flaw dai shan this will not be my only error i will see them as i saw this one and learn from them still perhaps we should see that you get more sleep i am perfectly hale lord mandragoran i know my limits i have spent my entire life learning them this battle will push me to my utmost and i must let it but relieve me or let me be agelmar said cutting in i will listen to advicei am not a foolbut i will not be secondguessed very well lan said rising i trust your wisdom agelmar nodded lowering his eyes to his maps he was still working on his plans when lan finally left to turn in chapter the choke of a patch elayne found bashere pacing on the east bank of the river riverbanks were among the few places that still felt alive to her so much was lifeless these days trees that did not put forth leaves grass that did not grow animals that huddled in their dens and refused to move the rivers kept flowing there was a sense of life to that though the plants were dreary the alguenya was one of those deceptively mighty rivers that looked placid from a distance but could pull a woman under its surface until she drowned she remembered bryne making a lesson of that to gawyn once during a hunting trip theyd taken along it hed been speaking to her too maybe to her primarily though hed always been careful not to overstep himself with the daughterheir be careful of currents hed said river currents are one of the most dangerous things under the light but only because men underestimate them the surface looks still because nothing is fighting it nothing wants to the fish go along with it and men stay out of it all except the fools who think to prove themselves elayne stepped down the rocky bank toward bashere her guards stayed behindbirgitte wasnt with them just now she was seeing to the archer companies miles downriver where they were busy pounding the trollocs building rafts to get them across the river birgittes archers and talmanes dragons were doing an outstanding job of reducing the trolloc numbers there but it was still only a matter of time before their vast army would pour across the alguenya elayne had pulled her forces out of andor a week before and she and bashere had been pleased with their progress until they had discovered the trap amazing isnt it she asked stepping up beside bashere who stood at the rivers bank bashere glanced at her then nodded we dont have anything like it back home what of the arinelle it doesnt grow this big until its outside of saldaea he said absently this is almost like an ocean settled right here dividing bank from bank it makes me smile thinking of how the aiel must have regarded it after first crossing the spine the two of them were silent for a time how bad is it elayne finally asked bad bashere said i should have realized burn me i should have seen you cant plan for everything bashere pardon he said but that is exactly what im supposed to be doing their march eastward from braem wood had gone according to plan burning the bridges across the erinin and the alguenya they had taken out large numbers of trollocs trying to cross after them elayne was now on the road that went upriver to the city of cairhien bashere had planned to set up their final confrontation with the trollocs in hills along the road that lay twenty leagues south of cairhien the shadow had outthought them scouts had spotted a second army of trollocs just to the north of their current position marching east heading toward the city of cairhien itself elayne had stripped that city of defenders to fill out her army now it was filled only with refugeesand was as crowded as caemlyn had been how did they do it she asked those trollocs couldnt have come down from tarwins gap there hasnt been enough time for that bashere agreed another waygate she asked perhaps bashere said perhaps not how then she asked where did that army come from that army of trollocs was almost close enough to knock on the city gates light i made the mistake of thinking like a human bashere said i accounted for trolloc marching speed but not for how the myrddraal might push them a foolish mistake the army in the woods must have split in two with half taking a northeastern route through the woods toward cairhien its the only thing i can think of weve been moving as quickly as we can elayne said how could they have overtaken us her army had gateways she couldnt move everyone through them as she didnt have enough channelers to hold gateways for long periods however she could move the supply carts the wounded and the camp followers through that let them march at the speed of trained soldiers weve moved as quickly as we could safely bashere said a human commander would never have pushed his forces into such a terrible march the terrain they went through had to have been awfulthe rivers they had to cross the forests the wetlands light they must have lost thousands of trollocs to fatigue during such a march the fades risked it and now they have us in a pincer the city could be destroyed as well elayne fell silent i wont let that happen she finally said not again not if we can prevent it do we have a choice yes elayne said bashere youre one of the greatest military minds the land has known you have resources that no man has ever had before the dragons the kinswomen ogier willing to fight in battle you can make this work i know you can you show surprising faith in me for someone you have known a very short time rand trusts you elayne said even during the dark times bashere when he would look at every second person around him with darkness in his eyeshe trusted you bashere seemed troubled there is a way what is it we march and hit the trollocs near cairhien as quickly as we can theyre tired they have to be if we could beat them quickly before the horde to the south reaches us we may have a chance it will be difficult the northern force probably wants to seize the city then use it against us as the southern trollocs arrive could we open gateways into the city and hold it i doubt it bashere said not with channelers as tired as these beyond that we need to destroy the northern trollocs not just hold against them if we give them time to rest they will recover from their march be joined by the trollocs from the south then use dreadlords to rip open cairhien like an overripe apple no elayne we have to attack and crush that northern army while it is weak only then could we possibly hold against the southern one if we fail the two will smash us between them it is the risk we must take elayne said make your plans bashere well make them work egwene stepped into telaranrhiod the world of dreams had always been dangerous unpredictable lately it was even more so the grand city of tear reflected strangely in the dream the buildings weathered as if by a hundred years of storms the city walls were now little more than ten feet high their tops rounded and smooth blown by the wind buildings inside had worn away leaving foundations and lumps of weathered stone chilled by the sight egwene turned toward the stone it at least stood as it had tall strong unchanged by the weathering of the winds that comforted her she sent herself into its heart the wise ones waited for her that too was comforting even in this time of change and tempest they were solid like the stone itself amys bair and melaine waited for her she overheard part of their conversation before they noticed her i saw it just as she did bair was saying though it was my own descendants who lent me their eyes i think we will all see it now if we return the third time it should be required three visits melaine said that brings change indeed we still do not know if the second visit will show this or the previous vision conscious of her eavesdropping egwene cleared her throat they turned toward her immediately falling silent i did not mean to intrude egwene said walking among the columns and joining them it is nothing bair said we should have guarded our tongues we were the ones to invite you here to meet us after all it is good to see you egwene alvere melaine said smiling with affection the woman looked so far along in her pregnancy she must be close to delivering from reports your army gains much ji we do well egwene said settling herself on the floor with them you shall have your own chance melaine the caracarn delays amys said frowning the spears grow impatient we should be moving against sightblinder he likes to prepare and plan egwene said she hesitated i cannot remain with you long i have a meeting with him later today about what bair asked leaning forward curious i dont know egwene said i found a letter from him on the floor of my tent he said he wanted to see me but not as dragon and amyrlin as old friends tell him that he must not dally bair said but here there is something we need to speak of with you what is it egwene asked curious have you seen anything like this melaine said concentrating on the floor between them the rock split with cracks she was imposing her will upon the world of dreams creating something specific for egwene to see at first she was confused cracks in the rock of course she had seen cracks in rock before and with the earthquakes striking the land so often recently they were probably becoming even more common there was something distinctive about these egwene leaned forward and found that the cracks seemed to empty into nothing a deep blackness unnaturally so what is it egwene asked our people report seeing these amys said softly those fighting in andor and those in the blasted lands with rand althor they appear like fractures in the pattern itself they remain dark like that for a few moments then fade leaving behind ordinary cracks it is a very dangerous sign bair said we sent one of ours to ask at the borderlands where lan mandragoran fights it appears that the cracks are most common there they appear more frequently when the dreadlords fight amys said when they use the weave known as balefire egwene stared at that darkness shivering balefire weakens the pattern during the war of power even the forsaken grew to fear using it lest they unravel the world itself we must spread the word to all of our allies amys said we must not use this weave it is forbidden of aes sedai already egwene said but i will make it known that nobody is to consider breaking that rule that is wise melaine said for a people with so many rules for themselves i have found that the aes sedai are very proficient at ignoring guidelines if their situation allows it we trust our women egwene said the oaths hold them otherwise their own wisdom must guide them if moiraine had not been willing to bend this rule perrin would be deadas would mat had rand ignored the rule but i will speak to the women balefire bothered her not that it existed or did what it did it was uniquely dangerous and yet what was it perrin had said to her in the dream its only another weave it seemed unfair that the shadow should have access to such a weapon as this one that unraveled the pattern as it was used how would they fight it how could they counter it this is not the only reason we sent to you egwene alvere melaine said you have seen the changes to the world of dreams egwene nodded the storm grows worse here we will not be visiting here often in the future amys said we have made the decision and despite our complaints about him the caracarn does prepare his armies to move it will not be long before we march with him to the shadows own hold egwene nodded slowly so this is it i am proud of you girl amys said amys toughasrocks amys looked tearyeyed they rose and egwene embraced them one at a time light shelter you amys melaine bair egwene said give my love to the others it will be done egwene alvere bair said may you find water and shade now and always one by one they faded from tear egwene took a deep breath looking upward the building groaned like a ship in a tempest the rock itself seemed to shift around her she had loved this placenot the stone but telararirhiod it had taught her so much but she knew as she prepared to leave that it was like a river in dangerous flood familiar and loved it might be but she could not risk herself here not while the white tower needed her and farewell to you old friend she said to the air until i dream again she let herself wake gawyn waited beside the bed as usual they were back in the tower egwene fully dressed in the chamber near her study it was not yet evening but the request from the wise one was not something she had wished to ignore hes here gawyn said quietly glancing at the door to her study then let us meet him egwene said she prepared herself rising smoothing her skirt she nodded to gawyn and they stepped out and went to meet the dragon reborn rand smiled when he saw her he waited inside with two maidens she did not know what is this about egwene asked tiredly convincing me to break the seals youve grown cynical rand noted the last two times we met egwene said you pointedly tried to infuriate me am i not to expect it again i am not trying to infuriate you rand said look here he pulled something from his pocket a hair ribbon he held it out to her you always looked forward so to being able to braid your hair so now you imply im a child egwene asked exasperated gawyn rested a hand on her shoulder comforting what no rand sighed light egwene i want to make amends youre like a sister to me i never had siblings or at least the one i have doesnt know me i only have you please im not trying to rile you for a moment he seemed just as he had long ago an innocent boy earnest egwene let her frustration melt away rand im busy we are busy there isnt time for things like this your armies are impatient their time will soon come rand said growing harder before this is through they will wonder why they were so eager and will look with longing at these restful days waiting he still held the ribbon in his hand forming a fist i just i didnt want to go to my fight with our last meeting having been an argument even if it was an important one oh rand egwene said she stepped forward taking the ribbon she embraced him light but hed been difficult to deal with latelybut shed thought the same thing about her parents on occasion i support you it doesnt mean im going to do as you say with the seals but i do support you egwene released rand she would not be tearyeyed even if it did seem like a last parting for them wait gawyn said sibling you have a sibling i am the son of tigraine rand said shrugging born after she went to the waste and became a maiden gawyn looked stunned though egwene had figured this out ages ago you are galads brother gawyn asked halfbrother rand said not that it would probably mean much to a whitecloak we had the same mother his father like yours was taringail but mine was an aiel i think galad would surprise you gawyn said softly but elayne not to tell you your own family history but elayne is not related to me rand turned to egwene may i see them the seals before i go to shayol ghul i would look upon them one last time i promise not to do anything with them reluctantly she fished them from the pouch at her waist where she often kept them gawyn still looking stunned walked to the window and pushed it open letting light into the room the white tower felt still silent its armies were gone its masters at war she unwrapped the first seal and handed it to rand she would not give him all of them at once just in case she did trust his word it was rand after all but just in case rand held up the seal staring at it as if seeking wisdom in that sinuous line i crafted these he whispered i made them to never break but i knew as i did it that they would eventually fail everything eventually fails when he touches it egwene hefted another of the seals holding it gingerly it would not do to break the thing by accident she kept them wrapped and the pouch stuffed with cloth she worried about breaking them while carrying them but moiraine had indicated that egwene would break them she felt that was foolish but the words she had read the things moiraine had said well if the moment did come to break them egwene would need to have them at hand and so she carried themcarried with her the potential death of the world itself rand suddenly went as white as a sheet egwene he said this does not fool me what doesnt he looked at her this is a fake please it is all right tell me the truth you made a copy and gave it to me i did nothing of the sort she said oh oh light rand raised the seal again its a fake what egwene snatched it from his hand feeling it she sensed nothing wrong how can you be sure i made them rand said i know my handiwork that is not one of the seals it is light someone took them ive had these with me each moment since you gave them to me egwene said then it happened before rand whispered i didnt look them over carefully after i fetched them he knew somehow where id put them taking the other one from her he shook his head its not real either he took the third nor this one he looked at her he has them egwene hes stolen them back somehow the dark one holds the keys to his own prison for much of mats life he had wished that people would not look at him so much they gave him frowns at the trouble he had ostensibly caused trouble that really was not his faultand glances of disapproval when he walked about completely innocent trying his best to be pleasant every boy filched a pie now and then no harm in it it was practically expected normal life had been harder for mat than for other boys for no good reason everyone watched him extra carefully perrin could have stolen pies all day and people would have just smiled at him and maybe mussed his hair mat they came at with the broom when he entered a place to dice he drew looks people watched him as they would watch a cheaterthough he never wasor with envy in their eyes yes he had always figured that not being watched would be a grand situation a cause for real celebration now he had it and it made him sick you can look at me mat protested really burn you its all right my eyes would be lowered the serving woman said as she piled fabric on the low table against the wall your eyes are already lowered theyre staring at the bloody floor arent they i want you to raise them the seanchan continued her work she was of fair skin with freckles under her eyes not too bad to look at though he was more in favor of darker shades these days he still would not have minded if this girl showed him a smile how could he talk to a woman if he could not try to make her smile a few other servants entered eyes downcast carrying other folds of fabric mat stood in what were apparently his chambers in the palace they were more numerous than he would ever need perhaps talmanes and some of the band could move in with him and keep the place from feeling so empty mat sauntered over to the window below in the mol hara an army organized it was going to take longer than he wanted galganmat had only met the man briefly and he did not trust the fellow no matter what tuon said about his assassins not being intended to succeedwas gathering the seanchan forces from the borders but too slowly he worried about losing almoth plain with the withdrawal well he had better listen to reason mat had little reason to like the man already but if he delayed in this honored one the serving girl asked mat turned raising an eyebrow several dacovale had entered with the last of the fabric and mat found himself blushing they hardly wore any clothing at all and what they did wear was transparent he could look though could he not they would not wear clothing like that if a man was not supposed to look what would tuon think she doesnt own me mat thought determined i will not be husbandly the freckled servantshe was sojhin half of her head shavedgestured toward a person who had entered behind the dacovale a middleaged woman with her dark hair in a bun none of her head shaved she was squat shaped kind of like a bell with a grandmotherly air the newcomer inspected him finally someone who would look at him if only her face did not have the expression of one studying horses at the market black for his new station the woman said clapping her hands once green for his heritage a deep forest in moderation someone bring me a variety of eyepatches and someone else burn that hat what mat exclaimed servants swarmed around him picking at his clothing wait now what is this your new regalia honored one the woman said i am nata and i will be your personal tailor you arent burning my hat mat said try and well bloody well see if you can fly from four stories up do you understand me the woman hesitated yes honored one do not burn his clothing keep it safe should it be needed she seemed doubtful it ever would be mat opened his mouth to complain further and then one of the dacovale opened a box jewelry shone inside it rubies emeralds firedrops mats breath caught in his throat there was a fortune in there he was so stunned that he almost did not notice that the servants were undressing him they pulled at his shirt and mat let them although he held on to his scarf he was not bashful that blush on his cheeks had nothing to do with his trousers being taken off he was just surprised at the jewelry then one of the young dacovale reached for mats smallclothes youd be real funny without any fingers mat growled the dacovale looked uphis eyes widening face paling he immediately looked down again bowing backing away mat was not bashful but the smallclothes were far enough nata clicked her tongue her servants began draping mat in fine cloth black and deep greenso dark it was nearly black itself we shall tailor you outfits for military expression court attendance private functions and civic appearances it no mat said military only but were at the bloody last battle woman mat said if we survive this you can make me a bloody feastday cap until then were at war and i dont need anything else she nodded mat reluctantly stood with arms out to the sides letting them drape him in the fabric taking measurements if he had to put up with this business of being called honored one and highness then he could at least make certain he was dressed in a reasonable way in truth he had been growing tired of the same old clothing there did not seem to be much lace used by the seanchan tailor which was a shame but mat did not want to correct her in doing her job he could not complain about every little thing nobody liked a complainer least of all mat as they dealt with the measurements a servant approached with a small velvetlined case displaying a variety of eyepatches he hesitated considering some were marked with gemstones others painted with designs that one he said pointing at the least ornamented patch simple black with only two small rubies cut thin and long set at the right and left edges of the patch opposite one another they fitted it on him as the other servants finished measuring that done the tailor had her servants dress him in a costume she had brought apparently he was not going to be allowed back to his old clothing while he waited for his new outfits to be tailored the clothing started off simple enough a silk robe of fine weave mat would have preferred trousers but the robe was comfortable however they overlaid it with a larger stiffer robe it was also silk of dark green every inch of it embroidered with scrollwork patterns the sleeves were large enough to trot a horse through and they felt heavy and bulky i thought i said to give me warriors clothing he said this is a ceremonial warriors uniform for a member of the imperial family highness nata said many will see you as an outsider and though nobody would question your loyalty it would be well for our soldiers to see you as prince of the ravens first and an outlander second would you agree i suppose mat said the servants continued buckling on an ornate girdle and placing forearm bands of the same design on his arms inside the large sleeves that was all right mat supposed as the girdle pulled in the waist of the clothing and kept it from feeling quite so bulky unfortunately the next piece of clothing was the most ridiculous of all the stiff pale piece of cloth fitted onto his shoulders it draped down his front and back like a tabard the sides open but they flared out to the sides a good foot each making him seem inhumanly wide they were like shoulder plates from heavy armor only made of cloth here now mat said this isnt a kind of trick you play on a fellow just because hes new is it trick honored one nata asked you cant really mat trailed off as someone passed outside his door another commander the man was wearing a costume not unlike mats though not as ornate and with shoulders not quite as wide not imperial family armor but ceremonial armor for one of the blood still it was almost as lavish the man stopped and bowed to mat then continued on his way burn me mat said nata clapped and the servants began draping mat in gemstones they chose mostly rubies which made mat uncomfortable that had to be a coincidence did it not he did not know what he thought of being covered in all of these gemstones perhaps he could sell them actually if he could put these on a gambling table he could probably end up owning all of ebou dar tuon already owns it he realized and i married her it sank in that he was rich really rich he sat there letting them lacquer his fingernails as he considered what this all meant oh he had not needed to worry about money for some time as he could always gamble for more this was different if he already had everything what point was there to gambling this did not sound like much fun people were not supposed to give you things like this you were supposed to find a way to come to them yourself by wits luck or skill burn me mat said lowering his arms to his side as the lacquering finished im a bloody nobleman he sighed plucking his hat from the hands of a startled servantwho was walking past with his old clothing and set it on his head honored one nata said please forgive my forwardness but it is my place to advise on fashion if you please that hat looks particularly out of place with that uniform who cares mat said marching out of the room he almost had to go out the door sideways if im going to look ridiculous i might as well do it with style someone point me toward where our flaming generals are meeting i need to figure out how many troops we have chapter into thakandar later in the day after her meeting with rand egwene thrust voras saangreal out in front of her and wove fire threads came together tiny glowing ribbons forming a complex weave in the air before her she could almost feel their heat shining upon her turning her skin a violent orange she finished the weave and a fiery ball as large as a boulder arced in the air crackling and roaring it fell upon the distant hilltop like a meteor the blast flung bowwielding trollocs aside scattering their carcasses romanda opened a gateway beside egwene romanda was among the yellows who had insisted on staying at the battlefront to provide emergency healing she and her small crew had been invaluable in saving lives today however there would be no opportunity for healing the trollocs had pulled back into the hills as bryne had indicated they would after a day and a half of rest many of the aes sedai were recovered not to full strengthnot after over a week of grueling combatbut enough gawyn jumped through the gateway right after it opened his sword out egwene followed along with romanda lelaine leane silviana raemassa and a handful of warders and soldiers they stepped out onto the very hilltop egwene had just cleared the charred earth was still warm under her feet blackened the scent of burned flesh hung in the air this hill was in the very middle of the trolloc army all around shadowspawn scrambled for safety this way and that romanda held the gateway and silviana began weaving air to create a dome of wind against arrows the rest of them began to send weaves outward the trollocs reacted slowlytheyd been waiting here in these hills ready to surge down into the valleys as egwenes army entered normally this would have been a disaster the trollocs could rain projectiles down on egwenes troops and her cavalry would have been at a disadvantage trying to get up those hills the hilltops would have given the trollocs and fades a better perspective to spot weak points in egwenes forces and attack accordingly egwene and her commanders had been disinclined to give the enemy that advantage the beasts scattered as the battle reversed on them aes sedai seizing the hilltops some of the beasts tried to charge up and retake them but others scrambled away for their lives egwenes heavy cavalry came next thundering through the valleys what had once been a very efficient position for the trollocs became a killing field with the trolloc archers removed by aes sedai the heavy cavalry could kill practically unmolested that opened the way for the foot who marched in formation to sweep the trollocs back smashing them against hillsides so that the aes sedai could kill them in groups unfortunately the trollocs had grown more accustomed to facing the one power either that or the myrddraal had grown more thorough at encouraging them soon more coordinated groups of trollocs charged the hilltops while others managed to form resistance to the foot assault bryne is right egwene thought leveling a contingent of trollocs that had almost clawed their way to her the fades are linked to the trollocs again the shadowspawn had been hesitant to use that tactic recently as killing the fade would drop all linked trollocs however she suspected that it was the only way they could make the trollocs climb toward almostcertain death on these hills if she could find the myrddraal linked to the trollocs nearby she could stop them all with one wellplaced weave of fire unfortunately the fades were crafty and had begun hiding among the trollocs theyre closing in lelaine said panting fall back egwene said they ducked through romandas gateway followed by their warders romanda came last leaping through as a group of trollocs claimed their hilltop one of the beasts a shaggyfurred bearlike monstrosity stumbled through the gateway after her the thing dropped dead immediately a faint wisp of smoke rising from its carcass its fellows hooted and growled on the other side egwene glanced at the other women then shrugged and released flame straight through the gateway a few fell dead twitching while the others scrambled away howling dropping their weapons that is effective leane noted folding her arms and raising an immaculate eyebrow at the gateway it was the middle of the last battle and the woman still took time each morning to do her face their gateway had taken them back to camp which was now mostly empty with the reserves formed up and ready to move when required the only soldiers who remained in the camp were a force of five hundred guarding brynes command tent she still carried the pouch with the false seals at her side rands words had shaken her hard how would they get the seals back if the minions of the shadow broke them at the wrong time it would be a catastrophe had they broken them already would the world know egwene felt a dread she could not abandon and yet the war continued and she had no recourse but to keep fighting they would think of a way to recover the seals if they could rand swore to try she wasnt certain what he could do theyre fighting so hard gawyn said egwene turned to find him standing a short distance away inspecting the battlefield with his looking glass she felt a longing from him without some men to lead as he had the younglings she knew he felt useless in these battles the trollocs are driven by myrddraal egwene said linked to give the fades greater control over them yes but why resist so strongly gawyn said still looking through the glass they dont care about this land its obvious that these hills are lost to them and yet they fight savagely trollocs are basethey fight and win or they scatter and retreat they dont hold land theyre trying to do so here its like like the fades think that even after a rout like this one theyre in a good position who knows why fades do what they do lelaine remarked arms folded looking through the stillopen gateway egwene turned looking through it too the hilltop was now empty strangely isolated amid the battle her soldiers had crashed up against the trollocs in the small valley between the hills and the fighting was brutal down there she heard grunts yells clangs bloodied pikes were raised in the air as a group of men were forced back and halberdiers moved in to try to slow the trollocs the shadowspawn were taking terrible casualties it was an oddity bryne had expected them to retreat somethings wrong egwene said the hairs of her arms standing on end her worry about the seals vanished for now her army was in danger gather the aes sedai and have the army pull back the other women looked at her as if she were mad gawyn took off at a dash toward the command tent to give her orders he didnt question mother romanda said letting her gateway die what is something split the air on the other side of egwenes war camp opposite the battlefield a line of light longer than any gateway egwene had seen it was nearly as wide as her camp itself the line of light turned upon itself opening a view that was not of southern kandor instead it was a place of ferns and drooping trees though they were brown like everything else they were still alien and unfamiliar an enormous army stood silently upon this unfamiliar landscape thousands of banners flew above it emblazoned with symbols egwene didnt recognize the foot soldiers wore kneelength garments that appeared to be some kind of padded armor reinforced with chain in a largesquared pattern others wore metal shirts that seemed sewn from coins tied together many carried hand axes though of a very strange design they had long thin handles that bulged like bulbs at the end and the axe heads were narrow and thin almost like picks the hafts of all of their weaponsfrom polearms to swordshad a flowing organic design smooth and not of a uniform width made of some dark red wood that had been painted with colorful dots down the sides egwene took in all of this in moments her mind searching for any kind of origin for this strange force she found nothing to latch on to until she sensed the channeling the glow of saidar surrounded hundreds of women all of them riding wearing strange dresses made entirely of stiff black silk the dresses were not tied at the waists but instead pulled relatively tight around the shoulders and flared wide toward the bottoms long rectangular tassels of a multitude of colors hung from ties at the front just below the neck the faces of the women were all tattooed release the power egwene said letting go of saidar dont let them sense you she dashed to the side lelaine following the glow winking out from around her romanda ignored egwene letting out a curse she began weaving a gateway to escape a dozen different weaves of fire suddenly thrashed the area where romanda stood the woman didnt have a chance to scream egwene and the other women scrambled through the camp as weaves of the one power destroyed tents consumed supplies and set the entire place aflame egwene reached the command tent just as gawyn stumbled out she grabbed him and pulled him to the ground as a ball of fire passed just overhead then crashed into a collection of tents nearby light gawyn said what is it sharans lelaine breathless huddled down beside them are you certain egwene whispered lelaine nodded accounts from the cairienin before the aiel war are plentiful if not very informative they werent allowed to see much but what they did see looked a lot like an army army gawyn said stretching to the side and looking between the tents toward the force marching through the unnaturally wide gateway blood and bloody ashes he swore ducking back there are thousands of them far too many to fight egwene agreed mind working furiously not pinned between them and the trollocs as we are we have to fall back i just passed the order to byrne to disengage the troops gawyn said but egwene where are we going to go trollocs in front that army behind light well be crushed between them byrne would react quickly hed send a messenger to the line captains oh no egwene grabbed gawyn and pulled him away from the command tent just as she felt channeling within lelaine cried out ducking in the other direction the sharan women reacted immediately to the channeling the ground ripped up underneath the tent destroying it in a burst of overwhelming power tattered shreds of cloth flew into the air amid stones and clods of earth egwene fell backward and gawyn pulled her toward a toppled cart that had been hit one wheel shattered its burden of firewood tumbling out gawyn pulled egwene to the sheltered place just under the edge of the cart beside the tumble of wood they huddled there though the wood flickered with flames and the ground was afire the heat was distressing but not unbearable egwene huddled against the ground blinking through eyes that burned with smoke searching for signs of lelaine or light siuan and byrne had been inside that tent along with yukiri and many of their command staff egwene and gawyn hid as flames rained on the camp tearing up the earth the sharans struck at any sign of movement several women who ran were instantly immolated be ready to run gawyn said once the fire stops falling the flames did wane but just as they did riders in sharan armor charged through the camp they hooted and yelled leveling bows at anyone they saw dropping dozens with arrows to the back after that the sharan troops moved through the camp in tight formations egwene waited tensely trying to think of how to slip away she saw no opportunity gawyn pulled egwene back farther rubbed soot on her cheeks and motioned for her to stay low then draped his warder cloak over them both with the smoke from the wood burning nearby perhaps they wouldnt be seen her heart thumped urgently in her chest gawyn pressed something to her face a kerchief he had soaked with his waterskin he held another one to his face and breathed through it she took the one he was holding to her but barely breathed those soldiers were so close one of the soldiers turned toward the cart peering at the woodpile but when he glanced through the smoke toward them he didnt seem to see anything egwene silently contemplated the warder cloak its colorshifting nature made them nearly invisible if they were careful not to move why dont i have one of these cloaks she thought with annoyance why should they only be for warders the soldiers were busy flushing out servants those who ran they killed with arrows from bows that stretched extremely far servants who moved more slowly they rounded up and forced to the ground egwene longed to embrace the source to do something to bring down fire and lightning upon these invaders she still had voras saangreal she could she quashed that line of thinking she was surrounded by the enemy and the swift reaction of the channelers indicated that they were watching for aes sedai if she wove for a single moment shed be killed before she could escape she huddled beside gawyn under his cloak hoping none of the sharan channelers walked close enough to sense her ability she could use a weave to hide that ability but would have to channel first to use it dared she try that they hid for a good hour or more if the cloud cover hadnt been so complete casting the land into perpetual twilight theyd certainly have been spotted cloak or no cloak she almost cried out at one point when a few of the sharan soldiers tossed some buckets of water onto the woodpile stifling the fire and soaking both of them she couldnt make out anything of her own army though she feared the worst the sharan channelers and a large portion of their army moved through the camp quickly toward the battlefield with bryne and the amyrlin gone and with a surprise force coming in from behind egwene felt sick how many were dying dead gawyn caught her arm as he felt her stir then shook his head mouthing a few words wait until night theyre dying she mouthed you cant help it was true she let him hold her letting his familiar scent calm her but how could she simply wait as soldiers and aes sedai who depended on her were slaughtered light a huge portion of the white tower was out there if this army fell and those women with it i am the amyrlin seat she told herself firmly i will be strong i will survive so long as i live the white tower stands she still let gawyn hold her aviendha crawled across the rock like a winter lizard seeking warmth her fingertips though callused were beginning to burn from the bitter cold shayol ghul was cold with air that smelled as if it came from a tomb rhuarc crawled to her left a stone dog named shaen to her right both wore the red headband of the siswaiaman she didnt know what to make of rhuarc a clan chief donning that headband he had never spoken of it it was as if the headband did not exist so it was with all of the siswaiaman amys crawled on shaens right for once no one had objected to wise ones joining the advance scouts in a place such as this at a time such as this the eyes of one who could channel might see what ordinary eyes would not aviendha pulled herself forward making no noise despite the necklaces she wore no plants sprouted on these rocks not even mold or lichen they were deep within the blasted lands now almost as deep as one could go rhuarc reachcd the ridge first and she saw him tense aviendha arrived next peering over the side of the rock keeping low so as not to be seen her breath stopped dead in her throat shed heard stories of this place of the massive forge near the base of the slope a single black stream running past it that water had been poisoned to the point that it would kill any who touched it hearths dotted the valley like open wounds reddening the fog around them as a young maiden shed listened with wide eyes as an ancient roofmistress told of the creatures who worked the shadows forges creatures that were not dead and not alive silent and horrible the brutish things moved with steps that held no lifelike the ticking hands of a clock the forgers paid little heed to the cages full of humans whose blood would be spilled to temper newly forged blades the captives might as well have been chunks of iron though aviendha was too far to hear the humans whimpers she felt them her fingers grew taut upon the rocks shayol ghul itself dominated the valley its black slopes rising like a serrated knife into the sky the sides were rent with cuts like the skin of a man who had been whipped a hundred times each score leaving a gash that spat steam perhaps that steam created the fog that lay over the valley the fog churned and surged as if the valley were a cup holding liquid such a terrible place amys whispered aviendha had never heard such dread in the womans voice that chilled aviendha nearly as much as the bitter wind that ruffled their clothing distant pings broke the air the workers forging a black column of smoke rose from the nearest forge and did not dissipate it rose like an umbilical cord to the clouds above which rained down lightning with dreadful frequency yes aviendha had heard stories of this place those stories had failed to convey the full truth one could not describe this place one had to experience it a scraping from behind and in a few moments rodel ituralde crawled up next to rhuarc he moved quietly for a wetlander you were so impatient that you could not await our report rhuarc asked softly no report can convey what a mans own eyes can ituralde said i didnt promise id stay behind i told you to go ahead and you did he raised his looking glass shading the front with his hand though that probably wasnt necessary with those clouds rhuarc frowned he and the other aiel who had come north had agreed to follow a wetlander general but it did not sit well with them nor should it they would do this thing without growing comfortable comfort was the great killer of men let it be enough aviendha thought turning back to look at the valley enough for my people enough for rand and the task he ynust accomplish seeing the end of her people had nauseated and horrified her but also awakened her if the end of the aiel was the sacrifice required for rand to win she would make it she would scream and curse the creators own name but she would pay that price any warrior would better that one people should end than the world fall completely under shadow the light willing it would not come to that the light willing her actions with the dragons peace would serve to protect and shelter the aiel she would not let the possibility of failure stop her they would fight waking from the dream was always a possibility when the spears were danced interesting ituralde said softly still looking through his glass your thoughts aiel we need to create a distraction rhuarc said we can come down the slope just to the east of the forge and set those captives free and break the place apart this stops the myrddraal from receiving new weapons and will keep the dark ones eyes on us and not the caracarn how long will it take the dragon ituralde asked what do you think aiel how much time do we give him to save the world he will fight amys said enter the mountain duel with sightblinder it will take as long as a fight needs to take a few hours perhaps i have not seen a duel last much longer than that even between two men of great skill let us assume ituralde said with a smile that there is going to be more to it than a duel i am not a fool rodel ituralde amys said coolly i doubt that the caracarris fight will be one of spears and shields however when he cleansed the source did that not happen in the space of a single day perhaps this will be similar perhaps ituralde said perhaps not he lowered the glass and looked to the aiel which possibility would you rather plan for the worst one aviendha said so we plan to hold out as long as the dragon needs ituralde said days weeks months years as long as it takes rhuarc nodded slowly what do you suggest the pass into the valley is narrow ituralde said scout reports put most of the shadowspawn left in the blight out beyond the pass there even they spend as little time as they can in this forsaken place if we can close off the pass and seize this valleydestroy those forgeworkers and the few fades down therewe could hold this place for ages you aiel are good at slashandrun tactics burn me but i know that from personal experience you lot attack that forge and well set about closing up the pass rhuarc nodded it is a good plan the four of them walked down the ridge to where rand waited dressed in red and gold arms behind his back accompanied by a force of twenty maidens and six ashaman plus nynaeve and moiraine he seemed very troubled by somethingshe could feel his anxietythough he should have been pleased he had convinced the seanchan to fight what was it that in his meeting with egwene alvere had disturbed him so rand turned and looked upward toward the peak of shayol ghul staring at it his emotions changed he seemed a man looking at a fountain in the threefold land savoring the idea of cool water aviendha could feel his anticipation there was also fear in him of course no warrior ever rid himself completely of the fear he controlled it overwhelmed it with the thirst to be on with the fight to test himself men or women could not know themselves not truly until they were strained to their absolute limit until they danced the spears with death felt their blood seeping out to stain the ground and drove the weapon home into the beating heart of an enemy rand althor wanted this and she understood him because of it strange to realize after all of this time just how alike they were she stepped up to him and he moved so that he stood just beside her his shoulder touching hers he did not drape an arm around her and she did not take his hand he did not own her and she did not own him the act of his movement so that they faced the same direction meant far more to her than any other gesture could shade of my heart he said softly watching his ashaman open a gateway what did you see a tomb she replied mine no that of your enemy the place where he was buried once and the place he will slumber again something hardened inside rand she could feel it his resolve you mean to kill him aviendha whispered sightblinder himself yes she waited others tell me i am a fool for thinking this rand said his guards moved through the gateway to return to merrilor no warrior should enter a battle without intending to see that battle finished aviendha said she hesitated after saying it something else occurring to her what is it rand asked well the greatest victory would be to take your enemy gaishain i doubt he would submit to that rand said dont make jest she said elbowing him in the side earning a grunt this must be considered rand althor which is the better way of jietoh is imprisoning the dark one like taking him gaishain if so that would be the proper path im not certain i care what is proper this time aviendha i a warrior must always consider jietoh she said sternly have i taught you nothing do not speak like that or you will shame me again before the other wise ones i had hoped thatconsidering how our relationship has progressedwe would be through with the lectures aviendha you thought that growing closer to me would end the lectures she asked baffled rand althor i have been among wetlander wives and ive seen that they he shook his head leading the way through the gateway aviendha following he seemed amused and that was good some of his anxiety had faded but truly this was not a jest wetlanders did not have good senses of humor sometimes they did not understand at all when to laugh on the other side of the gateway they entered a camp made up of many groups rand had command of the maidens and the siswaiaman along with most of the wise ones just outside of the aiel camp were the aes sedai rand had command of some three dozenall of the aes sedai who had sworn to him personally and most who were bonded to his ashaman that meant another two dozen ashaman of various ranks he also had rodel ituralde and his force composed primarily of domani their king with his wispy beard and the beauty mark on his cheek rode with them as well but left the command to the great captain the monarch gestured and ituralde walked over to give a report alsalam seemed uncomfortable around rand and did not go on any excursions when the dragon did aviendha liked that arrangement she wasnt certain she trusted this alsalam outside the aiel tents camped another large military force the tairen army including the elite force known as the defenders of the stone led by a man named rodrivar tihera their king was with them as well and was generally considered the highest authority in their gathered armies aside from rand the tairens would form a key part of rodel ituraldes plans as much as it galled aviendha to admit it ituralde was right the aiel were not a defensive force and though they could hold a pass if needed they would be better used for offensive maneuvers the tairens would be perfect for holding ground they had welltrained companies of pikemen and a full banner of crossbowmen with a new kind of crossbow crank knowledge of which the smiths had only just received they had spent the last week converting the equipment to the new style there was one other group in rands force and it was the most baffling to aviendha dragonsworn in large numbers they camped together and flew a flag that placed the image of the dragon over the ancient symbol of the aes sedai the group was made up of common men soldiers lords ladies and some aes sedai and warders they came from all nations including the aiel and shared only one common bond they had put aside all loyalties broken all bonds to fight in the last battle aviendha had heard discomforting rumors that many of the aiel among them were gaishain who had put aside the white claiming they would take it up again when the last battle was won rands coming was said to remove all bonds from men oaths shattered when he drew near and any loyalty or alliance was secondary to the need to serve him in this last fight for humankind part of her wanted to name that wetlander foolishness but perhaps she used that term too easily a wise one had to see with better eyes than that now that they were on the other side of the gateway aviendha finally allowed herself to release saidar the world dulled around her the added sense of life and wonder evaporating every time she released the one power she felt slightly hollow the joy and thrill now passed over ituralde and rhuarc went to join king darlin speaking together about their battle plans aviendha joined rand as he walked toward his tent the dagger worked rand said he reached down and fingered the black sheath that held the dull dagger artham i had heard them spoken of back in the age of legends but nobody created one i wonder who finally managed it are you certain it worked aviendha said he could have been watching you but not exposed his hand no i would have felt the attention rand said it did work with this he wont sense me until i step right up to the bore once he does know im there he will have trouble envisioning me striking at me directly aviendha that you should find this and identify it when you did that elayne should give it to me the pattern weaves us all where we need to be rand smiled then added elayne sounded sad when she gave me the dagger i think a part of her wanted to keep it because it would let her curse by the dark ones name without drawing his attention is this really a time for levity aviendha asked scowling at him if ever there was a need for laughter this is it rand said though the laughter seemed to have left his voice that anxiety of his returned as they reached his tent what is troubling you aviendha asked him they have the seals rand said what only egwene knows but it is true they were stolen perhaps from my hiding place perhaps after i delivered them to egwene then they are broken no rand said i would feel that i think they must be waiting perhaps they know that in breaking the seals they clear the way for me to reforge his prison theyll break them at just the wrong moment to let the dark one touch the world perhaps to give him the strength to overwhelm me as i face him we will find a way to stop this aviendha said voice firm he looked to her and smiled always the warrior of course what else would she be i have another concern the forsaken will try to strike at me when i enter to face him the dark one cannot see me does not know where i am and so is committing some of his forces to each of the different battlefronts the shadow pushes hard at lan trying to destroy himthe dark one presses elayne almost as badly in cairhien only egwene seems to be having some success he searches for me at each of these battlefields committing his creatures in large numbers when we attack shayol ghul we should be able to hold the valley against armies the forsaken however will come through gateways holding a pass will not stop them or the dreadlords male or female my confrontation with the dark one will draw them as the cleansing didonly a thousand times more urgently they will come with fire and thunder and they will kill so will we fm counting on it rand said but i cannot afford to take you into the cavern with me aviendha she felt a sinking feeling though she attacked it stabbed it left it to die i suspected do not think to send me away to safety rand althor you would i wouldnt dare he said id fear for my life if i were to trythere isnt any place that is safe now i cannot take you into the cavern because you will be needed out in the valley watching for the forsaken and the seals i need you aviendha i need all three of you to watch to be my handsmy heartduring this fight i am going to send min to egwene something is going to happen there im certain elayne will fight in the south and you i need you in the valley of thakandar watching my back i will leave orders for the aes sedai and ashaman aviendha ituralde leads our troops but you command our channelers at shayol ghul you must keep the enemy from entering the cavern after me you are my spear in this battle if they reach me while i am in the cavern i will be helpless what i must do will take all of meall of my concentration every scrap of power i have ill be like a babe lying in the wilderness defenseless against the beasts and how is this different from how you usually are rand althor she asked he laughed it felt good to be able to both see and feel that smile i thought you said this wasnt a time for levity someone must keep you humble aviendha said it would not do for you to think yourself something grand simply because you save the world he laughed again leading her up to the tent where min was nynaeve and moiraine waited there too one with annoyance on her face the other serenity nynaeve looked very odd with her hair not long enough to braid today shed pulled it up and pinned it back moiraine sat quietly on a large stone callandorthe sword that is not a swordlying across her lap one hand resting protectively on its hilt thom sat beside her whittling a stick and whistling softly to himself you should have taken me rand nynaeve said folding her arms you had work to do rand said you have tried as i instructed time and time again nynaeve said theres no way around the flaw rand you cannot use callandor it will be too dangerous rand came up to moiraine reaching out his hand and she lifted callandor for him to take he raised it up before him looking through its crystalline substance it started to glow softly min i have a task for you he whispered egwene is progressing well and i feel her battlefront will be key i wish you to go and watch her and the seanchan empress whom i have asked to join that battlefront once their forces are ready you would have the seanchan join egwenes battlefront moiraine asked aghast is that wise i cannot tell wisdom from brashness these days rand said but i would feel better if someone were keeping an eye on those two factions min will you do it i was hoping min looked away hoping hed take her into the cavern aviendha thought but of course he could not im sorry min rand said but i need you i will do it rand nynaeve said you are taking callandor when you attack him its weakness so long as you are channeling into that thing anyone can seize control of you they can use you and can draw the one power through callandor into you until it burns you outleaving you powerless and leaving them with the strength to level mountains destroy cities i will take it rand said but its a trap nynaeve said yes rand said sounding tired a trap i must stride into and allow to spring shut upon me he laughed suddenly throwing his head back as always why should i be surprised spread the word nynaeve tell ituralde rhuarc king darlin tomorrow we invade shayol ghul and claim it as our own if we must put our head into the lions mouth let us make certain that he chokes upon our flesh chapter not a mistake to ignore siuan rolled her shoulder she grimaced at the sharp pain yukiri she grumbled that weave of yours still needs work the tiny gray cursed softly standing up from beside a soldier who had lost his hand she hadnt healed him instead leaving him to more mundane healers with bandages to spend energy healing this man would be a waste as he would never fight again they needed to save their strength for soldiers who could rejoin the battle it was brutal reasoning well these were brutal times siuan and yukiri moved on to the next soldier in the line of wounded the man with the missing hand would survive without healing probably they had the yellows in mayene but their energy was consumed in healing aes sedai who had survived the escape and soldiers who could still fight all through the makeshift camp set up on arafellin soil east of the rivers ford soldiers wept and groaned so many wounded and siuan and yukiri were among the few aes sedai left with any strength to heal most of the others had drained themselves making gateways to bring their army out from between the two attacking forces the sharans had attacked aggressively but securing the white towers camp had occupied them for a while giving time for the army to flee pieces of it at least yukiri delved the next man then nodded siuan knelt down and began a healing weave shed never been very good at this and even with an angreal it took a lot out of her she brought the soldier back from the edge of death healing the wound in his side he gasped much of the energy for the healing coming from his own body siuan wavered then fell to her knees in exhaustion light she was as unsteady as a noblewoman her first day on the deck of a ship yukiri looked her over then reached out for the angreal a small stone flower go rest siuan siuan clenched her teeth but handed over the angreal the one power slipped from her and she let out a deep sigh halfrelieved and halfsaddened at losing the beauty of saidar yukiri moved to the next soldier siuan lay back where she was her body complaining of its numerous bruises and aches the events of the battle were a blur to her she remembered young gawyn trakand bursting into the command tent yelling that egwene wanted the army to retreat bryne had moved quickly dropping a written order through the gateway in the floor that was his newest method of passing commandsan arrow shaft with a note and a long ribbon tied to it dropped through a gateway high above there were no heads on the shafts just a small stone to weight them bryne had been restless before gawyn appeared he hadnt liked the way the battle had been playing out the way the trollocs moved had warned him that the shadow had been planning something siuan was certain hed already prepared the orders then there had been the explosions in camp and yukiri yelling for them to jump through the hole in the floor light shed assumed the woman was mad mad enough to save all of their lives apparently burn me if im going to lie here like a piece of yesterdays catch on the deck siuan thought staring up at the sky she hauled herself to her feet and started stalking through the new camp yukiri claimed her weave wasnt all that obscure though siuan had never heard of it a massive cushion of air meant to cradle someone who had fallen a great distance crafting it had drawn the attention of the sharanssharans of all things but theyd escaped she bryne yukiri and a few aides burn her theyd gotten out though that fall still made her wince to remember and yukiri kept saying she thought the weave might be the secret behind discovering how to fly fool woman there was a good reason the creator hadnt given people wings she found bryne at the edge of the new camp sitting exhausted on a stump two battle maps spread out by stones lay on the ground in front of him the maps were wrinkled hed grabbed them as the tent started to explode around him fool man she thought risking his life for a couple of pieces of paper from reports said general haerm the new commander of the illianer companions im sorry my lord the scouts dont dare sneak too close to the old camp no sign of the amyrlin siuan asked bryne and haerm both shook their heads keep looking young man siuan wagged a finger at haerm he raised an eyebrow at her use of the word young burn this youthful face shed been given i mean it the amyrlin is alive you find her you hear me i yes aes sedai he showed some measure of respect but not enough these illianers didnt know how to treat aes sedai bryne waved the man off and for once it didnt look as if anyone was waiting to meet with him everyone was probably too exhausted their camp looked more like a collection of refugees from a terrible fire than it did an army most of the men had rolled themselves in cloaks and gone to sleep soldiers were better than sailors at sleeping whenever and wherever they could she couldnt blame them shed been exhausted before the sharans arrived now she was tired as death itself she sat down on the ground beside brynes stump arm still hurting you bryne asked reaching down to rub her shoulder you can feel that it is siuan grumbled merely trying to be pleasant siuan dont think i have forgotten that youre to blame for this bruise me bryne said sounding amused you pushed me through the hole you didnt seem ready to move i was just about to jump i was almost there im certain bryne said its your fault siuan insisted i tumbled i hadnt intended to tumble and yukiris weave horrible thing it worked bryne said i doubt many people can claim to have fallen three hundred paces and survived she was too eager siuan said she was probably longing to make us jump you know all that talk about traveling and weaves of movement she trailed off partly because she was annoyed at herself this day had gone poorly enough without her griping at bryne how many did we lose not a much better topic but she needed to know do we have reports yet nearly one in two of the soldiers bryne said softly worse than shed suspected and the aes sedai we have somewhere around two hundred and fifty left bryne said though a number of those are in shock at having lost warders that was more of a disaster a hundred and twenty aes sedai dead in a matter of hours the white tower would require a very long time to recover from that im sorry siuan bryne said bah siuan said most of them treated me like fish guts anyway they resented me as amyrlin laughed when i was cast down and then made a servant of me when i returned bryne nodded still rubbing her shoulder he could feel that she was hurt despite her words there were good women among the dead many good sisters shes out there siuan said stubbornly egwene will surprise us bryne you watch if im watching it wont be much of a surprise will it siuan grunted fool man youre right he said solemnly on both counts i think egwene will surprise us im also a fool bryne i am siuan how could i miss that they were stalling they wanted to occupy us until this other force could gather the trollocs pulled back into those hills a defensive move trollocs arent defensive i assumed they were trying to set up an ambush only and that was why they were pulling back corpses and preparing to wait if id attacked them earlier this could have been avoided i was too careful a man who thinks all day about the catch he missed because of stormy weather ends up wasting time when the sky is clear a clever proverb siuan he said but theres a saying among generals written by fogh the tireless if you do not learn from your losses you will be ruled by them i cant see how i let this happen ive trained better than this prepared better than this its not just a mistake i can ignore siuan the pattern itself is at stake he rubbed his forehead in the dim light of the setting sun he looked older his face wrinkled his hands frail it was as if this battle had stolen decades from him he sighed hunching forward siuan found herself at a loss for words they sat in silence lyrelle waited outside the gates to the socalled black tower it took every ounce of her training not to let her frustration show this entire expedition had been a disaster from the start first the black tower had refused them entry until the reds had done their business and that had been followed by the trouble with gateways that had been followed by three bubbles of evil two attempts by darkfriends to murder the lot of them and the warning from the amyrlin that the black tower had joined the shadow to fight lyrelle had sent most of her women to fight alongside lan mandragoran at the amyrlins insistence shed remained behind with a few sisters to watch the black tower and now now this what to make of it i can assure you the young ashaman said the danger has passed we drove off the mflael and the others who turned to the shadow the rest of us walk in the light lyrelle turned to her companions a representative from each ajah along with backupsent for desperately this morning when the ashaman had first approached herin the form of thirty other sisters they accepted lyrelles leadership here if only reluctantly we will discuss it she said dismissing the young ashaman with a nod what do we do myrelle asked the green had been with lyrelle from the start one of the few that shed not sent away partially because she wanted the womans warders near if some of their members are fighting for the shadow gateways can be made again seaine said something has changed about this place in the days since we felt that channeling inside i dont trust it myrelle said we must know for certain seaine said we cannot leave the black tower unattended during the last battle itself we must see these men taken care of one way or another the black tower men claimed that only a few of their number had joined the shadow and that the channeling had been the result of an attack by the black ajah it galled her to hear them use those words black ajah for centuries the white tower had denied the existence of darkfriends among aes sedai the truth had unfortunately been revealed that didnt mean lyrelle wanted to hear men tossing around the term so casually particularly men like these if theyd wanted to attack us lyrelle said speculatively theyd have done it when we couldnt escape with gateways for now i will assume they have cleansed the problems among their ranks as was required of the white tower itself so we go in myrelle asked yes we bond the men we were promised and from them draw out the truth if it is obscured it troubled lyrelle that the dragon reborn had refused them the highestranking among the ashaman but lyrelle had devised a plan when she first came here it should still work she would first ask for a display of channeling among the men and would bond the one she felt was strongest she would then have that one tell her which among the trainees were the most talented so her sisters could bond those from there well she hoped that would contain the majority of these men light what a mess men who could channel walking about unashamed she did not accept this fable of the taint having been cleansed of course these men would claim such a thing sometimes lyrelle muttered i wish i could go back and slap myself for accepting this commission myrelle laughed she never did take events as seriously as she should lyrelle felt annoyed at having missed the chances to be had at the white tower during her long absence reunification fighting the seanchan these were the times when leadership could be proven and a woman could gain a reputation for strength opportunities appeared during times of upheaval opportunities now lost to her light but she hated that thought we will enter she called up to the walls framing the gate before her then more softly she continued to her women hold the one power and be careful we do not know what could happen here her women would be a match for a larger number of untrained ashaman if it came to that it shouldnt logically of course the men were likely mad so perhaps assuming logic from them was imprudent the large gates opened to allow her people in it said something about these black tower men that they chose to finish the walls around their grounds before actually building their tower she kneed her horse forward and myrelle and the others followed in a clopping of hooves lyrelle embraced the source and used the new weave which would tell her if a man channeled nearby it was not the young man from a short time ago who met them at the gates however what is this lyrelle asked as she was joined by pevara tazanovni lyrelle knew the red sitter though not well ive been asked to accompany you pevara said cheerfully logain thought that a familiar face might make you more comfortable lyrelle held in a sneer aes sedai should not be cheerful aes sedai should be calm collected andif anything elsestern a man should look at an aes sedai and immediately wonder what he had done wrong and how he could fix it pevara fell in beside her as they rode onto the grounds of the black tower logain who is in charge now sends his regards pevara continued he was gravely wounded in the attacks and has not yet fully recovered will he be well oh certainly he should be up and about in another day or two he will be needed to lead the ashaman as they join the last battle i suspect pity lyrelle thought the black tower would have been more easily controlled without a false dragon at their head better that he had died i am certain his aid will be useful lyrelle said his leadership however well we shall see tell me pevara i have been told that bonding a man who can channel is different from bonding a normal man have you been through the process yes pevara said is it true then lyrelle asked ordinary men can be compelled with the bond to obey but not these ashaman pevara smiled seeming wistful ah what would that be like no the bond cannot force ashaman you will have to use more inventive means that was not good how obedient are they aledrin asked from the other side it depends on the man i suspect pevara said if they cannot be forced lyrelle said will they obey their aes sedai in battle probably pevara said though there was something ambiguous about the way she said it i must tell you something all of you the mission i was sent on and the one you also pursue is a fools errand is that so lyrelle asked evenly she was hardly going to trust a red after what they had done to siuan why is that i was once where you are pevara said ready to bond all of the ashaman in an attempt to control them but would you ride into another city and select fifty men there at a whim and bond them as warders bonding the ashaman just to bond them is foolish it will not control them i do think some ashaman will make excellent warders butlike many men others will not i suggest that you abandon your plan to bond exactly fortyseven and take those who are most willing you will gain better warders interesting advice lyrelle said but as you mentioned the ashaman will be needed at the battlefront there is not time we will take the fortyseven most powerful pevara sighed but said nothing further as they passed several men in black coats with two pins on the high collars lyrelle felt her skin crawling as if insects burrowed beneath it men who could channel lelaine felt that the black tower was vital to the white towers plans well lyrelle did not belong to lelaine she was her own person and a sitter in her own right if she could find a way to bring the black tower under her direct authority then perhaps she could finally wiggle out from under lelaines thumb for that prize bonding ashaman was worthwhile light but she wasnt going to enjoy it they needed all of these men controlled somehow the dragon would be growing mad unreliable by this point tainted by the dark ones touch on saidin could he be manipulated into letting the rest of the men be bonded not having control through the bond that will be dangerous she imagined going into battle with ranks of two or three dozen ashaman bonded and forced to her will how could she make it happen they reached a line of men in black coats waiting at the edge of the village lyrelle and the others approached them and lyrelle did a quick count fortyseven men including the one standing at the front what trick were they trying to pull the one at the front came forward he was a sturdy man in his middle years and he looked as if hed recently suffered some kind of ordeal he had bags under his eyes and wan skin his step was firm however and his gaze steady as he met lyrelles eyes then bowed to her welcome aes sedai he said and you are androl genhald he said ive been put in charge of your fortyseven until they have been bonded my fortyseven i see that you have forgotten the terms already we are to be given any soldier or dedicated we wish and they cannot refuse us yes indeed androl said that is true unfortunately all of the men in the black tower other than these are either full ashaman or have been called away on urgent business the others would of course follow the dragons commands if they were here we made certain to keep fortyseven for you actually fortysix ive already been bonded by pevara sedai you see we will wait until the others return lyrelle said coldly alas androl said i do not think they will return any time soon if you intend to join the last battle you will have to make your selections quickly lyrelle narrowed her eyes at him then looked at pevara who shrugged this is a trick lyrelle said to androl and a childish one i thought it clever myself androl returned voice cool worthy of an aes sedai one might say you were promised that any member of the black tower save full ashaman would respond to your request they will any of them to whom you can make the request undoubtedly you chose for me the weakest among your numbers actually androl said we took those who volunteered they are good men every one of them they are the ones who wanted to be warders the dragon reborn will hear of this from what ive heard androl said hes heading to shayol ghul any time now are you going to join him there just to make your complaint lyrelle drew her lips into a line heres the thing aes sedai androl said the dragon reborn sent a message to us just earlier today he instructed us to learn one last lesson that were not to think of ourselves as weapons but as men well men have a choice in their fate and weapons do not here are your men aes sedai respect them androl bowed again and walked away pevara hesitated then turned her horse following him lyrelle saw something in the womans face as she looked at the man so that is it lyrelle thought no better than a green that one is i would have expected more of one her age lyrelle was tempted to refuse this manipulation to go to the amyrlin and protest what had happened only news from the amyrlins battlefront was jumbled something about an unexpected army appearing details were not available certainly the amyrlin would not be happy to hear complaints at this point and certainly lyrelle admitted to herself she also wanted to be done with the black tower each of you pick two lyrelle said to her companions a few of us will take only one faolain and theodrin you are among those be quick about it all of you i want away from this place as soon as possible pevara caught up to androl as he slipped into one of the huts light she said id forgotten how cold some of us can be oh i dont know androl replied ive heard that some of you arent quite so bad be careful of them androl she said looking back out many will see you as only a threat or a tool to be used we won you over androl said walking into a room where canler jonneth and emarin waited with cups of warm tea all three were beginning to recover from the fighting jonneth most quickly emarin bore the worst scars most of them emotional he like logain had been subjected to the turning process pevara noticed him staring blankly sometimes face etched by fear as if remembering something horrible you three shouldnt be here pevara said hands on hips facing emarin and the other two i know logain promised you advancement but you still wear only the sword on your collars if any of those women saw you they could take you as warders they wont see us jonneth said with a laugh androl would have us through a gateway before we had time to curse so what do we do now canler asked whatever logain wishes of us androl said logain had changed since the ordeal androl whispered to her that he was darker now he spoke less he did still seem determined to get to the last battle but for now he gathered the men in and pored over things theyd found in taims rooms pevara worried that the turning had broken him inside he thinks there might be something in those battle maps he found in taims chambers emarin said well go where logain decides we can be of most use androl replied a straightforward answer but one that didnt actually say much and what of the lord dragon pevara asked carefully she felt androls uncertainty the ashaman naeff had come to them bearing news and instructionsand with them some implications the dragon reborn had known all was not well at the black tower he left us alone on purpose androl said he would have come if he could have jonneth said i promise you he left us to escape on our own emarin said or to fall on our own he has become a harsh man perhaps callous it doesnt matter androl said the black tower has learned to survive without him light it always survived without him he barely had anything to do with us it was logain who gave us hope it is logain who will have my allegiance the others nodded pevara felt something important happening here they couldnt have leaned upon him forever anyway she thought the dragon reborn will die at the last battle by intention or not he had given them the chance to become their own men i will take his last order to heart however androl said i will not be merely a weapon the taint is cleansed we fight not to die but to live we have a reason to live spread the word among the other men and let us take oaths to uphold logain as our leader and then to the last battle not as minions of the dragon reborn not as pawns of the amyrlin seat but as the black tower our own men our own men the other three whispered nodding chapter the wyld egwene was shocked awake as gawyn clamped his hand over her mouth she tensed memories returning like the light of a sunrise they were still hiding beneath the broken cart the air still smelled of burned wood the land nearby was dark as coal night had fallen she looked to gawyn and nodded had she really drifted off she wouldnt have thought it possible under the circumstances im going to try to slip away gawyn whispered and make a distraction ill go with you i can go more quietly obviously youve never tried to sneak up on someone from the two rivers gawyn trakand she said id bet you a hundred tar valon marks that im the quieter of us two yes gawyn whispered but if you draw within a dozen steps of one of their channelers youll be spotted no matter how quiet theyve been patrolling through camp particularly at the perimeters she frowned how did he know that you went out scouting a little he whispered i wasnt seen theyre scavenging through the tents taking captive anyone they find we wont be able to hide here much longer he should not have gone out without asking her we gawyn stiffened and egwene cut off listening feet shuffling the two of them pulled back watching as ten or twelve captives were led into an open space near where the command tent had stood sharans placed torches on poles around the ragged prisoners a few of these were soldiers beaten to the point where they could barely walk there were cooks and laborers as well they had been lashed their trousers frayed all of their shirts had been removed on their backs someone had tattooed a symbol that egwene did not recognize at least she thought they were tattoos the symbols might have been burned into them as the captives were gathered someone yelled nearby in a few minutes a darkskinned sharan guard walked up dragging a young messenger boy hed apparently found hiding in camp he ripped off the boys shirt and shoved him crying to the ground the sharans oddly wore clothing that had a large diamond shape cut out of the back egwene could see that the guard bore a mark on his own back a tattoo she could barely make out against his dark skin his clothing was very formal with a large stiff robe that came almost to his knees it didnt have sleeves but underneath he wore a shirt with a diamond cutout that had long sleeves another sharan came out of the darkness and this man was almost completely naked he wore ripped trousers but no shirt instead of a tattoo on his back he had tattoos all across his shoulders they crept up his neck like twisted vines before reaching up to cup his jaw and cheeks they looked like a hundred twisted hands long fingers with claws holding his head from below this man went over to the kneeling messenger boy the other guards shuffled they werent comfortable with this fellow whoever he was he held out a hand sneering the boys back burned suddenly with a tattoo mark like that of the other captives smoke rose and the boy cried out in pain gawyn exhaled softly in shock that man with the tattoos running up onto his face that man could channel several of the guards muttered she could almost understand the words but they had a thick accent the channeler snapped like a feral dog the guards stepped back and the channeler prowled off disappearing into the shadows light egwene thought rustling in the darkness resolved into two women in the wide silk dresses one had lighter skin and as egwene searched she found that some of the soldiers did too not all sharans were dark as the fellows shed seen so far the womens faces were very beautiful delicate egwene shrank back from what she had seen earlier these two would probably be channelers if they stepped too close to egwene they might sense her the two women inspected the captives by the light of their lanterns egwene made out tattoos on their faces as well though theirs were not as disturbing as those upon the men these were like leaves tattooed from the back of the neck forward going under the ears and spreading like blossoms on the cheeks the two women whispered to one another and again egwene felt as if she could almost understand them if she could weave a thread to listen idiot she thought channeling would get her killed here others gathered around the captives egwene held her breath a hundred two hundred more people approached they did not talk much they seemed a quiet solemn people these sharans most of those who came had open backs to their garments revealing their tattoos were those symbols of status she had assumed that the more important one was the more intricate the tattoos however officersshe had to assume that was what they were with their feathered helmets and fine silken coats and golden armor made as if of coins that had been sewn together through the holes at their centersthey had only small openings revealing tiny tattoos at the base of shoulders theyve removed pieces of armor to display the tattoos she thought surely they did not do battle with the skin exposed this was something done during more formal times the last people who joined the crowdushered to the frontwere the strangest of all two men and a woman atop small donkeys all three wearing beautiful silk skirts their animals draped with gold and silver chains plumes of vibrant colors fanned out from intricate headdresses upon these three they were nude from the waist up including the woman save for the jewelry and necklaces that covered much of their chests their backs were exposed their heads shaven just on the back to show their necks there were no tattoos so lords of some sort except all three had hollow haunted expressions they slumped forward eyes down faces wan their arms seemed thin almost skeletal so frail what had been done to these people it made no sense to her the sharans were undoubtedly a people as baffling as the aiel probably more so but why come now egwene thought why after centuries upon centuries of isolation have they finally decided to invade there were no coincidences not of this magnitude these had come to ambush egwenes people and had worked with the trollocs she let herself seize upon that whatever she learned here would be of vital importance she could not help her army right nowlight send that some of its members at least had managed to fleeso she should learn what she could gawyn prodded her softly she looked to him and felt his worry for her now he mouthed gesturing behind them perhaps with everyones attention drawn by whatever was happening the two of them could sneak away they started to back up shuffling quietly one of the sharan channelers called out egwene froze shed been spotted no no egwene breathed deeply trying to calm her heart which seemed to be trying to beat its way out through her chest the woman was speaking to the others egwene thought shed heard the words it is done through the thick accent the group of people knelt down the bejeweled trio bowed their heads further and then near the captives the air bent egwene couldnt describe it any other way it warped and and seemed to rip apart twisting like it did above the road on a hot day something formed from this disruption a tall man in glistening armor he wore no helmet and had dark hair and light skin his nose was slightly hooked and he was very handsome particularly in that armor it looked to be constructed all of coins silvery and overlapping the coins were polished to such a shine they reflected the faces around him like a mirror you have done well the man announced to those bowing before him you may stand his voice bore hints of the sharan accent but it was not nearly as thick the man placed his hand on the pommel of the sword at his waist as the others rose from the darkness behind a group of the channelers crawled forward they bobbed for this newcomer in a kind of bow he removed one of his gauntlets reached out with an offhanded gesture and scratched the head of one of the men as a lord might favor a hound so these are the new inacal the man said speculatively do any of you know who i am the captives cringed before him though the sharans had risen the captives were smart enough to remain on the ground none of them spoke i suspected not the man said though one can never tell if ones fame has spread unexpectedly tell me if you know who i am speak it and i will let you free no replies well you will listen and remember the man said i am bao the wyld i am your savior i have crawled through the depths of sorrow and have risen up to accept my glory i have come seeking what was taken from me remember that the captives cowered further obviously uncertain what to do gawyn tugged on egwenes sleeve motioning backward but she did not move there was something about that man he looked up suddenly he focused on the women channelers then gazed about peering into the darkness do any of you inacal know the dragon he asked though he sounded distracted speak up tell me i did see him said one of the captive soldiers several times did you speak with him bao asked strolling away from the captives no great lord the soldier said the aes sedai they did speak with him not i yes i worried you would be of no use bao said servants we are being watched you have not searched this camp as well as you claimed i sense a woman nearby who can channel egwene felt a spike of alarm gawyn pulled on her arm meaning to go but if they ran theyd be captured for certain light she the crowd turned at a sudden noise near one of the fallen tents bao raised a hand and egwene heard a furious yell in the darkness moments later leane floated through the crowd of sharans tied in air her eyes wide bao brought her up close to him holding her wrapped in weaves that egwene could not see her heart continued to pound leane was alive how had she remained hidden light what could egwene do ah bao said one of these aes sedai you you have spoken with the dragon leane didnt respond to her credit she kept her face blank impressive bao said reaching up fingers and touching her chin he held up another hand and the collected captives suddenly started to writhe and scream they burst into flames yelling in agony egwene had to forcibly stop herself from reaching for the true source as she watched she was crying by the time it ended though she did not remember starting the sharans shuffled do not be displeased bao said to them i know you went to great trouble to take some alive for me but they would have made poor inacal they are not raised to it and during this war we do not have time to train them killing them now is a mercy compared to what they would have had to endure besides this one this aes sedai will serve our purpose leanes mask had cracked and despite the distance egwene could see her hatred bao still had her chin cupped in his hand you are a beautiful thing he said unfortunately beauty is meaningless you are to deliver a message for me aes sedai to lews therin the one who calls himself the dragon reborn tell him that i have come to slay him and in so doing i will claim this world i will take what originally should have been mine tell him that tell him you have seen me and describe me to him he will know me just as the people here awaited him with prophecy just as they showered him with glory the people of my land awaited me i have fulfilled their prophecies he is false and i am true tell him i will finally have satisfaction he is to come to me so that we may face one another if he does not i will slaughter and destroy i will seize his people i will enslave his children i will take his women for my own one by one i will break destroy or dominate everything he has loved the only way for him to avoid this is for him to come and face me tell him this little aes sedai tell him that an old friend awaits i am bao the wyld he who is owned only by the land the dragonslayer he knew me once by a name i have scorned the name barid bel barid bel egwene thought memories from her lessons in the white tower returning to her barid bel medar demandred the storm in the wolf dream was a changeable thing perrin spent hours prowling the borderlands visiting packs of wolves as he ran down dry riverbeds and across broken hills gaul had learned quickly he wouldnt stand for a moment against slayer of course but at least he had learned to keep his clothing from changing though his veil did still snap up to cover his face when he was startled the two of them bounded through kandor leaving blurs in the air as they moved from hilltop to hilltop the storm was sometimes strong sometimes weak at the moment kandor was hauntingly still the grassy highland landscape was strewn with all kinds of debris tents roofing tiles the sail of a large ship even a blacksmiths anvil deposited pointfirst into a muddy hillside the dangerously powerful storm could arise anywhere in the wolf dream and rip apart cities or forests hed found tairen hats blown all the way to shienar perrin came to rest on a hilltop gaul streaking into place beside him how long had they been searching for slayer a few hours it seemed on one hand on the other how much ground had they crossed they had returned to their food stores now three times to eat did that mean a day had passed gaul perrin said how long have we been at this i cannot say perrin aybara gaul replied he checked for the sun though there was none a long while will we need to stop and sleep that was a good question perrins stomach suddenly growled and he made them a meal of dried meat and a hunk of bread he gave some to gaul would summoned bread sustain them in the wolf dream or would it merely vanish once they consumed it the latter the food vanished even as perrin ate it they would need to rely upon their supplies perhaps getting more from rands ashaman during the daily opening of that portal for now he shifted back to their packs and dug out some dried meat then rejoined gaul in the north as they settled down on the hillside to eat again he found himself dwelling on the dreamspike he carried it with him turned to its slumbering position as lanfear had taught him it made no dome now but he could make one when he wished lanfear had all but given it to him what did that mean why did she taunt him he ripped at a hunk of dried meat was faile safe if the shadow discovered what she was doing well he wished he could at least check on her he took a long drink from his waterskin then searched outward for the wolves there were hundreds of them up here in the borderlands perhaps thousands he gave those nearby a greeting sending his scent mixed with his image the dozen replies that came were not words but his mind understood them as such young bull this from a wolf named white eyes the last hunt is here will you lead us many asked this lately and perrin couldnt figure out how to interpret it why do you need me to lead you it will be by your call white eyes replied by your howl i dont understand what you mean perrin sent can you not hunt on your own not this prey young bull perrin shook his head a response like others hed received white eyes he sent have you seen slayer the killer of wolves has he stalked you here perrin sent it out broadly and some of the other wolves replied they knew of slayer his image and scent had been passed among many wolves much as had perrins own none had seen him recently but time was an odd thing to wolves perrin wasnt certain how recent their recently really was perrin took a bite of dried meat and caught himself growling softly he stifled that he had come to a peace with the wolf inside of him but that didnt mean he intended to let it start tracking mud into the house young bull another wolf sent turn bow an aged female pack leader moonhunter walks the dreams again she seeks you thank you he sent back i know this i will avoid her avoid the moon turn bow sent back a difficult thing young bull difficult she had the right of that i saw heartseeker just now sent steps a blackfurred youth she wears a new scent but it is her other wolves sent agreement heartseeker was in the wolf dream some had seen her to the east but others said that she had been seen to the south but what of slayer where was the man if not hunting wolves perrin caught himself growling again heartseeker that must be one of the forsaken though he didnt recognize the images they sent of her she was ancient and so were the memories of wolves but often the things they remembered were fragments of fragments that their ancestors had seen any news gaul said another one of the forsaken is here perrin said with a grunt doing something to the east does it involve us the forsaken always involve us perrin said standing he reached down touched gaul on the shoulder and shifted them in the direction steps had indicated the position wasnt exact but once perrin arrived he found some wolves who had seen heartseeker on their way to the borderlands the day before they sent perrin eager greetings asking if he was going to lead them he rebuffed their questions pinpointing where heartseeker had been spotted it was merrilor perrin shifted there a strange mist hung over the landscape here tall trees the ones rand had grown reflected here and their lofty tops poked out of the mist above tents dotted the landscape like the tops of mushrooms aiel tents were plentiful and between them cook fires glowed in the mist this camp had been here long enough to manifest in the wolf dream though tent flaps changed places and bedrolls vanished flickering in the insubstantial way of this place perrin led gaul between the neat rows of tents and horseless horse pickets they both froze as they heard a sound someone muttering perrin used the trick hed seen lanfear use creating a pocket of something around himself that was invisible but which stopped sound it was strange but he did it by creating a barrier with no air in it why would that make the sound stop he and gaul crept forward to the canvas of a tent that of the man rodel ituralde one of the great captains judging by the banner inside a woman in trousers picked through documents on a table they kept vanishing in her fingers perrin didnt recognize her though she was painfully homely that certainly wasnt what hed have expected from one of the forsaken not that large forehead bulbous nose uneven eyes or thinning hair he didnt recognize her curses though he grasped the meaning from her tone gaul looked at him and perrin reached for his hammer but hesitated attacking slayer was one thing but one of the forsaken he was confident of his ability to resist weaves here in the wolf dream but still the woman cursed again as the paper she was reading vanished then she looked up perrins reaction was immediate he created a paperthin wall between her and him her side painted with an exact replica of the landscape behind him his side transparent she looked right at him but didnt see him and turned away beside him gaul let out a very soft breath of relief how did i do that perrin thought it wasnt something he had practiced it had merely seemed right heartseekerthis had to be shewaved her fingers and the tent split in half above her the canvas flaps hanging down she rose through the air moving toward the black tempest above perrin whispered to gaul wait here and watch for danger gaul nodded perrin cautiously followed heartseeker lifting himself into the air with a thought he tried to form another wall between himself and her but it was too difficult to keep the right image displayed while moving instead he kept his distance and put a blank brownishgreen wall between him and the forsaken hoping that if she happened to glance down shed pass over the small oddity she began to move more quickly and perrin forced himself to keep up he glanced down and was rewarded with the stomachchurning sight of merrilors landscape dwindling below then it grew dark and vanished into blackness they didnt pass through the clouds as the ground faded away so did the clouds and they entered someplace black pinpricks of light appeared all around perrin the woman above stopped and hung in the air for a few moments before streaking away to the right perrin followed again coloring himselfhis skin his clothing everythingblack to hide the woman approached one of the pinpricks of light until it expanded and dominated the sky in front of her heartseeker reached her hands forward and pressed them against the light she was muttering to herself feeling he needed to hear what she was saying perrin dared move closer though he suspected that the pounding of his heart was so loud it would give him away take it from me she said you think i care give me a face of broken stone what do i care thats not me i will have your place moridin it will be mine this face will just make them underestimate me burn you perrin frowned he couldnt make much sense of what she was saying go ahead and throw your armies at them you fools she continued to herself ill have the greater victory an insect can have a thousand legs but only one head destroy the head and the day is yours all youre doing is cutting off the legs stupid fool stupid arrogant insufferable fool ill have what is due me ill she hesitated then pivoted perrin spooked immediately sent himself back to the ground it worked thankfullyhe hadnt known if it would up in that place of lights gaul jumped and perrin took a deep breath lets a ball of blazing fire crashed into the ground beside him perrin cursed and rolled cooling himself with a gust of wind imagining his hammer up into his hand heartseeker dropped to the ground in a wave of energy power rippling around her who are you she demanded where are you i she focused suddenly on perrin seeing him completely for the first time the blackness having faded from his clothing you she screeched you are to blame for this she raised her hands her eyes almost seemed to glow with hatred perrin could smell the emotion in spite of the blowing wind she released a whitehot bar of light but perrin bent it around himself the woman started they always did that didnt they realize that nothing was real here except what you thought to be real perrin vanished appearing behind her raising his hammer then he hesitated a woman she spun about screaming and ripping the earth beneath him he jumped up into the sky and the air around him tried to seize himbut he did what hed done before creating a wall of nothingness there was no air to grab him holding his breath he vanished and appeared back on the ground summoning banks of earth in front of him to block the balls of fire that hurtled his way i want you dead the woman screamed you should be dead my plans were perfect perrin vanished leaving behind a statue of himself he appeared beside the tent where gaul watched carefully spear raised perrin put a wall between them and the woman coloring it to hide them and made a barrier to block the sound she cant hear us now perrin said you are strong here gaul said thoughtfully very strong do the wise ones know of this im still a pup compared to them perrin said perhaps gaul said i have not seen them and they do not speak of this place to men he shook his head much honor perrin aybara you have much honor i should have just struck her down perrin said as heartseeker destroyed the statue of him then stepped up to it looking confused she turned about searching frantically yes gaul agreed a warrior who will not strike a maiden is a warrior who refuses her honor of course the greater honor for you would be to take her captive could he do it perrin took a breath then sent himself behind her imagining vines reaching around her to hold her in place the woman howled curses at him slicing the vines with unseen blades she reached her hand toward perrin and he shifted to the side his feet crunched on bits of frost on the ground that he hadnt noticed and she immediately spun on him and released another weave of balefire clever perrin thought barely managing to bend the light away it struck the hillside behind drilling a hole straight through it heartseeker continued the weave snarling hideous face distorted the weave bent back toward perrin and he gritted his teeth keeping it at bay she was strong she pushed hard but finally she released it panting how how can you possibly perrin filled her mouth with forkroot it was difficult to do changing anything directly about a person was always harder however this was much easier than trying to transform her into an animal or the like she raised a hand to her mouth eyes adopting a look of panic she began to spit and hack then desperately opened a gateway beside her perrin growled imagining ropes reaching for her but she destroyed them with a weave of fireshe must have gotten the forkroot out she hurled herself through the gateway and he shifted himself to be right in front of it preparing to leap through he froze when he saw her entering the middle of an enormous army of trollocs and fades at night many faced the gateway eager perrin stepped back as heartseeker raised a hand to her mouth looking aghast and coughing out more forkroot the gateway closed you should have killed her lanfear said perrin turned to find the woman standing nearby her arms folded her hair had changed from silver to dark brown in fact her face had changed too becoming slightly more like it had been before when hed first seen her nearly two years ago perrin said nothing returning his hammer to its straps this is a weakness perrin lanfear said i found it charming in lews therin at one point but that doesnt make it any less a weakness you need to overcome it i will he snapped what was she doing up there with the balls of light invading dreams lanfear said she was here in the flesh that affords one certain advantages particularly when playing with dreams that hussy she thinks she knows this place but it has always been mine it would have been best if youd killed her that was graendal wasnt it perrin asked or was it moghedien graendal lanfear said though again we are not to use that name for her shes been renamed hessalam hessalam perrin said trying the word out in his mouth i dont know it it means without forgiveness and what is your new name the one were supposed to call you now that actually pulled a blush out of her never mind she said you are skilled here in telaranrhiod much better than lews therin ever was i always thought i would rule at his side that only a man who could channel would be worthy of me but the power you display here i think i may accept it as a substitute perrin grunted gaul had moved across the small clearing between the camp tents spear raised shoufa covering his face perrin waved him off not only was lanfear likely to be much better with the wolf dream than gaul but she hadnt done anything specifically threatening yet if youve been watching me perrin said youll know that im married quite happily so i have seen then stop looking at me like a flank of beef hung up for display in the market perrin growled what was graendal doing here what does she want im not certain lanfear said lightly she always has three or four plots going at the same time dont underestimate her perrin shes not as skilled here as some others but she is dangerous shes a fighter unlike moghedien who will run from you whenever she can ill keep that in mind perrin said walking up to the place where shed vanished by gateway he prodded at the earth where the gateway had cut the ground you could do that you know lanfear said he spun on her what go back and forth into the waking world she said without requiring the help of one like lews therin perrin didnt like the way she sneered when she said his name she tried to cover it up but he smelled hatred on her whenever she mentioned him i cant channel perrin said i suppose i could imagine being able to it wouldnt work she said there are limits to what one can accomplish here regardless of how strong the mind the ability to channel is not a thing of the body but a thing of the soul there are still ways for one such as you to move back and forth between worlds in the flesh the one you call slayer does it hes not a wolfbrother no she said but he is something similar im honestly not certain another has had his skills before the dark one did something to this slayer when capturing his soul or his souls i suspect semirhage might have been able to tell us more its a pity shes dead lanfear didnt smell of pity at all she glanced at the sky but was calm not worried you dont seem as worried about being spotted as you once were perrin noted my former master is occupied this last week watching you ive rarely felt his eyes on me week perrin asked shocked but time passes oddly here she said and the barriers of time itself are fraying the closer you are to the bore the more time will distort for those who approach shayol ghul in the real world it will be just as bad for every day that passes to them three or four might pass to those more distant a week light how much had happened on the outside who lived and who had died while perrin hunted he should wait at the traveling ground for his portal to open but judging by the darkness hed seen through graendals gateway it was night perrins escape portal could be hours away you could make a gateway for me perrin said a pathway out then back in will you lanfear considered it strolling past one of the flickering tents and letting her fingers trail on the canvas as it vanished no she finally said but you must learn to do this thing for yourself if we are to be together were not going to be together he said flatly you need this power of and for yourself she said ignoring what he had said you are weak so long as you are trapped only in one of the worlds being able to come here when you want will give you great power i dont care about power lanfear he said watching her as she continued to stroll she was pretty not as pretty as faile of course beautiful nonetheless dont you she faced him have you never thought of what you could do with more strength more power more authority that wont tempt me to save lives she said prevent children from starving stop the weak from being bullied end wickedness reward honor power to encourage men to be straightforward and honest with one another he shook his head you could do so much good perrin aybara she said walking up to him then touching the side of his face running her fingers down his beard tell me how to do what slayer does perrin said pushing her hand away how does he move between worlds i cannot explain it to you she said turning away as it is a skill i have never had to learn i use other methods perhaps you can beat it out of him i would be quick assuming you wish to stop graendal stop her perrin said didnt you realize lanfear turned back to him the dream she was invading was not one of the people from this campspace and distance matter not to dreams that dream you saw her invading it belongs to davram bashere father of your wife with that lanfear vanished chapter at the edge of time gawyn tugged urgently on egwenes shoulder why wouldnt she move whoever that man was in the armor made of silver discs he could sense female channelers he d picked leane out of the darkness he could do the same for egwene light he probably would as soon as he took a moment to notice im going to haul her up onto my shoulder if she doesnt move he thought light help me ill do it no matter how much noise it makes were going to be caught anyway if we the one who called himself bao moved off towing leanestill wrapped in airwith him the others followed in a mass leaving the awful charred remnants of the other captives behind egwene gawyn whispered she looked at him a cold strength in her eyes and nodded light how could she be so calm when he had to clench his teeth for fear they would start rattling together they wriggled out from under the cart backward moving on their stomachs until they emerged egwene glanced in the direction of the sharans her cold sense of control radiated into his mind from the bond hearing that mans name had done that to her given her a sudden spike of shock followed by grim determination what was that name barid something gawyn thought hed heard it before he wanted egwene out of this death trap he put the warder cloak around her shoulders the best way out is directly east he whispered around the mess tentwhats left of itthen on to the camp perimeter they have a guard post set up next to what was our traveling ground well go around that to the north side she nodded ill scout ahead you follow gawyn said if i see anything ill toss a stone back toward you listen for it hitting all right count to twenty then follow me at a slow pace but you cant go first lest we run across some of those channelers i need to take the lead at least wear the cloak she hissed ill be fine he whispered then slipped away before she could argue further he did feel her spike of annoyance and suspected hed get an earful once they were out of this well if they lived long enough for that to happen hed accept the reprimand happily once he was a short distance from her he slipped on one of the rings of the bloodknives he had activated it with his blood as leilwin had said was needed shed also said it might kill him youre a fool gawyn trakand he thought as a tingling sensation ran across his body though hed used the terangreal only once before he knew that his figure had been blurred and darkened if people glanced in his direction their eyes would slide away from him it worked particularly well in shadows for once he was pleased that those clouds blocked out any moonlight or starlight he moved on stepping carefully earlier in the night when hed first tested the ring as egwene slept hed been able to pass within a few steps of sentries holding lanterns one had looked right at gawyn but hadnt seen him in this much darkness he might as well have been invisible the terangreal allowed him to move more quickly as well the change was slight but noticeable he itched to try out the ability in a duel how many of these sharans could he take on his own while wearing one of these rings a dozen two that would last right up until one of those channelers cooked you gawyn told himself he collected a few pebbles off the ground to toss back toward egwene if he spotted one of the female channelers he looped around the mess tent following the path hed scouted earlier it was important to keep reminding himself to be careful earlier the terangreals power had made him too bold it was a heady thing knowing how easily he could move he had told himself he wouldnt use the rings but that had been during battlewhen hed been tempted to try to make a name for himself this was different this was protecting egwene he could allow an exception for this the moment she hit the count of twenty egwene moved into the darkness she wasnt as good at sneaking as nynaeve and perrin were but she was from the two rivers every child in emonds field learned how to move in the woods without startling game she turned her attention to the path before her testing with her toes shed removed her shoesto avoid dried leaves or weeds moving this way was second nature to her that left her mind free unfortunately one of the forsaken led the sharans she could only guess from his words that their entire nation followed him this was as bad as the seanchan worse the seanchan captured and used aes sedai but they didnt slaughter the common people with such recklessness egwene had to survive to escape she needed to bring this information to the white tower the aes sedai would have to face demandred light send that enough of their number had escaped the battle earlier to do so why had demandred sent for rand everyone knew where to find the dragon reborn egwene reached the mess tent then crept around it guards chatted in the near distance that sharan accent was oddly monotone as if the people had no emotions at all it was as if the music was gone from their speech music that egwene hadnt realized was normally there the ones speaking were men so she probably didnt need to worry that they would sense her ability to channel still demandred had done it with leane perhaps he had a terangreal for the purpose such things existed she gave the men a wide berth anyway and continued on into the darkness of what had once been her camp she moved past fallen tents the scent of smoldering fires still lingering in the air and crossed a path that she had taken most evenings while collecting troop reports it was disturbing how quickly one could go from being in a position of power to slinking through camp like a rat being suddenly unable to channel changed so many things my authority is not drawn from my power to channel she told herself my strength is in control understanding and care i will escape this camp and i will continue the fight she repeated those words fighting off a creeping sense of powerlessness the feeling of despair at so many dead the tingling between her shoulder blades as if someone were watching her in the darkness light poor leane something hit the bare earth near her it was followed by two more pebbles dropping to the ground gawyn apparently didnt trust in just one she moved quickly to the remnants of a nearby tent halfburned the other half of the canvas hanging from the poles she crouched down at that moment she realized a halfburned body was lying on the ground mere inches from her he was shienaran she saw in a flash of lightning from the rumbling clouds above though he wore the symbol of the white tower on his shirt he lay with one eye up toward the sky silent the other side of his head burned down to the skull a light appeared from the direction shed been heading she waited tense as two sharan guards approached bearing a lantern they didnt speak as they turned to walk southward along their route she could see that their armor had symbols etched across the back that mimicked the tattoos shed seen on men earlier these marks were quite extravagant and soby her best guessthe men were actually of low rank the system disturbed her you could always add to a persons tattoo but she knew of no way to remove one having the tattoos grow more intricate the lower one was in society implied something people could fall from grace but they could not rise once fallenor bornto a lowly position she sensed the channeler behind her mere moments before a shield slammed between egwene and the source egwene reacted immediately she didnt give terror time to gain purchase she grabbed her belt knife and spun toward the woman she could sense approaching from behind egwene lunged but a weave of air snatched her arm and held it tightly another one filled her mouth gagging her egwene thrashed but other weaves grabbed her and hauled her into the air the knife dropped from her twitching fingers a globe of light appeared nearby a soft blue aura much dimmer than that of a lantern it had been created by a woman with dark skin and very refined features delicate a small nose a slender frame she stood up from her crouch and egwene found her to be quite tall nearly as tall as a man you are a dangerous little rabbit the woman said her thick toneless accent making her difficult to understand she emphasized words in the wrong places and pronounced many sounds in a justoff way she had the tattoos on her face like delicate branches reaching from the back of her neck forward onto her cheeks she also wore one of those dresses shaped like a cows bell black with strands of white tied a handspan below the neck the woman touched her arm where egwenes knife had nearly taken her yes the woman said very dangerous few of the ayyad would reach for a dagger so quickly rather than for the source you have been trained well egwene struggled in her bonds it was no use they were tight her heart began racing but she was better than that panic would not save her she forced herself to be calm no she thought no panic wont save me but it may alert gawyn she could sense that he was worried out there somewhere in the darkness with effort she allowed her terror to rise she let go of all of her careful aes sedai training it was not nearly as easy as she had expected you move quietly little rabbit the sharan woman said inspecting egwene i would never have been able to follow you if i hadnt already known you were moving in this direction she walked around egwene looking curious you watched the wylds little show all the way through did you brave or stupid egwene shut her eyes and focused on her terror her sheer panic she had to bring gawyn to her she reached within and opened the tight little nugget of emotion shed packed there her fear at being captured again by the seanchan she could feel it the adam on her neck the name tuli a name for a pet egwene had been younger then but no more powerless than she was now it would happen again she would be nothing she would have her very self stripped away she would rather be dead oh light why couldnt she have died shed sworn shed never be captured like this again she began to breathe quickly now unable to control her terror now now the sharan said she seemed amused though her tone was so flat egwene couldnt completely tell it wont be that bad now will it i have to decide which will gain me more turning you over to him or keeping you for myself hmm strong channeling came suddenly from the far side of the camp where demandred had gone the sharan glanced that way but didnt seem alarmed egwene could feel gawyn approaching he was very worried her message had served its purpose but he wasnt coming quickly enough and he was farther away than shed expected what was wrong now that shed let her worry out of its hidden place it overwhelmed her beating against her a series of blows your man the sharan said you have one of them what are they called again odd that you should rely on the protection of a man but you never reach your potential in this land i am told he will be taken ive sent for him as egwene had feared light shed led gawyn to this shed led the army to disaster egwene squeezed her eyes shut shed led the white tower to its destruction her parents would be slaughtered the two rivers would burn she should have been stronger she should have been smarter no she had not been broken by the seanchan she would not be broken by this egwene opened her eyes and met the gaze of the sharan in the soft blue light egwene wrestled her emotions to stillness and felt the aes sedai calm envelop her you are an odd one the sharan whispered still held by egwenes eyes so transfixed was she that the woman didnt notice when the shadow moved up behind her a shadow that could not have been gawyn for he was still distant something smashed into the womans head from behind she crumpled slumping to the ground the globe winked out instantly and egwene was free she dropped to a crouch fingers finding her knife a figure moved up to her egwene raised her knife and prepared herself to embrace the source she would draw attention if she had to she would not be taken again but who was this hush the figure said egwene recognized the voice leilwin others noticed this woman channeling leilwin said they will come to see what she was doing we must move you saved me egwene whispered you rescued me i take my oaths seriously leilwin said then so softly that egwene could barely hear it she added maybe too seriously such horrible omens this night they moved quickly through the camp for a few moments until egwene sensed gawyn approaching she couldnt make him out in the darkness finally she whispered softly gawyn suddenly he was there right next to her egwene who did you find leilwin stiffened then hissed softly through her teeth something seemed to have upset her greatly perhaps she was angry at having someone sneak up on her if that was the case egwene shared the emotion shed been taking pride in her abilities and then shed been blindsided not only by a channeler but now by gawyn why should a boy raised in the city be able to move so well without her spotting him i didnt find anyone egwene whispered leilwin found me and she pulled me out of a fire leilwin gawyn said peering through the darkness egwene could feel his surprise and his suspicion we must keep moving leilwin said i will not argue with that gawyn replied were almost out well want to go a little to the north though i left some bodies just to the right bodies leilwin asked half a dozen or so sharans jumped me gawyn said half a dozen egwene thought he made it sound as if it were nothing this was not the place for discussion she joined the other two heading out of the camp leilwin leading them in a specific direction each noise or shout from the camp made egwene wince worried that one of the bodies had been found in fact she nearly jumped all the way to the storm clouds above when someone spoke from the darkness do that be you it is us bayle leilwin said softly my aged grandmother bayle domon exclaimed softly joining them you found her woman you do amaze me again he hesitated i do wish youd have let me come with you my husband leilwin whispered you are as brave and stout a man as any woman could wish on her crew but you move with all of the stillness of a bear charging through a river he grunted but joined them as they left the edge of the camp quietly and carefully about ten minutes away egwene finally trusted herself to embrace the source glorying in it she made a gateway for them and skimmed to the white tower aviendha ran with the rest of the aiel through gateways they surged like floodwaters into the valley of thakandar two waves rushing down from opposite sides of the valley aviendha did not carry a spear that was not her place instead she was a spear she was joined by two men in black coats five wise ones the woman alivia and ten of rands sworn aes sedai with warders none of them save alivia had responded well to having aviendha placed above them the ashaman did not like having to answer to any woman the wise ones didnt like being ordered by rand at all and the aes sedai still thought of aiel channelers as inferior they all obeyed the order anyway rand had whispered to her in a quiet moment to watch them all for darkfriends fear did not make him speak those words but his sense of realism shadows could creep anywhere there were trollocs here in the valley and some myrddraal but they had not anticipated this attack the aiel took advantage of their disarray and commenced a slaughter aviendha led her group of channelers toward the forge that massive grayroofed building the shadowforgers turned from their inexorable movement showing just a hint of confusion aviendha wove fire at one removing its head from its shoulders the body turned to stone then started to crumble that seemed a signal to the other channelers and shadowforgers through the valley began to explode they were said to be terrible warriors when provoked with skin that turned aside swords that might just be rumor as few aiel had ever actually danced the spears with a shadowforger aviendha didnt particularly want to discover the truth she let her team end the first group of shadowforgers and tried not to think too hard about the death and destruction these things had caused during their unnatural lives the shadowspawn tried to mount a defense some of the myrddraal screaming and whipping at their trollocs to charge and break the aiel attack that came at them across a broad front it would have been easier to stop a river with a handful of twigs the aiel didnt slow and those shadowspawn who tried to resist were slain in their tracks often falling to multiple spears or arrows most of the trollocs broke and ran fleeing before the thunder of aiel yells aviendha and her channelers reached the forges and the nearby pens of dirty lifelesseyed captives who had been awaiting death quickly aviendha said to the warders who accompanied her the men broke open pens as aviendha and the others attacked the last of the shadowforgers as they diedfalling to stone and dustthey dropped halffinished thakandar blades to the rocks aviendha looked upward to the right a long serpentine path led up toward the cavern maw in the side of the mountain that loomed above the hole there was dark it seemed a trap that tempted light to enter then never released it aviendha wove fire and spirit then released the weave into the air a moment later a gateway opened at the head of the path up to shayol ghul four figures stepped through a woman in blue small of stature but not of will an aging man whitehaired and shrouded in a multihued cloak a woman in yellow her dark hair cut short adorned with an assortment of gemstones set in gold and a tall man hair the color of living coals fie wore his coat of red and gold but under it a simple two rivers shirt what he had become and what he had been wrapped together in one he carried two swords like a shienaran one looked as if it were glass he wore it upon his back the other was the sword of the treekiller king laman tied at his waist he carried that because of her fool man aviendha raised her hand to him and he raised his in return that would be their only farewell if he failed in his task or she died during hers with a last look she turned away from him and toward her duty two of her aes sedai had linked and created a gateway so that the warders could usher the captives to safety many needed to be prodded into motion they stumbled forward eyes nearly as dead as those of the shadowforgers check inside the forge too aviendha said motioning to a few of the warders they charged in aes sedai following weaves of the one power shook the building as they found more shadowforgers and the two ashaman quickly went in as well aviendha scanned the valley the battle had become uglier there were more shadowspawn at the corridor leading out of the valley these had been given more time to prepare and form up ituralde led his forces in behind the aiel securing the sections of the valley already taken patience aviendha thought to herself her job would not be to join that battle ahead but to guard rands back as he ascended and entered the pit of doom she worried about one thing couldnt the forsaken just travel directly into the cavern itself rand didnt seem worried about that but he was also very distracted by what he had to do perhaps she should join him and she frowned looking up what was that shadow high above the sun shone in a turbulent sky some storm clouds in patches some deep black others brilliant white it wasnt a cloud that had suddenly obscured the sun however but something solid and black sliding into place aviendha felt a chill and found herself trembling as the light slipped away darkness true darkness fell soldiers across the field looked up in awe and even fear the light went out the end of the world had come channeling came suddenly from the other end of the wide valley aviendha spun shaking off her awe the ground nearby was littered with torn garments dropped weapons and corpses all of the fighting was at the mouth of the valley distant from her where the aiel were trying to push the shadowspawn back into the pass though aviendha couldnt see much through the darkness she could tell soldiers were staring at the sky even the trollocs looked awestruck but then the solid blackness began to move in the sky revealing first the edge of the sun and then the sun itself light the end was not upon them the battle at the mouth of the valley resumed but it was obviously difficult making the trollocs retreat through such narrow confines was like trying to shove a horse through a small crack in a wall impossible unless you started doing some carving there aviendha said pointing toward the side of the valley behind the aiel lines i sense channeling by a woman light but shes powerful nesune breathed circle aviendha yelled now the others linked feeding aviendha control of the circle power filled her unimaginable power it was as if she drew in a breath but just kept being able to take in more air filling expanding crackling with energy she was a thunderstorm a vast sea of the one power she thrust her hands forward letting loose a raw weave only halfformed this was almost too much power for her to shape air and fire spurted from her hands a column of it as wide as a man with arms outstretched the fire flared as a thick hot nearliquid not balefireshe was smarter than that but dangerous nonetheless the air contained the fire in a concentrated mass of destruction the column streaked across the battlefield melting the stone beneath and starting corpses aflame a huge swath of fog vanished with a hiss and the ground shook as the column plowed into the side of the valley wall where the enemy channeleraviendha could only assume it was one of the forsaken from her strengthhad been attacking the back ranks of aiel aviendha released the weave her skin slick with sweat a smoldering black column of smoke rose from the valley wall molten rock trickled down the slope she grew still waiting alert the one power inside of her actually started to strain as if trying to escape her was that because some of the energy she used came from men never before had the one power seemed to want to destroy her she had only a brief warning a frantic moment of channeling from the other side of the valley followed by an enormous rush of wind aviendha sliced that wind down the center with an invisible weave the size of a great forest tree she followed it with another blast of fire this time more controlled no she didnt dare use balefire rand had warned her that could widen the bore break the framework of reality in a place where that membrane was already thin her enemy didnt have the same restriction the womans next attack came as a whitehot bar narrowly missing aviendhadrilling through the air a fingers width from her headbefore hitting the wall of the forge behind the balefire sliced a wide swath of stone and brick from the wall and the building collapsed with a crash good riddance aviendha thought throwing herself to the ground spread out she ordered the others dont give her good targets she channeled stirring up air to create a tempest of dust and debris in front of them then she used a weave to mask the fact that she was holding to the one power and hide her from her enemy she scuttled in a low crouch behind some nearby cover a heap of slag and broken bits of iron waiting to be smelted balefire struck again hitting the stony ground where shed been before it punctured stone as easily as a spear went through a melon aviendhas companions had all taken cover and they continued to feed her their strength such power it was distracting she judged the source of the attacks be ready to follow she said to the others then made a gateway to the point where the weave had begun come through after me but take cover immediately she leaped through skirts swishing the one power held like thunder somehow contained she landed on a slope overlooking the battlefield below maidens and men fought trollocs it looked as if the aiel were holding back a vast black flood aviendha didnt spare time for more than a quick glance she dug into the ground with a primal weave of earth and ripped up a horsesized chunk of rock popping it into the air the beam that came for her a second later struck the chunk of rock balefire was a dangerous spear to wield sometimes it cut but if it hit a distinct objecta person for exampleit caused the entire thing to flash and vanish the balefire burned aviendhas chunk from existence in a flash dropping motes of glowing dust that soon vanished behind her the men and women in her circle dashed through her gateway and took cover aviendha barely had time to notice that nearby cracks had appeared in the rock cracks that seemed to look down into darkness as the bar of light faded in aviendhas vision she released a burning column of fire this time she met flesh burning away a copperyskinned slender woman in a red dress two other women nearby cursed scrambling away aviendha launched a second attack at the others one of the twothe strongestmade a weave with such skill and speed that aviendha barely caught sight of it the weave went up in front of her column of fire and the result was an explosion of blistering steam aviendhas fire was extinguished and she gasped temporarily blinded battle instincts took over obscured by the cloud of steam she dropped to her knees then rolled to the side while grabbing a handful of rocks and tossing them away from her to create a distraction it worked as she blinked tears from her eyes a whitehot bar struck toward the sound of the rocks those dark cracks spread further aviendha blew the steam away with a weave of air while still blinking tears she could see well enough to distinguish two black shapes crouching nearby on the rocks one turned toward her gaspedseeing the attack weaves that aviendha was makingthen vanished there was no gateway the person just seemed to fold up on herself and aviendha sensed no channeling she did feel something else a faint something a tremble to the air that wasnt entirely physical no the second woman said just a blur to aviendhas tearstreaked eyes dont aviendhas vision cleared just enough to make out the womans featuresa long face and dark hairas her weave struck the woman the womans limbs ripped from her body a smoldering arm spun in the air creating a swirl of black smoke before hitting nearby aviendha coughed then released the circle healing she said struggling to her feet bera harkin reached her first and a healing weave set aviendha trembling she panted and her reddened skinher singed eyeswere repaired she nodded in thanks to bera whom she could now see clearly ahead of her sarene an aes sedai with a teardrop face and numerous dark braidsstepped up to the corpses aviendha had made her warder vitalien close by her side she shook her head duhara and falion dreadlords now theres a difference between dreadlords and black ajah amys asked of course sarene said with a calm tone nearby the others still held the one power expecting another attack aviendha didnt think there would be one she had heard that gasp of surprise sensed the panic in the way the final womanthe strongest of the three had fled perhaps she hadnt anticipated facing such powerful resistance so quickly sarene kicked at an arm that had been falions better to have taken them alive for questioning i am certain we could have learned the identity of that third woman did anyone recognize her members of the group shook their heads she was not anyone on the list of black ajah who escaped sarene said taking the arm of her warder she has a distinctive face so bulbous and lacking any qualities of charm i am certain i would remember her she was powerful aviendha said very powerful aviendha would have guessed her as one of the forsaken but that certainly hadnt been moghedien and it didnt match the description of graendal well split into three circles aviendha said bera will lead one of them amys and i the others yes we can make circles larger than thirteen now but it seems a waste i dont need that much power to kill one of our groups will attack the trollocs below the other two will avoid channeling and hide nearby watching that way we can goad the enemy channeler into assuming were still in one large circle and the other two can strike at her from the sides when she comes to attack amys smiled she recognized this as a basic maiden raiding tactic she didnt seem particularly put out to be following aviendhas orders now that annoyance at rands presumption had faded in fact if anything she and the other four wise ones looked proud as aviendhas team obeyed she sensed more channeling on the battlefield cadsuane and those who followed her liked to consider themselves outside rands orders they fought while another group of aes sedai and ashaman held open gateways to usher through the domani and tairen armies too many people channeling all about it was going to grow difficult to pinpoint an attack by one of the forsaken we need to set up traveling grounds aviendha said and keep strict control over who is going to channel and where that way well be able to tell in an instant when we sense channeling if something is wrong she raised her hand to her head this is going to be very difficult to organize nearby amys smile widened you are in command now aviendha that smile seemed to say and leaderships headaches are yours to endure rand althor the dragon reborn turned away from aviendha and left her and ituralde to their battle he had a different one to join at last the time had come he approached the base of the mountain of shayol ghul above a black hole burrowed into the mountain face the only way to reach the pit of doom moiraine joined him pulling close her rippling shawl its blue fringe catching in the wind remember this is not the bore this is not the dark ones prison this is merely the place where his touch is strongest upon the world he has control here he touches the entire world now to one extent or another rand said and so his touch here will be stronger rand nodded setting his hand upon the dagger he wore at his belt no channeling until we strike at the dark one directly if possible i would avoid a fight like the one we had at the cleansing what comes will require all of my strength nynaeve nodded she wore her angreal and terangreal jewelry over a gown of yellow one far more beautiful than she would ever have allowed herself during their days in the two rivers she looked strange to him without her braid her hair now barely to her shoulders she seemed somehow older that shouldnt be the braid was a symbol of age and maturity in the two rivers why should nynaeve look older without it thom stepped up beside rand squinting up at the hole in the rock i suspect im not going in with you moiraine looked at him pursing her lips someone will need to guard the entry into the cave my wife thom said that ledge up there right beside the opening has an excellent view of the battlefield i can watch the battle below maybe compose a good ballad or two rand smiled at the spark of humor in thoms eyes they stood at the edge of time itself and still thom merrilin found a smile above them dark clouds spun the peak of shayol ghul their axis darkness assaulted the sun until it was nearly gone entirely covered in total oblivion rands forces stopped staring in terror at the sky and even the trollocs paused growling and hooting but as the sun slowly emerged from its captivity the fierce battle resumed in the valley below it announced his intentions but the dagger would shield him from the dark ones eyes the light willing the shadows leaders would focus on the battle and assume rand would wait for its outcome before striking now nynaeve asked looking up the narrow stony pathway to the cavern rand nodded and led the way forward a wind rose whipping at the four as they climbed the pathway he had chosen his clothing deliberately his red coat embroidered with longthorned briars on the sleeves and golden herons on the collar was a twin to one of those moiraine had arranged for him to receive in fal dara the white shirt laced across the front was of two rivers make callandor on his back the sword of laman at his hip it had been a long time since hed chosen to wear that but it felt appropriate the winds buffeted him threatening to throw him from the heights he pushed forward anyway climbing the steep hill gritting his teeth against the pain in his side time seemed to have less meaning here and he felt as if hed been walking for days when he reached the flat area before the cavern he turned resting one hand against the rock of the open maw and looked out over the valley his forces in the valley seemed so fragile so insignificant would they be able to hold it long enough rand nynaeve said taking his arm perhaps you should rest he looked down following her eyes to his side his wound the old wound had broken open again he felt blood inside his boot it had run down his side down his leg and when he moved his foot he left a bloody footprint behind blood on the rocks nynaeve raised a hand to her mouth it has to happen nynaeve rand said you cannot stop it the prophecy does not say anything about me living through this ive always found that odd havent you why would it speak of the blood but not what comes after he shook his head then unsheathed callandor from his back moiraine nynaeve will you lend me your strength and join me in a circle do you wish one of us to lead moiraine said hesitantly so you can use that safely im not planning to be safe rand said a circle please the two women exchanged a look so long as he led the circle another could strike and seize control of him neither liked the request obviously he wasnt certain if he should be pleased that the two of them had started to get alongperhaps instead he should worry about them teaming up against him that seemed like a thought from simpler days easier days he smiled wryly but knew that the smile did not reach his eyes moiraine and nynaeve fed him their strength and he accepted it thom kissed moiraine and then the three of them turned to regard the opening before them it led back down toward the base of the mountain and the fiery pit that was the closest thing this world knew to the dark ones dwelling shadows from a returned sun dimmed the cavern mouth around him wind tugged at him his foot warm with his own blood i will not walk out of this pit alive he thought he no longer cared survival was not his goal it had not been for some time he did want to do this right he had to do this right was it the right time had he planned well enough it is time let the task be undertaken the voice spoke with the inevitability of an earthquake the words vibrating through him more than sound in the air far more the words spoke as if from one soul to another moiraine gasped eyes opening wide rand was not surprised he had heard this voice once before and he realized that he had been expecting it hoping for it at least thank you rand whispered then stepped forward into the dark ones realm leaving footprints of blood behind chapter to ignore the omens fortuona empress of the seanchan empire studied her husband as he gave orders to their forces they were arrayed outside the palace in ebou dar and she herself sat upon an elaborate mobile throne outfitted with poles at the bottom so she could be carried by a dozen soldiers the throne lent her grandeur but also gave an illusion of immobility an assassin would assume that she could not move quickly while wearing her formal silks her gown draping down in front and tumbling toward the ground they would be surprised then that she could break free of the outer garments at the flick of a wrist he has changed greatest one beslan said to her and yet he hasnt i dont know what to make of him any longer he is what the wheel has sent us fortuona replied have you considered what you will do beslan kept eyes forward he was impetuous often governed by his emotions but no more so than the other altarans they were a passionate people and were making a fine addition to the empire now that they were properly tamed i will do as has been suggested beslan said face flushed wise fortuona said may the throne stand forever beslan said and may your breath continue as long greatest one he bowed withdrawing to do as he should fortuona could march to war but these were beslans lands to govern he so wanted to be part of the battle but now he understood that he was needed here selucia watched him go nodding in approval that one is becoming a strong asset as he learns proper restraint she signed fortuona said nothing selucias motions carried an implication one that fortuona would have missed save for their long association beslan was learning other men however mat started cursing up a storm nearby gathered with the seanchan commanders she could not hear exactly what had set him off what had she done in yoking herself to him i have followed the omens she thought she caught him glancing toward her before he returned to his raving he would have to be taught restraint but teaching him it would be difficult far more difficult than teaching beslan had been at least selucia did not speak her condemnations out loud the woman was now fortuonas truthspeaker though fortuna could sense that selucia was finding the position grating she would prefer to remain only fortuonas voice perhaps the omens would show fortuona someone else fitting as a truthspeaker are we really going to do as he says selucia signed this world is chaos fortuona signed back not a straight answer she did not want to give straight answers at the moment selucia would puzzle out the meaning the seanchan commonly said may she live forever in regard to the empress to some it was a platitude or a mere ritual of allegiance fortuona had always seen much more to it that phrase encapsulated the strength of the empire an empress had to be crafty strong and skilled if she was to survive only the fittest deserved to sit on the crystal throne if one of her siblings or a member of the high blood like galgan managed to kill her then her death served the empirefor she had obviously been too weak to lead it may she live forever may she be strong enough to live forever may she be strong enough to lead us to victory she would bring order to this world that was her goal matrim stalked past on the armys gathering grounds passing ten paces before fortuonas throne he wore an imperial high generals uniform although not well he kept snagging the paltroncloths on things a high generals regalia was meant to give the bearer authority to enhance his grace as cloth rippled in response to his careful movements on matrim it was like wrapping a racehorse in silk and expecting him to run he had a kind of grace but it was not the grace of court lesser commanders trailed after him matrim baffled the blood that was good as it kept them off balance but he also represented disorder with his random ways and constant stabs at authority fortuona represented order and she had married chaos himself what had she been thinking but what of the sea folk highness general yulan said stopping beside matrim in front of fortuona stop worrying about the bloody sea folk matrim snapped if you say the words sea folk one more time ill hang you by your toenails from one of those raken you fly about on and send you off to shara yulan seemed perplexed highness i he trailed off as mat yelled savara were leading with pikes not cavalry you goatloving idiot i dont care if the cavalry thinks it can do a better job cavalry always thinks that what are you a bloody tairen high lady well ill name you an honorary one if you keep this up matrim stormed off toward savara who sat her horse with arms folded displeasure on her dark face yulan left behind looked completely bewildered how does one hang a person by their toenails yulan asked softly enough that fortuona barely heard i do not think that is possible the nails would break off he walked away shaking his head to the side selucia signed beware galgan approaches fortuona steeled herself as captaingeneral galgan rode up he wore black armor rather than a uniform like mats and he wore it well commanding almost towering he was her greatest rival and her strongest resource any man in his position would be a rival of course that was the way of thingsthe proper way of things matrim would never be a rival she still did not know how to think of that a piece of hersmall but not without strengththought she should have him put away for that very reason was not the prince of the ravens a check upon the empress to keep her strong by providing a constant threat sarabat shaiqen nai batain pyast a woman was most resourceful with a knife at her throat a proverb uttered by varuota her greatgreatgreatgrandmother she would hate to put matrim away she couldnt until she had a child by him anywayit would be ignoring the omens to do otherwise such a strange man he was each time she thought she could anticipate him she was proved wrong greatest one galgan said we are nearly ready the prince of the ravens is dissatisfied with the delays she said he fears we are joining the battle too late if the prince of the ravens has any real understanding of armies and battlefields galgan said his tone indicating that he didnt believe such a thing was possible he will realize that moving a force of this size requires no small effort up until matrims arrival galgan had been the highestranking member of the blood in these lands other than fortuona herself he would dislike being superseded suddenly as of yet galgan had command of their armiesand fortuona intended to let him continue to lead earlier today galgan had asked mat how he would gather their forces and mat had taken it as a suggestion to do just that the prince of the ravens strode about giving orders but he did not command not fully galgan could stop him with a word he did not obviously he wished to see how mat handled command galgan watched mat eyes narrowed he did not fully know how the prince of the ravens fit into the command structure fortuona had yet to make a decision on that nearby a burst of wind carried away some dust it revealed the small skull of a rodent peeking from the earth another omen her life had been cluttered with them lately this was an omen of danger of course it was as if she strolled through deep grasses passing between stalking lopar and among holes dug to catch the unwary the dragon reborn had knelt before the crystal throne and the omen of peach blossomsthe most powerful omen she knewhad accompanied him troops marched past officers shouting orders in time to the steps the raken calls seemed timed to the beats of the falling feet this was what she would be leaving for an unknown war in lands she barely knew her lands here would be virtually undefended a foreigner of newly minted loyalty in command great change her decisions could end her rule and indeed the empire itself matrim did not understand that summon my consort fortuona signed tapping the armrest of her throne selucia voiced the order to a messenger after a short time mat rode up on his horse he had refused the gift of a new one with good reason he had a better eye for horseflesh than the imperial stablemaster herself still pips what a silly name fortuona stood up immediately those nearby bowed galgan dismounted and went down on his knees everyone else prostrated themselves to the ground the empress standing to proclaim meant an act of the crystal throne blood and ashes matrim said more bowing have you folks nothing better to do i could think of a few dozen things if you cant to the side she saw galgan smile he thought he knew what she was going to do he was wrong i name you knotai for you are a bringer of destruction to the empires enemies let your new name only be spoken from now into eternity knotai i proclaim that knotai prince of the ravens is to be given the rank of rodholder in our armies let it be published as my will rodholder it meant that should galgan fall mat would have command galgan was no longer smiling he would have to keep watch over his shoulder lest mat overcome him and take control fortuona sat down knotai knotai said she glared at him keep your tongue for once she thought at him please i kind of like it knotai said turning his horse and trotting away galgan regained his saddle he will need to learn to kneel the general muttered then kicked his horse forward it was an eversosmall offense deliberate and calculating galgan had not addressed the words to fortuona directly instead acting as if they were just a comment to himself he sidestepped calling her greatest one it was enough to make selucia growl softly and wiggle her fingers in a question no fortuona signed we need him once again knotai did not seem to realize what she had done and the risk inherent in it galgan would have to consult with him on their battle plans the rodholder could not be left out of meetings as he had to be ready to take control at any moment galgan would have to listen to his advice and incorporate it she bet upon her prince in this hoping that he could manifest again the unexpected genius in battle that had so impressed furyk karede this is bold selucia said but what if he fails we will not fail fortuona replied for this is the last battle the pattern had placed knotai before her had shoved her into his arms the dragon reborn had seen and spoken truth about herfor all the illusion of order her rule was like a heavy rock balanced on its smallest point she was stretched thin reigning over lands unaccustomed to discipline she needed to take great risks to bring order to chaos she hoped that selucia would see it that way and not publicly denounce her fortuona really would need to find a new voice or appoint someone else as truthspeaker having one person fill both roles was drawing criticism in court it knotai suddenly came riding back holding to his hat tuon why is it so hard for him to understand names selucia asked with a wiggle of her fingers fortuona could almost read the sigh in those motions knotai fortuona asked you may approach bloody good knotai said since im already here tuon we need to move now the scouts just came back egwenes army is in trouble yulan rode up just behind knotai then dismounted and bowed himself full to the ground rise fortuona said is this true the army of the marathdamane has suffered a grave defeat yulan said the returning fists of heaven describe it in detail this amyrlins armies are scattered in turmoil and retreating at speed galgan had stopped nearby to receive a messenger no doubt being given a similar report the general looked at her we should move in to support egwenes retreat knotai said i dont know what a rodholder is but from how everyones reacting i think it means i have control of the armies no fortuona said you are third behind me behind galgan then you can order a move right now knotai said we need to go egwene is getting stomped how many marathdamane are there fortuona asked we have been watching this army yulan said there are hundreds the entirety of the white tower that remains they are exhausted being driven forth by a new force one we do not recognize tuon mat warned great change so this was the meaning of the dragons omen fortuona could swoop in and all of those damane would be hers hundreds upon hundreds with that force she could crush the resistance to her rule back in seanchan it was the last battle the world hung upon her decisions was it truly better to support these marathdamane in their desperate fight here or should she use the chance to retreat to seanchan secure her rule there then defeat the trollocs and the shadow with the might of the empire you gave your word knotai said softly i signed a treaty she said any treaty can be broken particularly by the empress some empresses might be able to do that knotai said but not you right light tuon you gave him your word order in one handsomething known something she could measure chaos in the other chaos in the form of a oneeyed man who knew artur hawk wings face had she not just told selucia she would bet upon him the empress cannot be constrained by words on a paper fortuona said however in this case the reason i signed the treaty remains and is real we will protect this world in its darkest days and we will destroy the shadow at its root general galgan you shall move our forces to protect these marathdamane as we will require their aid in fighting the shadow knotai relaxed good yulan galgan lets get planning and send for that woman tylee she seems like the only bloody general around here with her head on her shoulders and he went on talking riding off giving orders that he really should have allowed galgan to give galgan studied her from horseback his face unreadable hed consider this a grave mistake but she she had the omens on her side those dreadful black clouds had been lans companion for far too long he had grown weary indeed of seeing them each day expanding toward infinity in all directions rumbling with thunder like growls from the stomach of a hungry beast the clouds seem lower today andere said from his horse beside mandarb the lightning is touching down it doesnt do that every day lan nodded andere was right it did look bad that didnt change a thing agelmar had chosen the place for their battle alongside the river roaring on their western flank using it to protect that side nearby hills provided archer positions and it was atop one of these that lan and andere waited ahead the trollocs gathered for an assault they would come soon closer by agelmar had placed heavy cavalry in the valleys for flanking attacks once the trollocs charged light cavalry behind the hills to help the heavy cavalry withdraw when the time came agelmar kept grumbling about not having any pikes though it was the lack of foot that had facilitated their successful retreat for all the good it has done lan thought gloomily as he studied the nearendless sea of trollocs his men had picked their battles carefully killing tens of thousands while losing only thousands leaving shienar burned and unable to sustain the trolloc advance none of it seemed to have mattered they were losing this fight yes they had delayed the trollocs but not well enoughand not long enough they would soon be trapped and destroyed with no aid coming from elaynes army which was pressed just as badly the sky darkened lan looked up sharply those clouds were still there but they grew much more ominous the land was cast into deep shadow blast it andere said looking up has the dark one somehow swallowed the sun well have to carry lanterns to fight even though its the middle of the day lan placed his hand to his breastplate beneath the armor nynaeves letter rested next to his heart light may her fight go better than my own earlier today she and rand had entered the pit of doom itself across the battlefield the tired channelers pulling their eyes from the terrifyingly dark sky sent up lights it wasnt much to see by but it would have to do but then the darkness receded and daylight returned clouded as had become usual gather the high guard of malkier lan said that was what his protectors were calling themselves it was an old malkieri term for the kings battlefield guard lan wasnt certain what to make of the fact that prince kaisel who was from kandor considered himself one many of lans malkieri had very little true malkier bloodthey came to him as an honor more than anything else the prince was another matter lan had asked him and his companions if they should be swearing to a foreign king no matter how friendly the only reply hed received was malkier represents the borderlands in this war dai shan lightning flashed nearby the clap of thunder beat against lan like a physical thing mandarb barely stirred the animal was growing accustomed to such strikes the high guard gathered and andere took up lans banner affixing it in the socket on his saddle so that he could carry it but still swing a sword their orders arrived from agelmar lan and his men would be in the very thick of the attack once the trollocs charged the heavy cavalry would hit the flanks to break up their momentum lan and his men would hit the creatures faceon as lan preferred it agelmar knew better than to try to coddle him lan and his troops would hold the center ground before the hills forcing the trollocs to fight in such a way that the archers could lob volley after volley into their back ranks harrying forces would be held mostly in reserve to prevent the enemy sweeping around their right flank the river was on their left a natural deterrent to the trollocs a good plan if any plan could be considered a good one in the face of such overwhelming odds still agelmar was not making mistakes that lan could see he complained of troubled dreams lately but considering the war they fought lan would have been more worried if the man hadnt dreamed of death and battle the trollocs started to move forward lan called as the trumpets sounded in the air accompanied by thunder from above a short distance from the walls of cairhien elayne rode moonshadow along the front lines the army had formed up according to basheres battle plans but she was worried they had done it a fast march upriver along the road to arrive at cairhien in front of the trolloc army elayne had positioned their force on the far northern side of cairhien to face the trolloc army coming in from that direction she had also left some of the dragons and a company of bowmen downriver to deter the trollocs trying to cross the river there they would withdraw quickly northward when it became impossible to prevent the enemy from crossing beat the army ahead then face the one behind it was their only chance the kinswomen were exhausted elayne had required many gateways to move her men their fatigue meant elayne would have no channelers in this fight the women would be hardpressed to make small gateways to mayene to deliver the wounded for healing elaynes army was slightly larger than that of the shadowspawn but her men were exhausted amid the anxiety of a coming battle some slumped in their lines pikes tipping forward those who stood firm had reddened eyes nonetheless they still had aludras dragons that would have to be enough elayne hadnt slept the night before shed spent the time searching for inspiring words seeking something she could say this day that would have meaning what did you say when all was coming to an end she halted moonshadow at the front of the line of andoran soldiers her words would be relayed using weaves to the entire army elayne was surprised to see that some of the aiel were drawing close to listen she wouldnt have thought theyd care about the words of a wetlander queen she opened her mouth to speak and the sun went out elayne froze looking upward with shock the clouds had parted above themthey often did when she was near one way the bond with rand manifestedand so shed been expecting an open sky and light for this battle the sun still shone up there but occluded something solid and dark rolled in front of it all across her army men looked up raising fingers as they were swallowed by darkness light it was hard to keep from trembling she heard cries through the army lamentations worries cries of despair elayne gathered her confidence and kicked her horse forward this is the place she announced enhancing her voice with the one power to project across the field where i promise you we will win this is where i tell you that days will continue that the land will recover this is the time when i promise you that the light will return that hope will survive that we will continue to live she paused behind the army people lined the top of cairhiens city walls children women and the elderly who were armed with kitchen knives and pots to throw down should the trollocs destroy the army and come for the city there had barely been time to contact them a skeleton force of soldiers guarded the city now their distant figures huddled down as darkness ate the sky those walls offered a false safety they meant little when the enemy had dreadlords she needed to defeat the trolloc army quickly not hide and allow them to be reinforced by the larger force to the south i am supposed to reassure you elayne shouted to the men but i cannot i will not tell you that the land will survive that the light will prevail doing so would remove responsibility this is our duty our blood that will be spilled this day we have come here to fight if we do not then the land will die the light will fall to the shadow this is not a day for empty promises our blood our blood is the fire within us today our blood must drive us to defeat the shadow she turned her horse the men had looked away from the darkness above toward her she wove a light high in the sky above her drawing their attention our blood is our passion she shouted too much of what i hear from my armies is about resistance we cannot merely resist we must show them our anger our fury at what they have done we must not resist today we must destroy our blood is our land this place is ours and we claim it for our fathers and mothers for our children our blood is our life we have come to give it across the world other armies are pushed back we will not retreat our task is to spend our blood to die advancing we will not remain still no if we are to have the light again we must make it ours we must reclaim it and cast out the shadow he seeks to make you despair to win this battle before it begins we will not give him that satisfaction we will destroy this army before us then destroy the one behind and from there we bring our bloodour life our fire our passionto the others who fight from there it spreads to victory and the light she honestly didnt know what kind of response to expect from a battlefield speech shed read all of the great ones particularly those given by queens of andor when younger shed imagined the soldiers clapping and shoutingthe response given to a gleeman at a rowdy tavern instead the men raised weapons to her drawn swords pikes lifted then thumped back against the ground the aiel did give some whoops but the andorans looked at her with solemn eyes she had not inspired them to excitement but to determination that seemed the more honest emotion they ignored the darkness in the sky and turned eyes on the goal birgitte walked up beside her horse that was quite good elayne when did you change it elayne blushed thinking of the carefully prepared speech shed memorized last night while repeating it half a dozen times to birgitte it had been a work of beauty with allusions to the sayings of queens through the ages shed forgotten every word of it once that darkness had come this one had spurted out instead come on elayne said looking over her shoulder the trolloc army was arriving opposite hers i need to move into position into position birgitte asked you mean that you need to go back to the command tent im not going there elayne said turning moonshadow blood and bloody ashes you arent i birgitte elayne snapped i am in command and you are my soldier you will obey birgitte recoiled as if slapped bashere has the command tent elayne said im one of the few channelers of any strength this army has and ill be drawn and quartered before i let myself sit out the fight im easily worth a thousand soldiers on this battlefield the babes even if min hadnt had that viewing id still insist on fighting you think the babes of these soldiers arent at risk many of them line the walls of that city if we fail here they will be slaughtered no i will not keep myself out of danger and no i will not sit back and wait if you think its your duty as my warder to stop me then i will bloody sever this bond right here and now and send you to someone else im not going to spend the last battle lounging on a chaise and drinking goats milk birgitte fell silent and elayne could feel her shock through the bond light the woman finally said i wont stop you but will you at least agree to back away for the initial arrow volleys you can do more good helping the lines where theyre weakened she allowed birgitte and her guards to lead the way back to a hillside near aludras dragons talmanes aludra and their crews waited with more anxiety and eagerness than the regular troops they were tired too but theyd also seen little use during the forest battles and the retreat today was their chance to shine basheres battle plan was as complex as any that elayne had been a part of the bulk of the army positioned itself almost a mile north of the city beyond the foregate ruins outside the city walls the armys lines ran east from the alguenya across a hillside that sloped down across an approach road to the jangai gates on the flats all the way to the ruins of the illuminators chapter house ranks of foot soldiersmostly andorans and cairhienin but some ghealdanin and whitecloaks as wellbowed out like a halfmoon across the front of elaynes forces six squadrons of dragons rolled up atop the hill behind the foot the trollocs would not reach the city without defeating this army estean had the bands cavalry on one flank while the mayener winged guards covered the other the rest of the cavalry was held in reserve elayne waited with patience watching the trolloc army prepare her biggest worry was that theyd just sit there waiting for their fellow trollocs to arrive from the south and attack elayne simultaneously fortunately that didnt happenthey had apparently been commanded to take the city and they were planning to do it basheres scout reports indicated that the second army was a little over a days march away and could arrive late on the morrow if they marched hard elayne had until then to defeat this northern force come on elayne thought move the trollocs finally began to surge forward bashere and elayne were counting on them to employ their usual tactic overwhelming numbers and sheer force indeed today the trollocs crashed forward in a large mass their goal would be to overwhelm the defenders shattering their lines her troops stood firm knowing what was coming next the dragons began to bellow each like innumerable hammers falling at exactly the same moment elayne was now a good hundred paces from them and still she had the urge to cover her ears rolling clouds of white smoke began to fill the sky above the dragons as they fired the first few shots fell short but aludra and her men used the shots to adjust range after that the eggs fell among trollocs ripping through their ranks tossing them into the air thousands of body parts fell to the crimsonsplattered ground for the first time elayne was frightened of the weapons light birgitte has been right all along elayne thought imagining what it would be like to charge a fortified position equipped with dragons normally in war at least a man could depend on one thing that his skill would be placed against that of his foe sword against sword trollocs were bad enough what would it be like for men to have to face this kind of power well make sure it doesnt happen she told herself rand had been right to force that peace upon them the dragoners had trained well and their reloading speeds were impressive each set off three volleys before the trollocs hit the front lines elayne hadnt watched the exchange of arrowsshed been too focused on the dragonsbut she did see that some of her lines were struck with blackfletched arrows and men were down and bleeding the trollocs crashed into her front ranks of crossbowmen and pikemen who were already fading back to make way for halberdiers nobody used swords and maces against trollocs at least not while on foot if they could help it lets go elayne said moving moonshadow forward birgitte followed elayne could sense the womans reluctant resignation they moved down off the hill through some reserve units and entered the battle rodel ituralde had almost forgotten what it was like to have adequate resources at his command it had been some time since he had commanded legions of men and full banners of archers for once his men werent halfstarved and healers fletchers and good smiths stood ready to repair his troops and equipment nightly what a wonder it was to be able to ask for somethingno matter how unusualand have it located and brought to him often within the hour he was still going to lose he faced a numberless host of foes dreadlords by the dozen and even some of the forsaken hed brought his force into this deadend valley seizing the jewel of the dark ones landshis very footstool the black mountain and now the sun itself had gone out though the aes sedai said that would pass ituralde puffed on his pipe as he rode his horse along the ridge that edged the valley to the north yes he was going to lose but with these resources hed do it with style he followed along the ridge reaching a point above the pass into thakandar the valley deep in the heart of the blasted lands ran east to west with shayol ghul at the western side and the pass on the east one could reach this vantage only after hours of very hard climbingor one quick step through a gateway handy that it was perfect for surveying his defenses the pass into shayol ghul was like a large slot canyon the top completely inaccessible from the eastern side except by gateway with a gateway he could reach the top and look down into the canyon which was perhaps wide enough to march fifty men down shouldertoshoulder a perfect bottleneck and he could position archers up top here to fire down on those coming through the pass the sun finally burned out from behind the blackness above like a drop of molten steel so the aes sedai had been right still those swirling black thunderheads spun back as if to consume all the sky since shayol ghul lay in the blasted lands the air was chill enough that ituralde wore a woolen winter cloak and his breath was white in front of him fog hung over the valley thinner than it had been when the forges worked he left the canyon mouth and moved back to a group of people that had come with him windfinders and other highranking sea folk stood in long coats that they hadhawkishly of coursetraded for before coming north colorful clothing peeked out beneath it and the many ornaments on their faces seemed a strange contrast to the dull brown coats ituralde was domani hed had more than a share of dealings with the sea folk if they proved half as tenacious in battle as they were in negotiations he was happy indeed to have them with him they had insisted on coming up here to the ridge so they could survey the valley below and the pass into it the woman at their front was the mistress of the ships herself zaida din parede blackwing a short woman she had dark skin and gray strands wove through her short black hair the windfinders send word to you rodel ituralde she said the attack has begun the attack the bringer of gales zaida said looking toward the sky where the dark clouds rumbled and churned the father of storms he would destroy you with the force of his ire your people can handle it right the windfinders already confront him with the power of the bowl of the winds zaida said if it were not so he would have destroyed us all with tempests already she still watched the sky as did many of her companions there were only about a hundred sea folk with him not counting the windfinders most of the rest worked with the supply teams relaying arrows food and other equipment to the four battlefronts they seemed particularly interested in the steamwagons though ituralde couldnt fathom why the devices couldnt match a good team of horses confronting the dark one himself gust for gust zaida said we will sing of this day she looked back to ituralde you must protect the coramoor she said sternly as if scolding him ill do my part ituralde said continuing on his way just do yours this bargain was sealed long ago rodel ituralde she called after him he nodded continuing back along the ridge men stationed at watchposts saluted as he passed well the ones that werent aiel he had a lot of the aiel up here where they could use their bows hed put the bulk of his tairens down below where those pikes and polearms would be of maximum use they would hold the path into shayol ghul a distant aiel horn blew a signal from one of the scouts the trollocs had entered the pass it was time he galloped back along the ridge toward the valley trailed by other commanders and king alsalam when they reached the point where he had set up his primary watchpost a vantage from which he could see miles back into the pass ituralde took out his looking glass shadows moved there in moments he could make out the trolloc hordes charging forward whipped to a frenzy for a moment he was back in maradon watching his mengood menfall one by one overrun at the hill fortifications pulled down in the streets of the city the explosion on the wall desperate act after desperate act killing as many as he could like a screaming man clubbing wolves as they tore him to pieces hoping to take at least one with him into the final darkness his hand holding the looking glass quivered he forced himself back to the present and his current defenses it felt as if hed been fighting losing battles his entire life that took a toll at night he would hear trollocs coming snorting sniffing the air hooves on the cobbles flashbacks from maradon steady old friend king alsalam said riding up beside him the king had a soothing voice hed always been able to calm others ituralde was certain the merchants of arad doman had chosen him for that reason tensions could run high when trade and war were concernedthe domani looked at the two as much the same beast but alsalam he could calm a frantic merchant who had just lost her entire fleet at sea ituralde nodded the defense of this valley he had to keep his mind on the defense of this valley hed hold not let the trollocs boil out of the pass into thakandar burn him hed hold for months if the dragon reborn needed it every other fightevery battle man had fought and was fightingwould be meaningless if ituralde lost here it was time to pull out every trick he knew every lastditch strategy here one moment of delay could earn rand althor the time he needed remind the men to remain steady below ituralde said surveying through his glass prepare the logs attendants relayed the orders which went through gateway to the squads involved that terrible force of trollocs continued onward clutching enormous swords twisted polearms or catchpoles to pull down riders they clamored through the pass lightning streaking between clouds above first the logs ituralde thought as the trollocs reached the middle of the pass the aiel on both sides untied piles of oiled tree trunksthere were so many dead trees in forests now that ituralde had had no trouble fetching them through gateways and lit them aflame hundreds of burning logs rolled down the sides of the pass crashing into the trollocs the oiled logs set flesh alight the beasts yelled howled and screeched depending on the orifice theyd been given ituralde raised his looking glass and watched them feeling an intense satisfaction that was new in the past hed never been satisfied to see his foes die oh hed been pleased when a plan worked and in truth the point of fighting was to see the other fellow dead and your men alivebut there had been no joy in that the longer you fought the more you saw the enemy as being like yourself the banners changed but the rank and file were much the same they wanted to win but usually they were more interested in a good meal a blanket to sleep on and boots without holes in them this was different ituralde wanted to see those beasts dead he lusted after it without them hed never have been forced to suffer the nightmare at maradon without them his hand wouldnt shake when the horns of war sounded theyd ruined him hed ruin them in return the trollocs pushed through the jumble of logs with great difficulty many of them had been set alight and the myrddraal had to whip them to keep them moving many seemed to want to eat the flesh of the fallen the rank scent of it made them hungry cooked bodies to them it was like the aroma of fresh bread the fades succeeded in driving them on but the trollocs soon reached the next of ituraldes defenses figuring out what to do had been a trick you couldnt plant spikes or dig ditches in that solid rock not without running your channelers to exhaustion he could have made piles of rock or earth but trollocs were big and mounds that would slow men were less effective against them beyond that moving so much earth and stone would have meant diverting workers from building real fortifications in the valley hed learned early that in a defensive war you wanted the fortifications to grow progressively better you lasted longer that way as you kept the enemy from gaining momentum in the end the solution had been simple brambles hed remembered huge thickets of them dry and dead back in arad doman ituraldes father had been a farmer and had always complained about the thorn thickets well if there was one thing mankind was not lacking it was dead plants another was manpower thousands had flocked to the dragons call and many of these dragonsworn had little battle experience hed still set them fighting when that time came for now however hed sent them to cut down enormous thornbushes theyd placed these across the pass lashed together in masses twenty feet thick and eight feet tall the thorn bales had been relatively easy to placefar lighter than stones or dirt yet amassed as they were the trollocs couldnt move them simply by pushing the first ranks ran up against them and tried but were rewarded with fiveinch thorns biting into them the creatures in the rear pressed forward causing the front ranks to turn in anger and rise up against those behind this left the bulk of the trolloc forces frozen in the pass at his mercy he didnt have much mercy for shadowspawn ituralde gave the signal and the ashaman with himawlsten one of those who had served under him at maradonshot a bright burst of red light into the sky along the sides above the pass more aiel came out and began to roll boulders and more burning logs down upon the trapped shadowspawn arrows and stones followedanything they could shoot throw or drop onto those below most of these attacks from ituraldes men happened farther down the pass in the middle of the bulk of trollocs that caused half to pull back and shy away while the others pushed forward to get awayshoving their allies in front into the brambles some trollocs carried shields and tried to protect themselves against the deadly hail wherever they formed together defensively and began to make a shield wall above themselves ituraldes channelers struck tearing them apart he couldnt spare many channelers for the workmost were back in the valley making gateways to move supplies and watching for enemy channelers theyd already had a second runin with dreadlords aviendha and cadsuane sedai had those operations in hand some of the trollocs shot arrows at the defenders above but casualties mounted as the shadowspawn at the front tried to hack their way through the abatis of thorns it was slow going ituralde watched cold inside and out as the myrddraal whipped the trollocs into a stampede that shoved the ones working on the thorns forward impaling them trampling them blood became a stream running back down toward the eastern end of the pass making the trollocs slip they pushed the front five or six lines breaking the thorns on the bodies of the beasts there it still took them the better part of an hour to break through they left thousands dead as they surged forward then found a second abatis thicker and higher than the first ituralde had placed seven at intervals in the pass the second was the largest and it had the desired effect seeing it made the trollocs at the front pull up short then they turned and broke backward mass confusion resulted trollocs behind cried and shouted pressing forward those in front snarled and howled as they tried to cut through the brambles some stood dazed all the while arrows and rocks and burning logs continued to fall beautiful alsalam whispered ituralde found that his arm was no longer quivering he lowered his looking glass lets go the battle is not through the king protested it is ituralde said turning away for now true to his word the entire trolloc army broke behind himhe could hear it happeningand fled eastward down the pass away from the valley one day held ituralde thought they would be back on the morrow and then they would be ready more shields better weapons at the front for cutting thorns theyd still bleed bleed dearly hed make certain of it chapter quick fragments siuan let out a long relieved breath as the amyrlinwith eyes as if on firestrode through the gateway and into their camp with doesine saerin and several other sitters bryne came through the gateway after them hurrying up to siuan what was decided she asked we stand for now bryne said elaynes orders and the amyrlin agrees with them were outnumbered siuan said and so is everyone else he said looking westward the sharans had spent the last few days gathering their forces setting up a mile or two away from egwenes army which was stationed with its back to the wide river that formed the border between kandor and arafel the shadow hadnt committed to an allout attack yet instead sending an occasional raiding group through gateways as they waited for the slower trolloc army to catch up the trollocs were here now unfortunately egwenes force could have retreated again through gateways but siuan admitted to herself that would accomplish little they had to face this force eventually bryne had selected this place at the southeastern tip of kandor because the terrain gave them an advantage albeit a small one the river that ran northsouth on the eastern border of kandor was deep but a ford lay less than a quartermile away from the hills that ran east to west along the southern border of kandor the shadows army would be making for the ford to enter arafel by stationing his forces at the ford and on the hills overlooking it bryne could engage the invading army from two directions if pressed he could withdraw across the ford to the arafellin side the water barrier putting the trollocs at a disadvantage against them it was a small benefit but in battle sometimes the small things made all the difference on the plains west of the river the shadow formed up the sharan and trolloc armies both moved across the field toward the beleaguered aes sedai and troops under brynes command nearby egwene surveyed the camp light it was a relief to know that the amyrlin had survived siuan had predicted it but still light it was good to see egwenes face if indeed it was her face this was the first time that the amyrlin had returned to camp following her ordeal but she had spent several quiet meetings with the sitters in secret locations siuan had not yet had a chance to speak with egwene in quiet egwene alvere siuan called after the amyrlin tell me where we first met the others looked at siuan frowning at her temerity egwene however seemed to understand fal dara she said you bound me with air on our trip down the river from there as part of a lesson in the power i have never forgotten siuan breathed a second deeper sigh of relief nobody had been in that lesson on the ship but egwene and nynaeve but siuan had unfortunately told sheriam mistress of novices and black ajah about it well she still believed that this was in fact egwene imitating a womans features was easy but prying out her memories was another story siuan made certain to look into the womans eyes there had been talk of what had happened at the black tower myrelle had spoken of it of events shared by her new warders something dark they said you could tell siuan would see the change in egwene if it had happened to her wouldnt she if we cant tell siuan thought then were already doomed she would have to trust the amyrlin as she had so many times before gather the aes sedai egwene said commander bryne you have your orders we hold at this river unless the losses become so absolutely unbearable that she trailed off how long have those been there siuan looked up at the raken scouts passing overhead all morning you have his letter bloody man egwene said the dragon reborns message delivered by min farshaw had been brief the seanchan fight the shadow hed sent min to them for reasons the woman wouldnt quite state bryne had given her tasks immediately she was working for the supply masters as a clerk do you trust the dragon reborns word regarding the seanchan mother saerin asked i dont know egwene said form up our battle lines anyway but keep an eye on those things up there in case they attack as rand entered the cavern something changed in the air the dark one only now sensed his arrival and was surprised by it the dagger had done its job rand led the way nynaeve at his left moiraine at his right the cavern led downward and climbing down it lost them all of the elevation theyd gained the passage was familiar to him from anothers memory from another age it was as if the cavern were swallowing them forcing them down toward the fires below the caverns ceiling jagged with fanglike stalactites seemed to lower as they walked inching down with each step it didnt move and the cavern didnt gradually narrow it just changed tall one moment shorter the next the cavern was a set of jaws slowly tightening on its prey rands head brushed the tip of a stalactite and nynaeve crouched down looking upward and cursing softly no rand said stopping i will not come to you on my knees shaitan the cavern rumbled the caverns dark reaches seemed to press inward pushing against rand he stood motionless it was as if he were a stuck gear and the rest of the machine strained to keep turning the hands on the clock he held firm the rocks trembled then retreated rand stepped forward and released a breath as the pressure lessened this thing he had begun could not be stopped now slowing strained both him and the dark one his adversary was caught up in this inevitability as much as he was the dark one didnt exist within the pattern but the pattern still affected him behind rand where he had stopped lay a small pool of blood i will need to be quick about this he thought i cant bleed to death until the battle is finished the ground trembled again thats right rand whispered im coming for you i am not a sheep being led to the slaughter shaitan today i am the hunter the trembling of the ground seemed almost like laughter horrible laughter rand ignored moiraines worried look as she walked beside him down they went an odd sensation came to mind one of the women was in trouble was it elayne aviendha he could not tell the warping of this place affected the bond he was moving through time differently than they and he lost his sense of where they were he could only feel that one was in pain rand growled walking faster if the dark one had hurt them shouldnt it be growing lighter in here they had to rely on the glow of callandor as he pulled saidin through it where are the fires rand asked voice echoing the molten stone at the bottom of the path the fires have been consumed lews therin a voice said from the shadows ahead rand stopped then stepped forward callandor thrust out to illuminate a figure on one knee at the edge of the light head bowed sword held before him tip resting against the ground beyond the figure was nothing a blackness rand moiraine said hand on his arm the dark one wells up against his bonds do not touch that blackness the figure stood and turned moridins nowfamiliar face reflecting callandors glow beside him on the ground lay a husk rand could explain it no other way it was like the shell some insects leave behind when they grow only it was in the shape of a man a man with no eyes one of the myrddraal moridin looked to the husk following rands gaze a vessel my master needed no longer moridin said saa floated in the whites of his eyes bouncing shaking moving with crazed vigor it gave birth to what is behind me there is nothing behind you moridin raised his sword before his face in a salute exactly those eyes were nearly completely black rand waved for moiraine and nynaeve to stay a few steps back as he approached you demand a duel here now elan you know what i do is inevitable slowing me has no purpose no purpose lews therin moridin laughed if i weaken you even slightly will my masters task not be that much easier no i think i shall indeed stand in your way and if i win what then your victory is not assured it never has been i win again lews therin you could step aside rand said raising callandor the glow of its light shifting off moridins black steel sword if my victory is not assured neither is your fall let me pass for once make the choice you know you should moridin laughed now now you beg me to return to the light i have been promised oblivion finally nothing a destruction of my entire being an end you will not steal that from me lews therin by my grave you will not moridin came forward swinging lan executed cherry petal kisses the pondnot an easy task from horseback as it was not a form designed for the saddle his sword slashed into the neck of a trolloc just an inch into the creatures skin that was enough to make fetid blood blossom in a spray the bullfaced creature dropped its catchpole reaching up to hold its neck and let out a gurgling halfscream halfgroan lan danced mandarb backward as a second trolloc came for his side he cut its arm off as he spun the trolloc stumbled from the blow and andere ran it through from behind andere moved his horse up beside mandarb over the din of battle lan could hear his friend panting how long had they been fighting here at the battles front lans arms felt like lead on his shoulders it hadnt been this bad during the blood snow lan andere shouted they keep coming lan nodded then moved mandarb back again as a pair of trollocs shoved their way through corpses to attack these two had catchpoles as well that wasnt uncommon for trollocs they realized that men on foot were far less dangerous to them than men on horseback still it made lan wonder if they were trying to capture him he and andere let the trollocs come through and attack as two members of the high guard rode in from the side to distract their attention the trollocs came for lan and he lurched forward swinging and cutting in half the shaft of each of their catchpoles the beasts didnt stop reaching brutish fingers to try to pull him down lan could smell their putrid breath as he rammed his sword into the throat of one how slowly his muscles moved andere had better be in position anderes horse came in with a sudden gallop slamming its armored flank into the second trolloc knocking it to the side it stumbled and the two mounted guardsmen butchered it with longhandled axes those men were both bloodied as was andere as was lan himself he only vaguely remembered taking that thigh wound he was growing so tired he wasnt in any condition to fight we pull back he announced reluctantly let someone else take the point for now lan and his men were leading the heavy cavalry at the tip of the fight pressing against the trollocs in a triangular formation to shear through and pushing them to the sides for the flanking attacks to crush the others nodded and he could sense their relief as he pulled himself and his fiftysomething high guards back they retreated and a group of shienarans moved in to fill the point lan cleaned his sword then sheathed it lightning rumbled above yes those clouds did seem lower today like a hand slowly pressing down upon the men as they died lightning bolts cracked the air nearby one after another lan turned mandarb sharply there had been a lot of lightning today but those had been too close together he smelled smoke on the air dreadlords andere asked lan nodded eyes searching for the attackers all he could see was the lines of men fighting the swarming mass of trollocs driving forward in waves he needed higher ground lan gestured at one of the hills and heeled mandarb toward it members of the rear guard watched him pass giving a raised hand and a dai shan their armor was stained with blood the reserves had been rotated to the front then back again during the day mandarb plodded up the hill lan patted the horse then dismounted and trudged beside the stallion at the top he stopped to survey the battle borderlander armies made spikelike indentations of silver and color in the trolloc sea so many the dreadlords had come out on their large platform again the mechanism pulled by dozens of trollocs as it rolled across the field they needed height to see where to direct their attacks lan set his jaw watching a series of lightning bolts strike the kandori hurling bodies into the air and opening a gap in their lines lans own channelers struck back hurling lightning and fire at the advancing trollocs to keep them from pouring through the hole in the borderlander line that would work for only so long he had far fewer aes sedai and ashaman than the shadow had dreadlords light said prince kaisel riding up next to him dai shan if they rip enough holes in our lines reserves are coming there andere said pointing he was still mounted and lan had to step forward to look around him to see what he was indicating a group of shienaran riders were making for the lines upon which the lightning bolts were falling there too kaisel said pointing to the east a group of arafellin were making for the same place the two forces became entangled as they both rushed to close the gap at the same time lightning began to strike down from the sky raining on the dreadlords platform good narishma and merise had been told to watch for the dreadlords and try to kill them perhaps it would distract the enemy lan focused on something else why had two groups of reserves been sent to plug that same hole either unit would have been large enough for the job with so many they had interfered with one another a mistake fie climbed into mandarbs saddle reluctant to make the horse work again so soon he would check on this error within the wolf dream perrin and gaul stopped on a ridge overlooking a valley with a mountain at the end of it above the mountain the black clouds spun in a terrible vortex that didnt quite touch the mountains tip the winds ravaged the valley and perrin was forced to create a pocket of stillness around himself and gaul deflecting debris down below they caught quick fragments of an enormous battle aiel trollocs and men in armor appeared in the wolf dream for moments as if out of twisting smoke and dust swung weapons disintegrated in midblow thousands of them many wolves were here in the dream all around they waited for for something something they could not explain to perrin they had a name for rand shadowkiller perhaps they were here to witness what he would do perrin gaul asked hes here finally perrin said softly he has entered the pit of doom rand was going to need perrin at some point during this fight unfortunately perrin couldnt just stand here there was work to be done gaul and he had with help from the wolves found graendal near cairhien she had spoken to some people in their dreams darkfriends among the armies perhaps she was peeking at basheres dreams before that perrin thought or so lanfear claimed he didnt trust her for a moment anyway hed found graendal earlier today and had been planning to strike when suddenly she had vanished he knew how to track someone in the wolf dream when they shifted and he had followed her here to thakandar her scent vanished sharply in the middle of the valley below shed traveled back into the real world perrin wasnt certain how much time had passed in the wolf dream he and gaul still had food but it felt as if it had been days and days lanfear said that the closer perrin came to rand the more time would distort he could probably test that statement at least he is here young bull the sending came sudden and urgent from a wolf named sunrise here in the valley slayer comes among us hurry perrin growled grabbed gaul by the shoulder without a word and shifted them they appeared on the rocky path leading to a gaping hole in the rock above the passage down to the pit of doom itself a wolf lay nearby arrow in its side smelling of death others howled in the near distance the horrible wind whipped at him perrin lowered his head and charged into it gaul at his side inside young bull a wolf sent inside the mouth of darkness not daring to think about what he was doing perrin burst into a long narrow chamber filled with jagged rocks projecting from the floor and ceiling ahead something bright sent pulsing waves through the space perrin raised a hand against the light vaguely catching sight of shapes at the end of the chamber two men locked in battle two women as if frozen and just a few feet from perrin slayer drawing his bow to his cheek perrin roared hammer in his hand and shifted himself between slayer and rand he slapped the arrow from the air with his hammer a split second after it was loosed slayers eyes widened and he vanished perrin shifted to gaul grabbing the man by the arm then shifted back to where slayer had been and caught the scent of his location be wary perrin said then shifted them after the man they dropped into the middle of a group of people they were aiel but instead of wearing normal shoufa they had strange red veils the shift hadnt taken perrin and gaul far this was a village of some sort close enough for the peak of shayol ghul to be visible in the distance the redveils attacked perrin wasnt particularly surprised to find aiel on the side of the shadow there were darkfriends among all peoples but why identify themselves with the color of their veils perrin swung his hammer in a wide circle keeping a group of them at bay then shifted behind them crushing the head of one from behind gaul became a blur of spears and brown clothing dodging around redveils stabbing then vanishingand then appearing and stabbing again yes hed learned quickly more quickly than these redveils apparently had for they failed to keep up with him perrin smashed another one in the kneecap then searched for slayer there he stood on a hillock above watching perrin glanced at gaul who between jumps gave him a quick nod there were eight redveils left but the earth underneath gauls feet began to heave exploding upward as gaul jumped perrin managed to protect his friend creating a steel plate beneath him to deflect the blast but it was a close thing gaul landed shakily and perrin was forced to shift to him and attack the redveil coming at him from behind take care perrin yelled at gaul at least one of these fellows can channel light as if aiel fighting for the shadow werent enough channeling aiel channeling aiel men light as perrin swung at another slayer arrived a sword in one hand and a long hunting knife in the otherthe type a man would use to skin his prey growling perrin threw himself into the fight and the two began a strange dance one attacking the other who vanished to appear nearby before attacking also they spun about like that one shifting then the other each trying for an edge perrin just missed crushing slayer with a blow then nearly caught steel in his gut gaul was proving very usefulperrin would have had a horrible time trying to stand alone against both slayer and the redveils unfortunately gaul could do little but distract his foes and was having a very difficult time managing that as a column of fire from one of the redveils nearly took him perrin made his decision he shifted over to gauland almost took a spear through the shoulder perrin turned the spear to cloth and it bent on his skin gaul started seeing perrin then opened his mouth perrin didnt give him a chance to speak he grabbed his friend by the arm then shifted them away they vanished just as flames welled up around them they reappeared before the entrance to the pit of doom perrins cloak was smoldering gaul was bleeding from the thigh when had that happened are you there perrin sent out urgent dozens upon dozens of wolves replied we are here young bull do you lead us young bull the last hunt watch for moonhunter young bull she stalks you like a lion in the high grass i need you perrin sent to the wolves slayer is here will you fight him and the men with him for me it is the last hunt one sent back as many others agreed to help him they appeared on the slopes of shayol ghul perrin could smell their wariness they did not like this place it was not a place wolves came not in the waking world nor in the dream slayer came for him either he realized perrin would be guarding this place or he intended to finish his attack on rand either way perrin caught sight of him standing on the ridge up above looking down into the valleya dark figure with a bow and a black cloak whipping in the tempests winds beneath him that battle still raged in dust and shadow thousands upon thousands of people dying killing struggling in the real world only phantoms reaching this place perrin gripped his hammer come try me he whispered youll find me a different foe this time slayer raised his bow then loosed the arrow split becoming four then sixteen then a hail of shafts shooting toward perrin perrin growled then attacked the column of air that slayer had created to stop the wind it dissolved and the raging gale caught the arrows spinning them about slayer appeared in front of perrin brandishing knife and sword perrin leaped at him as the redveils appeared nearby the wolves and gaul dealt with them this time perrin could focus on his enemy he swung with a roar slapping slayers weapon away then aiming for his head slayer danced back and created stone arms that burst from the ground throwing chips and shards of rockto seize perrin perrin concentrated and they burst tumbling back to the ground he caught the sharp scent of slayers surprise youre here in the flesh slayer hissed perrin jumped for him shifting in midleap to reach the man more quickly slayer blocked with a shield that appeared on his arm mahalleinir left a large dent in the front as it was deflected slayer vanished and appeared five strides back on the rim of the pathway leading up to the cavern im so very glad you came hunting me wolf pup i was forbidden from seeking you but now you are here i skinned the sire now the pup perrin launched himself at slayer in a blurring leap like those he used to bound from hilltop to hilltop he crashed into the man throwing them both off of the ledge in front of the opening to the pit of doom sending them tumbling dozens of feet toward the ground perrins hammer was at his belthe didnt remember putting it there but he didnt want to hit this man with the hammer he wanted to feel slayer as he slammed a fist into the mans face the punch connected as they fell but slayers face was suddenly hard as stone in that moment the fight became not one of flesh against flesh but will against will as they fell together perrin imagined slayers skin becoming soft giving beneath his punch the bones brittle and cracking slayer in response imagined his skin as stone the result was that slayers cheek became hard as rock but perrin cracked it anyway they hit the ground and rolled apart when slayer stood his right cheek looked like that of a statue hit with a hammer small cracks moving out over the skin blood began to trickle through those cracks and slayer opened his eyes in shock he raised a hand to his cheek feeling the blood the skin became flesh again and stitches appeared as if sewn by a master surgeon one could not heal oneself in the wolf dream slayer sneered at perrin then lunged the two of them danced back and forth surrounded by churning dust that formed the faces and bodies of people struggling for their lives in another place another world perrin crashed through a pair of them dust streaming from mahalleinir as he swung slayer skidded back creating a wind to blow him out of the way then struck forward too quickly perrin became a wolf without a thought slayers sword passing over his head young bull leaped into slayer slamming him backward through an impression of two aiel fighting one another those exploded into sand and dust others formed to the sides then blew away the howling tempest was a roar in young bulls ears and the dust ground into his skin and eyes he rolled across slayer then lunged for his throat how sweet it will be to taste this twolegs blood in my mouth slayer shifted away young bull became perrin with hammer at the ready crouching on the plain of fragmentary fighting changing people careful he thought to himself you are a wolf but more a man with a start he realized that some of those impressions werent completely human he saw a couple that were distinctly snakelike in appearance though they faded quickly does this place reflect other worlds he wondered not certain what else to make of the phantoms slayer came at him again teeth clenched perrins hammer grew hot in his fingers and his leg throbbed where hed been hit and then healed during his last fight with slayer he roared letting slayers sword closeletting it graze him on the cheekas he crashed his own weapon into the mans side slayer vanished perrin followed through with the swing and for a moment assumed hed beaten the man but no his hammer had barely connected before slayer disappeared the man had been ready waiting to shift perrin felt blood moving through the hair of his beard toward his chin that graze had cut a gash on his cheek much in the same place as hed landed that blow on slayers face he sniffed at the air turning about trying to catch the scent of slayers location where had he gone there was nothing slayer hadnt shifted to another place in the wolf dream he knew that perrin could follow him instead he must have jumped back into the waking world perrin howled realizing hed lost his prey the wolf railed against this a failed hunt and it was a struggle for perrin to bring himself back under control it was a scent that brought him back to it burning fur it was accompanied by howls of pain perrin shifted himself back to the top of the pathway wolves lay burned and dying amid the corpses of redveils two of the men were still up back to back and incongruously theyd lowered their veils they had teeth filed to points and were smiling almost with madness as they channeled burning wolf after wolf to char gaul had been forced to take shelter beside a rock his clothing smoldering he smelled of pain the two smiling channelers didnt seem to care that their companions were bleeding to death on the ground around them perrin walked toward them one raised a hand and released a jet of fire perrin turned it to smoke then parted that by walking directly into it the grayblack smoke eddying against him then streaming off the other aiel man also channeled trying to rip the earth up beneath perrin perrin knew that earth would not break that it would resist the weaves so it did perrin could not see the weaves but he knew that the earthsuddenly far more solidrefused to budge as ordered the first aiel reached for his spear with a growl but perrin grabbed him by the neck he wanted so badly to crush this mans throat he had lost slayer again and wolves were dead because of these two he held himself back slayer slayer deserved worse than death for what he had done he didnt know about these men and he wasnt certain if killing them here would kill them forever without rebirth it seemed to him that everyone including creatures like these should have another chance the redveil in his hand struggled trying with weaves of air to envelop perrin you are an idiot perrin said softly then he looked to the other one you too both blinked then looked at him with eyes that grew slack one started drooling perrin shook his head slayer hadnt trained them at all even gaul after only a how long had it been anyway even gaul knew not to be caught like that in the grip of someone who could change the very capacity of ones mind perrin had to keep thinking of them as idiots to maintain the transformation he knelt seeking among the wolves for the wounded he could help he imagined bindings on the wounds of those who were hurt they would heal quickly in this place wolves seemed to be able to do that they had lost eight of their members for whom perrin howled the others joined him but there was no regret to their sendings they had fought that was what they had come to do after that perrin saw to the fallen redveils all were dead gaul limped up beside him holding a burned arm the wound was bad but not immediately lifethreatening we need to take you out of here perrin said to him and get you some healing im not certain what time it is but i think we should go to merrilor and wait for the gateway out gaul gave him a toothy grin i killed two of those myself perrin aybara one could channel i think myself great with honor then you slide in and take two captive he shook his head bain would laugh herself all the way back to the threefold land if she saw this perrin turned to his two captives killing them here seemed heartlessly cruel but to release them meant fighting them againperhaps losing more wolves more friends i do not suspect these keep to jietolo gaul said would you take a man who could channel as gaishain anyway he shuddered visibly just kill them and be done with it lanfear said perrin eyed her he didnt jump as she spokehe had grown somewhat accustomed to the way she popped in and out he did find it annoying however if i kill them here will that kill them forever no she said it doesnt work that way for men did he trust her on this point for some reason he found that he did why would she lie still killing unarmed men they were barely more than babies here to him no he thought considering the dead wolves not babies far more dangerous than that those two have been turned she said folding her arms nodding to the two channelers many are born to their life these days but those two have the filed teeth they were taken and turned gaul muttered something it sounded like an oath but it also sounded reverent it was in the old tongue and perrin didnt catch its meaning after that however gaul raised a spear he smelled regretful you spat in his eye and so he uses you my brothers horrible turned perrin thought like those men at the black tower he frowned walking up and taking the head of one of the men in his hands could he will the man back to the light if he could be forced to be evil could he be restored perrin hit something vast as he pushed against the minds of these men his will bounced free like a twig used to try beating down an iron gate perrin stumbled back he looked at gaul and shook his head i can do nothing for them i will do it gaul said they are brothers perrin nodded reluctant as gaul slit the throats of the two men it was better this way still it ripped perrin up inside to see it he hated what fighting did to people what it did to him the perrin of months ago could never have stood and watched this light if gaul hadnt done it he would have himself he knew it you can be such a child lanfear said arms still folded beneath her breasts as she watched him she sighed then took him by the arm a wave of icy healing washed through him the wound on his cheek closed perrin took a deep breath then nodded toward gaul i am not your errand woman wolf pup she said you want to convince me that youre not a foe he asked thats a good place to start she sighed then waved impatiently for gaul to approach he did so limping and she healed him a distant rumbling shook the cavern behind them she looked at it and narrowed her eyes i cannot stay here she said then she was gone i do not know what to make of that one gaul said rubbing his arm where the clothing was burned but the skin healed i believe she is gaming with us perrin aybara i do not know which game perrin grunted in agreement this slayer he will return fm thinking of a way to do something about that perrin said reaching to his waist where hed tied the dreamspike to his belt with straps he freed it watch here he told gaul then entered the cavern perrin walked past those stones like teeth it was hard to escape the feeling that he was crawling into the mouth of a darkhound the light at the bottom of the descent was blinding but perrin created a bubble around himself that was shaded like glass that was only translucent he could make out rand and someone else striking at one another with swords at the lip of a deep pit no it wasnt a pit perrin gaped the entire world seemed to end here the cavern opening into a vast nothingness an eternal expanse like the blackness of the ways only this one seemed to be pulling him into it him and everything else hed grown accustomed to the storm raging outside so he hadnt noticed the wind in the tunnel now that he paid attention he could feel it streaming through the cavern into that hole looking into that gap he knew that hed never understood blackness before not really this was blackness this was nothingness the absolute end of all other darkness was frightening because of what it might hide this darkness was different if this engulfed you you would cease completely perrin stumbled back though the wind blowing down the tunnel wasnt strong just steady like a stream running into nowhere perrin gripped the dreamspike then forced himself to turn away from rand someone knelt on the floor nearby her head bowed braced as if against some great force coming from the nothingness moiraine yes and that was nynaeve kneeling to her right the veil between worlds was very thin here if he could see nynaeve and moiraine perhaps they could see or hear him he stepped up to nynaeve nynaeve can you hear me she blinked turning her head yes she could hear him but she could not see him it seemed she searched about confused as she clung to the stone teeth of the floor as if for life itself nynaeve perrin yelled perrin she whispered looking about where are you im going to do something nynaeve he said i will make it impossible to create gateways into this place if you want to travel to or from this area youll need to create your gateway out in front of the cavern all right she nodded still looking about for him apparently though the real world reflected in the wolf dream it didnt work the other way around perrin rammed the dreamspike into the ground then activated it as lanfear had shown him creating the bubble of purple just around the cavern itself he hurried back into the tunnel emerging through a wall of purple glass to rejoin gaul and the wolves light gaul said i was about to go search for you why did it take so long so long perrin asked you were gone at least two hours perrin shook his head its the bore playing with our sense of time well at least with that dreamspike in place slayer will have trouble reaching rand after having slayer use the dreamspike against him it was satisfying to turn the terangreal against the man perrin had made the protective bubble just large enough to fit inside the cavern and shelter rand the bore and those with him the placement meant all of the borders of the dome save the one here at the front were inside rock slayer would not be able to jump into the middle of the cavern and strike he would have to enter through the front either that or find a way to burrow through the rock which perrin supposed was possible here in the wolf dream however it would slow him and that was what rand needed i need you to protect this place perrin sent to the gathered wolves many of whom were still licking their wounds shadowkiller fights inside hunting the most dangerous prey this world has known we must not let slayer reach him we will guard this place young bull one sent others gather he will not pass us can you do this perrin sent an image of wolves spaced through the borderlands relaying messages quickly between themselves there were thousands upon thousands of them roaming the area perrin was proud of his sending he didnt send it as words or as images but as a concept mixed with scents with a hint of instinct with the wolves positioned as he sent they could send to him through the network almost instantly if slayer returned we can do it the wolves sent perrin nodded then waved to gaul we are not staying he asked there is too much happening perrin said time moves too slowly here i dont want the war to pass us by besides there was still the matter of whatever graendal was doing chapter considerations i dont like fighting beside those seanchan gawyn said softly coming up beside egwene she didnt like it either and she knew he would be able to sense that from her what could she say she couldnt turn the seanchan away the shadow had brought the sharans to fight under its banner egwene therefore would have to use what she had anything she had her neck itched as she crossed the field to the meeting place about a mile or so east of the ford in arafel bryne had already arrayed most of her forces at the ford aes sedai could be seen atop the hills just south of the ford and large squadrons of archers and pikemen were positioned below them on the slopes the troops were feeling fresher the days egwenes force had spent retreating had relieved some of the pressure of warfare despite attempts by the enemy to make them commit to combat egwenes chances depended on the seanchan joining the battle and engaging the sharan channelers her stomach twisted she had once heard that in caemlyn unscrupulous men would throw starving dogs into a pit together and bet on which one would survive the ensuing fight this felt the same to her the seanchan damane were not free women they could not choose to fight from what shed seen of the sharan male channelers they were little more than animals themselves egwene should be fighting the seanchan with every breath not allying with them her instincts rebelled as she approached the gathering of seanchan the seanchan leader demanded this audience with egwene the light send it would be quick egwene had received reports on this fortuona so she knew what to expect the diminutive seanchan empress stood atop a small platform watching the battle preparations she wore a glittering dress whose train extended a ridiculous distance behind her carried by eight dacovale those servants in the horribly immodest clothing various members of the blood stood in groups waiting with careful poses deathwatch guards hulking in their nearblack armor stood like boulders around the empress egwene approached guarded by her own soldiers and much of the hall of the tower fortuona had first tried to insist that egwene come to visit her in her camp egwene had of course refused it had taken hours to reach an agreement both would come to this location in arafel and both would stand rather than sit so that neither could give the impression of being above the other still egwene was irritated to find the woman waiting shed wanted to time this meeting so they both arrived at the same moment fortuona turned from the battle preparations and looked at egwene it appeared that many of siuans reports were false true fortuona did look something like a child with that slight build and delicate features those similarities were minor no child had ever had eyes so discerning so calculating egwene revised her expectations shed imagined fortuona as a spoiled adolescent the product of a coddled lifetime i have considered fortuona said whether it would be appropriate to speak to you in person with my own voice nearby several of the seanchan bloodwith their painted fingernails and partially shaved headsgasped egwene ignored them they stood near several pairs of suldam and damane if she let those pairs draw her attention her temper might get the better of her i have considered myself egwene said whether it would be appropriate to speak to one such as yourself who has committed such terrible atrocities i have decided that i will speak to you fortuona continued ignoring egwenes remark i think that for the time it would be better if i see you not as marathdamane but as a queen among the people of this land no egwene said you will see me for what i am woman i demand it fortuona pursed her lips very well she finally said i have spoken to damane before training them has been a hobby of mine to see you as such does not violate protocol as the empress may speak with her pet hounds then i will speak with you directly as well egwene said keeping her face impassive for the amyrlin judges many trials she must be able to speak to murderers and rapists in order to pass sentence upon them i think you would be at home in their company though i suspect they would find you nauseating i can see that this will be an uneasy alliance you expected otherwise egwene asked you hold my sisters captive what you have done to them is worse than murder you have tortured them broken their wills i wish to the light you had simply killed them instead i would not expect you to understand what needs to be done fortuona said looking back toward the battlefield you are marathdamane it is natural for you to seek your own good as you see it natural indeed egwene said softly this is why i insist that you see me as i am for i represent the ultimate proof that your society and empire are built upon falsehoods here i stand a woman you insist should be collared for the common good and yet i display none of the wild or dangerous tendencies that you claim i should have so long as i am free from your collars i prove to every man and woman who draws breath that you are a liar the other seanchan murmured fortuona herself maintained a cool face you would be much happier with us fortuna said oh would i egwene said yes you speak of hating the collar but if you were to wear it and see you would find it a more peaceful life we do not torture our damane we care for them and allow them to live lives of privilege you dont know do you egwene asked i am the empress fortuona said my domination extends across seas and the realms of my protection encompass all that humankind knows and thinks if there are things i do not know they are known by those in my empire for i am the empire delightful egwene said and does your empire realize that i wore one of your collars that i was once trained by your suldam fortuona stiffened then rewarded egwene with a look of shock although she covered it immediately i was in falme egwene said a damane trained by renna yes i wore your collar woman i found no peace there i found pain humiliation and terror why did i not know of this fortuona asked loudly turning why did you not tell me egwene glanced at the collected seanchan nobility fortuona seemed to be addressing one man in particular a man in rich black and golden clothing trimmed with white lace he had an eyepatch over one eye black to match and the fingernails on both hands were lacquered to a dark mat egwene sputtered he gave a kind of halfwave looking embarrassed oh light she thought what has he thrown himself into she galloped through plans in her mind mat was imitating a seanchan nobleman they must not know who he really was could she trade something to save him approach fortuona said this man is not egwene began but fortuona spoke over her knotai she said did you know that this woman was an escaped damane you knew her as a child i believe you know who he is egwene asked of course i do fortuona said he is named knotai but once was called matrim cauthon do not think he will serve you marathdamane though you did grow up together he is the prince of the ravens now a position he earned by his marriage to me he serves the seanchan the crystal throne and the empress may she live forever mat noted hello egwene glad to hear you escaped those sharans hows the white tower still white i guess egwene looked from mat to the seanchan empress then back at him again finally unable to do anything else she burst out laughing you married matrim cauthon the omens predicted it fortuona said you let yourself draw too close to a taveren egwene said and so the pattern bound you to him foolish superstitions fortuona said egwene glanced at mat being taveren never did get me much mat said sourly i suppose i should be grateful the pattern didnt haul me by my boots over to shayol ghul small blessing that you didnt answer my question knotai fortuona said did you know this woman was an escaped damane if so why didnt you speak of it to me i didnt think too much about it mat said she wasnt one for very long tuon we will speak of this on another occasion fortuona said softly it will not be pleasant she turned back to egwene to converse with a former damane is not the same as speaking to one recently captured or one who has always been free news of this event will spread you have caused me inconvenience egwene regarded the woman baffled light these people were completely insane what was your purpose insisting upon this meeting the dragon reborn says you will help our fight help us then i needed to meet you fortuona said you are my opposite i have agreed to join this peace the dragon offered but there are conditions oh light rand egwene thought what did you promise them she braced herself along with agreeing to fight fortuona said i will acknowledge the sovereign borders of nations as they are currently mapped we will force the obedience of no marathdamane save those who violate our borders and those borders are egwene asked as currently outlined as i be more specific egwene said tell me with your own voice woman what borders fortuona drew her lips to a line obviously she was not accustomed to being interrupted we control altara amadicia tarabon and almoth plain tremalking egwene said youll release tremalking and the other sea folk islands i did not list those because they are not of your land but the sea they are not your concern besides they were not part of the agreement with the dragon reborn he did not mention it he has a lot on his mind tremalking will be part of the agreement with me i wasnt aware we were making such an agreement fortuona said calmly you require our assistance we could leave in a moment should i order it how would you fare against that army without our aid which you so recently begged me to lend begged egwene thought do you realize what happens if we lose the last battle the dark one breaks the wheel slays the great serpent and all things will end thats if were lucky if we arent lucky the dark one will remake the world according to his own twisted vision all people will be bound to him in an eternity of suffering subjugation and torment i am aware of this fortuona said you act as if this particular fighthere on this battlefieldis decisive if my army were to be destroyed egwene said our entire effort would be jeopardized everything could indeed hinge on what happens here i disagree fortuona said your armies are not vital they are populated by the children of oathbreakers you fight the shadow and for that i grant you honor if you were to lose i would return to seanchan and raise up the full might of the ever victorious army and bring it to bear against this horror we would still win the last battle it would be more difficult without you and i would not waste useful lives or potential damane but i am confident we could stand against the shadow on our own she met egwenes eyes so cold egwene thought shes bluffing she must be reports from siuans eyesandears said that the seanchan homeland was in chaos a succession crisis perhaps fortuona really did believe that the empire could stand against the shadow on its own if so she was wrong you will fight alongside us egwene said you made the treaty with rand gave him your oath i assume tremalking is ours oh egwene said and you have set up a leader there one of the sea folk to acknowledge your rule fortuona said nothing you have the allegiance of most of the other lands youve conquered egwene said for better or worse the altarans and amadicians follow you the taraboners seem to as well but the sea folk i have no reports whatsoever of a single one of their kind supporting you or living peacefully beneath your thumb borders the borders you just mentioned as they exist on maps show tremalking as sea folk land it is not yours if our treaty holds current borders as they are you would need a ruler in tremalking to acknowledge you it seemed a tenuous argument to egwene the seanchan were conquerors what did they care if they had any kind of legitimacy however fortuona seemed to consider egwenes words she frowned in thought this is a good argument fortuona finally said they have not accepted us they are foolish to reject the peace we offer but they have indeed done so very well we will leave tremalking but i will add a condition to our agreement as you have and your condition you will announce through your tower and through your lands fortuona said any marathdamane who wish to come to ebou dar and be properly collared must be allowed to do so you think people would want to be collared she was insane she had to be of course they would want to fortuona said in seanchan very occasionally one who can channel is missed in our searches when they discover what they are they come to us and demand to be collared as is appropriate you will not force anyone to stay away from us you will let them come i promise you none will then you should have no trouble making the proclamation fortuona said we will send emissaries to educate your people on the benefits of damaneour teachers will come peacefully for we will hold to the treaty i believe you will be surprised some will see what is right do what you wish egwene said amused break no laws and i suspect most will allow your emissaries i cannot speak for every ruler what of the lands you control tar valon you will allow our emissaries if they break no laws egwene said i wont silence them id allow in whitecloaks if they could say their piece without driving men to riot but light woman you cant actually believe she trailed off watching fortuona she did believe it so far as egwene could tell she did at least shes sincere egwene thought insane insane but sincere and the damane you now hold egwene said youll let them go if they wish to be released none who are properly trained would wish that this must be equal on both sides egwene said what of a girl whom you discover to be able to channel if she does not wish to be made damane will you let her leave your lands and join ours that would be like letting an enraged grolm free in a city square you said that people will see the truth egwene said if your way of life is strong your ideals true then people will see them for what they are if they dont you shouldnt force them let any who wish to be free go free and ill let your people speak in tar valon light ill give them room and free board and ill see the same done in every city fortuona eyed egwene many of our suldam have come to this war anticipating the chance to capture new damane from among those who serve the shadow these sharans perhaps you would have us let them or your sisters of the shadow free to destroy murder to be tried and executed under the light why not let them be put to use why waste their lives what you do is an abomination egwene said feeling exasperated not even the black ajah deserves that resources should not be discarded so idly is that so egwene said do you realize that every one of your suldam your precious trainers is herself a marathdamane fortuona spun on her do not spread such lies oh shall we test it fortuona you said you trained them yourself you are a suldam i presume put the adam on your neck i dare you if i am wrong it will do nothing to you if i am right you will be subject to its power and will prove to be marathdamane fortuonas eyes widened in anger she had ignored egwenes barbs calling her a criminal but this accusation seemed to dig into her so egwene made certain to twist the knife a little deeper yes egwene said let us do it and test the real strength of your commitment if you prove to be able to channel will you do as you claim others should will you stroll up to the collar and snap it around your own neck fortuona will you obey your own laws i have obeyed them fortuona said coldly you are very ignorant perhaps it is true that suldam can learn to channel but this is not the same thing as being a marathdamaneany more than a man who can become a murderer is to be considered one we shall see egwene said once more of your people realize the lies theyve been told i will break you myself fortuona said softly someday your people will turn you over to me you will forget yourself and your arrogance will lead you to our borders i will be waiting i plan to live centuries egwene hissed i will watch your empire crumble fortuona i will watch it with joy she raised a finger to tap the woman on the chest but fortuona moved with blurring speed her hand grabbing egwenes by the wrist for one so small she certainly was quick egwene embraced the source by reflex damane nearby gasped and the light of the one power sprang up around them mat pushed between egwene and fortuona and shoved them apart holding one hand at each womans chest egwene wove by instinct intending to remove his hand with a thread of air it fell apart of course blood and ashes thats inconvenient she had forgotten he was there lets be civil ladies mat said eyeing one of them then the other dont make me throw the pair of you over my knee egwene glared at him and mat met her eyes he was trying to deflect her anger to him instead of fortuona egwene looked down at his hand which was pressed against her chest uncomfortably close to her breasts fortuona was also looking at that hand mat lowered both hands but took his sweet time at it as if completely unconcerned the people of this world need you two and they need you levelheaded you hear me this is bigger than any of us when you fight each other the dark one wins and that is that so stop behaving like children we will have many words about this tonight knotai fortuona said i love words mat said there are some deliciously pretty words out there smile thats always sounded like a pretty word to me dont you think or perhaps the words i promise not to kill egwene right now for trying to touch me the empress may i live forever because we really bloody need her for the next couple of weeks or so he eyed fortuona pointedly you really married him egwene said to fortuona honestly it was an unusual event fortuona replied she shook herself then glared at egwene he is mine and i do not intend to release him you dont seem the type to release anything once you have your hands on it egwene said matrim does not interest me at the moment your army does will you fight or wont you i will fight fortuona said but my army is not subject to you have your general send us suggestions we will consider them but i can see you are going to have a difficult time defending the ford against the invader without a larger number of your marathdamane i will send you some of my suldam and damane to protect your army that is all i will do for now she started walking back toward her people come knotai i dont know how you fell into this egwene said under her breath to mat i dont want to know ill do what i can to help free you once we are done fighting thats kind of you egwene mat said but i can handle this on my own he rushed off after fortuona that was what he always said shed find some way to help him she shook her head returning to where gawyn waited for her leilwin had declined to come though egwene would have expected her to enjoy seeing some of those from her homeland well need to keep them at arms length gawyn said softly agreed egwene said youll still fight alongside the seanchan despite what theyve done so long as they keep the sharan channelers occupied yes egwene looked toward the horizontoward rand and the powerful struggle he must be embroiled in our options are limited gawyn and our allies dwindling for now whoever is willing to kill trollocs is a friend that is that the andoran line buckled and trollocs ripped through snarling beasts with stinking breath that clouded in the chill air elaynes halberdiers nearby scrambled as they fell over themselves to escape the first few trollocs ignored them howling and leaping over them to make room for more to pour through the opening like dark blood from a gash in the flesh elayne tried to gather what little strength she had left she felt as if saidar would slip from her at any moment but the men fighting and dying wouldnt be any stronger than she at this point theyd all been fighting for most of the day somehow finding the strength to weave she roasted the first few trollocs with balls of fire tripping up the flow through the wound in the human lines streaks of white arrows from birgittes bow followed trollocs gurgled clawing at their necks where the arrows hit elayne sent strike after strike from horseback tired hands clinging to the saddle as she blinked eyes that seemed leaden dead trollocs toppled forming like a scab over the hole blocking the others from ripping through reserve troops stumbled up seizing ground and pushing the trollocs back elayne breathed out wavering light she felt as if shed been forced to run around caemlyn while pulling lead weights she could barely sit upright let alone hold the one power her vision dimmed then darkened further sound faded in her ears then darkness sound came back first distant yells clangs a very faint horn the howls of the trollocs occasional thundering from the dragons those arent firing as often she thought aludra had moved to a rhythm in her firing bashere would pull back one section of troops and let them rest the trollocs would pour through and the dragons would bombard them for a short time as the trollocs tried to crawl up and destroy the dragons cavalry would come in and smash them at the flanks it killed a lot of trollocs that was their job kill trollocs too slow she thought too slow elayne found herself on the ground birgittes worried face hovering above her oh light elayne mumbled did i fall off we caught you in time birgitte muttered you slumped into our arms come on were pulling back i birgitte raised an eyebrow at her waiting for the argument it was hard to make one lying on her back mere paces from the front lines saidar had fled her and she probably couldnt take hold of it again if her life depended on it yes she said i should should check on bashere very wise birgitte said waving for the guard to help elayne back onto her horse she hesitated then you did well here elayne they know how you fought it was good for them to see they began a hurried trip through the back lines those were very shallow most soldiers were committed to the fight they needed to win before that second trolloc army arrived and that meant throwing everything they had at this force still elayne was surprised at the depleted reserves the small number that could be spared to rotate from the front and rest how long had it been the clouds had enveloped the open sky that often accompanied her that seemed a bad sign curse those clouds she muttered what time of day is it maybe two hours from sunset birgitte said light you should have made me return to camp hours ago birgitte the woman glared at her and elayne vaguely remembered attempts to do just that well no use arguing about it now elayne was recovering some of her strength and forced herself to sit straightbacked on her horse as she was led to the small valley between hills near cairhien where bashere gave battle orders she rode right up to the command post not trusting her legs to be able to support her walking and remained in the saddle as she addressed bashere is it working he looked up at her i assume i cant count on you any longer on the front too weak to channel for now im sorry you lasted longer than you should have he made a notation on his maps good thing i half think you were the only thing that kept the eastern flank from collapsing ill need to send more support that direction is it working go have a look bashere said nodding toward the hillside elayne gritted her teeth but nudged moonshadow up to where she could find a vantage she lifted her looking glass with fingers that shook far more than she would have liked the trolloc force had hit their bowed line of defenders the natural result of this had been the infantry falling back the bowl inverting as the trollocs pushed forward this had let the shadowspawn feel as if they were gaining the advantage and had stopped them from realizing the truth as they pressed forward the infantry line had wrapped up and surrounded the trolloc sides shed missed the most important moment when bashere had ordered the aiel to attack their quick sweep around to hit the trollocs from behind had worked as hoped elaynes forces had the trollocs completely surrounded an enormous circle of writhing shadowspawn fought with her encircling force pressing them together to constrict their movements and their ability to fight it was working light it was the aiel beat against the back flanks of trollocs slaughtering them the noose had been drawn which of them was blowing those horns those were trolloc horns elayne searched through the shadowspawn but could not find the ones sounding the horns she did spot some dead myrddraal near the aiel ranks one of aludras dragonsattached to its cart and pulled by a pair of horseswas with the bands horsemen they had been positioning the carts on different hilltops to fire down into the trollocs elayne birgitte said oh sorry elayne said lowering the looking glass and handing it to her warder have a look its going well elayne with a start she realized how worried the warder was elayne spun following the womans gaze south far beyond the citys walls those horns sounding theyd been so soft elayne hadnt realized they were coming from behind oh no elayne said hastily raising her looking glass there like black filth on the horizon approached the second trolloc army didnt bashere say they werent supposed to be here until tomorrow birgitte said at the earliest it doesnt matter elayne said one way or another theyre here we need to get ready to turn those dragons the other way send the order to talmanes and find lord tam althor i want the two rivers men armed and ready light the crossbowmen too we have to slow that second army any way possible bashere she thought i have to tell bashere she spun moonshadow moving so fast she became dizzy she tried to embrace the source but it wouldnt come she was so tired she had trouble gripping the reins somehow she made it down the hill without tailing off birgitte had left to convey her orders good woman elayne rode into camp to find an argument in progress wont listen to this bashere yelled i will not stand by and be insulted in my own camp man the object of his scorn was none other than tam althor the steady two rivers man glanced at elayne and his eyes opened wider as if he was surprised to see her there your majesty tam said i was told you were still out on the battlefield he turned back to bashere who grew redfaced i didnt want you going to her with enough elayne said riding moonshadow between them why was tam of all people arguing with bashere bashere the second trolloc army is almost upon us yes bashere said breathing deeply i just had word light this is a disaster elayne we need to pull out through gateways we exhausted the kinswomen on our push up here bashere elayne said most can barely channel enough now to warm a teacup let alone make a gateway light and i couldnt warm the tea she forced her voice to remain firm that was part of the plan i thats right bashere said he looked at the map let me think the city well retreat into the city and give the shadowspawn time to rest gather together and assault us elayne asked thats what theyre probably trying to force us to do i dont see any other choice bashere said the city is our only hope the city talmanes said hurrying up panting you cant be talking about pulling back into the city why not elayne asked your majesty our infantry have just managed to surround a trolloc army theyre going at it tooth and claw we have no reserves left and our cavalry is exhausted wed never manage to disengage from that contest without sustaining heavy losses and then our survivors would be holed up in the city trapped between two armies of the shadow light elayne whispered its like they planned it i think they did tam said softly not this again bashere bellowed he didnt seem like himself at all though she knew that saldaeans could have tempers bashere almost seemed like a different person his wife had stepped up to his side arms folded and both confronted tam have your say tam elayne said i bashere began but elayne held up a hand he knew your majesty tam said softly its the only thing that makes sense he hasnt been using the aiel to scout what elayne said of course he has i read the scout reports the reports are faked or at least tampered with tam said i talked to bael he said that none of his aiel had been sent on scouting duty the last few days of our march he said he thought my men had been doing it but they hadnt i talked to arganda who thought whitecloaks had been doing it but galad said that it was the band it wasnt us talmanes said frowning none of my men have been used for scout details all eyes turned to bashere who elayne asked has been watching our rear bashere i he looked up anger flaring again i have the reports somewhere i showed them to you and you approved them its all too perfect elayne said she felt a sudden chill right at the middle point of her back it spread down through her body a wave of icy wind blowing through her veins theyd been trapped perfectly channelers run to exhaustion soldiers committed to a closefought battle a second army left to approach in secret a day ahead of where falsified reports said they would be davram bashere was a darkfriend bashere is relieved of duty she said but he sputtered his wife put her hand on his arm looking at elayne with fire in her eyes bashere leveled a finger at tam i did send the two rivers men tam althor must be the culprit hes trying to distract you your majesty talmanes elayne said feeling cold to the bone have five redarms put lord bashere and his wife under guard bashere let out a string of curses elayne was surprised at how calm she felt her emotions were deadened she watched him be dragged away there wasnt time for this gather our commanders elayne said to the others galad arganda finish off that trolloc army above the city spread the word to the men throw everything we have into this battle if we cant crush the trollocs in the next hour we die here talmanes those dragons cant be much use against the trollocs now that theyre surroundedyou risk hitting our men have aludra move all of the dragon carts up on the tallest hill to pound the new enemy coming up from the south tell the ogier to make a cordon around the hill the dragons are on we cant have them damaged tam put your two rivers bowmen on the surrounding hills and have the legion of the dragon form up the front lines crossbowmen in the lead heavy cavalry behind light willing that will be enough to buy us time to finish off the surrounded trollocs it would be close light if that second army surrounded her men elayne took a deep breath then opened herself to saidar the one power flooded into her though she could hold only a trickle she could act as if she werent exhausted but her body knew the truth she would lead them anyway chapter friendly fire gareth bryne strode through the camp he had set up on the arafellin side several hundred paces on the kandor border east of the ford ignoring soldiers who tried to salute him siuan hastened at one side a messenger delivering reports at his other they were trailed by a flurry of guards and attendants carrying maps ink and paper the whole burning place shook with explosions of the power crashing racket and calamity it was like being in the middle of a rockslide hed stopped being bothered by the scent of smoke it was pervasive at least some of the fires were put out those seanchan channelers had set up by the river and were drawing out streams of water nearby a rack of polearms tumbled to the ground in a clatter as a surge of the one power hit in the camp nearby he stumbled and earth sprayed around him and siuan pebbles clattering against his helmet and breastplate keep talking man he snapped at holcom the messenger er yes my lord the spindly man had a face like a horse the aes sedai on the red green and blue hilltops are all holding the gray have fallen back and the white report that theyre running out of strength the other aes sedai will be tiring as well siuan said im not surprised that the whites are the first to admit it it wont be a point of shame to them merely another fact bryne grunted ignoring another spray of earth as it fell over them he had to keep moving the shadow had too many gateways now theyd try to strike at his command centers that was what hed do if he were them the best counter to that strategy was to not have a command center at least not one that was easy to find all things considered the battle was going according to plan it was a surprise sometimes when that happened on a battlefield you expected to have to rebuild your tactics from the ground up at every turnbut for once everything had gone smoothly aes sedai were pounding the sharans from the hilltops south of the ford augmented by a steady stream of projectiles from archers stationed just below them on the slopes because of that the shadows commander demandred himselfcouldnt devote all his troops against the defenders at the river nor could he bring all his troops against the aes sedaithey would travel awayso committing himself fully there would expose him with very little gain instead hed split his forces sending the trollocs off his right flank toward the hillsthey would sustain heavy losses but hed keep the aes sedai pressedand bringing his sharans forward to engage the bulk of the white tower troops at the river the seanchan occupied most of the enemy channelers attention this did not prevent some sharan channelers from lobbing fire at brynes camp across the river there was no use worrying about being hit he was as safe here as he would be anywhere other than perhaps retreating all the way to the white tower he couldnt stand the idea of being safe in a room somewhere miles from the battlefield light he thought thats how commanders will probably do it in the future a secure command position accessed only by gateways but a general needed to feel the flow of the battlefield he couldnt do that from miles away how well are the pikemen on each of the hills doing he demanded very well my lord said holcom as well as can be expected after hours of holding off trollocs bryne had placed defensive lines of pikemen halfway up each of the hills any trollocs that managed to get through the cordon could be picked off by archers above without having to disturb the work of the aes sedai the pikes defending the red ajah on the middle hill will be needing reinforcement soon though they lost a fair number on the last assault theyll have to hang on a bit longer those reds are nasty enough to take care of any more trollocs that break through the pike formations he hoped another explosion flattened a tent nearby how about the archer squadrons up there bryne kicked aside a fallen halberd some are getting low on arrows my lord well he couldnt do much about that he glanced toward the ford but it was a right mess of confusion it rankled him to be this close to the fighting and not know how things were going for his troops does anyone have information about whats happening at the ford he bellowed turning toward his aides i cant see a lightblasted thing just a churning of bodies and those balls of fire shooting back and forth blinding us all holcom paled those seanchan women are channeling like theyve got redhot irons up i mean theyre giving the sharans a hard time my lord our left flank just took a lot of casualties but they seem to be fighting back admirably now didnt i put joni in command of the lancers there captain shagrin is dead my lord said another messenger stepping forward he had a fresh cut on his scalp ive just come from there burn me well joni had always wanted to fall in battle bryne kept his emotions in check who commands now uno nomesta the messenger said he pulled us together after joni fell but sends warning that theyre being hardpressed light nomestas not even an officer still hed been training heavy cavalry for years and there probably wasnt a better man in the saddle than him all right get back there and tell him im giving him some reinforcements bryne turned back to holcom get over to captain denhold and have him send his cavalry reserve squadron across the ford to beef up our left flank lets see what those illianers can do we cant lose this river the messenger rushed off ill have to do something to take the pressure off those aes sedai soon he bellowed annah where are you two soldiers talking nearby were pushed aside as a heavyset young womana former merchants guard and now foot soldier and messenger serving general bryneshoved through my lord annah go beg that imperial monster of a seanchan leader if shed be ever so kind as to lend us some of her bloody cavalry shall i phrase it exactly that way annah asked saluting a smile on her lips if you do girl ill throw you off a cliff and let yukiri sedai test a few of her new falling weaves on you go the messenger grinned then dashed off toward the traveling ground for passage siuan eyed bryne youre growing grouchy youre a good influence on me he snapped glancing up as a shadow passed above he reached for his sword expecting to see another flight of draghkar instead it was only one of those seanchan flying beasts he relaxed a fireball knocked the creature from the sky it spun flapping burning wings bryne cursed jumping back as the monstrous animal crashed into the path just ahead where the messenger annah was running the animals corpse rolled over her and crashed through one of the supply tents which was filled with soldiers and quartermasters the rakeris rider slapped the ground a fraction of a moment later bryne recovered his wits and leaped forward stooping beneath a fallen section of cloth and tent poles that covered the path two of his guards found a soldier halfpinned by the dead beasts wing and pulled him free siuan kneeling and removing her angreal from her pouch to perform healing bryne moved to where annah had fallen he found her crushed where the fallen beast had rolled burn it he shoved aside thought for the dead to consider what to do next i need someone to go to the seanchan of his entourage only two guards and one clerk remained in camp he needed the seanchan to give him some more cavalry he was beginning to feel that a great deal depended on keeping those aes sedai on the hills safe after all the amyrlin was up there with them looks like were going ourselves bryne said leaving annahs corpse siuan are you strong enough to make a gateway with that angreal she stood masking her exhaustion but he could see it i can though it will be so small well have to crawl through i dont know this area well enough well have to move back to the center of camp burn me bryne said turning as a series of explosions sounded from the river we dont have time for this i can go find us some more messengers a guard said the other was helping the soldier siuan had healed the man stood on wobbly feet i dont know if there are more messengers to be had bryne said lets just tu go bryne saw min farshaw rising to her feet nearby and dusting herself off he d almost forgotten that hed set her helping as a clerk for one of the supply regiments it doesnt look like ill be clerking here in the near future min said inspecting the fallen supply tent i can run as well as any of your messengers what do you want me to do find the seanchan empress bryne said her camp is a few miles north of here on the arafellin side go to the traveling ground theyll know where to send you tell the empress she needs to send me some cavalry our reserves are depleted ill do it min said she wasnt a soldier well it seemed half of his army hadnt been soldiers until a few weeks back go he said then smiled ill count the days work toward what you owe me she blushed did she think hed let a woman forget her oath it didnt matter to him whose company she kept an oath was an oath min ran through the armys back lines the camp had more tents and carts brought in from supply dumps in tar valon or tearto replace the ones lost during the initial sharan assault those proved to be obstacles to weave around as she sought out the traveling ground the ground was a series of ropedoff squares numbered with painted planks shoved in the ground a quartet of women in gray shawls spoke together in hushed voices as one of their number held open a gateway for a supply cart laden with arrows the placid oxen didnt look up as a cometlike ball of fire hit the ground nearby hurling glowing red stones into the air and across a pile of bedrolls which began to smolder i need to go to the seanchan army min said to the grays lord brynes orders one of the gray sisters ashmanaille looked at her she took in mins breeches and curls then frowned elmindreda sweet thing what are you doing here sweet thing one of the others asked shes one of the clerks isnt she i need to go to the seanchan army min said breathing deeply from her run lord brynes orders this time they seemed to hear her one of the women sighed square four she asked the others three dear ashmanaille said a gateway could be opening to four from illian any moment three the first said waving min over a small gateway split the air there all messengers crawl she noted we have to conserve strength gateways need to be made as small as reasonable this is reasonable min thought with annoyance running to the small hole she dropped to her hands and knees and crawled through she came out in a ring of grass that had been burned black to mark its location a pair of seanchan guards stood with tasseled spears nearby their faces obscured by insectile helmets min started to walk forward but one held up a hand im a messenger from general bryne she said new messengers wait here one of the guards said its urgent new messengers wait here she received no further explanation so she crossed her armsstepping out of the black circle in case another gateway openedand waited she could see the river from here and a large military encampment stretched out along its banks the seanchan could make a big difference to this battle min thought there are so many of them she was far from the battle here a few miles north of brynes camp but still close enough to see the flashes of light as channelers traded deadly weaves she found herself fidgeting so she forced herself to remain still explosions from channeling sounded like dull thumps the sounds came after the flashes of light like thunder trailing behind lightning why was that it doesnt really matter min thought she needed cavalry for bryne at least she was doing something she had spent the last week pitching in wherever she found that an extra hand was needed it was surprising how much there was to do in a war camp other than fighting it wasnt work that had required her specifically but it was better than sitting in tear and worrying about rand or being angry at him for forbidding her to go to shayol ghul youd have been a liability there min told herself you know it he couldnt worry about saving the world and protecting her from the forsaken at the same time sometimes it was hard not to feel insignificant in a world of channelers like rand elayne and aviendha she glanced at the guards only one had an image hovering above his head a bloodied stone hed die by falling from someplace high it seemed like decades since shed seen anything hopeful around a persons head death destruction symbols of fear and darkness and who is she a slurred seanchan voice asked a suldam had approached one without a damane the woman held an adam in her hand tapping the silvery collar against her other palm new messenger the guard said she has not come through the gateways before min took a deep breath i was sent by general bryne he was supposed to clear all messengers with us the suldam said she was dark of skin with curls that came down to her shoulders the empress may she live forevermust be protected our camp will be orderly every messenger cleared no opportunities for assassins i am no assassin min said flatly and the knives in your sleeves the suldam asked min started the way your cuffs droop make it obvious child the suldam said though she was no older than min herself a woman would be a fool to walk a battlefield without some kind of weapon min said let me deliver my message to one of the generals the other messenger was killed when one of your raken was hit and fell from the sky onto our camp the suldam raised an eyebrow i am catrona she said and you will do exactly as i say while in camp she turned and waved for min to follow min hurried gratefully behind the woman as they crossed the ground the seanchan camp was very different from brynes they had raken to fly their messages and reports not to mention an empress to protect they had set their camp away from the hostilities it also looked far tidier than brynes camp which had been nearly destroyed and rebuilt and which included people from many different countries and military backgrounds the seanchan camp was homogeneous full of trained soldiers at least that was the way min decided to interpret its orderliness seanchan soldiers stood in ranks silent awaiting the call to battle sections of the camp had been marked with posts and ropes everything clearly organized nobody bustled about men walked with quiet purpose or waited at parade rest speak what criticism one would about the seanchanand min had a number of things she could add to that conversationthey certainly were organized the suldam led min to a section of camp where several men stood at ledgers set on tall desks wearing robes and bearing the halfshaved head of upper servants they quietly made notations immodestly dressed young women carrying lacquered trays threaded their way between the desks placing on them thin white cups of steaming black liquid have we lost any raken in the last little while catrona asked the men was one hit by an enemy marathdamane while in flight and could it have crashed into general brynes camp a report just came in of such a thing a servant said bowing i am surprised that you have heard of it catronas eyebrow inched a little higher as she inspected min you hadnt expected the truth min asked no the suldam said she moved her hand replacing a knife into its sheath at her side follow min let out a breath well she had dealt with aiel before the seanchan couldnt possibly be as prickly as they were catrona led the way along another path in the camp and min found herself growing anxious how long had it been since bryne had sent her was it too late light but the seanchan liked things well guarded there were two soldiers at every intersection of paths standing with raised spears watching through those awful helmets of theirs shouldnt all of these men be out fighting eventually catrona led her to an actual building they had constructed here it wasnt a tent it had walls that looked to be draped silk stretched into wooden frames a wooden floor and a ceiling covered with shingles it probably broke down quickly to be transported but it seemed frivolous the guards here were big fellows in armor of black and red they had a wicked appearance catrona passed them as they saluted her she and min entered the building and catrona bowed not to the groundthe empress wasnt in the room it appearedbut still deep since many members of the blood were inside catrona glanced at min bow you fool i think ill be fine standing min said folding her arms as she regarded the commanders inside standing at their forefront was a familiar figure mat wore silken seanchan clothingshe had heard he was in this camp but he topped it with his familiar hat he had an eyepatch covering one eye so that viewing had finally come to pass had it mat looked up at her and grinned min im a total fool she said i could have just said i knew you theyd have brought me right here without all of the fuss i dont know min mat said they rather like fuss around here dont you galgan a wideshouldered man with a thin crest of white hair on his otherwise shaven head eyed mat as if uncertain what to make of him mat min said clearing her mind general bryne needs cavalry mat grunted i dont doubt it hes been pushing his troops hard even the aes sedai man ought to be given a medal for that ive never seen one of those women budge so much as to take a step indoors when a man suggests even if shes standing in the rain first legion galgan they will do galgan said so long as the sharans dont manage to get across the ford they wont mat said bryne has set up a good defensive position that should punish the shadow with a little encouragement laero lendhae an indemela what was that galgan asked frowning min missed it too something about a flag she had been studying the old tongue lately but mat spoke it so quickly hmm what mat said youve never heard it before its a saying of the fallen army of kardia who galgan sounded baffled never mind mat said tylee would you care to lead your legion on to the battlefield assuming the good general approves i would be honored raven prince said a woman in a breastplate standing nearby four plumes rising from the helmet she held under her arm i have wanted to watch the actions of this gareth bryne more directly mat glanced to galgan who rubbed his chin inspecting his maps take your legion lieutenantgeneral khirgan as the raven prince suggests and mat added we need to watch those sharan archers theyre going to move north along the river for a better shot at brynes right flank how can you be certain its just obvious mat said tapping at the map send a raken to make sure if you want galgan hesitated then gave the order min wasnt certain that she was needed any longer so she started to walk away but mat caught her by the arm hey i could uh use you min use me she asked flatly make use of you mat said thats what i meant ive had trouble with the words coming out of my mouth lately only the stupid ones seem to make it anyway could you uh you know i dont see anything new around you she said though i assume the eye on a balance scale finally makes sense to you yes mat said wincing that one is bloody obvious what about galgan a dagger rammed through the heart of a raven bloody ashes i dont think it means you she added i cant say why galgan was speaking with some lesser nobles at least they had more hair than he did which was the seanchan mark of a lesser their tones were hushed and galgan would occasionally glance over at mat he doesnt know what to make of me mat said softly how very uncommon i cant think of anyone else who has reacted that way to you mat ha ha youre sure that bloody dagger doesnt mean me ravens well ravens kind of mean me right sometimes im the flaming prince of the bloody ravens now its not you hes trying to decide when to assassinate me mat said softly gaze narrowing toward galgan i ve been put right beneath him in the army and he worries i will supplant him tuon says hes a dedicated soldier so hell wait until after the last battle to strike thats awful i know mat said he wont play cards with me first i was hoping i could win him over lose on purpose a few times i dont think you could manage that actually i figured out how to lose bloody ages ago he seemed to be completely serious tuon says it would be a sign of disrespect if he didnt try to kill me theyre insane min theyre all bloody insane im sure egwene would help you escape if you ask mat well i didnt say they werent fun just insane he straightened his hat but if any more of them bloody well try to he cut off as the guards outside the door dropped to their knees then completely prostrated themselves on the ground mat sighed say the name of darkness and his eye is upon you yalu kazath dzamon patra daeseia asa darshi what min asked you dont know that one either mat said doesnt anyone bloody read anymore the seanchan empress stepped through the door min was surprised to see her wearing not a dress but wide silvery trousers or well maybe it was a dress min couldnt tell if those were skirts that had been divided for riding or if it was a pair of trousers with very enveloping legs fortuonas top was of tight scarlet silk and over it she wore an openfronted blue robe with a very long train it seemed the clothing of a warrior a kind of uniform the people in the room fell to their knees then bowed themselves down all the way to the floor even general galgan mat stayed standing gritting her teeth min went down on one knee the woman was the empress after all min wouldnt bow to mat or the generals but it was only proper to show respect to fortuona who is this one knotai fortuona asked curious she thinks herself high oh well mat said idly shes just the dragon reborns woman catrona who at the side of the room had bowed herself to the ground made a strangled sound she looked up at min with bulging eyes light min thought she probably thinks shes offended me or something how curious fortuona said that would make her your equal knotai of course you seem to have forgotten to bow again my father would be mortified mat said he always did pride himself on my memory you embarrass me in public again only as much as i embarrass myself he smiled then hesitated as if thinking through those words a second time the empress smiled as well though she looked distinctly predatory she moved into the room and the people rose so min climbed to her feet mat immediately began to push her toward the door mat wait min whispered just keep moving he said dont risk her deciding to snatch you up shes not particularly good at letting things go once she has them in hand he actually sounded proud saying that youre as crazy as they are min thought mat a bloody flower what he said still shoving her a bloody flower around her head min said a death lily someone is going to try to kill her very soon mat froze fortuona turned sharply min didnt realize that two guards were moving until they had her pressed against the ground they were the odd ones in the black armor though now that she was close min could see it was actually a dark green idiot she thought as they pressed her face against the floor i should have let mat pull me from the room first she hadnt made a mistake like that speaking of one of her viewings loud enough for others to hearin years what was wrong with her stop mat said let her up mat might have been elevated to the blood but the guards obviously had no problem ignoring a direct order from him how does she know this knotai fortuona asked stepping up to mat she sounded angry perhaps disappointed what is happening its not what you assume tuon mat said no dont she sees things mat continued its nothing to get all angry about its just a trick of the pattern tuon min sees visions around people like little pictures she didnt mean anything by what she said he laughed it was forced the room grew very still it was so quiet min could once again hear the explosions in the distance doomseer fortuona whispered the guards suddenly let her free backing away min groaned sitting up the guards had moved to protect the empress but one who had touched her pulled his gauntlets off and tossed them to the ground he wiped his hand against his breastplate as if trying to clean his skin of something fortuona didnt seem afraid she stepped up to min lips parting almost in awe the young empress reached out and touched mins face what he says it is true yes min said grudgingly what do you see around me fortuona said speak it doomseer i would know your omens and judge you true or false that sounded dangerous i see a bloody death lily as i told mat min said and three ships sailing an insect in the darkness red lights spread across a field that should be lush and ripe a man with the teeth of a wolf fortuona drew in a sharp breath she looked up at mat this is a great gift you have brought me knotai enough to pay your penance enough for credit beyond such a grand gift well i i dont belong to anyone min said except maybe rand and him to me fortuona ignored her standing this woman is my new soefeia doomseer truthspeaker holy woman she who may not be touched we have been blessed let it be known the crystal throne has not had a true reader of the omens for over three centuries min sat stunned until mat pulled her to her feet is that a good thing she whispered to him ill be bloody in the face if i know mat said back but you remember what i said about getting away from her well you can probably forget about that now chapter too many men lord agelmar sent us directly the arafellin said to lan the man kept glancing toward the front line where his companions fought for their lives thunder shook the battlefield here in shienar the scent of burnt flesh was pungent in the air alongside burnt hair the dreadlords didnt care if their attacks killed trollocs so long as they hit men as well youre certain lan asked from horseback of course dai shan the man said he wore his braids long the bells painted red for some reason lan did not understand something to do with the arafellin houses and their approach to the last battle if i lie let me be whipped a hundred times and left in the sun i was surprised by the order as i thought my men were to guard the flanks not only did the messenger have the proper passwords but the man i sent to the command tent returned to confirm thank you captain lan said waving for him to go back to his men he glanced at andere and prince kaisel both of whom sat nearby looking confused they had listened to lan interrogate the kandori banner leader just before this and that man had made similar assertions lord agelmar had sent them both two reserve forces sent separately neither knowing the other was going to the same place a cool breeze blew across the river to lans right as he turned and rode toward the back lines the lands heat soon smothered that coolness those clouds above seemed so close one could almost reach out and touch them lan andere asked as he and kaisel trotted their horses up beside mandarb what is this about too many men sent to plug the same hole in our lines lan said softly it is an easy mistake to make prince kaisel said the worry that the trollocs would punch through is a real one now that the dreadlords have joined the battle the general sent two banners instead of one best to be safe he probably did it intentionally no it had been a mistake a small one but a mistake the correct move would have been to pull the soldiers back and stabilize their battle lines a single banner of cavalry then could ride in and cut off the trollocs coming through two waves could have been coordinated but without giving warning to the different captains the risk was that they would trip one another upwhich was what had happened lan shook his head and scanned the battlefield queen ethenielles banner was not far away he headed straight for it the queen waited with her honor guard lord baldhere on one side the sword of kirukan held with its hilt directly toward the queen though she had chosen not to ride into battle herself lan had halfwondered if she would follow tenobias lead on that point but he shouldnt have ethenielle was a coolheaded woman more importantly shed surrounded herself with coolheaded advisors lord ramsinher new husbandspoke with a group of his commanders a slylooking fellow in the clothing of a scout brushed past lan as he rode up off to deliver orders lord agelmar didnt usually give the squadbysquad commands his concern was the overall battle he told his commanders what he wanted them to accomplish but details of how they would carry out those objectives were left up to them a stout roundfaced woman sat beside the queen speaking calmly to her she noticed lan and nodded lady serailla was the queens primary advisor lan and she had had disagreements in the past he respected her as much as he could someone he occasionally wanted to throttle and toss off a cliff dai shan the queen said nodding to him ramsin standing a little ways off gave a wave thunder rumbled there was no rain and lan didnt expect any despite the thick humidity you are wounded let me send for one of the healers they are needed elsewhere lan said tersely as her guards saluted him each man wore a green tabard over his breastplate the red horse embroidered on it and each lance trailed red and green streamers the helmets had steel facebars as opposed to lans own openfronted wide malkieri helmet might i borrow lord baldhere your majesty i have a question for him you need but make the request dai shan queen ethenielle said though lady serailla narrowed her eyes at him obviously she wondered what he needed of the kandori queens swordbearer baldhere moved up to lan shifting the sword of kirukan to his other arm to keep the hilt still pointed at his queen it was a formality but baldhere was a formal man andere and prince kaisel joined the two of them and lan did not make them fall back lord agelmar committed a good fourth of our reserves to a small opening in our lines lan said softly enough that only baldhere andere and kaisel could hear im not certain all were needed he just gave orders for our saldaean light cavalry to pull away from the eastern flank baldhere said and hit the trollocs left flank deep behind their lines a surprise hitandrun attack he says he wants the dreadlords attention spread out and claims that making our defenses appear weaker than they are will tempt them into making a mistake your thoughts lan asked its a good move baldhere said if you intend to force the battle to go long alone it wouldnt worry me too much not as long as the saldaeans can get out with their necks intact i hadnt heard about the reserves that leaves us enormously exposed on the east lets assume lan said softly carefully that one were in a position to sabotage the entire army lets assume that one wanted to do so but do it with great subtlety as to not be suspected what would you do put our back to the river baldhere said slowly claim a position for the high ground but leave us in danger of being surrounded commit us to a deadly fight then expose an opening in our defenses and let us be split make each step seem rational and your next step lan said baldhere considered looking troubled youd need to pull the archers off the hills to the east the land is rough over there and so shadowspawn could come around our scoutsparticularly with everyones eyes up toward the front linesand draw close archers would see them and raise the alarm perhaps be able to hold the trollocs back long enough for the other reserves to arrive but if the archers were moved and the eastern reserves committed and the enemy could swing around our eastern flank and attack our back lines our whole army would be pinned back against the river from there it would be only a matter of time lord mandragoran prince kaisel said nudging his horse forward he looked about as if ashamed i cant believe fm hearing this surely you dont suspect lord agelmar of betraying us we cant afford to leave anyone above suspicion lan said grimly a caution i should have listened to with a keener ear perhaps it is nothing perhaps were going to have enough difficulty getting out of this position as it is andere said frowning if we get pinned against the river the plan originally was to use the reserve light cavalry to cover the retreat lan said the infantry could retreat first crossing the river on foot then we could bring the heavy cavalry through gateways the river is not swift and the horses of the light cavalry could ford it while trollocs wouldnt dare not until they were forced it was a good enough plan unless they got pressed too hard for the foot to disengage everything would fall apart then and if they were surrounded there was no way lan would get his army out they didnt have enough channelers to move the entire army the only way out would be to leave the foot abandoning half of his army to the slaughter no hed die before he let that happen everything lord agelmar has been doing lately is a good enough plan baldhere said intensely good enough to avoid suspicion but not good enough to win lan something is wrong with him ive known him for years please i still believe that hes merely tired but he is making mistakes im right i know i am lan nodded he left lord baldhere at his post and rode with his guard toward the back lines and the command tent the sense of dread that lan felt was like a stone stuck in his throat those clouds seemed lower than before they rumbled the drums of the dark one come to claim the lives of men by the time lan reached the command tent he had a hundred good men at his back as he drew near lan spotted a young shienaran messengerunarmored topknot streaming behind him as he ranmaking for his horse at lans wave andere dashed over and caught the mans reins holding them tight the messenger frowned dai shan he asked saluting as lan rode up you are delivering orders for lord agelmar lan asked dismounting yes my lord what orders the eastern kandori archers the messenger said their hill is too far from the main part of the battlefield and lord agelmar feels they would serve better coming forward and launching volleys at those dreadlords the archers probably thought that the saldaean light cavalry were still back there the saldaeans thought the archers would stay the reserves thought that both would hold after theyd been deployed it could still be a coincidence agelmar was being worked too hard or had some greater plan that was beyond the eyes of other generals never accuse a man of a killing offense unless you were ready to kill him yourself right then with your own sword belay that order lan said cold instead send the saldaean scouts out roving through those eastern hills tell them to watch for signs of a force of shadowspawn sneaking in to strike at us warn the archers to prepare to shoot then return here and bring me word be quick about it but tell nobody but the scouts and archers themselves that you are doing it the man looked confused but he saluted agelmar was commanding general of this army but lanas dai shanhad final word on all orders and the only authority greater than his in this battle was that of elayne lan nodded to a pair of men from the high guard washim and geral were malkieri whom hed grown to respect a great deal during their weeks fighting together light has it only been weeks it feels like months he pushed the thought away as the two malkieri followed the messenger to make certain he did as told lan would consider the ramifications of what was happening only after he knew all of the facts only then loial did not know much about warfare one did not need to know much to realize that elaynes side was losing he and the other ogier fought facing a horde of thousands upon thousands of trollocsthe second army that had come up to crush from the south skirting the city crossbowmen from the legion of the dragon flanked the ogier launching volleys of quarrels having withdrawn from the front as the trollocs hit their lines the enemy had dispersed the legions heavy cavalry exhausted as they had been companies of pikemen held desperately against the tide and the wolf guard clung to a disintegrating line on the other hill hed heard fragments of what was happening on other parts of the battlefield elaynes armies had crushed the northern force of trollocs finishing them off and as the ogier fought guarding the dragons that fired from the hill above them more and more soldiers came to join the new front they came bloodied exhausted and weak this new force of trollocs would crush them the ogier sang a song of mourning it was the dirge they sang for forests that had to be leveled or for great trees that died in a storm it was a song of loss of regret of inevitability he joined in the final refrain all rivers run dry all songs must end every root will die every branch must bend he downed a snarling trolloc but another one sank its teeth into his leg he bellowed breaking off his song as he grabbed the trolloc by the neck he had never considered himself strong not by ogier standards but he lifted the trolloc and flung it into its fellows behind menfragile menwere dead all around his feet their loss of life pained him each one had been given such a short time to live some still alive still fought he knew they thought of themselves as bigger than they were but here on the battlefieldwith ogier and trollocsthey seemed like children running around underfoot no he would not see them that way the men and women fought with bravery and passion not children but heroes still seeing them broken made his ears lie back he started singing again louder and this time it was not the song of mourning it was a song he had not sung before a song of growing but not one of the tree songs that were so familiar to him he bellowed it loud and angry laying about him with his axe on all sides grass turned green cords and ribbons of life sprouted the hafts of the trolloc polearms began to grow leaves many of the beasts snarled and dropped the weapons in shock loial fought on this song was not a song of victory it was a song of life loial did not intend to die here on this hillside by the light he had a book to finish before he went mat stood in the seanchan command building surrounded by skeptical generals min had only just returned after being taken away and dressed in seanchan finery tuon had gone as well to see to some empressly duty looking back at the maps mat felt like cursing again maps maps and more maps pieces of paper most of them had been sketched by tuons clerks in the fading light of the previous evening how could he know they were accurate mat had once seen a street artist drawing a pretty woman at night in caemlyn and the resulting picture could have been sold for gold as a deadon representation of cenn buie in a dress more and more he was thinking that battle maps were about as useful as a heavy coat in tear he needed to be able to see the battle not how someone else thought the battle looked the map was too simple im going out to look at the battlefield mat declared youre what courtani asked the seanchan bannergeneral was about as pretty as a bundle of sticks with armor bolted to it mat figured she must have eaten something very sour once andupon finding the resulting grimace useful for frightening away birdshad decided to adopt it permanently i m going to go look at the battlefield mat said again he set aside his hat then reached up over his head and grabbed the back of his rich bulky seanchan robes he pulled the clothing awkward shoulder pieces and all over his head with a rustle of silk and lace then tossed it aside that left him clad in only his neck scarf his medallion and the strange breeches the seanchan had given him black and somewhat stiff min raised an eyebrow at his bare chest which made him blush but what did it matter she was with rand so that made her practically his sister there was courtani too but mat was not convinced that she was female he was not convinced she was human either mat dug under the table for a moment and pulled out a bundle he had stashed there earlier then straightened up min folded her arms her new clothing looked very nice on her a dress nearly as rich as the ones worn by tuon mins was a dark green shiny silk with black embroidery and wide open sleeves that were at least long enough to stick your head into they had done up her hair too sticking bits of metal into it silver with inset firedrops there were hundreds of them if this whole doomseer title did not work out for her perhaps she could find work as a chandelier she was quite fetching in the outfit actually odd mat had always considered min on the boyish side but now he found her appealing not that he looked the seanchan in the room seemed stunned that mat had suddenly stripped to the waist he did not see why they had servants that wore much less light but they did im tempted to do the same as you min muttered grabbing the front of her dress mat froze then sputtered he must have swallowed a fly or something burn me he said throwing on the shirt he dug out of the bundle ill give you a hundred tar valon marks if you do it just so i can tell the story that earned him a glare though he did not know why she was the one talking about striding about like a bloody aiel maiden on her way to the sweat tent min did not do it and he was almost sad almost he had to be careful around min he was certain that a smile in the wrong place would earn him a knifing not only from her but from tuon and mat was much happier with only one knife stuck in him at a time the foxhead medallion rested comfortably against his skinthank the light tuon had understood that he did need itas he tossed on his coat also retrieved from the bundle how did you retain those captaingeneral galgan asked i was under the impression that your clothing had been burned raven prince galgan looked very silly with that one strip of white hair on his head but mat did not mention this it was the seanchan way folk could be funny but he didnt doubt galgan could handle himself in a battle however he looked these mat said gesturing to his coat and shirt i really have no idea they were just down there im completely baffled he had been very pleased to learn that seanchan guardsfor all their stoic expressions and toostraight backsresponded to bribes like other people all but those deathwatch guards mat had learned not to try it with them the glare theyd given him made him think that if he tried it again hed end up with his face in the mud perhaps it would be better not to even talk to a deathwatch guard again as it was quite obvious that each and every one one of them had traded his sense of humor for an oversized chin in a pinch though he knew exactly who he would trust with tuons safety mat strode out grabbing his ashandarei from against the wall as he passed courtani and min followed him out it was too bad tylee was so good at what she did mat would rather have kept her behind for company and sent the scarecrow instead maybe he should have some of the trollocs might have mistaken her for one of them he had to wait as a groom ran for pips unfortunately and that gave someone time to alert tuon he saw her approaching well she had said she would return shortly anyway so he had not really expected to avoid a confrontation min shuffled cursing softly at her skirts still trying to decide if you should run mat asked min under his breath as tuon approached yes min said sourly the beds are nice here you know and they know how to treat a fellow so long as they dont end up beheading him i still havent figured out what keeps that from happening wonderful mat turned to her you realize that if rand were here hed probably ask you to stay min glared at him its just the truth min the bloody truth i was there when rand brought them to his side and i can tell you he was worried the seanchan and aes sedai dont get along too well if you hadnt noticed thats about as obvious as your pride is mat ouch here im trying to help i tell you min how much relief do you think it would bring rand if he knew that someone he trusted had tuons ear someone who could nudge her to play nicely with the aes sedai by giving the right omens at the right time of course you could be back at the camp hauling water and running messages im sure that would be just as helpful as you would be keeping an eye on a foreign monarch and encouraging her to trust and respect the dragon reborn building a bridge of friendship between her and the rest of the nations min stood silently for a moment i hate you bloody mat cauthon thats the spirit mat said raising a hand to greet tuon now lets see which of my limbs she cuts off for throwing away her fancy clothing too bad about that nice embroidery on that robe a man needed a little embroidery to keep him refined still he was not about to wear that heap of cloth into battle he would have better luck trying to fight while carrying pips on his back the others did their usual bowing and scraping when tuon walked up though she had been gone only a few minutes mat gave her a nod she took in his clothing with a long glance up and down why was everyone so sour on a good shirt and jacket he had not chosen the ratty one he had worn to visit elayne he had burned that greatest one courtani said she was of the high blood and could address tuon directly may you always draw breath the raven prince has determined that he himself must visit the battlefield as he has judged our messengers and generals to be lacking skill mat hooked his thumbs into his belt regarding tuon as a groom finally arrived with pips about bloody time had the boy stopped for lunch along the way perhaps taken in a gleeman performance or two well why are we waiting tuon asked if the prince of the ravens wishes to see the battlefield i would think that loyal servants of the empire would have tripped over themselves in their haste to carry him there courtani looked as if she had been slapped mat grinned at tuon and she favored him with a smile light but he liked those smiles so youre coming along then he asked tuon of course you see a reason why i should not not a one mat said groaning inside not a single bloody one chapter the loss of a hill focus attention on the fades egwene said releasing a burst of air toward the trollocs climbing up the hillside the trollocs had made a gaping hole in the ranks of pikemen defending the hill and were pouring through now accustomed to assaulting channelers they squatted and braced themselves that gave egwene a good view of the fist and the myrddraal hiding at the very center it wore a brown coat over its usual clothing and held a trolloc catchpole no wonder i had trouble spotting him egwene thought destroying the creature with a weave of fire the halfman writhed shaking and screeching in the fire its eyeless face turned toward the heavens the fist of trollocs dropped as well egwene smiled in satisfaction but her pleasure was short lived her archers were getting low on arrows the pike ranks were tattered and some of the aes sedai were clearly fatigued another wave of trollocs replaced those that egwene had dropped will we be able to stand another day of this she thought a banner of lancers suddenly broke from the left flank of brynes army fighting at the river they flew the flame of tar valonthat would be the unit of heavy cavalry that bryne was proud of he had cobbled them together under captain joni shagrin out of a mix of seasoned veterans from the cavalries of other countries and those soldiers from the tower guard who wanted to join this elite fighting force the lancers skirted the sharans opposite them and rode furiously toward egwenes hills directly at the rear of the trolloc army that was assaulting her position right behind them a second cavalry unit followed in the dust of the first this one displaying the dark green banner of illian it looked like the general was finally going to send her some relief but wait egwene frowned from her vantage she could see that the main armys left flank was completely unprotected now what is he doing some some sort of trap for the sharans if there had been a trap planned the jaws did not snap shut instead a sharan cavalry unit charged into brynes exposed left flank and began to inflict heavy casualties on the foot soldiers defending that position at the river and then egwene saw another movement on the field below that really horrified heran even larger sharan cavalry banner had broken off the enemys right flank and was bearing down on the lancer unit that had come to help egwene gawyn get word to those lancersits a trap but there was no time to do anything within moments the sharan cavalry had begun slaying the white tower lancers from behind at the same time the back ranks of trollocs had turned around to face the lancer charge egwene could see that these trollocs all carried long polearms that ripped through the flesh of man and horse the front ranks of lancers went down in a bloody heap and the trollocs waded between the bodies to pull down and thrust their weapons through the cavalrymen behind egwene shouted drawing what power she could and trying to destroy that trolloc forceand the other women joined her it was a massacre on both sides there were just too many trollocs and the lancers were unprotected in minutes it was over only a few cavalrymen had managed to survive and egwene saw them riding at full bore toward the river it shook her at times the armies seemed to move at the turgid pace of enormous ships at dockand then in an instant everything would burst and entire banners would have perished she looked away from the corpses below the aes sedai positions on the hilltops had been compromised as the trollocs returned their attention toward her force egwene gave orders for gateways she had the pikemen withdraw uphill through the gateways as her archers continued to shoot projectiles into the trollocs below then egwene and the remaining aes sedai rained destruction down on the trollocs long enough to get the archers through the gateways before disappearing through the last gateway on her hill egwene gave a final look at the battlefield what had just happened she shook her head as gawyn stepped up to her side faithful as always he hadnt had an opportunity to draw his sword this battle neither had leilwin the two seemed to be having a little silent competition as to who could act as the better guard remaining right by egwenes side shed have found it annoying but it was better than gawyns sullen regret in previous battle engagements he was looking pale though as if at the start of a sickness had he been getting enough sleep i want to go to the camp and find general bryne egwene said i want to know why this was allowed to happen and then i will go to our troops defending the ford and avenge our people who just lost their lives here they both gave her frowns egwene gawyn said i have strength yet egwene said i have been using the saangreal to keep from having to work too hard the men fighting in that quarter need to see me and i must do good where i can i will take as many guards as you wish me to take gawyn hesitated glanced at leilwin then finally nodded lan dismounted and handed the reins to andere then continued past the guardswho seemed shocked to see him and his numerous guards many of them bloodiedtoward the command tent the tent was little more than an awning now open on all sides with soldiers moving in and out like ants in a hill the air was hot here in shienar today he had not received reports recently from the other battlefronts but had heard his would not be the only desperate stand today elayne fought at cairhien the amyrlin on the border of arafel light send that they were having a better time of it than lan inside the tent agelmar stood with maps on the ground all around him pointing at them with a thin pole and moving bits of colored stone around as he gave orders runners would come and give updates on the progress of battle the best battle plans lasted only until the first sword was drawn but a good general could work battles like a potter working clay taking the ebbs and flows of soldiers and molding them lord mandragoran agelmar asked looking up light man you look like the blight itself have you seen the aes sedai for healing i am well lan said how goes the battle im encouraged agelmar said if we can find some way to stall those dreadlords for an hour or two i think we actually have a fair shot of turning the trollocs back surely not lan said there are so many its not about numbers agelmar said waving lan over pointing at a map lan here is a thing that few men understand armies can and often do break when they have superior numbers superior battlefield advantage and a good chance of winning when you spend time commanding you start to think of an army as a single entity a massive beast with thousands of limbs thats a mistake an army is made up of menor in this case trollocseach one on the field each one terrified being a soldier is about keeping your terror in check the beast inside just wants to escape lan crouched down inspecting the battle maps the situation was much as hed seen it only agelmar still had the saldaean light cavalry watching the eastern flank on the map a mistake lan had confirmed for himself that they were no longer there shouldnt runners have brought agelmar word that the map was wrong or was he somehow distracting them from noticing ill show you something today lan agelmar said softly ill show you what the smallest man on the practice yard must learn if he is to survive you can make the larger enemy break if you convince him that he is going to die hit him hard enough and he will run and wont return to let you hit againeven if youre secretly too weak to hit again thats your plan then lan asked today the trollocs will break if we show them a display of force that frightens them agelmar said i know it can work im hoping that we can bring down the leader of those dreadlords if the trollocs assume theyre losing they will run they are cowardly beasts listening to agelmar made it seem plausible perhaps lan just wasnt seeing the entire picture perhaps the great captains genius was beyond what others could fathom had he done right in countermanding the order to move the archers the messenger lan had sent earlier came galloping back to the command center one of lans high guard was there too holding his own arm a blackfletched arrow stuck in it an enormous force of shadowspawn the messenger said coming in from the east dai shan you were right they knew to come in that way lan thought they couldnt have just noticed that wed exposed ourselves not with those hills blocking their view its come too quickly the shadow must have been told or must have known what to expect he looked at agelmar impossible agelmar said whats this now why didnt the scouts see it lord agelmar one of his commanders said you sent the scouts in the east back to look at the river remember they were to inspect the crossing for us you said the archers would the commander paled the archers the archers are still in their positions lan said rising i want the front lines to begin withdrawing pull the saldaeans out of the fighting ready to strike to help the foot soldiers disengage pull the ashaman back well need gateways lord mandragoran agelmar said this new development can be used if we pull apart and then smash them between us we can you are relieved of duty lord agelmar lan said not looking at the man and unfortunately i must request that you remain under supervision until i can sort through what has happened the command tent grew silent every aide messenger and officer turning toward lan now lan agelmar said that sounded like you are having me arrested i am lan said motioning to the high guard they moved into the tent taking positions to keep anyone from escaping some of agelmars men did reach for swords but most looked confused and only rested their hands on the hilts this is an outrage agelmar said dont be a fool this isnt the time what would you have me do agelmar lan barked let you run this army into the ground let the shadow take us why are you doing this why youre overreacting lan agelmar said keeping his calm with obvious difficulty his eyes burning whats going through your head light why did you pull the archers off of the eastern hills because i needed them elsewhere and does that make sense lan demanded didnt you tell me that guarding that flank was vital i you drew away the scouts from that position too why they it agelmar raised a hand to his head looking dazed he looked down at the battle map and his eyes widened whats wrong with you agelmar lan said i dont know the man said he blinked staring at the maps at his feet his face adopted a look of horror eyes wide lips parting oh light what have i done pass my orders lan said urgently to his high guard bring lord baldhere to the command tent queen ethenielle and king easar as well lan you have to bring the agelmar stopped light i cant say it i start thinking about what to do and the wrong thoughts come into my head im still trying to sabotage us ive doomed us his eyes wide he reached for his shortsword sliding the blade free lan caught the sword around the guard and the blade collar stopping it just before agelmar could ram it into his stomach and end his life blood seeped between lans fingers from where one brushed the sharp edge of the blade just below the collar let me die with honor agelmar said i ive destroyed us all ive lost us this war lan not the war just the battle lan said something is wrong with you a sickness a fatigue or something of the shadow i suspect well find someone has been tampering with your mind but you are a soldier lan bellowed act like one agelmar froze he met lans eyes then nodded once lan removed his fingers from the blade and agelmar thrust it back in its sheath the great captain sat down crosslegged in the traditional shienaran meditation posture eyes closed lan strode away calling orders prince kaisel ran up to him obviously afraid whats happening lord mandragoran compulsion likely lan said weve been like rabbits in a snare with the line being drawn slowlybut snuglyaround our necks someone please tell me the ashaman still have enough strength for gateways and bring me news of the eastern flank those archers will need support commit the rest of the reserves to protecting them prince kaisel backed away as the orders continued his eyes wide his hand on his sword he looked at lord agelmar face pale weve really lost he asked lan once the orders were out messengers racing to deliver them yes lan said we have lan agelmar said suddenly opening his eyes lan turned to him queen tenobia agelmar said ive sent her into danger without understanding what id done whoever put these plans into my head wanted her dead lan swore softly bolting out of camp and up the side of the nearest hill the scouts there made room for him as he reached the top pulling his looking glass from his belt he didnt need it he found the queens flag while scanning the battlefield she was surrounded whatever support she had thought she would receive had not been sent lan opened his mouth to call orders but they died on his lips as the trollocs swarmed over the small flag of white and silver where shed been fighting it fell and in seconds he couldnt pick out a living soldier in that section of the battlefield coldness he could do nothing for tenobia it was no longer about saving individuals he would be lucky to escape this day with any semblance of an army at all mat rode with tuon south toward the battlefield along the banks of the river that was the western border of arafel of course where tuon went so did selucia and now min tuon wanted to keep her new doomseer at her side at all times tuon kept asking for viewings and min kept reluctantly explaining what she saw mat had tried to make her say she saw a hat floating around mats head that would persuade tuon to stop trying to get rid of his would it not it would have been better than min explaining about the eye on a scale and the dagger and all of the other bloody things she had seen about mat where tuon went a hundred of the deathwatch guards also went and galgan and courtani who felt chastised for not acting quickly enough to help mat furyk karede was along too leading the deathwatch guard being around karede was about as pleasant as finding another mans hand in your purse but he was a good soldier and mat respected him he would very much like to put karede and lan in a staring contest together they could be at it for years i need a better view mat said scanning the battlefield when they came within range there he turned pips and rode toward a rise close enough to where the opposing forces traded destruction at the rivers edge tuon followed him without a word when they all reached the rise he noticed selucia staring daggers at him whats wrong mat asked id have assumed you would be happy to have me back it gives you someone else to scowl at the empress will follow where you go she said so she will mat said as ill follow where she goes i suppose i hope that doesnt lead us in too many circles he inspected the combat the river was not terribly widemaybe fifty spans across but it was swiftmoving and deep on either side of the ford the water made a nice barrier and not just for trollocs the ford though made for an easy crossing the water there was kneedeep and wide enough for at least twenty files of riders to cross at the same time in the distant middle of the sharan army a man sat upon a brilliant white horse mat could barely make him out with his glass the mans glistening armor didnt seem like any mat had seen though the distance made it difficult to tell specifics i assume thats our forsaken he asked gesturing with the ashandarei he seems to be yelling for the dragon reborn galgan said demandreds voice boomed across the battlefield right then enhanced by the one power he was demanding that the dragon come and face him in a duel mat inspected the fellow through the glass demandred eh has he gone a bit dotty or what well mat knew which part of the battle to bloody stay away from he had not signed up to fight forsaken in fact so far as he remembered he had not signed up at all he had been bloody pressganged every step of the way usually by force and always by one fool woman or another egwene could deal with demandred or maybe the ashaman could rand said the ashaman were not going crazy anymore but that was a shallow promise any man who wanted to wield the one power was already crazy so far as mat considered it adding more crazy to them would be like pouring tea into an already full cup at least tuons damane had those sharan channelers occupied their firelight ripped up the ground on both riverbanks it was impossible to get a clear picture of what was going on though there was just too much confusion mat pointed his looking glass southward along the river once more and frowned there was a military camp set up just a few hundred paces opposite the ford but it wasnt the haphazard arrangement of tents that caught his attention at the eastern edge of the camp was a large body of troops and their horses just standing there he picked out a figure pacing in front of the assembly who appeared to be in a foul mood mat might have been missing an eye but it was no difficult task to recognize tylee mat lowered the looking glass he rubbed his chin adjusted his hat and set his ashandarei on his shoulder give me five minutes on my own he said then kicked pips into a gallop down the hill hoping that tuon would let him go alone for once she did though as he reached the base of the rise he could imagine her up there watching him with those curious eyes of hers she seemed to find everything he did to be interesting mat galloped alongside the river toward tylees location explosions rang out painful to the ears announcing that he had neared the heart of the battle mat nudged pips to the left and rode directly toward the pacing general tylee you lightblinded fool why are you sitting around here instead of making yourself useful highness tylee said falling to her knees we were ordered to stay here until we were called who told you to do that and get up general bryne highness she said rising he could sense the annoyance in her tone but she kept her face under control he said that we were only a reserve force and that under no circumstances were we to move from here until he gave the order he said many lives depended on it but look you can see for yourself she said gesturing toward the river the battle is not going well mat had been too caught up with tylee to see the state of affairs across the water but now he gave the field a wide sweep with his eye while the damane still seemed to be holding their own against the sharan channelers the regular troops were clearly in a bind the defenses on brynes left flank downriver had completely broken down and the soldiers there were being mobbed by sharans where was the cavalry it was supposed to be protecting the flanks and as mat had predicted sharan archers had moved out into the field and were sending arrows into brynes cavalry on the right flank it was all like a boil being squeezed and brynes troops were the boil about to pop this doesnt make any bloody sense mat said hes spinning this more and more into a disaster where is the general now tylee i cannot say highness i have people out looking for him but so far there is no word but i have reports that our side has had a major setback just south of here two large cavalry units of general brynes have been wiped out by the sharans just below the hills on the border it is said they had been sent there to relieve the marathdamane on the hilltops blood and bloody ashes mat considered this information all right tylee we cant wait around any longer heres what we are going to do have bannergeneral makoti take the second banner right up the middle he has to work his way around our troops fighting there and push back those sharans you take the third banner and swing around to the right flank take out those archers and any other goatkissers that cross your path im going to take the first banner over to the left flank and put a patch on those defenses get going tylee yes highness but surely you arent going to get so close to the battle yes i am now get going tylee please if i might make a humble suggestion highness you are unprotected let me at least give you some proper armor mat thought for a moment then agreed that her suggestion was a prudent one a person could get hurt out there what with arrows flying and blades swinging tylee called over one of her senior officers who seemed to be about the same size as mat she had the man remove his armor which was extremely colorful overlapping plates lacquered green gold and red outlined with silver the officer looked bemused when mat handed him his coat in trade saying that he expected it to be returned at the end of the day in the same condition mat put on the armor which covered his chest the back of his arms and the front of his thighs and it felt comfortable enough when the officer held out his helmet though mat ignored him merely adjusting his widebrimmed hat as he turned to tylee highness one more thing the marathdamane ill deal with those channelers personally mat said she gawked at him as if he were insane bloody ashes he probably was highness tylee said the empress she stopped when she saw mats expression let us at least send for some damane to protect you i can take care of myself just fine thank you very much those bloody women would just get in my way he grinned are you ready tylee i would really like this over with before its time for my bedtime mug of ale in response tylee turned and yelled mount up light she had a strong set of lungs with that thousands of bottoms hit their saddles producing a slapping sound that reverberated across the legion and each soldier sat at attention eyes straight ahead hed give the seanchan one thing they trained bloody good soldiers tylee barked out a series of orders turned back to mat and said on your command highness mat cried out los cabadrin words most of those assembled did not understand and yet instinctively knew to mean horsemen forward as mat spurred pips into the waters of the ford the ashandarei raised above his head he heard the ground rumble as the first banner closed ranks around him the blaring seanchan horns behind were giving the call to charge each horn pitched slightly differently from the next producing a grating dissonant sound meant to be heard at great distances ahead soldiers of the white tower glanced over their shoulders at the noise and in the seconds it took mat and the seanchan to cross the passage soldiers were flinging themselves out of the way to make room for the riders just a short veer to the left and the seanchan were suddenly in the thick of sharan cavalry which had been grinding through egwenes foot soldiers the speed of their approach enabled the seanchan vanguard to smash hard into the sharans their welltrained steeds rearing up just before crashing down on the foe with their forelegs sharans and their mounts fell many crushed as the seanchan cavalry continued their relentless forward motion the sharans appeared to know what they were about but these were heavy cavalry weighted down with burdensome armor and equipped with long lances perfect for eliminating foot soldiers with their backs up against a wall but disadvantaged against a highly mobile light cavalry in such tight quarters the first banner were a crack unit that used a wide variety of weaponry and they were trained to work in teams spears thrown by lead riders with deadly accuracy plunged into the visors of the sharans a surprising number of which went through the slits and into faces pushing through behind were riders wielding twohanded swords with curved blades slicing their weapons across the vulnerable space that separated helmets from the top of body armor or at other times slashing the vulnerable chests of armorclad sharan mounts bringing their riders to the ground other seanchan used hooked polearms to pull sharans out of the saddle while their partners swung spiked maces at the enemy denting their armor so much that movement was severely restricted and when the sharans were on the ground trying with difficulty to rise the spikers would descend on them lightly armed seanchan whose job it was to pull up visors of the fallen and thrust a narrow dagger into exposed eyes the lances of the sharans were useless under these conditionsin fact they were a hindrance and many sharans died before they could drop their lances and draw swords mat ordered one of his cavalry squadrons to ride along the waters edge until they reached the far left edge of battle and then to swing around the sharan cavalry no longer overwhelmed by sharan lances the white tower infantry on the leftcenter were able to use their pikes and halberds again and with the addition of the efforts of the seanchan second and third banners defenses were slowly reestablished at the ford it was dirty slippery work as the ground within several hundred paces of the river got beaten down and became an expanse of churnedup mud but the forces of light stood their ground mat found himself washed into the thick of the fray and his ashandarei never stopped spinning he quickly found however that his weapon was not very useful a few of his swings met with vulnerable flesh but most of the time his blade glanced off the armor of his opponents and he was forced to duck and twist in the saddle repeatedly to avoid being struck by a sharan blade mat slowly worked his way forward through the brawl and had nearly reached the back lines of sharan cavalry when he realized that three of his companions were no longer in their saddles odd they had just been there a minute ago two others stiffened up scanning from side to side and suddenly they both went up in flames screaming in agony and throwing themselves to the ground before going limp mat looked to his right just in time to see a seanchan flung back a hundred feet in the air by an unseen force when he turned back his eye met the gaze of a most beautiful woman she was oddly clad in a black silk dress that stood out from her body adorned with white ribbons she was a darkskinned beauty like tuon but there was nothing delicate about her bold high cheekbones and wide sensuous mouth lips that seemed to pout until they curved up into a smile a smile that was not meant to comfort him as she stared at him his medallion grew cold mat breathed out luck seemed to be with him so far but he did not want to press it too far any more than you wanted to press your best racehorse he would still have a healthy need of that luck in the days to come mat dismounted and walked toward her as the woman gasped trying another weave her eyes wide with amazement mat flipped the ashandarei around and spun it sweeping her feet from beneath her he brought the haft just below the blade back down to his right cracking her on the back of the head as she fell she landed facedown in the mud mat did not have time to pull her out as he was suddenly confronted by dozens of sharans ten of mats soldiers filled out around him and he pressed forward these sharans only had swords mat fended them off with spinning blade and pole and he and the seanchan fought furiously the fight became a blur of sweeping weapons his ashandarei spraying clods of mud into the air two of mats men grabbed the facedown woman before she could suffocate in the mire mat pushed forward men yelled calling for reinforcements steps taken cautiously but inevitably forward the ground was turning red sharan soldiers replaced the ones who were slain and the bodies of the fallen sank deeper in the mud soldiers often were a grim folk but each of these sharans seemed personally intent on killing himuntil the sharans stopped coming mat looked around him there were only four seanchan remaining at his side despite the chaos of the fight mat felt he saw more clearly than he had before and the lull in fighting gave him a chance to act like a commander again bind that womans hands behind her back mat said panting to the men around him and tie a cloth around her eyes so that she cant see anything he wiped the sweat from his browlight there was enough of it for a second river we are going to push our way back to the ford with our prisoner ill see if i can find a few more of those bloody damane to throw into this battle the sharans were wrong to leave only one of their channelers by herself on the battlefield but lets get out of here before any more of them show up mat shook his hand he had cracked one of his nails splitting the fine lacquer he turned to a seanchan officer one of those who had fought alongside him the man wore an expression of awe as if he were staring at the dragon bloody reborn himself mat looked down at the ground not liking the mans expression but he supposed it wasnt any worse than looking at the bloodsoaked muck littered with sharan corpses how many had mat killed highness the officer said great lord no man in the empires service would ever dare question the empress may she live forever but if a man had wondered about some of her choices he would do so no longer prince of the ravens he raised his sword prompting a cheer from those behind get yourselves some bloody polearms mat said those swords are next to useless for foot soldiers in this battle he chewed a bit off the offending fingernail then spat it to the side you fellows did well anyone see my horse pips was nearby and so taking his mounts reins he headed back toward the ford he even managed to stay out of more skirmishes for the most part that seanchan captain reminded him a little too much of talmanes and mat had enough people following him about i wonder if he plays dice mat thought idly stepping into the water his boots were good but all boots eventually leaked and his feet squished inside his stockings as he walked across the ford with pips there was a commotion far to his right on the bank what appeared to be a gathering of aes sedai channeling toward the battlefield but mat had no intention of sticking his nose into their business he had larger issues on his mind ahead mat saw a man standing by a tree dressed in voluminous pants and a familiarlooking coat he approached the man and after a brief conversation exchanged garb with him feeling good about being back in his two rivers coat mat heaved himself into the saddle legs still dripping water and rode back toward where he had left tuon his men had brought that sharan channelerby his order theyd gagged her and blindfolded her light what would he do with her shed probably end up as a damane he left his soldiers and passed the guards now set up at the base of the little rise with barely a nod the battlefield spread out in his mind no longer little drawings on paper he could see the field hear the men fighting smell the rancid breath of the enemy it was real to him now the empress selucia said as he reached the top of the rise would like to knowwith great specificityexactly why you saw fit to put yourself into the skirmish in such an irresponsible way your life is no longer your own prince of the ravens you cannot toss it aside as you once might have i had to know mat said looking out i had to feel the pulse of the battle the pulse selucia said tuon was talking through her by wiggling her fingers like some bloody maiden of the spear not speaking to him directly bad sign every battle has a pulse tuon mat said still staring into the middle distance nynaeve she would sometimes feel a persons hand to check their heartbeat and from there would know that something was wrong with their feet its the same thing step into the struggle feel its motion know it a servant with his head halfshaven stepped up to tuon whispering to her and selucia he had come from the ford mat kept looking out remembering maps but overlaying them with the real combat bryne failing to use tylee in combat exposing his defenses left flank at the ford sending his cavalry into a trap the battle opened to him and he saw tactics ten steps ahead of what was occurring it was like reading the future like what min saw only with flesh blood swords and battle drums mat grunted huh gareth bryne is a darkfriend he what min sputtered this battle is one step away from being doomed mat said turning to tuon i need absolute control of our armies right now no more arguing with galgan min i need you to send to egwene and warn her that bryne is trying to lose this battle tuon she ll need to go in person i doubt egwene will listen to anyone else everyone looked at mat with stunned expressionseveryone but tuon who gave him one of those soulshaking stares of hers the ones that had him feeling as if he were a mouse who had just been caught in an otherwise immaculately clean room that made him sweat more than the battle had come on he thought there isnt time he could see it now like a grand game of stones brynes movements were complex and subtle but the end result would be the destruction of egwenes army mat could stop it but he had to act now it is done tuon said the comment provoked almost as much surprise as mats announcement captaingeneral galgan looked as if he would rather swallow his own boots than have mat in command min found herself being led away by a group of servants and soldiers and she gave a squawk of annoyance tuon moved her horse nearer to mats i am told she said softly that in the battle moments ago you not only claimed a marathdamane for yourself but also raised one of our officers to the low blood i did mat asked baffled i dont remember that you dropped your nail at his feet oh that all right maybe i did that accidentally and the channeler bloody ashes tuon i didnt mean for her to i guess well you can have her no tuon said it is well for you to have taken one of your own you cannot train her of course but there are many suldam who will be eager for the chance it is very rare that a man captures a damane personally on the battlefield very rare indeed though i know of your particular advantage others do not this will greatly increase your reputation mat shrugged what else could he do maybe if the damane belonged to him he could let her free or something i will have the officer you raised transferred to be your personal retainer tuon said he has a good record perhaps too good he had been assigned that duty at the ford because he was considered potentially part of a faction who would have moved against us he is now spouting your praises i do not know what you did to change his opinion you seem to have a particular skill at that lets just hope i have as much skill for retrieving a victory mat grumbled this is bad tuon nobody else thinks so she said the words carefully not arguing with him really stating a fact im right anyway i wish i wasnt but i am i bloody am if you are not i will lose influence youll be fine mat said leading the way back toward the seanchan camp a few miles north at a brisk pace i may lead you wrong now and then but in the end you can be sure that im always a safe bet chapter the way of the predator perrin and gaul did another dismayed round of egwenes campat least the little of it that reflected in the wolf dream her army had been pushed far to the east and the tents had not been placed long enough at the river to reflect strongly in the wolf dream the wolves had spotted graendal here but perrin had not been able to catch her at whatever she was doing three times now slayer had tried attacking the bore and the wolves had warned perrin each time slayer had withdrawn before perrin arrived the man was testing them it was the way of the predator surveying the herd searching for the weak at least perrins plan with the wolves had worked time progressed slowly in the bore and so slayerby necessitywas slowed down as he tried to reach rand that gave perrin a chance to reach him in time we need to warn the others about graendal perrin said stopping in the center of camp she must be communicating with darkfriends in our camps perhaps we could go to those at the bore you managed to speak to nynaeve sedai maybe perrin said i dont know if it would be good to distract nynaeve again considering what she is up to perrin turned about looking at the bedrolls that flickered then vanished in the wolf dream he and gaul had checked at merrilor for a gateway but none was there currently if he wanted to go back to the waking world hed need to camp there and wait for hours it seemed like such a waste if only he could figure out how to shift back to the real world himself lanfear implied that he might be able to learn the trick but his only clue in how to do so lay in slayer perrin tried remembering the moment when the man had shifted out had perrin sensed anything a hint to how slayer did what he did he shook his head hed gone over and over that and had come to no conclusions with a sigh he quested out for the wolves any sign of heartseeker he asked hopefully the wolves sent amusement he had been asking them too frequently have you seen any camps of twolegs then perrin sent this earned a vague response wolves paid attention to men only to avoid them in the wolf dream that didnt matter much still where men congregated nightmares sometimes ran wild so the wolves had learned to keep their distance he would have liked to know how the other battles were progressing what of elaynes army perrins men lord and lady bashere perrin led gaul away they ran with quick strides rather than jumping to a place immediately perrin wanted to think the longer he remained in the wolf dream in the flesh the more he felt that he should know how to shift back his body seemed to understand that this place was not natural for it he hadnt slept here despite how long had it been he could not say they were almost at the end of their rations though he felt as though he and gaul had been here only a handful of hours part of that sensation was caused by frequent approaches to the bore to check on the dreamspike but it was generally so easy to lose track of time here there was also an ache of fatigue inside him growing stronger he didnt know if he could sleep in this place his body wanted rest but had forgotten how to find it it reminded him a little of when moiraine had dispelled their fatigue while fleeing the two rivers all that time ago two years now a very long two years perrin and gaul inspected lans camp next it was even more ephemeral than egwenes using the wolf dream for surveillance here was pointless lan moved with lots of cavalry retreating at speed he and his men did not remain in one place long enough to reflect in the wolf dream except in the most fleeting of ways there were no signs of graendal aanallein is retreating too gaul guessed surveying the rocky ground that they thought was lans camp there were no tents here just the occasional fleeting appearance of sleeping rings marked by a pole at the center where horsemen would hobble their animals gaul looked up scanning the landscape to the west if they keep falling back from here they will eventually reach the field of merrilor again perhaps that is the goal perhaps perrin said i want to visit elaynes battlefront and young bull a wolf called to him he found the voice of the sending to be familiar somehow she is here here perrin sent heartseeker come perrin grabbed gaul by the arm and shifted them far to the north graendal was at shayol ghul was she trying to break in and kill rand they arrived on a ledge overlooking the valley he and gaul went down immediately to their stomachs peering over the edge inspecting the valley an old grizzled wolf appeared beside perrin he knew this wolf he was certain of itthe scent was familiar but he could not place a name to him and the wolf did not send one where perrin whispered is she in the cavern no the grizzled wolf sent there the wolf sent an image of tents clustered in the valley just below the entrance to the cavern she had not been spotted in this valley since that first time perrin had caught her here ituraldes troops had been holding here for long enough that their tents were becoming more and more stable in the wolf dream perrin shifted carefully down below gaul and the wolf joined him as he prowled forward relying on the wolfs sending to lead him there the wolf said nodding toward a large tent at the center perrin had seen graendal here before at this tent the tent of rodel ituralde perrin froze as the tents flap rustled graendal stepped out she looked as she had before with a face like a slab of rock perrin created a thin painted wall to hide himself but he neednt have bothered graendal immediately created a gateway and stepped into the waking world it was night there though time passed at such a strange rate this close to the bore that might not mean much for the rest of the world perrin could see the same tent darkly on the other side of the gateway two domani guards out front graendal waved a hand and both stood up straighter and saluted her the gateway began to close as graendal slipped into the tent perrin hesitated then shifted to stand just in front of the gateway he had a moment to decide follow no he had to keep watch on slayer however being this close he felt something an awareness stepping through that gateway would be like like waking up the gateway snapped shut perrin felt a stab of regret but knew staying in the wolf dream had been right rand was all but defenseless against slayer here he would need perrins help we need to send warning perrin said i suppose i could take the message for you young bull sent the unnamed wolf perrin froze then spun pointing elyas i am long tooth here young bull elyas sent amusement i thought you said you didnt come here i said i avoided it this place is strange and dangerous i have enough strangeness and danger in my life in the other world the wolf sat down on his haunches but someone needed to check on you foolish pup perrin smiled elyas thoughts were a strange mix of wolf and human his way of sending was very wolflike but the way he thought of himself was too individual too human how goes the fight perrin asked eagerly gaul took up position nearby watching alert in case graendal or slayer appeared the field before them the floor of the valley was quiet for once the winds had died down the dust on the sandy ground stirring in small rifts and ripples like water i do not know of the other battlefields elyas sent and we wolves stay far from the twolegs we fight here and there at the edges of the battle mostly we have attacked the twisted ones and neverborn from the other side of the canyon where there are no twolegs except those strange aiel it is a grueling fight shadowkiller must do quick work we have stood five days but may not last many more five days here in the north much longer had passed in the rest of the world since rand entered to face the dark one rand himself was so close to the bore that it was likely only hoursmaybe minuteshad passed for him perrin could feel how time moved differently when he drew near to where rand fought ituralde perrin said scratching at his beard hes one of the great captains yes elyas sent smelling of amusement some call him little wolf bashere is with elaynes army perrin said and gareth bryne is with egwene agelmar is with the borderlanders and lan i do not know he is four battlefronts four great captains thats what shes doing graendal gaul asked yes perrin said anger gathering shes doing something to them changing their minds corrupting them i overheard her saying yes thats it im certain instead of fighting our armies with armies of her own she plans to bring down the great captains elyas do you know how a man can shift in and out of the wolf dream in the flesh even if i knew this thingwhich i do noti would not teach it to you elyas said with a growl has nobody told you it is a terrible dangerous thing that you do too many perrin said light we need to warn bashere i must perrin aybara gaul said pointing he is here perrin spun to see a dark blur streak upward toward the entrance to the pit of doom wolves whimpered and died others howled beginning the hunt this time slayer did not back away the way of the predator two or three quick lunges to determine weakness then an allout attack wake perrin called to elyas running up the incline warn elayne egwene anyone you can and if you cannot stop ituralde somehow the great captains are being corrupted one of the forsaken controls their minds and their tactics cannot be trusted i will do it young bull elyas sent fading go to rand gaul perrin roared guard the way to him do not let any of those redveils pass you perrin summoned his hammer to his hands not waiting for a reply then shifted to confront slayer rand clashed with moridin sword against sword standing before the darkness that was the essence of the dark one the cold expanse was somehow both infinite and empty rand held so much of the one power that he nearly burst he would need that strength in the fight to come for now he resisted moridin sword against sword he wielded callandor as a physical weapon fighting as if with a sword made of light itself parrying moridins attacks each step rand took dripped blood to the ground nynaeve and moiraine clung to stalagmites as if something were battering them a wind that rand could not sense nynaeve closed her eyes moiraine stared straight ahead as if determined not to look away no matter the price rand turned aside moridins latest attack the blades throwing sparks he had always been the better swordsman of the two during the age of legends he had lost his hand but thanks to tam that no longer mattered as it once might have and he was also wounded this place this place changed things rocks on the ground seemed to move and he often stumbled the air grew alternately musty and dry then humid and moldy time slipped around them like a stream rand felt as if he could see it each blow here took moments yet hours passed outside he scored moridin across the arm drawing his blood to spray against the wall my blood and yours rand said i have you to thank for this wound in my side elan you thought you were the dark one didnt you has he punished you for that yes moridin snarled he returned me to life moridin came swinging hard in a twohanded blow rand stepped backward catching the blow on callandor but he misjudged the slope of the ground either that or the slope changed on him rand stumbled the blow forcing him down on one knee blade against blade rands leg slipped backward and brushed the darkness behind which waited like a pool of ink all went black the distant ogier song was comforting to elayne as she slumped in her saddle atop the hill just north of cairhien the women around her werent in any better shape than she was elayne had gathered all of the kinswomen who could hold on to saidarno matter how weak or tiredand formed two circles with them she had twelve with her in her own circle but their collective strength in the power at the moment was barely more than that of a single aes sedai elayne had stopped channeling in an attempt to let the women recover most of them slumped in their saddles or sat on the ground in front of them extended a ragged battle line men fought desperately before the cairhienin hills trying to hold against the sea of trollocs their victory over the northern trolloc army had been shortlived as they now found themselves strungout exhausted and in serious danger of being surrounded by the southern one we almost managed arganda said from beside her shaking his head we almost made it he wore a plume in his helmet it had belonged to gallenne elayne hadnt been there when the mayener commander had fallen that was the frustrating part they were close despite basheres betrayal despite the unexpected arrival of the southern force they had almost pulled it off if shed had more time to position her men if theyd been able to catch more than a moments breather between defeating the northern army and then turning to meet this southern one but that was not the case nearby the proud ogier fought to protect the dragons but the ogier were slowly being overrun the ancient creatures had begun to collapse like felled trees pulled down by trollocs one by one their songs broke off arganda held a bloodied hand to his side palefaced barely able to speak she didnt have the strength to heal him that warder of yours is a fiend on the battlefield your majesty her arrows fly like light itself id swear arganda shook his head he might never hold a sword again even if healed he should have been sent with the other wounded somewhere there wasnt really anywhere to take them the channelers were too exhausted to make gateways her people were fracturing the aiel fought in clumps the whitecloaks nearly surrounded the wolf guard in no better shape the legion of the dragon heavy cavalry still rode but basheres betrayal had shaken them now and then a dragon fired aludra had rolled them back up to the top of the highest hill but they were out of ammunition and the channelers didnt have strength to make gateways to baerlon to fetch the new dragons eggs aludra had fired bits of armor until her powder ran low now they had only enough for the occasional shot the trollocs would push through her lines soon fragmenting her army like ravenous lions elayne watched from one of the hilltops guarded by ten of her guardswomen the rest had gone to fight trollocs broke through the aiel to the east of her position right near the dragoner hilltop position the beasts charged up the hill killing the few ogier defenders on that side roaring their victory as the dragoners pulled out sabers and grimly stood to defend elayne wasnt ready to let the dragons go yet she gathered strength through the circle women groaned around her she took up barely a dribble of the power far less than shed hoped and directed fire at the lead trollocs her attack arced in the air toward the shadowspawn she felt she was trying to stop a storm by spitting at the wind that lone ball of fire hit the earth exploded beneath it ripping the hillside and hurling dozens of trollocs back in the air elayne started causing moonshadow to shuffle beneath her arganda cursed someone rode up beside her on a large black horse emerging as if from smoke the man was of medium build and had dark curls of hair down to his shoulders logain looked thinner than she remembered from last time shed seen him his cheeks sunken but his face was still handsome logain she said shocked the ashaman gestured sharply explosions sounded all across the battlefield elayne turned to see over a hundred men in black coats marching through a large gateway on top of her hill pull those ogier back logain said his ragged voice was raw those eyes of his seemed darker now than they once had been we will hold this position elayne blinked then nodded for arganda to pass the command logain shouldnt give orders to me she thought absently for the moment she let it pass logain turned his horse and rode to the side of the hilltop looking down at her army elayne followed feeling numb trollocs fell as asha man called up strange attacks gateways that seemed tied to the ground somehow they stormed forward killing the shadowspawn logain grunted youre in bad shape she forced her mind to work the ashaman were here did rand send you we sent ourselves logain said the shadow has been planning this trap for a long time according to notes in taims study i only just managed to decipher them he looked at her we came to you first the black tower stands with the lion of andor we need to get my people out of here elayne said forcing her mind to think through the cloud of fatigue her army needed a queen mothers milk in a cup this is going to cost us shed probably lose half her force withdrawing better half than all of them ill start bringing my men back in ranks can you make enough gateways to lead us to safety that wouldnt be a problem logain said absently looking down the slope his impassive face would have impressed any warder but it will be a slaughter theres no room for a good retreat and your lines will grow weaker and weaker as you pull back the last ranks will be overwhelmed and consumed i dont see that we have any other choice elayne snapped exhausted light here help had come and she was snapping stop it she composed herself sitting up straighter i mean to say that your arrival while appreciated greatly cannot turn a battle that is this far gone a hundred ashaman cannot stop a hundred thousand trollocs on their own if we could arrange our battle lines better get at least a short rest for my men but no that is impossible we must retreatunless you can produce a miracle lord logain he smiled perhaps at her use of lord for him androl he barked a middleaged ashaman hurried over a plump aes sedai joining him pevara elayne thought too exhausted to make sense of it a red my lord the man androl asked i need to slow that army of trollocs long enough for the army to regroup and refield itself androl logain said how much will it cost us for a miracle well my lord androl said rubbing his chin that depends how many of those women sitting back there can channel it was a thing of legends elayne had heard of the great works performed by large circles of men and women every woman in the white tower was taught of these feats from the past stories of different days better days days when one half of the one power had not been a thing to fear when two halves of one whole had worked together to create incredible wonders she wasnt sure the days of legend had truly returned certainly the aes sedai during those times hadnt been so worried so desperate but what they did now left elayne in awe she joined in the circle making the total fourteen women and twelve men she barely had any strength to lend but her trickle added to the increasingly large stream more importantly a circle had to have at least one more woman than it had menand now that she had joined logain could come in last of all and add his considerable strength to the flow at the head of this circle was androl an odd choice now that she was part of the circle she could feel his relative strength he was extremely weak weaker than many women who were turned away from the tower refused the shawl because of their lack of innate talent elayne and the others had relocated to the far side of the battlefield the rest of the ashaman held back the attacking trolloc horde as androl prepared whatever he did it would need to be swift elayne still had trouble believing anything could be done even with this much power even with thirteen men and fourteen women working together light androl whispered standing between her horse and logains is this what it feels like to be one of you people how do you handle so much of the one power how do you keep it from consuming you alive burning you away pevara rested her hand on his shoulder in a gesture that was unmistakably tender elayne could barely rub two thoughts together amid her fatigue but she still found herself shocked she had not expected affection from a red for a man who could channel move the soldiers back androl said softly elayne gave the order worried the man beside her had never held this kind of power before it could go to someones head she had seen it happen light send that he knew what he was doing the soldiers and others retreated passing by elaynes group several tired ogier nodded to her in passing their shoulders slumped their arms scored with cuts the trollocs poured forward but the ashaman who werent in the circle disrupted their attack with weaves of the one power it wasnt enough though the ashaman fought well there were just so many trollocs the ashaman could not stop this tide what did logain think could be done androl smiled widely and held his hands out in front of himself as if pressing against a wall he closed his eyes three thousand years ago the lord dragon created dragonmount to hide his shame his rage still burns hot today i bring it to you your majesty a beam of light split the air easily a hundred feet tall moonshadow shied back and elayne frowned why a column of light what good would that the beam of light began to twist in the air rotating upon itself only then did elayne recognize it for the start of a gateway an enormous gateway large enough to swallow buildings she could have moved an entire wing of the caemlyn palace through that thing the air shimmered in front of them the way a gateway always looked from behind she couldnt see where the gateway was leading did they have an army waiting on the other side she could see the expressions on the slavering trolloc faces as they looked into the opening absolute horror they broke away running and elayne felt a sudden heat almost overpowering something exploded out of the gateway as if pushed by an incredible force a column of lava a hundred feet in diameter blazing hot the column broke apart as the lava crashed down splashing to the battlefield gushing forward in a river the ashaman outside the circle used weaves of air to keep it from splashing back on the circle and to shepherd it in the right direction the river of fire washed through the foremost trolloc ranks consuming them destroying hundreds in an eyeblink the lava was under pressure on the other side that was the only way she could explain the force with which it sprayed from the enormous gateway turning trollocs into cinders burning a large swath through their army androl held the gateway for long minutes as the shadows army pulled back ashaman to the sides used gusts of wind to blow the shadowspawn back into the everwidening river by the time androl finished he had created a barrier of redhot death between elaynes army and the bulk of the trollocs whose backs were against the northern walls of cairhien androl took a breath closed the gateway then pivoted and made two others in quick succession one pointing southeast the other southwest a second and third column of lava spurted forthsmaller this time as androl was obviously weakened these went tumbling over the land to the east and west of cairhien singeing away dead weeds and casting smoke into the air some of the trolloc army had pulled back but many others had perished boxed in with the walled city on one side and lava on others it would be some time before the fades could organize the survivors to resume their attacks on elaynes forces androl let the gateway close he slumped but pevara caught him one miracle my lord androl said voice soft as if strained delivered as requested that should hold them back for a few hours long enough long enough elayne said we will be able to regroup bring through supplies for the dragons and fetch as many aes sedai from mayene as we can get to heal our men and wash away their fatigue then we can sort through who is strong enough to continue and reposition our ranks for a much more effective battle you intend to keep fighting androl asked surprised yes elayne said i can barely stand but yes we cannot afford to leave that trolloc horde here intact you and your men give us an edge logain we will use it and everything we have and we will destroy them chapter a tempest of water egwene looked across the river at the struggle raging between her forces and the sharan army she had arrived back at her camp on the arafellin side of the ford she was itching to join the battle against the shadow again but she also needed to talk with bryne about what had happened at the hills she had arrived to find the command tent empty the camp continued to fill with aes sedai and the surviving archers and pikemen who were coming through gateways from the hilltops to the south the aes sedai were milling about and speaking to each other with some urgency they all seemed worn out but it was clear from their frequent glances toward the battle taking place across the river that they were as eager as egwene was to rejoin the fight against the shadow egwene summoned the messenger who was standing in front of the command tent get word to the sisters that they have less than an hour to rest those trollocs we were fighting will be joining the battle at the river soon now that we have left the hills shed move the aes sedai downriver on this side then attack them across the water as they moved across the fields to attack her soldiers tell the archers theyll be marching with us as well she added they may as well put their remaining arrows to good use until we can get them another supply as the messenger rushed off egwene turned to leilwin who was standing with her husband bayle domon nearby leilwin those look like seanchan cavalry troops across the river do you know anything about that yes mother they are seanchan that man standing over there she pointed to a man with shaved temples standing by a tree down toward the river he wore voluminous trousers and incongruously a tattered brown coat which looked as if it might have come from the two rivers he told me that a legion commanded by lieutenantgeneral khirgan had come from the seanchan camp and that they had been summoned by general bryne he also said that they do be accompanied by the prince of ravens domon interjected mat he did more than accompany them he do be leading one of the cavalry banners the ones giving the sharans a hiding on our armys left flank he got there just in time our pikemen were getting the worst of it before he showed up egwene gawyn said pointing to the south a few hundred paces below the ford a small number of soldiers were hauling themselves from the river they had stripped to their smallclothes and carried swords tied to their backs it was too far to be sure but one of their leaders looked familiar is that uno egwene frowned then waved for her horse she mounted and galloped with gawyn and her guards along the river to where the men lay gasping on the bank and the sound of one man cursing filled the air uno its about bloody flaming time someone came uno stood as he saluted in respect mother were in bad shape i saw egwene gritted her teeth i was in the hills when your force was attacked we did what we could but there were just too many of them how did you get out how did we flaming get out mother when the men started dropping all around us and we figured we was goners we flaming rode out of there like a flaming lightning bolt had struck our flaming hindquarters we got to the frogkissing river on the run stripped and jumped in swimming for all we were bloody worth mother with all due respect unos topknot danced as he continued to blaspheme and egwene could have sworn the eye painted on his eyepatch became a more intense red uno took a deep breath and continued a little more subdued i cant understand it mother some goatheaded messenger told us that the aes sedai on the hills were in trouble and we needed to go up the flaming backsides of the trollocs attacking them i said whos going to mind the left flank at the river and for that bloody matter our own bloody flank when we attack the trollocs and he said that general bryne had that taken care of reserve cavalry would move up into our position at the river and the illianers would watch out for our bloody flanks some protection they were all right one flaming squadron like a flaming fly trying to fend off a flaming falcon oh they were just waiting for us like they knew we was coming no mother this cant be the fault of gareth bryne weve been tricked by some sheepgutted milkdrinking traitor with all due respect mother i cant believe that uno i just heard that general bryne had brought in a legion of seanchan cavalry maybe they were simply late getting here we sort it all out when i find the general meanwhile get your men back to camp so they can have a proper rest light knows youve earned it uno nodded and egwene galloped back toward camp using voras saangreal egwene wove air and water spinning them together a funnel of water surged up drawn from the river beneath egwene blew her tornado of water into the trollocs that were beginning their assault against her armys left flank on the kandori side of the river her tempest of water surged across them it wasnt strong enough to pull any of them into the airshe didnt have the energy for thatbut it drove them back hands to their faces behind her and the other aes sedai positioned on the arafellin side of the river archers loosed volleys of arrows into the sky those didnt darken the sky the way she would have likedthere werent so manybut they did take down more than a hundred trollocs with each wave to the side pylar and a couple of other brownsall adept with weaves of earthcaused the ground to erupt under the charging trollocs spread out next to her myrelle and a large contingent of greens wove fireballs that they lobbed over the water into bunchedup groups of trollocs many of whom continued to run a considerable distance before they collapsed engulfed in flames the trollocs howled and roared but continued their relentless progress against the defenders at the rivers edge at one point several ranks of seanchan cavalry moved out from the defensive lines and attacked the trolloc onslaught headon it happened so quickly that many of the trollocs were unable to raise their spears before contact was made large swaths of the foe in the front ranks went down the seanchan swept to the side and returned to their lines at the river egwene held to her channeling forcing herself to work through sheer exhaustion but the trollocs didnt break they grew enraged attacking the humans with a frenzy egwene could hear their yells distinctly over the sounds of wind and water the trollocs grew angry did they well they would not know anger until they had felt that of the amyrlin seat egwene pulled in more and more of the power until she was at the very edges of her ability she put heat into her tempest so that the scalding water burned trolloc eyes hands hearts she felt herself yelling voras saangreal thrust before her like a spear what seemed like hours went by eventually exhausted she allowed gawyn to talk her into pulling back for a time gawyn went to fetch her horse and as he was returning egwene looked across the river there was no doubt about it her armys left flank had already been pushed another thirty paces even with the aes sedai aid they were losing this battle it was long past time for her to find gareth bryne when egwene and gawyn got back to camp she climbed from her horse and gave it to leilwin telling her to use it to help carry the wounded there were plenty of those who had been dragged across the ford to safety bloodied soldiers slumping against the arms of friends unfortunately she hadnt the strength for healing let alone a gateway to send wounded to tar valon or mayene most of the aes sedai not busy at the riverbank didnt look as if they were doing any better egwene gawyn said softly rider seanchan looks like a noblewoman one of the blood egwene thought standing and looking through camp toward where gawyn pointed at least he had the strength left to keep a lookout why any woman would voluntarily go without a warder was beyond her the woman approaching wore fine seanchan silks and egwenes stomach turned at the sight that finery existed because of a foundation of enslaved channelers forced into obedience to the crystal throne the woman was certainly one of the blood as a contingent of deathwatch guards accompanied her you had to be very important for light gawyn exclaimed is that min egwene gaped it was min rode up scowling mother she said to egwene bowing her head amid her stonefaced guards in dark armor min are you well egwene asked careful dont give out too much information was min a captive surely she couldnt have joined the seanchan could she oh im well min said sourly ive been pampered stuffed in this outfit and offered all sorts of somewhat delicate foods i might add that among the seanchan delicate does not necessarily mean tasty you should see the things they drink egwene i ve seen them egwene said unable to keep her tone from coldness oh yes i suppose you have mother we have a problem what kind of problem well it depends on how much you trust mat i trust him to find trouble egwene said i trust him to find drinking and gambling no matter where he goes do you trust him to lead an army min asked egwene hesitated did she min leaned forward sparing a glance for the deathwatch guards who didnt seem about to let her draw any closer to egwene egwene she said softly mat thinks that bryne is leading your army to destruction he says he says he thinks bryne is a darkfriend gawyn started laughing egwene jumped she would have expected anger from him outrage gareth bryne gawyn asked a darkfriend id believe my own mother to be a darkfriend before him tell cauthon to stay out of his wifes royal brandy hes obviously had too much im inclined to agree with gawyn egwene said slowly still she could not ignore the irregularities in how the army was being led she would sort through that mat is always looking out for people who dont need to be looked out for she said hes just trying to protect me tell him that we appreciate the warning mother min said he seemed certain this isnt a joke he wants you to turn your armies over to him my armies egwene said flatly yes in the hands of matrim cauthon um yes i should mention the empress has given him command of all the seanchan forces hes now marshalgeneral cauthon taveren egwene shook her head mat is a good tactician but handing him the white towers armies no that is beyond possibility besides the armies are not mine to give himthe hall of the tower has authority for them now how can we persuade these gentlemen surrounding you that youll be safe accompanying me as little as egwene wanted to admit it she needed the seanchan she wouldnt risk their alliance to save min particularly since it didnt seem that she was in immediate danger of course if the seanchan realized that min had sworn their oaths back in falme then fled dont worry about me min said with a grimace i suppose im better off with fortuona she knows about a certain talent of mine thanks to mat and it might let me help her and you the statement was laden with meaning the deathwatch guards were too stoic to respond overtly to mins use of the empresss name but they did seem to stiffen their faces hardening take care min egwene thought youre surrounded by autumn thornweeds min didnt seem to care will you at least consider what mat is saying that gareth bryne is a darkfriend egwene said it really was laughable go back and tell mat to submit his battle suggestions to us if he must for now i need to find my commanders to plan our next steps gareth bryne where are you a flight of black arrows rose almost invisibly into the air then fell like a breaking wave they hit ituraldes army at the mouth of the pass to the valley of thakandar some bouncing off shields others finding flesh one fell inches from where ituralde stood atop a rocky outcropping ituralde didnt flinch he stood straightbacked hands clasped behind him he did however mutter letting things draw a little close arent we binde the ashaman who stood beside him in the night grimaced sorry lord ituralde he was supposed to keep the arrows away hed done well so far sometimes however he got a distant look in his face and started muttering about them trying to take his hands stay sharp ituralde said his head throbbed more dreams earlier tonight so real he had seen trollocs eating members of his family alive and had been too weak to save them he had struggled and wept as they ate tamsin and his children but at the same time had been lured by the scents of the boiling and burning flesh at the end of the dream he had joined the monsters in their feast put that from your mind he thought it was not easy to do so the dreams had been so vivid he had been glad to be awakened by a trolloc attack hed been ready for this his men lit bonfires at the barricades the trollocs had finally pushed through his thorn fortifications but their butchers bill had been high now ituraldes men fought at the mouth of the pass holding the tides back from entering the valley they had applied their time well during the days the trollocs had pushed their way through arduous barriers to the mouth of the pass the entrance to the valley was now fortified with a series of chesthigh earthen bulwarks those would be excellent for crossbowmen to use as cover if ituraldes pike formations were ever pushed back too far for now ituralde had split his army into groups of around three thousand men each then organized them into square formations of pikes billhooks and crossbows he used mounted crossbowmen as skirmishers in the front and on the flanks and had formed up a vanguardabout six ranks deep of pikemen big pikes twenty feet long hed learned from maradon that you wanted to keep your distance from the trollocs pikes worked wonderfully ituraldes pike squares could pivot and fight in all directions in case they were surrounded trollocs could be forced to fight in ranks but these squaresproperly appliedcould break up their lines once the trolloc ranks were shattered the aiel could kill with abandon behind ranks of pikemen he positioned foot soldiers carrying billhooks and halberds sometimes trollocs fought their way through the pikes pushing the weapons aside or pulling them down with the weight of corpses the billhookmen then moved upslipping between the pikemenand hamstrung the leading trollocs this gave the leading foot soldiers time to pull back and regroup while the next wave of soldiersmore foot with pikes moved up to engage the trollocs it was working so far he had a dozen such squares of troops facing the trollocs in the night they fought defensively doing whatever they could to break the surging tide the trollocs threw themselves at the pikemen trying to crack them but each square operated independently ituralde didnt worry about the trollocs that made it through the gauntlet because they would be handled by the aiel ituralde had to keep his hands clasped behind his back to conceal their shaking nothing had been the same after maradon hed learned but hed paid dearly for that education burn these headaches he thought and burn those trollocs three times he had nearly given the order to send his armies in with a direct assault abandoning the square formations he could imagine them slaughtering killing no more delaying he wanted blood each time hed stopped himself they werent here for blood they were here to hold to give that man the time he needed in the cavern that was what it was all about wasnt it why did he have so much trouble remembering that lately another wave of trolloc arrows dropped onto ituraldes men the fades had some of them stationed on the tops of the slopes above the pass in places that ituraldes own archers had once held getting them up there must have been quite an undertaking the walls of the pass were very steep how many would have dropped to their deaths making the attempt regardless trollocs werent good shots with bows but they didnt need to be when firing at armies the halberdiers raised shields they couldnt fight while holding those but they kept them strapped to their backs for need the falling arrows increased plummeting through the lightly foggy night air the storm rumbled overhead but the windfinders were at their task again keeping it away they claimed that at several moments the army had been mere breaths away from an allout storm of destruction at one point hail the size of a mans fist had fallen for about a minute before theyd wrested control of the weather again if that was what awaited them if the windfinders werent using their bowl ituralde was more than happy to leave them at their task the dark one wouldnt care how many trollocs he destroyed while sending a blizzard twister or hurricane to kill the humans they fought theyre gathering for another surge at the mouth of the pass someone yelled in the night air followed by other calls confirming it ituralde peered through the mist aided by light from the bonfires the trollocs were indeed regrouping withdraw the seventh and ninth infantry squads ituralde said theyve been at it too long pull the fourth and fifth out of reserve and have them take flanking positions prepare for more arrows and he trailed off frowning what were those trollocs doing theyd pulled back farther than hed have expected drawing into the darkness of the pass they couldnt be retreating could they a dark wave slid out of the mouth of the pass myrddraal hundreds upon hundreds of them black cloaks that did not move in defiance of the breeze faces with no eyes lips that sneered black swords the creatures moved like eels sinuous and sleek they gave no time for orders no time for response they flowed into the squares of defenders sliding between pikes whipping deadly swords aiel ituralde bellowed bring in the aiel all of them and channelers everyone except for those who guard at the pit of doom itself move move messengers scrambled away ituralde watched in horror an army of myrddraal light it was as bad as his nightmares the seventh infantry collapsed before the attack square formation shattering ituralde opened his mouth to order the primary reservethe one defending his positionto give support he needed the cavalry to ride out and draw pressure off the infantry he didnt have much cavalry hed agreed that most of the horsemen would be needed on other fronts but he did have some theyd be essential here except he squeezed his eyes shut light but he was exhausted he had trouble thinking pull back before the attack a voice seemed to be saying to him pull back to the aiel then make a stand there pull back he whispered pull something felt very very wrong about doing that why was his mind insisting upon it captain tihera ituralde tried to whisper you have command it wouldnt come out something physical seemed to be holding his mouth shut he could hear men screaming what was happening dozens of men could die fighting a single myrddraal at maradon hed lost an entire company of archersone hundred mento two fades who had slipped into the city at night his defensive squads were built to deal with trollocs to hamstring them to drop them the fades would crack those pike squares open like eggs nobody was doing what needed to be done my lord ituralde captain tihera said my lord what was it you said if they retreated the trollocs would surround them they needed to stand firm ituraldes lips opened to give the order to retreat pull the wolves wolves appeared in the fog like shadows they leaped at the myrddraal growling ituralde started spinning as a man in furs pulled himself up onto the top of the rocky outcrop tihera stumbled back calling for their guards the newcomer in furs leaped for ituralde and shoved him off the top of the rocks ituralde did not fight back whoever this man was ituralde was grateful to him feeling a moment of victory as he fell he hadnt given the order to retreat he hit the ground not far below and it knocked the wind out of him the wolves took his arms in gentle mouths and pulled him off into the darkness as he slowly drifted into unconsciousness egwene sat in the camp as the battle for the border of kandor continued her army held back the trollocs the seanchan fought alongside her troops just across the river egwene herself held a small cup of tea light it was galling she was the amyrlin but she was drained of energy she still hadnt found gareth bryne but that wasnt unexpected he moved about silviana was hunting him and should have word soon aes sedai had been sent to take the wounded to mayene the sun drooped low in the sky like an eyelid that refused to stay open egwenes hands shook as she held her cup she could still hear the battle it seemed that the trollocs would fight into the night grinding the human armies against the river distant shouts rose like the calls of an angry crowd but the explosions from the channelers had slowed she turned to gawyn he didnt seem tired at all though he was strangely pale egwene sipped her tea and silently cursed him it was unfair but she wasnt concerned with fairness right now she could grumble at her warder that was what they were for wasnt it a breeze blew through camp she was a few hundred paces east of the ford but she smelled blood in the air nearby a squad of archers drew their bows at their commanders call launching a volley of arrows a pair of blackwinged draghkar plummeted moments later hitting the ground with dull thuds just beyond camp more would come as it grew dark and they had an easier time hiding against the sky mat she felt strangely sick thinking about him he was such a blowhard a carouser leering at every pretty woman he met treating her like a painting and not a person he he he was mat once when egwene had been around thirteen hed jumped into the river to save kiem lewin from drowning of course she hadnt been drowning shed merely been dunked under the water by a friend and mat had come running throwing himself into the water to help the men of emonds field had made sport of him for months about that the next spring mat had pulled jer alhune from the same river saving the boys life people had stopped making fun of mat for a while afterward that was how mat was hed grumbled and muttered all winter about how people made sport of him insisting that next time hed just let them drown then the moment hed seen someone in danger hed gone splashing right back in egwene could remember gangly mat stumbling from the river little jer clinging to him and gasping a look of pure terror in his eyes jer had gone down without making a sound egwene had never realized that could happen people who started to drown didnt yell or sputter or call for help they just slipped under the water when everything seemed fine and peaceful unless mat was watching he came for me in the stone of tear she thought of course hed also tried to save her from the aes sedai unwilling to believe she was amyrlin so which was this was she drowning or not how much do you trust matrim cauthon min had asked light i do trust him fool that i am i do mat could be wrong he often was wrong but when he was right he saved lives egwene forced herself to stand she wavered and gawyn came to her side she patted him on the arm then stepped away from him she would not let the army see its amyrlin so weak that she had to lean against someone for support what reports do we have from the other battlefronts not much today gawyn said he frowned in fact its been rather silent elayne was supposed to fight at cairhien egwene said it was an important battle she might be too occupied to send word i want you to send a messenger by gateway i need to know how that battle is going gawyn nodded hurrying off after he was gone egwene walked at a steady pace until she found silviana who was talking with a pair of blue sisters bryne egwene asked in the mess tent silviana said i only just had word i sent a runner to tell him to stay put until you arrived come she walked over to the tent the largest shelter in camp by far and spotted him as she entered not eating but standing beside the cooks travel table with his maps spread out the table smelled of onions which had probably been cut there time and time again yukiri had a gateway open in the floor to look down on the battlefield she closed it as egwene arrived they didnt leave it open long not with the sharans watching for it and preparing weaves to send through it egwene whispered very quietly to silviana gather the hall of the tower bring back any sitters you can find get them all here to this tent as soon as you can silviana nodded her face betraying no hint of the confusion she likely felt she hastened off and egwene sat down in the tent siuan wasnt thereshe was likely helping with healing again that was good egwene wouldnt have wanted to attempt this with siuan glaring at her as it was she worried about gawyn he loved bryne like a father and already his anxiety streamed through their bond she would have to approach this very delicately and she didnt want to start until the hall had arrived she couldnt accuse bryne but she couldnt ignore mat he was a scoundrel and a fool but she trusted him light help her but she did shed trust him with her life and things had been going oddly on the battlefield the sitters gathered relatively quickly they had charge of the war effort and they met together each evening to get reports and tactical explanations from bryne and his commanders bryne didnt seem to think it odd that they came to him now he kept at his work many of the women did give egwene curious looks as they entered she nodded to them trying to convey the weight of the amyrlin seat eventually enough of them had arrived that egwene decided she should begin time was wasting she needed to dismiss mats accusations from her mind once and for all or she needed to act on them general bryne egwene said have you been well weve had a difficult time finding you he looked up and blinked his eyes were red mother he said he nodded to the sitters i feel tired but probably no more than you ive been all over the battlefield tending to all kinds of details you know how it is gawyn hurried in egwene he said his face pale trouble what i he took a deep breath general bashere turned against elayne light hes a darkfriend the battle would have been lost had the ashaman not arrived whats this bryne asked looking up from his maps bashere a darkfriend yes impossible bryne said he was the lord dragons companion for months i dont know him well but a darkfriend it couldnt be it is somewhat unreasonable to assume saerin said you can speak with the queen yourself if you wish gawyn said standing tall i heard it from her own mouth the tent stilled sitters looked to one another with worried faces general egwene said to bryne how was it that you sent two cavalry units to protect us from the trollocs on the hills south of here sending them into a trap and leaving the main armys left flank exposed how was it mother bryne asked it was obvious that you were about to be overrun anyone could see that yes i had them leave the left flank but i moved the illianer reserves into that position when i saw that sharan cavalry unit split off to attack unos right flank i sent the illianers out to intercept them it was the right thing to do i didnt know there would be so many sharans his voice had raised to a shout but he stopped and his hands were trembling i made a mistake im not perfect mother this was more than a mistake faiselle said i have just returned from speaking with uno and the other survivors of that cavalry massacre uno said he could smell a trap as soon as he and his men started riding toward the sisters but that you had promised him help i told you i sent him reinforcements i just didnt expect the sharans would send such a large force besides i had it all under control i had ordered up a seanchan cavalry legion to reinforce our troops they were supposed to take care of those sharans i had them staged across the river i just didnt expect them to be so late yes egwene said hardening her voice those menso many thousands of themwere crushed between the trollocs and the sharans with no hope for escape you lost them and all for no good reason i had to bring the aes sedai out bryne said theyre our most valuable resource pardon mother but you have made that same point to me the aes sedai could have waited saerin said i was there yes we needed outwe were being pressedbut we held and could have held longer you left thousands of good men to die general bryne and you know the worst part it was unnecessary you left all those seanchan across the ford here the ones who were going to save the day waiting for your order to attack but that order never came did it general you abandoned them just like you abandoned our cavalry but i ordered them to attack they finally went in didnt they i sent a messenger i i no if it wasnt for mat cauthon they would still be waiting on this side of the river general egwene turned away from him egwene gawyn said taking her arm what are you saying just because bryne raised a hand to his head then he sagged as if suddenly his limbs had lost their strength i dont know whats wrong with me he whispered sounding hollow i keep making mistakes mother they are the kind a man can recover from and i keep telling myself that then i make another mistake and there is more scrambling to fix it youre just tired gawyn said voice pained looking to him we all are no bryne said softly no its more than that ive been tired before this is like my instincts are suddenly wrong i give the orders then afterward i see the holes the problems i compulsion egwene said feeling cold youve been compelled theyre attacking our great captains several women in the room embraced the source how would that be possible gawyn protested egwene we have sisters watching the camp for signs of channeling i dont know how it happened egwene said perhaps it was put in place months ago before the battle began she turned to the sitters i move that the hall relieve gareth bryne as commander of our armies it is your decision sitters light yukiri said we light it must be done doesine said it is a clever move a way to destroy our armies without us seeing the trap we should have seen the great captains should have been better protected light faiselle said we need to send word to lord mandragoran and to thakandar this could involve them tooan attempt to bring down all four battlefronts at once in a coordinated attack i will see it done saerin said moving toward the tent flaps for now i agree with mother bryne must be relieved one by one the others nodded it was not a formal vote in the hall but it would do beside the table gareth bryne sat down poor man he was no doubt shaken worried unexpectedly he smiled general egwene asked thank you bryne said looking relaxed for what i feared i was losing my mind mother i kept seeing what id done i left thousands of men to die but it wasnt me it wasnt me egwene gawyn said he covered his pain well the army if bryne has been forced to lead us toward danger we need to change our command structure immediately bring in my commanders bryne said i will relinquish control to them and if they have been corrupted as well doesine asked i agree egwene said this smells of one of the forsaken perhaps moghedien lord bryne if you were to fall in this fight shed know that your commanders would be next to take charge they might have the same faulty instincts that you do doesine shook her head who can we trust any bloody man or woman we put in command could have suffered compulsion we may have to lead ourselves faiselle said getting to a man who cannot channel would be easier than a sister who would sense channeling and notice a woman with the ability we are more likely to be clean but who among us has the knowledge of battlefield tactics ferane asked i consider myself wellread enough to oversee plans but to make them we will be better than someone who may have been corrupted faiselle said no egwene said pulling herself up on gawyns arm then what gawyn asked egwene clenched her teeth then what she knew of only one man she could trust not to have been compelled at least not by moghedien a man who was immune to the effects of saidar and saidin we will have to put our armies under the command of matrim cauthon she said may the light watch over us chapter a yellow flowerspider the damane held open a hole in the floor for mat it looked down on the battlefield itself mat rubbed his chin still impressed though hed been using these holes for the last hour or so as he countered the trap that bryne had laid for egwenes armies he had sent in additional banners of seanchan cavalry to reinforce both flanks of his troops at the river and additional damane to counter the sharan channelers and stem the flood of trollocs pressing against the defenders of course this still wasnt as good as being down on the battlefield himself maybe he should go out again and do a little more fighting he glanced at tuon who sat on a thronea massive tenfoottall throneat one side of the command building tuon narrowed her eyes at him as if she could see right into his thoughts shes aes sedai mat told himself oh she cant channelshe hasnt let herself learn yet shes bloody one of them anyway and i married her she was something incredible though he felt a thrill each time she gave orders she did it so naturally elayne and nynaeve could take lessons tuon did look very nice on that throne mat let his gaze linger on her and that earned him a scowl which was downright unfair if a man couldnt leer at his wife who could he leer at mat turned back to the battlefield nice trick he said stooping down to stick his hand through the hole they were high up if he fell hed have time to hum three verses of she has no ankles that i can see before he hit maybe an extra round of the chorus this one learned it the suldam said referring to her new damane from watching the weaves of the aes sedai the suldam catrona almost choked on the words aes sedai mat couldnt blame her those could be tough words to speak he didnt look too hard at the damane nor the tattoos of flowering branches on her cheeks reaching from the back of her head like hands to cup her face mat was responsible for her being captured it was better than her fighting for the shadow wasnt it blood and bloody ashes he thought to himself you are doing a fine job of persuading tuon not to use damane matrim cauthon capturing one yourself it was unnerving how quickly the sharan woman had taken to her captivity the suldam had all remarked upon it barely a moment of struggle then complete subservience they expected a newly captured damane to take months to train properly yet this one had been ready within hours catrona practically beamed as if she were personally responsible for the sharan womans temperament that hole was remarkable mat stood right on the edge looking down at the world counting off the banners and squadrons as he marked them in his head what would classen bayor have done with one of these he wondered maybe the battle of kolesar would have turned out differently hed have never lost his cavalry in the marsh thats for certain mats forces continued to hold back the shadow at the eastern border of kandor but he was not pleased with the current situation the nature of brynes trap had been subtle as hard to see as a yellow flowerspider crouching on a petal thats how mat had known it had taken true military genius to put the army into such a bad situation without it looking like the army was in a bad situation that sort of thing didnt happen by accident mat had lost more men than he wanted to count his people were pressed up against the river and demandreddespite continuing to rave about the dragon rebornwas continually testing mats defenses trying to find a weak spot sending out a heavy cavalry raid against one side then an attack from sharan archers and a trolloc charge on the other consequently mat had to keep a close eye on demandreds movements to be able to counter them in time night was coming soon would the shadow pull back the trollocs could fight into the darkness but those sharans probably couldnt mat gave another sequence of orders and messengers galloped through gateways to deliver them it seemed like only moments passed before his troops below responded so fast mat said this will change the world general galgan said messengers can respond instantly commanders can watch their battles and plan in the moment mat grunted in agreement f bet it still takes all bloody evening to get dinner from the mess tent though galgan actually smiled it was like seeing a boulder crack in half tell me general tuon said what is your assessment of our consorts abilities i dont know where you found this one greatest one but he is a diamond of great worth i have watched him these last hours as he rescued the forces of the white tower for all of his unconventional style i have rarely seen a battle commander as gifted as he tuon did not smile but he could see from her eyes that she was pleased they were nice eyes and actually with galgan not acting so gruff perhaps this wouldnt be such a bad place to be after all thanks mat said under his breath to galgan as they both leaned over to study the field below i consider myself a man of truth my prince galgan said rubbing his chin with a callused finger you will serve the crystal throne well it would be a shame to see you assassinated too early i will make certain that the first i send after you are newly trained so that you may stop them with ease mat felt his mouth drop open the man said it with perfect frankness almost affection as if he were planning to do mat a favor by trying to kill him the trollocs here he pointed at a group of them far below will pull back soon i concur galgan said mat rubbed his chin well have to see what demandred does with them im concerned that the sharans may try to slip some of their marathdamane into our camp during the night they show a remarkable dedication to their cause or a bloody foolish disregard for selfpreservation aes sedai and suldayn werent particularly timid but they were generally cautious the sharan channelers were anything but particularly the men get me some damane to create lights for the river mat said and put the camp on lockdown with a ring of damane spaced through camp to watch for channeling nobody channels not even to light a bloody candle the aes sedai may not like this general galgan said he too hesitated upon using the words aes sedai they had started using the term instead of marathdamane by mats order one that hed expected tuon to rescind she had not figuring that woman out was going to be a real pleasure if they both survived this bloody mess tylee entered the room tall and with a scarred face the darkskinned woman walked with the confidence of a longtime soldier she prostrated herself before tuon her clothing bloodied and her armor dented her legion had taken a beating today and she probably felt like a rug did after a goodwife had been at it fm worried about our position here mat turned back and squatted down looking through the hole as hed predicted the trollocs had begun to fall back in what way general galgan asked weve run our channelers to the bone mat said and were backed up against the river a difficult position to defend longterm especially against such a huge army if they channel some gateways and move part of the sharan army to this side of the river in the night they could crush us i see what you mean galgan said shaking his head given their strength they will continue to wear us down until we are so weak they can throw a noose around us and tighten it mat looked directly at galgan i think its time we abandon this position i agree that seems to be our only reasonable course of action general galgan said nodding why not choose a battlefield more to our advantage will your friends from the white tower agree to a retreat lets see mat said straightening all the way up someone send for egwene and the sitters they will not come tuon said the aes sedai will not meet with us here i doubt this amyrlin will accept me into her camp not with the protections i would require fine mat waved toward the gateway in the floor which the damane was closing well use a gateway and talk through it like a door tuon made no specific objection so mat sent the messengers it took a little arranging but egwene seemed to like the idea well enough tuon entertained herself during the wait by having her throne moved to the other side of the roommat had no idea why she then proceeded to begin annoying min and this one tuon asked as a lanky member of the blood entered and bowed himself hell marry soon min said you will give the omen first tuon said then interpretation if you desire i know exactly what this one means min protested she had been set on a smaller throne beside that of tuon the girl was so decked in fine cloth and lace that she could have been mistaken for a mouse hiding in a bale of silk sometimes i know immediately and you will give the omen first tuon said her tone unchanged and you will refer to me as greatest one it is a high honor that you are given to speak with me directly do not let the prince of the ravens attitude prove a model for your own min quieted though she didnt look cowed shed spent too long around aes sedai to let tuon bully her that gave mat pause he had an inkling of what tuon might be capable of if she grew displeased with min he loved herlight he was pretty sure he did but he also let himself be a little afraid of her hed have to keep watch so that tuon didnt decide to educate min the omen for this man min said controlling her tone withit seemedsome difficulty is white lace trailing in a pond i know that it will mean his marriage in the near future tuon nodded she wiggled her fingers at seluciathe man they were discussing was of the low blood not of a high enough rank to speak directly to tuon his head was down so close to the ground as he bowed that it seemed that he had become fascinated with beetles and was trying to collect a specimen lord gokhan of the blood selucia voiced is to be moved to the front lines he is forbidden to marry until the end of this conflict the omens have spoken that he will live long enough to find a wife and so he will be protected min grimaced then opened her mouth probably to object that it didnt work that way mat caught her eye and shook his head and she backed down tuon brought in the next a young soldier not of the blood the woman had fair skin and not a bad face though mat couldnt see much else beneath that armor mens armor and womens armor didnt actually look much different which he found a shame mat had asked a seanchan armorer if certain areas of the female breastplate shouldnt be emphasized so to speak and the armorer had looked at him like he was a halfwit light these people had no sense of morality a fellow needed to know if he was fighting a woman on the battlefield it was only right as min gave her omens mat settled back in his chair putting his boots up on the map table and fishing in his pocket for his pipe she was rather finelooking that soldier though he could not see some of the important parts she might make a good match for talmanes that fellow spent entirely too little time looking at women he was shy around them talmanes was mat ignored the looks of those nearby as he tipped his chair back onto two legs set his heels on the table and packed his pipe seanchan could be so touchy he wasnt certain what he thought of so many seanchan women being soldiers a lot of them seemed like birgitte which wouldnt be so bad mat would rather spend an evening in the tavern with her than half the men he knew you will be executed tuon voiced through selucia speaking to the soldier mat nearly fell off of his chair he grabbed the table in front of him the chairs front legs slamming down on the ground what min demanded no you saw the sign of the white boar tuon said i dont know the meaning the boar is the symbol of one handoin one of my rivals in seanchan tuon explained patiently the white boar is an omen of danger perhaps betrayal this woman works for him or will in the future you cant just execute her tuon blinked once looking straight at min the room seemed to drop into shade feeling colder mat shivered he didnt like it when tuon got like this that stare of hers it seemed like the stare of another person a person without compassion a statue had more life to it nearby selucia wiggled her fingers at tuon tuon glanced at them then nodded you are my truthspeaker she said to min almost reluctantly you may correct me in public do you see error in my decisions yes i do min said not missing a beat you do not use my skills as you should and how should i tuon asked the soldier who had been given a death sentence continued lying prostrate she didnt objectshe was not of a rank that could address the empress she was lowly enough that speaking to someone else in tuons presence would be a breach of honor what someone may do is not grounds to kill them min said i intend no disrespect but if you are going to kill people because of what i tell you i will not speak you can be made to speak try it min said softly mat started bloody ashes she looked as cold as tuon had a moment ago let us see how the pattern treats you empress if you torture the bearer of omens instead tuon smiled you take to this well explain to me what you desire bringer of omens i will tell you my viewings min said but from now on the interpretationswhether my own or those you read into the imagesare to be kept quiet between the two of us would be best you are allowed to watch someone because of what ive said but not to punish themnot unless you catch them doing something set this woman free let it be so tuon said you are free she voiced through selucia walk in loyalty to the crystal throne you will be watched the woman bowed lower then retreated from the room head down mat caught a trickle of sweat running down the side of her face so she wasnt a statue he turned back to tuon and min they were still staring at one another no knives but he felt as if someone had been stabbed if only min would learn a little respect one of these days he was going to have to haul her away from the seanchan by her collara step in front of the headsmanhe was certain of it a gateway suddenly split the air on the side of the room where tuon had indicated it should go suddenly it occurred to mat why she had moved her throne if that damane had been captured and forced to say where tuon was sitting an aes sedai could have opened a gateway where she sat slicing her in two it was so unlikely it was laughablean aes sedai could sooner fly than kill someone who wasnt a darkfriendbut tuon took no chances the gateway opened to reveal the hall of the tower seated in a tent behind them egwene sat upon a large chair the amyrlin seat itself mat realized blood and ashes she had them fetch it egwene looked exhausted though she was doing a good job of hiding it the others were no better the aes sedai had been strained to their limits if she were a soldier hed never send her into battle blood and bloody ashesif he had a soldier with that cast to his skin and that look in his eyes mat would send the fellow to bed rest for a week we are curious to know the purpose of this meeting saerin said calmly silviana sat in a smaller chair by egwenes side and the other sisters were organized by ajah some were missing including one of the yellows by mats best guess tuon nodded to mat he was to lead this meeting he tipped his hat to her which earned him a halfraised eyebrow her dangerous look was gone although she was still empress aes sedai mat said standing up and tipping his hat to the sitters the crystal throne appreciates you coming to your bloody senses and letting us direct the battle silvianas eyes bulged as if someone had just stepped on her foot from the corner of his eye mat caught a hint of a smile on tuons lips blood and bloody ashes both women should know better than to encourage him so you are as eloquent as ever mat egwene said dryly do you still have your pet fox i do mat said hes snuggled up nice and warm take care of him egwene said i would not see you suffer gareth brynes fate so it was really compulsion mat asked egwene had sent him word as near as we can tell saerin said nynaeve sedai can see the weaves on someones mind fm told but none of the rest of us can we have our healers looking at bryne said a stocky domani aes sedai for now we cannot trust any battle plans that he touched at least not until we determine how long hes been under the shadows thumb mat nodded that sounds good also we need to withdraw our forces from the ford why lelaine demanded we have stabilized here not well enough mat said i dont like this terrain and we shouldnt have to fight where we dont want to i hesitate to give an extra inch to the shadow saerin said a pace given up now could earn us two at the dawn mat replied general galgan murmured in agreement and mat realized that hed quoted hawk wing saerin frowned the others seemed to be letting her lead the meeting egwene mostly stayed out of it fingers laced before her sitting at the back i should probably tell you saerin said that our great captain was not the only one targeted davram bashere and lord agelmar also tried to lead their respective armies to destruction elayne sedai did well in her battle destroying a large force of trollocs but she was only able to do so because of the black towers arrival the borderlanders were crushed losing nearly twothirds of their numbers mat felt a chill twothirds light they were among the best troops the light had lan lord mandragoran lives saerin said well that was something and what of that army up in the blight lord ituralde fell in battle saerin replied no one quite seems to know what happened to him this was planned very well mat said mind racing blood and bloody ashes they tried to crush all four battlefronts at once i cant imagine the amount of coordination that would take as i noted egwene said softly we must be very careful keep that fox of yours near at all times what does elayne want to do mat said isnt she in charge elayne sedai is currently helping the borderlanders saerin said she has instructed us that shienar is all but lost and is having the ashaman bring lord mandragorans army to a place of safety tomorrow she plans to move her army through gateways and hold the trollocs in the blight mat shook his head we need to make a unified stand he hesitated could we bring her through one of these gateways at least contact her there seemed to be no good objection in a short time another gateway opened in the tent with egwene and the sitters elayne strode through thick with child eyes practically on fire behind her mat caught a glimpse of soldiers with slumped postures trudging across a dim evening field light elayne said mat what is it you want youve won your battle mat asked barely but yes the trollocs in cairhien have been destroyed the city is safe as well mat nodded i need to withdraw from our position here fine elayne said perhaps we can meld your force with whats left of the borderlanders i want to do more than that elayne mat said stepping forward this ploy the shadow tried it was clever elayne bloody clever were bloodied and almost broken we dont have the luxury of fighting on multiple battlefronts anymore what then a last stand mat said softly all of us together at one place where the terrain favors us elayne quieted and someone brought her a chair to sit beside egwene she maintained the posture of a queen but her disheveled hair and clothing burned in several places indicated what shed been through mat could smell smoke coming from her battlefield where the gateway was still open that sounds desperate elayne finally said we are desperate saerin said we should ask our commanders elayne trailed off if there are any we can trust not to be under compulsion theres only one mat said grimly meeting her eyes and hes telling you we are finished if we continue as we have the earlier plan was a good enough one but after what we lost today elayne were dead unless we choose one place to stand gather together and fight one last toss of the dice elayne sat for a time where she finally asked tar valon gawyn asked no mat said theyd just besiege it and move on it cant be a city where we can get boxed in we need a territory that will work in our favor also a land that cant feed the trollocs well a place in the borderlands should work for that elayne said with a grimace lans army burned almost every city or field they passed to deny the shadow resources maps mat said waving someone get me maps we need a location in southern shienar or arafel someplace close enough that the shadow will see it as tempting a place to fight us all at once mat elayne asked wont that be giving them what they want a chance to wipe us out yes mat said softly as the aes sedai sent over maps these had markings on them notations that appeared to be in general brynes hand judging by what they said we have to be a tempting target we have to draw them in face them and either defeat them or be crushed a drawnout fight would serve the shadow once enough trollocs reached southern lands there would be no containing them he had to win or lose quickly one last toss of the dice indeed mat pointed at a location on the maps a place that bryne had annotated it had a good water supply a nice meeting of hills and rivers this place merrilor youve been using it as a supply dump saerin chuckled softly and so we go back where we began do we it does have some small fortifications elayne said the men built a palisade on one side and we could expand it its what we need mat said envisioning a battle there merrilor would put them where the two major trolloc armies could come in try to crush the humans between them that would be tempting but the terrain would be wonderful for mat to use yes it would be like the battle of the priya narrows if he put archers along those cliffsno dragonsand if he could give the aes sedai a few days of rest priya narrows he had counted on using a large river to trap the hamarean army at the mouth of the narrows but as he sprung the trap the blasted river dried up on him the hamareans had dammed it up on the other side of the narrows they had stepped right over the riverbed and got clean away thats a lesson i wont forget this will do mat said placing his hand on the map elayne let it be done elayne said i hope you know what youre doing mat as she spoke the dice started tumbling inside his head galad closed troms eyes hed searched the battlefield north of cairhien for over an hour to find him trom had bled out and only a few corners of his cloak were still white galad ripped the officers knots off his shoulder amazingly unsoiledand stood up he felt weary to the bone he started back across the battlefield passing heaps of the dead the crows and the ravens had come they blanketed the landscape behind him an undulating quivering blackness that coated the ground like mold from a distance it seemed as if the ground had been burned there were so many carrion birds occasionally galad passed men like himself who sifted through the corpses for friends there were surprisingly few lootersyou had to watch for those on a battlefield elayne had caught a few trying to sneak out of cairhien shed threatened to hang them shes grown harder galad thought trudging back toward camp his boots felt like lead on his feet that is good as a child she had often made decisions with her heart she was a queen now and acted it now if only he could right her moral compass she wasnt a bad person but galad wished that shelike other monarchscould see as clearly as he did he was beginning to accept that they didnt he was beginning to accept that it was all right so long as they tried their best whatever he had inside of him that allowed him to see the right of things was obviously a gift of the light and holding others to scorn because they had not been born with it was wrong just as it would be wrong to hold a man to scorn because he had been born with only one hand and was therefore an inferior swordsman many of the living he passed sat on the ground in the rare spots where there were no corpses and no blood these men did not look like the victors of a battle though the arrival of the ashaman had saved this day the trick with the lava had given elaynes army the breather it needed to regroup and attack that battle had been swift but brutal trollocs did not surrender and they couldnt be allowed to break and flee so galad and the others had fought bled and died long past when it was obvious they would be victorious the trollocs were dead now the remaining men sat and stared out at the blanket of corpses as if numbed by the prospect of searching out the few living among the many thousands dead the setting sun and choking clouds made the light red and gave faces a bloody cast galad eventually reached the long hill that had marked the division between the two battlefields he climbed it slowly forcing down thoughts of how good a bed would feel or a pallet on the floor or some flat rock in an outoftheway place where he could roll up in his cloak the fresher air atop the hill shocked him hed been smelling blood and death for so long that now it was the clean air that smelled wrong he shook his head walking past tired borderlanders who were trudging through gateways the ashaman had gone to hold off the trollocs to the north so lord mandragorans armies could escape from what galad heard the borderlander armies were a fraction of what they had been the betrayal of the great captains had been felt most deeply by lord mandragoran and his men it sickened galad for this battle had not gone easily for him or anyone else with elayne it had been horrible and as bad as it had been the fight had gone more poorly for the borderlanders galad kept his stomach settled with difficulty as his view from atop the hill let him see just how many carrion birds had come to feast the dark ones minions fell and the dark ones minions glutted themselves galad eventually found elayne her passionate words being spoken to tam althor and arganda took him by surprise mat is right she said the field of merrilor is a good battlefield light i wish we could give the people more time to rest well have only a few days a week at most before the trollocs reach merrilor behind us she shook her head we should have seen those sharans coming when the deck starts to look like its stacked against the dark one of course he will just add a few new cards to the game galads pride demanded that he remain standing as he listened to elayne talk to the other commanders for once however his pride lost out and he settled down on a stool and slumped forward galad elayne said you really should allow one of the ashaman to wash away your fatigue your insistence upon treating them like outcasts is foolish galad straightened up it has nothing to do with the ashaman he snapped too argumentative he was tired this fatigue reminds me of what we lost today it is an exhaustion my men must endure and so i will lest i forget just how tired they are and push them too far elayne frowned at him he had stopped worrying that his words offended her long ago it seemed he couldnt claim that a day was pleasant or his tea warm without her taking offense somehow it would have been nice if aybara hadnt run off that man was a leaderone of the few that galad had ever metthat one could actually talk to without worrying that hed take offense perhaps the two rivers would be a good place for the whitecloaks to settle of course there was something of a history of bad blood between them he could work on that i called them whitecloaks he thought to himself a moment later inside my head thats how i thought of the children just now it had been a long time since hed done that by accident your majesty arganda said he stood beside logain the leader of the ashaman and havien nurelle the new commander of the winged guard talmanes of the band of the red hand trudged up with a few commanders from the saldaeans and the legion of the dragon elder haman of the ogier sat on the ground a short distance away he stared off toward the sunset seeming dazed your majesty arganda continued i realize you consider this a great victory it is a great victory elayne said we must persuade the men to see it that way not eight hours ago i assumed that our entire army would be slaughtered we won at a cost of half of our troops arganda said softly i will count that a victory elayne insisted we were expecting complete destruction the only victor today is the butcher nurelle said softly he looked haunted no tam althor said shes right the troops have to understand what their losses earned we must treat this as a victory it must be recorded that way in the histories and the soldiers must be convinced to see it so that is a lie galad found himself saying it is not althor said we lost many friends today light but we all did focusing on death however is what the dark one wants us to do i dare you to tell me im wrong we must look and see light not shadow or well all be pulled under by winning here elayne said deliberately emphasizing the word we earn a reprieve we can gather at merrilor entrench there and make our last stand in our strength against the shadow light talmanes whispered were going to go through this again arent we yes elayne said reluctantly galad looked out over the fields of the dead then shivered merrilor will be worse light help us its going to get worse chapter the princes tabac perrin chased slayer through the skies he leaped from a churning silverblack cloud slayer a blur before him in the charred sky the air pulsed with the rhythm of lightning bolts and furious winds scent after scent assailed perrin with no logic behind them mud in tear a burning pie rotting garbage a deathlily flower slayer landed on the cloud ahead and shifted turning around in an eyeblink bow drawn the arrow loosed so quickly the air cracked but perrin managed to slap it down with his hammer he landed on the same thunderhead as slayer imagining footing beneath him and the vapors of the storm cloud became solid perrin charged forward through a churning dark gray fog the top layer of the cloud and attacked they clashed slayer summoning a shield and sword perrins hammer beat a rhythm against that shield pounding alongside the booming of thunder a crash with each blow slayer spun away to flee but perrin managed to snatch the edge of his cloak as slayer attempted to shift away perrin imagined them staying put he knew they would it was not a possibility it was they both fuzzed for a moment then returned to the cloud slayer growled then swept his sword backward shearing off the tip of his cloak and freeing himself he turned to face perrin stalking to the side sword held in wary hands the cloud trembled beneath them and a flash of phantom lightning lit the misty vapor at their feet you become increasingly annoying wolf pup slayer said youve never fought a wolf that can fight you back perrin said youve killed them from afar the slaughter was easy now youve tried to hunt a prey who has teeth slayer slayer snorted youre like a boy with his fathers sword dangerous but completely unaware of why or how to use your weapons well see who perrin began but slayer lunged sword out perrin braced himself imagining the sword growing dull the air becoming thick to slow it his skin turning hard enough to turn the weapon aside a second later perrin found himself tumbling through the air fool he thought hed focused so much on the attack that he hadnt been ready when slayer changed their footing perrin passed through the rumbling cloud breaking out into the sky below wind tugging at his clothing he prepared himself waiting for the hail of arrows to follow him down out of the cloud slayer could be so predictable no arrows came perrin fell for a few moments then cursed and twisted to see a storm of arrows shooting up from the ground below he shifted seconds before they passed through where hed been perrin appeared in the air a hundred feet to the side still falling he didnt bother to slow himself he hit the ground increasing his bodys strength to deal with the shock of the blow the ground cracked a ring of dust blew out from him the storm was far worse than it had been the ground herethey were in the south somewhere with overgrown brush and tangled vines growing up the sides of the treeswas pocked and torn lightning lashed repeatedly so frequent that he could hardly count to three without seeing a bolt there was no rain but the landscape crumbled entire hills would suddenly disintegrate the one just to perrins left dissolved like an enormous pile of dust a trail of dirt and sand streaking out into the wind perrin leaped through the debrisladen sky hunting slayer had the man shifted back up to shayol ghul no two more arrows pierced the sky heading for perrin slayer was very good at making them ignore the wind perrin slapped the arrows aside and hurled himself in slayers direction he spotted the man on a peak of rock ground crumbling to either side of him and whipping into the air perrin came down with hammer swinging slayer shifted away of course and the hammer struck stone with a sound like thunder perrin growled slayer was too quick perrin was fast too sooner or later one of them would slip one slip would be enough he caught sight of slayer bounding away and followed when perrin jumped off the next hilltop the stones shattered behind him rising up into the wind the pattern was weakening beyond that his will was much stronger now that he was here in the flesh he no longer had to worry about entering the dream too strongly and losing himself he had entered it as strongly as one could and so when perrin moved the landscape shuddered around him the next leap showed him sea ahead they had traveled much farther to the south than perrin had realized were they in illian tear slayer hit the beach where water crashed against rocks the sandif there had been anyhad been blown away the land seemed to be returning to a primal state grass ripped free soil eroded leaving only stone and crashing waves perrin landed beside slayer for once there was no shifting both men were intent on the fight the swings of hammer and sword metal clanged against metal perrin nearly landed a hit his hammer brushing slayers clothing he heard a curse but the next moment slayer was rounding from his dodge with a large axe in hand perrin braced himself and took it on the side hardening his skin the axe didnt draw blood not with perrin braced as he was but it did carry a huge amount of force behind it the blow tossed perrin out over the sea slayer appeared above him a second later plunging down with that axe perrin caught it on his hammer as he fell but the force of the blow flung him downward toward the ocean he commanded the water to recede it rushed away churning and bubbling as if pursued by a powerful wind perrin righted himself as he fell landing and cracking the stillwet rocky bottom of the bay seawater rose high to either side of him a circular wall some thirty feet high slayer crashed down nearby the man was panting from the exertion of their fight good perrins own fatigue manifested as a deep burning in his muscles im glad you were there slayer said raising his sword to his shoulder his shield vanishing i had so hoped that when i appeared to kill the dragon you would interfere what are you luc perrin asked wary shifting to the side keeping opposite slayer in the circle of stone with walls of sea what are you really slayer prowled to the side talkingperrin knewto lull his prey ive seen him you know slayer said softly the dark one the great lord as some would call him both terms are gross almost insulting understatements do you really think hell reward you perrin spat how can you not realize that once youve done what he wishes of you hell just discard you as he has so many slayer laughed did he discard the forsaken when they failed and were imprisoned with him in the bore he could have slaughtered them all and kept their souls in eternal torment did he perrin didnt reply the dark one does not discard useful tools slayer said fail him and he may exact punishment but he never discards hes like a goodwife with her balls of tangled yarn and broken teakettles hidden away in the bottoms of baskets waiting for the right moment to return them to usefulness that is where youre wrong aybara a mere human might kill a tool who succeeds fearing that the tool will threaten him that is not the dark ones way he will reward me perrin opened his mouth to reply and slayer shifted right in front of him to attack thinking him distracted perrin vanished and slayer struck only air the man spun about sword splitting the air but perrin had shifted to the opposite side small sea creatures with many arms undulated near his feet confused at the sudden lack of water something large and dark swam through the shadowy water behind slayer you never answered my question perrin said what are you im bold slayer said striding forward and im tired of being afraid in this life there are predators and there are prey often the predators themselves become food for someone else the only way to survive is to move up the chain become the hunter thats why you kill wolves slayer smiled a dangerous smile his face in shadows with the storm clouds above and the high walls of water it was dim here at the bottom though the strange light of the wolf dream pierced this place if in a muted way wolves and men are the finest hunters in this world slayer said softly kill them and you elevate yourself above them not all of us had the privilege of growing up in a comfortable home with a warm hearth and laughing siblings perrin and slayer rounded one another shadows blending lightning blasts above shimmering through the water if you knew my life slayer said youd howl the hopelessness the agony i soon found my way my power in this place i am a king he leaped across the space his form a blur perrin prepared to swing but slayer didnt draw his sword he crashed into perrin throwing them both into the wall of water the sea churned and bubbled around them darkness perrin created light somehow making the rocks at his feet glow slayer had hold of his cloak with one hand and was swinging at him in the dark water his sword trailing bubbles but moving as quickly as in the air perrin yelled bubbles coming from his mouth he tried to block but his arms moved lethargically in that frozen moment perrin tried to imagine the water not impeding him but his mind rejected that thought it wasnt natural it couldnt be in desperation slayers sword nearly close enough to bite perrin froze the water solid around both of them doing so nearly crushed him but it held slayer still for a precarious moment while perrin oriented himself he made his cloak vanish so he wouldnt take slayer with him then shifted away perrin landed on the rocky beach beside a steep hillside that was half broken away by the power of the sea he fell on hands and knees gasping water streamed from his beard his mind felt numb he had trouble thinking the water away from him to dry himself whats happening he thought trembling around him the storm raged the bark ripping from tree trunks their limbs already stripped away he was just so tired exhausted how long had it been since he slept weeks had passed in the real world but it couldnt actually have been weeks here could it it the sea boiled churning perrin turned hed kept his hammer somehow and he raised it to face slayer the waters continued to move but nothing came from them suddenly behind him the hill split in half perrin felt something heavy hit him in the shoulder like a punch he fell to his knees twisting to see the hillside broken in two slayer standing on the other side nocking another arrow to his bow perrin shifted desperate pain belatedly flaring up his side and across his body all im saying is that battles are being fought mandevwin said and we are not there battles are always being fought somewhere vanin replied leaning back against the wall outside a warehouse in tar valon faile listened to them with half an ear weve fought our share of them all im saying is that im pleased to avoid this particular one people are dying mandevwin said disapproving this is not simply a battle vanin it is tarmon gaidon itself which means nobody is paying us vanin said mandevwin sputtered paying to fight the last battle you knave this battle means life itself faile smiled as she looked over the supply ledgers the two redarms idled by the doorway as servants wearing the flame of tar valon loaded failes caravan behind them the white tower rose over the city at first she had been annoyed by the banter but the way vanin poked at the other man reminded her of gilber one of her fathers quartermasters back in saldaea now mandevwin vanin said you hardly sound like a mercenary at all what if lord mat heard you lord mat will fight said mandevwin when he has to vanin said we dont have to look these supplies are important right and someone has to guard them right here we are i just do not see why this job requires us i should be helping talmanes lead the band and you lot you should be guarding lord mat faile could almost hear the end of that line the one they were all thinking you should be guarding lord mat from those seanchan the soldiers had taken in stride mats disappearance then his reappearance with the seanchan apparently they expected this kind of behavior from lord matrim cauthon faile had a squad of fifty of the bands best including captain mandevwin lieutenant sandip and several redarms who came highly recommended by talmanes none of them knew their true purpose in guarding the horn of valere she would have brought ten times this number if she could as it was fifty was suspicious enough those fifty were the bands very best some pulled from command positions they would have to do were not going far faile thought checking the next page of the ledgers she had to look as if she were concerned about the supplies why am i so worried she needed only to carry the horn to the field of merrilor now that cauthon had finally appeared shed already run three caravans from other locations using the same guards so her current job wouldnt be suspicious in the least shed chosen the band very deliberately in the eyes of most they were just mercenaries so the least importantand least trustworthytroops in the army however for all of her complaints about matshe might not know him well but the way perrin spoke of him was enoughhe did inspire loyalty in his men the men who found their way to cauthon were like him they tried to hide from duty and preferred gambling and drinking to doing anything useful but in a pinch theyd each fight like ten men at merrilor cauthon would have good reason to check in on mandevwin and his men at that point faile could give him the horn of course she also had some members of cha faile with her as guards she wanted some people she knew for certain she could trust nearby larasthe stout mistress of the kitchens at tar valoncame out of the warehouse wagging a finger at several of the serving girls the woman walked to faile trailed by a lanky youth with a limp who was carrying a beatup chest something for you my lady laras gestured to the trunk the amyrlin herself added it to your shipment as an afterthought something about a friend of hers from back home its matrim cauthons tabac faile said with a grimace when he found that the amyrlin had a store of two rivers leaf left he insisted upon purchasing it tabac at a time like this laras shook her head wiping her fingers on her apron i remember that boy ive known a youth or two in my day like him always skulking around the kitchens like a stray wanting scraps someone ought to find something useful for him to do were working on it faile said as laras servant placed the trunk in failes own wagon she winced as he let it thump down then dusted off his hands laras nodded walking back into her warehouse faile rested her fingers on the chest philosophers claimed the pattern did not have a sense of humor the pattern and the wheel simply were they did not care they did not take sides however faile could not help thinking that somewhere the creator was grinning at her she had left home with her head full of arrogant dreams a child thinking herself on a grand quest to find the horn life had knocked those out from under her leaving her to haul herself back up she had grown up had started paying mind to what was really important and now now the pattern with almost casual indifference dropped the horn of valere into her lap she removed her hand and pointedly refusing to open the chest she had the key delivered to her separately and she would check to see that the horn was really in the chest not now not until she was alone and reasonably certain she was safe she climbed into the wagon and rested her feet on the chest i still dont like it mandevwin was saying beside the warehouse you dont like anything vanin said look the work were doing is important soldiers have to eat i suppose that is true mandevwin said it is a new voice added harnan another redarm joined them not one of the three faile noticed jumped to help the servants load the caravan eating is wonderful harnan said and if there is an expert on the subject vanin it is certainly you harnan was a sturdily built man with a wide face and a hawk tattooed on his cheek talmanes swore by the man calling him a veteran survivor of both the sixstory slaughter and hinderstap whatever those were now that wounds me harnan vanin said from behind that wounds me badly i doubt it harnan said with a laugh to wound you badly an attack would first have to penetrate through fat to reach the muscle im not sure trolloc swords are long enough for that mandevwin laughed and the three of them moved off faile went over the last few pages of the ledger then began to climb down to call for setalle anan the woman had been acting as her assistant for these caravan runs as she was climbing down however faile noticed that not all three members of the band had moved off only two of them had portly vanin still stood back there she saw him and paused vanin immediately lumbered off toward some of the other soldiers had he been watching her faile faile aravine says she has finished checking over the manifests for you we can go faile olver scrambled eagerly into the wagon seat he had insisted on joining the caravan and the members of the band had persuaded her to allow it even setalle had suggested it would be wise to bring him apparently they worried that olver would find his way to the fighting somehow if he wasnt constantly under their watch faile had reluctantly set him to running errands all right then faile said climbing back into the wagon i suppose we can be off the wagons lumbered into motion she spent the entire trip out of the city trying not to look at the chest she tried to distract herself from thinking about it but that only brought her mind to another pressing concern perrin she had seen him only briefly during a supply run to andor hed warned her he might have another duty but had been reluctant to tell her about it now hed vanished hed made tam steward in his place had taken a gateway to shayol ghul and had vanished shed asked those whod been there but nobody had seen him since his conversation with rand all would be well with him wouldnt it she was a soldiers daughter and a soldiers wife she knew not to worry overly much but a person could not help but worry a little perrin had been the one to suggest her as the keeper of the horn she wondered idly if he had done it to keep her off the battlefield she wouldnt mind terribly if hed done so though she would never tell him that in fact once this was all said and done she would insinuate that she was offended and see how he reacted he needed to know that she would not sit back and be coddled even if her true name implied otherwise faile pulled her wagon which was first in the caravan onto the jualdhe bridge out of tar valon about halfway across the bridge trembled the horses stomped and tossed their heads as faile slowed them and glanced over her shoulder the sight of swaying buildings in tar valon proved to her that the trembling wasnt just the bridge but an earthquake the other horses danced and whinnied and the shaking rattled carts we need to move off the bridge lady faile olver cried the bridge is much too long for us to get to the other side before this ends faile said calmly she had suffered earthquakes in saldaea before wed be more in danger of hurting ourselves in the scramble than we will be here this bridge is ogier work were probably safer here than wed be on solid ground indeed the earthquake passed without so much as a stone being loosed from the bridge faile brought her horses under control and started ahead again the light willing the damage to the city wasnt too bad she didnt know if earthquakes were common here with dragonmount nearby there would at least be occasional rumblings wouldnt there still the earthquake worried her people spoke of the land becoming unstable the groanings of the earth coming to match the breaking of the sky by lightning and thunder she had heard more than one account of the spiderweb cracks that appeared in rocks pure black as if they extended on into eternity itself once the rest of the caravan left the city faile pulled her wagons up beside some mercenary bands waiting their turn at an aes sedai for traveling faile could not afford to insist on preference she had to avoid attention so nerveracking though it was she settled down to wait her caravan was last in line for the day eventually aravine came up to failes wagon and olver scooted over to make room for her she patted him on the head a lot of women responded that way to olver and he did seem so innocent much of the time faile wasnt convinced she narrowed her eyes at olver as he snuggled up beside aravine mat seemed to have had a strong influence on the child fm pleased with this shipment my lady aravine said with this canvas we should have enough material to put tents over the heads of most men in the army we are still going to need leather we know that queen elayne marched her men hard and we will be getting requests for new boots faile nodded absently a gateway ahead opened to merrilor and she could see the armies still gathering over the last couple of days theyd slowly limped back to lick their wounds three battlefronts three disasters of varying degrees light the arrival of the sharans was devastating as was the betrayals of the great captains including failes own father the armies of the light had lost well over a third of their forces on the field of merrilor commanders deliberated and their soldiers repaired armor and weapons awaiting what would come a final stand will also need some more meat aravine said we should suggest some quick hunting trips using gateways over the next few days to see what we can find faile nodded it was a comfort having aravine though faile still reviewed reports and visited the quartermasters aravines careful attention made the job much easier like a good sergeant who had made certain his men were in shape before an inspection aravine faile said you havent ever taken one of the gateways to check on your family in amadicia there is nothing for me there any longer my lady aravine stubbornly refused to admit that shed been a noble before being taken by the shaido well at least she didnt act as some of the former gaishain did docile and submissive if aravine was determined to leave her past behind her then faile would gladly give her the chance it was the least she owed the woman as they talked olver climbed down to go chat with some of his uncles among the redarms faile glanced to the side as vanin rode past with two of the bands other scouts he spoke jovially to them youre misreading that look of his faile told herself theres nothing suspicious about the man youre merely jumpy because of the horn still when harnan came to ask if she needed anythinga member of the band did that every halfhourshe asked him about vanin vanin harnan said from horseback good fellow he can chew your ear off griping at times my lady but dont let that sour you hes our best scout i cant imagine how she said i mean he cant move quickly or quietly with that bulk can he hed surprise you my lady harnan said with a laugh i like to rib him but he really is skilled has he ever presented any disciplinary problems faile asked trying to choose her words fighting lifting things from other mens tents vanin harnan laughed hell borrow your brandy if you let him then return the flask mostly empty and truth be told he might have had a bit of thieving in his past but ive never known him to fight hes a good man you dont need to worry about him some thieving in his past harnan though looked like he didnt want to talk about it any further thank you she said but she remained worried harnan raised a hand to his head in a kind of salute then rode off it was three more hours before an aes sedai came to process them berisha strolled over giving the caravan a critical inspection she was hard of features and lean of figure the other aes sedai working the traveling ground had already returned to tar valon by this point and the sun was dipping toward the horizon caravan of foodstuffs and canvas berisha said examining failes ledger bound for the field of merrilor weve sent them seven caravans today so far why another i suspect the caemlyn refugees could use this as much the field of merrilor is soon going to be a site of great battle faile said keeping her temper with difficulty aes sedai did not like to be snapped at i doubt we can oversupply it berisha sniffed i say its too much the woman seemed chronically dissatisfied as if annoyed at being left out of the fighting the amyrlin disagrees with you faile replied a gateway please the hour grows late and if you want to talk about a waste why not consider how you made me march all the way out of the city and wait instead of sending me straight from the white tower grounds the hall of the tower wanted a single traveling ground for large troop or supply movements to keep better control over who entered and left tar valon faile could not blame them for the precaution even if it was frustrating sometimes bureaucracy was bureaucracy and berisha finally adopted a look of concentration in preparation for making a gateway before she could weave the gateway however the ground started to rumble not again faile thought with a sigh well there were commonly smaller quakes after an a series of sharp black crystal spikes split the ground nearby jutting upward some ten or fifteen feet one speared a redarms horse splashing blood into the air as the spike went straight through both beast and man bubble of evil harnan called from nearby other crystalline spikessome thin as a spear others wide as a personripped up through the ground faile frantically tried to control her horses they danced to the side spinning her cart nearly toppling it as she pulled on the reins around her madness ruled the spikes punched up through the ground in groups each sharp as a razor one wagon splintered as crystals destroyed its left side foodstuffs spilled to the dead grass some horses went wild and other wagons overturned the crystal spikes continued to rise appearing all over the empty field shouts rose from the nearby village at the end of the bridge from tar valon gateway faile screamed still fighting her horses do it berisha jumped back as spikes jutted out of the ground near her feet she threw a palefaced glance at them and only then did faile realize that something was moving inside the shadowy crystals it seemed like smoke a crystal spike came up through berishas foot she cried out kneeling just as a line of light split the air thank the light the woman held her weave andwith what seemed glacial slownessthe line of light rotated and opened a hole large enough for a wagon through the gateway faile shouted but her voice was lost in the commotion crystals burst from the ground very near her left tossing earth across her face her horses danced then started to gallop rather than risking complete loss of control faile steered them toward the gateway right before they went through however she pulled them to a rearing halt the gateway she shouted at the others again her voice was lost fortunately the redarms took up the call riding down the disordered line grabbing the reins of horses and steering wagons toward the gateway other men picked up those who had been tossed to the ground harnan thundered past carrying olver he was followed by sandip with setalle anan clinging to him from behind the frequency of the crystals increased one jutted up near faile and with horror she realized that the smoky movements inside had form figures of men and women screaming as if trapped inside she drew back aghast nearby the last working wagon rattled through the gateway soon the field would be nothing but crystals some straggling members of the band helped the wounded onto horses but two fell as the crystals started budding growths that shot out to the sides it was time to go aravine passed by grabbing failes reins to pull them to safety berisha faile said the aes sedai knelt beside the opening sweat trickling down her pale face faile leaped from her wagon seat grabbing the womans shoulder as aravine pulled the wagon through the gateway lets move faile said to berisha ill carry you the woman teetered then fell to the side holding her stomach faile realized with a start that blood streamed around the womans fingers berisha stared at the sky mouth working but no sounds came out my lady mandevwin galloped up i dont care where it leads we must get through what she cut off as mandevwin grabbed her by the waist and hauled her up crystals exploding nearby he galloped through the opening holding her the gateway snapped shut a moment later faile panted as mandevwin let her down she stared at where the gateway had been his words finally caught up with her i dont care where it leads he had seen something she in her panic over getting everyone to safety had not the gateway hadnt led to the field of merrilor where faile whispered joining the others who stared at the horrid landscape a sweltering heat plants covered in spots of darkness a scent of something awful in the air they were in the blight aviendha chewed on her rations crunchy rolled oats that had been mixed with honey they tasted good being near rand meant that their food stores had stopped spoiling she reached for her water flask then hesitated shed been drinking a lot of water lately she rarely stopped to think about its value had she already forgotten the lessons shed learned during her return to the threefold land to visit rhuidean light she thought raising the flask to her lips who cares its the last battle she sat on the floor of a large aiel tent in the valley of thakandar melaine chewed on her own rations close by the woman was near to term now with her twins her belly bulging beneath her dress and shawl much as a maiden was forbidden to fight while with child melaine was forbidden dangerous activity she had voluntarily gone to work in berelains healing station in mayenebut she regularly checked on the progress of the battle many of the gaishain had found their way through gateways to help as they could though all they could do was carry water or soil for the earthen mounds ituralde had ordered cast up to give the defenders some kind of protection a group of maidens ate nearby chatting with handtalk aviendha could have read it but didnt it would only make her wish she could join them shed become a wise one and had forsaken her old life that didnt mean she had purged herself of every bit of envy instead she wiped out her wooden bowl and stowed it in her pack stood up and slipped out of the tent outside the night air was cool it was about an hour before dawn and felt almost like the threefold land at night aviendha looked up at the mountain that dominated the valley despite the dark of early morning she could see the pit leading inward it had been many days since rand had entered ituralde had wandered back into camp the night before with a tale of being held by wolves and a man who claimed perrin aybara had sent him to kidnap the great captain ituralde had been taken into custody and had not complained the trollocs had not attacked the valley all day the defenders still had them held in the pass the shadow seemed to be waiting for something the light send it was not another attack by myrddraal the last one had nearly ended the resistance aviendha had rallied the channelers once the eyeless had emerged to kill the humans defending the mouth of the pass they must have realized that exposing themselves in large numbers was unwise and they fled back to the safety of the pass once the channeling began either way she felt grateful for this rare moment of rest and relative peace between attacks she stared into that pit in the mountain within which rand fought a strong pulse came from deep within it channeling in waves powerful several days on the outside but how long on the inside a day hours minutes maidens who guarded the path up to the entrance claimed that after four hours of duty theyd climb down the mountainside and find that eight hours had passed we have to hold aviendha thought we have to fight give him as much time as we can at least she knew he still lived she could sense that and his pain she looked away as she did she noticed something a woman was channeling in the camp it was faint but aviendha frowned at this hour with no fighting the only channeling should have been happening on the traveling ground and this was in the wrong direction muttering to herself she started through the camp it was probably one of the offduty windfinders again they took turns rotating in and out of the group using the bowl of the winds constantly to keep the tempest at bay that task was done atop the northern valley wall well guarded by a large force of sea folk they had to take gateways up there to change shifts when the windfinders werent on duty with the bowl they camped with the rest of the army aviendha had told them time and time again that while in the valley they were not allowed to channel for incidental reasons one would think after all the years they had spent never letting aes sedai see them use their powers that they could be more selfcontrolled if she caught another one of them using the one power to warm her tea shed send her to sorilea for an education this was supposed to be a secure camp aviendha froze in place that channeling was not coming from the small ring of tents where the windfinders made camp had she sensed an incursion a dreadlord or forsaken would probably assume thatin a camp this large filled with aes sedai windfinders and wise onesno one would notice a tiny bit of channeling here or there aviendha immediately crouched beside a nearby tent avoiding the light of a lantern on a pole the channeling came again very faint she crept forward if this turns out to be someone heating water for a bath she moved between tents across the hard earth as she drew closer she took off her boots and left them behind then pulled her dagger from its sheath she couldnt risk embracing the source lest she reveal herself to her prey the camp didnt truly sleep those warriors who were not on duty had trouble slumbering here fatigue among the spears including the maidens was becoming a problem they complained of terrible dreams aviendha continued forward silently slipping between tents avoiding those that shone with light this place disturbed all of them so she was not surprised to hear of bad dreams how could they sleep in peace so close to the dark ones abode logically she knew that the dark one was not nearby not really that wasnt what the bore was he didnt live in this place he existed outside the pattern inside his prison still bedding down here was like trying to sleep while a murderer stood beside your bed holding a knife and contemplating the color of your hair there she thought slowing the channeling stopped but aviendha was close draghkar attacks and the threat of myrddraal slipping in at night had driven the camp leaders to spread the officers throughout the camp in tents that bore no external sign of which belonged to a commander and which to a common foot soldier aviendha however knew this tent to belong to darlin sisnera darlin had official command of this battlefield now that ituralde had fallen he was not a general but the tairen army was the bulk of the defense with the defenders of the stone their elite units their commander tihera was good with tactics and darlin listened well to the mans suggestions tihera was not a great captain but he was very clever he darlin and rhuarc had been devising their battle plans following ituraldes fall in the darkness aviendha nearly missed the three figures crouched ahead of her just outside darlins tent they gestured to one another silent and she could see little about themnot even their clothing she raised her knife and then a bolt of lightning split the sky giving her a better glimpse of one the man was wearing a veil aiel they noticed the intruder too she thought stalking up to them and raising a hand to keep them from attacking she whispered i felt channeling nearby and i do not think it is from one of ours what have you seen the three men stared at her as if stunned though she couldnt make out much of their faces then they attacked her aviendha cursed leaping backward as their spears came out and one threw a knife in her direction aiel darkfriends she felt a fool she should have known better she reached out to embrace the source if a female dread lord was nearby shed feel what aviendha did but there was no help for it she needed to survive these three however as aviendha reached for the one power something snapped into place between her and the source a shield with weaves she could not see one of these men could channel aviendhas reaction was instinctive she shoved down her panic stopped scrambling to touch the source and threw herself at the nearest of the men she caught his spearthrust with her off handignoring the pain as the spearhead sliced against her ribs and hauled him forward to ram her knife in his neck one of the other two cursed and aviendha suddenly found herself wrapped in weaves of air unable to speak or move blood soaked into her blouse and pooled against her wounded side the man shed struck gasped and thrashed on the ground as he died the other two did not move to help him one of the darkfriends stepped forward lithe almost invisible in the darkness he pulled her face close to inspect her then waved his hand to the other a very soft light appeared beside them giving them a better look at herand her at them they wore red veils but this one had taken his down for the fight why what was this no aiel she knew did that were these the shaido had they joined the shadow one of the men made a few gestures to the other it was handtalk not maiden handtalk but something similar the other man nodded aviendha thrashed against her invisible bonds she slammed her will against that shield biting down on her gag of air the aiel on the right the taller one the one who probably held her shieldgrunted she felt as if her fingers were clawing at the edge of a nearly shut door with light warmth and power beyond that door wouldnt budge an inch the tall aiel narrowed his eyes at her he let the light hed summoned vanish plunging them into darkness aviendha heard him take out a spear a foot fell on the ground nearby the redveils heard it and spun aviendha looked as best she could but couldnt make out the newcomer the men stood perfectly still what is this a womans voice asked cadsuane she approached a lantern in her hand aviendha was jerked away as the man holding her weaves pulled her back into the shadows and cadsuane did not seem aware of her cadsuane saw only the other man who stood closer to the pathway that aiel man stepped from the shadows hed lowered his veil too i thought i heard something near the tents here aes sedai he said he had a strange accent one that was slightly off only by a shade a wetlander would never know the difference these arent aiel aviendha thought theyre something different her mind wrestled with the concept aiel who were not aiel men who could channel the men we send she realized with horror men discovered among the aiel with the ability to channel were sent to try to kill the dark one alone they came to the blight nobody knew what happened to them after that aviendha began to struggle again trying to make noiseany noiseto alert cadsuane the attempts were in vain she hung tightly in the air in the darkness and cadsuane wasnt looking in her direction well did you find anything cadsuane asked the man no aes sedai i will speak to the guards cadsuane said sounding dissatisfied we must be vigilant if a draghkaror worse a myrddraalmanaged to sneak in it could kill dozens before being discovered cadsuane turned to go aviendha shook her head tears of frustration in her eyes so close the redveil who had been with cadsuane stepped back into the shadows going up to aviendha in a flash of lightning she caught a smile on his lips mimicked by the one who still held her in the bonds the redveil in front of her slid a dagger from his belt then reached up for her she watched that knife helpless as he raised it to her throat she sensed channeling the bonds holding her were gone instantly and she dropped to the ground aviendha caught the mans knife hand as she fell his eyes opening wide though she embraced the source by raw mad instinct her hands were already moving she twisted the mans wrist snapping the bones where hand met arm she caught the knife with her other hand then slammed it into his eye as he started to scream in pain the scream cut off the redveil fell at her feet and she looked with anxiety toward the one beside herthe one who had been holding her in weaves he lay dead on the ground gasping she scrambled toward the path nearby and found cadsuane it is a simple thing to stop a mans heart cadsuane said arms folded she seemed dissatisfied so close to healing yet opposite in effect perhaps it is an evil thing yet ive always failed to see how it would be worse than simply burning a man to ash with fire how aviendha asked how did you recognize what they were i am not a halftrained wilder cadsuane replied i would have liked to strike them down when i first arrived but i had to be certain before i could act when that one threatened you with the knife i knew aviendha breathed in and out trying to still her heart and of course there was the other one cadsuane said the one that channeled how many male aiel warriors can secretly channel was this an anomaly or have your people been covering them up what no we dont or we didnt aviendha wasnt certain what they would do now that the source had been cleansed men certainly should stop being sent alone to die fighting the dark one youre certain cadsuane asked voice flat yes pity that could have been a large boon to us now cadsuane shook her head i wouldnt have been surprised after finding out about those windfinders so these were just runofthemill darkfriends with one among them who had hidden his channeling ability what were they about tonight these are anything but ordinary darkfriends aviendha said softly inspecting the corpses red veils the man who had been able to channel wore his teeth filed to points but the other two did not what did it mean we need to alert the camp aviendha continued its possible that these three merely walked in unchallenged many of the wetlander guards avoid challenging aiel they assume that all of us serve the caracarn to many wetlanders an aiel was an aiel fools though to be honest aviendha had to admit that her own first instinct upon seeing aiel had been to think them allies when had that happened not two years back if shed caught unfamiliar algaidsiswai prowling about shed have attacked aviendha continued her inspection of the dead mena knife on each man spears and bows nothing else telling however her thoughts whispered to her that she was missing something the female channeler she said suddenly looking up it was a woman using the one power that drew me aes sedai was that you i did not channel until i killed that man cadsuane said frowning aviendha dropped back into a battle stance hugging the shadows what would she find next wise ones who served the shadow cadsuane frowned as aviendha scouted the area further she passed darlins tent where soldiers outside huddled around lamps and cast shadows that danced on the canvas she passed soldiers in tight groups walking along the pathways not speaking they carried torches blinding their eyes to the night aviendha had heard tairen officers remark that it was nice for once to have no worry about their sentries dozing on duty with the lightning the trolloc drums in the near distance the occasional raids by shadowspawn trying to slip into camp soldiers knew to be wary the frosted air smelled of smoke with putrid scents blowing in from the trolloc camps she eventually gave up the hunt and walked back the way she had come finding cadsuane speaking with a group of soldiers aviendha was about to approach when her eyes passed over a patch of darkness nearby and her senses came alert that patch of darkness is channeling aviendha began weaving a shield immediately the one in the darkness wove fire and air toward cadsuane aviendha dropped her weave and instead lashed out with spirit slicing the enemy weave just as it was released aviendha heard a curse and a quick weave of fire blossomed in her direction aviendha ducked as it lashed overhead hissing in the cold air the wave of heat passed her enemy ducked out of the shadowswhatever weave shed been using to hide had collapsedrevealing the woman aviendha had fought before the one with the face almost as ugly as a trollocs the woman dashed behind a group of tents just before the ground ripped up behind hera weave that aviendha hadnt made a second later the woman folded again as she had before vanishing aviendha stood warily she turned toward cadsuane who walked up to her thank you the woman said grudgingly for disrupting that weave i suppose we are even then aviendha said even no not by several hundred years child i will admit that i am thankful for your intervention she frowned she vanished she did that before a method of traveling we do not know cadsuane said looking troubled i saw no flows for it perhaps a terangreal it a shot of red light rose from the front lines of the army the trollocs were attacking at the same time aviendha felt channeling in different spots around the camp one two three she spun about trying to locate each of the locations she counted five channelers cadsuane said sharply dozens of them dozens i sense five most are men fool child cadsuane said waving a hand go gather the others aviendha dashed away yelling the alarm she would have words with cadsuane later for ordering her about maybe having words with cadsuane often left one feeling like a complete fool aviendha ran into the aiel section of camp in time to see amys and sorilea pulling on their shawls checking the sky flinn stumbled out of a nearby tent blinking bleary eyes men he said channeling have more ashaman arrived unlikely aviendha said amys sorilea i need a circle they raised eyebrows at her she might be one of them now and she might have command by the caracarns authority but reminding sorilea of that would end with aviendha buried to her neck in sand if you please she added quickly it is your say aviendha sorilea said i will go and speak with the others and send them to you so you may have your circle we will make two i think as you have suggested before that would be for the best stubborn as cadsuane that one is aviendha thought the two of them could teach lessons on patience to trees still sorilea was not strong in the powerin fact she could barely channelso it would be wise to use others as she suggested sorilea began calling for the other wise ones and aes sedai aviendha suffered the delay with anxiety already she could hear screams and explosions in the valley streams of fire arced into the air then dropped sorilea aviendha said softly to the elder wise one as the women began to build the circles i was attacked in camp just now by three aiel men the battle we are about to fight it will probably involve other aiel who fight for the shadow sorilea turned sharply meeting aviendhas eyes explain i think they must be the men we sent to kill sightblinder aviendha said sorilea hissed softly if this is true child then this night will mark great toh for us all toh toward the caracarn toh toward the land itself i know bring me word sorilea said i will organize a third circle maybe make some of those offduty windfinders join in aviendha nodded then accepted control of the circle as it was handed to her she had three aes sedai who had sworn to rand and two wise ones by her order flinn did not join the circle she wanted him to be on the watch for signs of men channeling ready to point the direction and being in a circle might make that impossible for him to do they moved off like a squad of spearsisters they passed clusters of tairen defenders pulling on burnished breastplates over uniforms with wide striped sleeves in one group she found king darlin bellowing orders a moment she said to the others hastening to the tairen them all darlin said to his commanders dont let the front lines weaken we cant let those monsters spill into the valley it appeared that hed been awakened from sleep by the attack for he stood dressed only in trousers and a white undershirt a disheveled serving man held out darlins coat but the king distracted by a messenger turned away when darlin saw aviendha he waved her forward urgently the serving man heaved a sigh lowering the coat id given up on them attacking tonight darlin said then glanced at the sky or well this morning the scout reports are so confused i feel like ive been thrown into a coop full of crazed chickens and told to catch the one with a single black feather those reports aviendha said do they mention aiel men fighting for the shadow possibly channeling darlin turned sharply its true yes and the trollocs are pushing with everything they have to force their way into the valley darlin said if those aiel dreadlords start attacking our troops we won t stand a chance without you lot being there to hold them off were moving aviendha said send for amys and cadsuane to make gateways but i warn you i caught a dreadlord sneaking around near your tent darlin paled like ituralde light they didnt touch me i swear it i he raised a hand to his head who do we trust if we cannot trust our own minds we must make the dance of spears as simple as possible aviendha said go to rhuarc gather your leaders plan how you will face the shadow together do not let one man control the battleand set your plans in place do not allow them to be changed that could lead to disaster darlin said if we dont have flexibility what needs be changed aviendha asked grimly we hold with everything we have we hold we dont pull back we dont try anything clever we just hold darlin nodded ill send for gateways to put maidens atop those slopes they can take out those trollocs shooting arrows down at our lads can you deal with the enemy channelers yes aviendha returned to her group then started to draw on their power the more of the one power you held the harder it was to cut you off from the true source she intended to hold so much that no man could separate her from it helplessness she hated feeling helpless she let the anger at what had been done to her rage inside of her and led her group toward the nearest source of male channeling that flinn could identify chapter drifting rand stood in a place that was not a place outside of time outside of the pattern itself all around him spread a vast nothingness voracious and hungry it longed to consume he could actually see the pattern it looked like thousands upon thousands of twisting ribbons of light they spun around him above him undulating and shimmering twisting together at least that was how his mind chose to interpret it everything that had ever been everything that could be everything that could have been it all lay right there before him rand could not comprehend it the blackness around it sucked on him pulled him toward it he reached out to the pattern and somehow anchored himself in it lest he be consumed that changed his focus it locked him slightly into a time the pattern before him rippled and rand watched it being woven it was not actually the pattern he knew but his mind saw it that way familiar as it had been described the threads of lives weaving together rand anchored himself in reality again and moved with it time had meaning again and he could not see ahead or behind he still could see all places like a man standing above a globe as it turned rand faced the emptiness so he said into it this is where it will really happen moridin would have had me believe that a simple sword fight would decide this all he is of me but his eyes are small yes rand said i have noticed the same small tools can be effective the thinnest of knives can stop a heart he has brought you here adversary none of this had happened the last time when rand had worn the name of lews therin he could only interpret that as a good sign now the battle truly began he looked into the nothingness and felt it welling up then like a sudden storm the dark one brought all of his force against rand perrin fell back against a tree gasping at the pain slayers arrow had impaled his shoulder the arrowhead coming out his back he didnt dare pull it free not with he wavered thoughts came lethargically where was he hed shifted away from slayer as far as he could go but he didnt recognize this place the trees were oddshaped on top too leafy of a variety hed never before seen the storm blew here but far more weakly perrin slipped and hit the ground with a grunt his shoulder flared with pain he rolled over staring up at the sky hed broken the arrow when falling its its the wolf dream i can just make the arrow vanish he tried to gather the strength to do so but was too weak he found himself floating and he sent outward seeking for wolves he found the minds of some and they started sending back surprise a twolegs who can talk what is this what are you his nature seemed to frighten them and they pushed him out of their minds how could they not know what he was wolves had long long memories surely surely faile he thought so beautiful so clever i should go to her i just need to need to close this waygate and i can get back to the two rivers to her perrin rolled over and crawled to his knees was that his blood on the ground so much red he blinked at it here you are a voice said lanfear he looked up at her his vision blurry so he defeated you she said folding her arms disappointing i didnt want to have to choose that one i find you much more appealing wolf please he croaked im tempted though i shouldnt be she said youve proven yourself weak i i can beat him suddenly the shame of having failed in front of her crushed perrin when had he started worrying about what lanfear thought of him he couldnt quite point to it she tapped one finger on her arm please perrin said raising a hand please no she said turning away ive learned the mistake of setting my heart on one who does not deserve it goodbye wolf pup she vanished leaving perrin on hands and knees in this strange place faile a piece of his mind said dont worry about lanfear you have to go to faile yes yes he could go to her couldnt he where was she the field of merrilor that was where hed left her it was where she would be he shifted there somehow gathering himself just enough to manage it but of course she wasnt there he was in the wolf dream the portal rand would send it would be here he just had to get to it he needed he needed he collapsed to the ground and rolled to his back he felt himself drifting into the nothingness his vision blackened as he stared up at the churning sky at least at least i was there for rand perrin thought the wolves could hold shayol ghul on this side now couldnt they they could keep rand safe theyd have to faile poked a stick at their meager cook fire darkness had fallen and the fire glowed with a faint red light they hadnt dared make it larger deadly things prowled the blight trollocs were the least of the dangers here the air here smelled pungent and faile expected to find a rotting corpse behind every blackspeckled shrub the ground cracked when she stepped dry earth crushing beneath her boots as if rain had not been seen in centuries as she sat in the camp she saw a group of sickly green lights like glowing insects in a swarmpassing in the distance over a stand of silhouetted trees she knew enough of the blight to hold her breath until they passed she did not know what they were and did not want to know she had led her group on a short hike to find this place for a camp along the way one caravan worker had been killed by a twig another by stepping in what looked like mudbut it had dissolved his leg hed gotten some of it on his face he had thrashed and screamed as he died theyd had to forcibly gag him to keep the sounds from bringing other horrors the blight they couldnt survive up here a simple walk had killed two of their members and faile had some hundred people to try to protect guards from the band some members of cha faile and the wagon drivers and workers from her supply caravan eight of the wagons still worked and theyd brought those to this camp for now they would probably be too conspicuous to take farther she wasnt even certain they would survive this night light their only chance of rescue seemed to lie with the aes sedai would they notice what had happened and send help it seemed a very faint hope but she did not know about the one power all right faile said softly to those who sat with hermandevwin aravine harnan setalle and arrela of cha faile lets talk the others looked hollow probably like faile they had been frightened with stories of the blight since childhood the quick deaths in their party soon after entering this land had reinforced that they knew how dangerous this place was they kept jumping at every sound in the night i will explain what i can faile said trying to divert them from the death all around during the bubble of evil one of those crystals speared berisha sedais foot right as she made the gateway a wound mandevwin asked from his place beside the fire would that have been enough to make the gateway go awry truly i know little of aes sedai business nor have i wanted to if one is distracted is it possible to create an accidental opening to the wrong place setalle frowned and the expression drew failes attention setalle was neither nobility nor an officer there was something about the woman however she projected authority and wisdom you know something faile asked her setalle cleared her throat i know some little about channeling it was once an area of curiosity to me sometimes if a weave is done incorrectly it simply does nothing other times the result is disastrous i have not heard of a weave doing something like this working but in the wrong way well harnan said watching that darkness and shivering visibly the alternative is to think that she wanted to send us to the blight perhaps she was disoriented faile said the pressure of the moment made her send us to the wrong place ive been turned about before in a moment of tension and found myself running in the wrong direction it could be like that the others nodded but again setalle looked concerned what is it faile prodded aes sedai training is very extensive in relation to this type of situation setalle said no woman reaches the level of aes sedai without learning how to channel under extreme pressure there are specific barriers a woman must clear in order to wear the ring so faile thought setalle must have a relative who is aes sedai someone close if they shared information so private a sister perhaps then do we assume that this is some kind of trap aravine sounded confused that berisha was some kind of darkfriend surely the shadow has greater things to misdirect than a simple supply train faile said nothing the horn was safe the chest it was in now sat in her small tent nearby they had circled the wagons and had allowed only this one fire the rest of the caravan slept or tried to the still toosilent air made faile feel as if they were being watched by a thousand eyes if the shadow had planned a trap for her caravan it meant the shadow knew about the horn in that case they were in very serious danger more serious even than being in the blight itself no setalle said no aravine is right this could not have been an intentional trap if the bubble of evil hadnt come we would never have burst through the opening without looking where it led so far as we know these bubbles are completely random unless berisha was simply taking advantage of the circumstances faile thought also there was the womans death that wound in her stomach had not looked like one caused by the spikes it had looked like a knife wound as if someone had attacked berisha once the horn was through the gateway to keep her from telling what shed done light faile thought i am growing suspicious so harnan said what do we do that depends faile said looking toward setalle is there any way an aes sedai could tell where wed been sent setalle hesitated as if reluctant to reveal how much she knew when she continued however she spoke with confidence weaves leave behind a residue so yes an aes sedai could discover where wed gone the residue does not last long however a few days at most for a powerful weave and not all channelers can read residuesthis is a rare talent the way she spoke so commanding and authoritative the way she projected an immediate sense of being trustworthy it wasnt a relative then faile thought this woman trained in the white tower was she perhaps like queen morgase too weak in the one power to become aes sedai we will wait one day faile said if nobody has come for us by then we will head south and try to escape the blight as quickly as possible i wonder how far north we are flarnan said rubbing his chin i dont fancy going over mountains to get back home youd rather remain in the blight mandevwin asked well no harnan said but it could take months to walk back to safety months traveling through the blight itself light faile thought traveling months in a place where were lucky to have lost only two in one day theyd never make it even without the wagons the caravan would stand out in this landscape like a fresh wound on diseased skin theyd be lucky to last another day or two she resisted the urge to glance back at the tent what would happen if she didnt bring it to mat in time there is another option setalle said hesitantly faile looked to her that peak you see to the east of us setalle said speaking with obvious reluctance that is shayol ghul mandevwin whispered something quietly that faile didnt catch squeezing his eyes shut the others looked sick faile however caught setalles implication that is where the dragon reborn is making war against the shadow faile said one of our armies will be there with channelers who could get us out indeed setalle said and the area just around shayol ghul is known as the blasted lands lands that the horrors of the blight are said to avoid because its so terrible arrela said if they dont go there its because they fear the dark one himself the dark one and his armies might have their attention on the fighting faile said slowly nodding her head we cant survive long in the blightwell be dead before the week is out but if the blasted lands are free of those horrors and if we can reach our armies there it seemed a far better hopeslim though it wasthan trying to march for months in the most dangerous place in the world she told the others shed consider what to do and dismissed them her advisors moved off to make their bedrolls mandevwin going to check the men on watch faile remained staring at the embers of the fire feeling sick someone did kill berisha she thought im certain of it the gateways location really could have been an accident accidents happened even to aes sedai no matter what setalle thought but if there was a darkfriend in the caravan one who had ducked through the opening and seen that it went to the blight they could have easily decided to kill berisha in order to leave the horn and the caravan stranded setalle faile said as the woman passed a word setalle sat down beside faile wearing a composed expression i know what youre going to ask how long has it been faile asked since you were in the white tower it has been decades now are you capable of making a gateway setalle laughed child i couldnt light a candle i was burned out in an accident i havent held the one power in over twentyfive years i see faile said thank you setalle moved off and faile found herself wondering how truthful was her story setalle had been very helpful in their days together and faile couldnt blame the woman for keeping secret her ties to the white tower in any other situation faile wouldnt have given the womans story a moment of doubt however there was no way out here to confirm what she said if setalle was black ajah in hiding her story about being burned out could simply be thata story perhaps she could still channel or perhaps she couldnt but had been stilled as a punishment could this woman be an escaped prisoner of the most dangerous type an agent who had waited decades for the right moment to strike setalle had been the one to suggest they go to shayol ghul was she seeking to bring the horn to her master feeling cold faile entered her tent as several members of cha faile set up watch around it faile wrapped herself in her bedroll she knew that she was being overly suspicious but how else was she to be considering the circumstances light she thought the horn of valere lost in the blight a nightmare aviendha knelt on one knee beside the smoldering corpse holding her angrealthe turtle brooch that elayne had given her she breathed through her mouth as she gazed down on the mans face there were a surprising number of these redveils whatever their origins they were not aiel they did not follow jietoh during the nights fighting she had seen two maidens take a man captive he had acted like gaishain but had then killed one from behind with a hidden knife well sarene asked breathless while those at the field of merrilor rested and prepared for their challenge ahead this battle at shayol ghul continued the redveil attack had lasted all through the night the following day and now into the night again i think i knew him aviendha said disturbed fie channeled for the first time when i was a child making algode grow when it should not she let the veil fall down on his face his name was soro he was kind to me i watched him run across the dry ground at sunset after vowing to spit in sightblinders eye im sorry sarene said though her voice was uncolored by any sympathy aviendha was growing accustomed to that in the woman it wasnt that sarene didnt care she just didnt let caring distract her at least not when her warder was elsewhere the aes sedai would have made a fine maiden lets keep moving aviendha said taking off with her pack of channelers during the days and nights of fighting aviendhas team had shifted melded and split as women needed rest aviendha herself had slept sometime during the day by common agreement the one leading the circle avoided drawing on her own powerthus aviendha was still at reasonable strength despite so many hours of fighting this allowed her to remain alert on the hunt the other women became wells of power to be drawn upon she had to be careful not to drain them too far tire a woman and she could sleep for a few hours and be back up to fight again drain her completely and she could be useless for days at the moment aviendha had flinn and three aes sedai with her she had learned the weave to tell her when a man was channeling nearbyit was moving through the aes sedai and wise onesbut having a male channeler with her was far more useful flinn pointed toward some flashes of fire on the side of the valley they loped in that direction passing corpses and places where the ground smoldered with the growing light of dawn aviendha could see through the cold mist that darlins forces still held the mouth of the valley the trollocs had pushed forward to the low earthen mounds that ituralde had built killing had been done there on both sides the trollocs had taken far more lossesbut then they were also far more numerous it seemed from her quick glance that they had overrun one of the earthen bulwarks but domani riders had come in from the reserves and were pushing them back bands of aiel roved and fought in the mouth of the valley itself some with red veils some with black too many aviendha thought as she slowed her team with a raised hand she then continued forward on her own quietly she could draw a few hundred paces away from the women and still have access to their power she picked her way through the barren rocky fields of the valley there were three dead bodies to her right two with black veils she tested them with a quick delving she would not be caught by the old trick of hiding among the corpses she had used that one herself these three were truly dead so she continued on in a crouch in addition to the place where the tairens and domani held the trollocs back they had a second force guarding their camp and the pathway up to where rand fought in the space between aiel and redveils roved in bands each trying to best the other only some of the redveils could channel the ground thumped and shook nearby a spray of soil fell through the air aviendha crouched down lower but quickened her pace ahead over a dozen siswaiaman were rushing the position of two redveils both channelers the redveils cast up the earth beneath the attackers sending bodies flying aviendha understood why the aiel kept going these redveils were an affront a crime the seanchan who would dare take wise ones captive were not as disgusting as these somehow the shadow had taken the bravest of the aiel and made them into these these things aviendha struck quickly pulling strength through her angreal and her circle weaving two lines of fire and hurling them at the redveils she began new weaves immediately casting up the ground beneath the two channelers and started a third set of weaves she threw fire at the redveils as they stumbled one jumped away as the other was caught in her earthen blasts she struck the one who had fled with spears of flame then she hit both corpses with an extra burst of power just to make certain these men no longer held to jietoh they were no longer alive they were weeds to be pulled she moved forward to check on the siswaiaman eight still lived three of them wounded aviendha was not particularly good with healing but she was able to save the life of one man keeping a wound in his throat from bleeding out the other survivors gathered the wounded and moved back toward the camp aviendha stood above the two corpses she decided not to look at them closely seeing one man she had known was bad enough these a shock went through her and one of her wells of power vanished aviendha gasped another one winked out she immediately released the circle then dashed back to where she had left the women flashes and explosions shook her aviendha clung to the one power her own strength now seeming pitifully small compared to what shed been using she stumbled to a halt before the smoldering corpses of kiruna and faeldrin the hideous woman she had seen beforethe woman that aviendha was increasingly certain was one of the forsakenstood there smiling at her the horrid woman had her hand on sarenes shoulder the slender white stood with her head turned toward the forsaken staring at her with vapid adoring eyes sarenes warder lay dead at her feet both vanished twisting upon themselves traveling without use of a gateway aviendha fell to her knees beside the dead nearby damer flinn groaned and tried to pull himself free of the castup earth his left arm was completely gone burned away at the shoulder aviendha cursed and did what she could to heal him though he slipped into unconsciousness she suddenly felt very tired and very very alone chapter a practiced grin olver missed wind belathe stout shaggy mare he now rode wasnt bad really she was just slow olver knew this because he kept trying to nudge her forward but she continued plodding along behind the other horses nothing he did could make her go any faster olver wanted to ride like a storm instead he rode like a sturdy log in a placid river he wiped his brow the blight was pretty scary and the othersmost of them didnt have horseswalked as if each step was going to bring a thousand trollocs down on them the rest of the caravan spoke in hushed voices and they looked at the hillsides with suspicion they passed a group of withered trees with sap leaking from open sores in the bark that sap looked too red almost like blood nearby one of the caravan drivers stepped up to inspect it vines snapped down from the limbs abovevines that looked brown and dead yet moved like snakes before olver could scream the caravan driver was hanging dead from the upper branches of the tree the entire line of people froze in place horrified above the tree actually pulled the dead man into itself through a split in the bark ingesting him maybe that sap was blood olver looked on horrified steady lady faile said a slight tremor in her voice ive told you dont draw close to plants dont touch anything they moved on a solemn bunch sandip riding nearby muttered to himself thats the fifteenth one fifteen men dead in a few days light were never going to survive this if only it were trollocs olver couldnt fight trees and insects who could but trollocs those hed be able to fight olver had his knife and hed learned a few things about using it from harnan and silvic olver wasnt that tall but he figured that would make trollocs underestimate him he could lunge low and go for their vitals before they knew what was happening he told himself this to keep his hands from shaking as he kicked bela hoping to move up by lady faile in the distance he heard a screeching sound like something dying in a horrible way olver shivered hed heard that same sound earlier in the day did it sound closer now setalle gave him a worried glance as he neared the front the others tried everything they could to keep him from danger he steeled himself ignoring that horrid screeching off in the distance everyone thought olver was fragile but he wasnt they hadnt seen what he had growing up in truth he didnt like thinking about those times it seemed as if hed lived three lives one before his parents died one when hed been alone and now this one anyway he was used to fighting people bigger than he was it was the last battle they kept saying everyone would be needed well why not him when the trollocs came the first thing hed do was climb down off this slow mount he could stroll faster than this animal could gallop well the aiel didnt need horses olver hadnt gone to train with them yet but he would he had it planned out he hated all aiel but mostly the shaido and he would need to learn their secrets if he was going to kill them hed go among them and demand to be trained theyd take him in and would treat him poorly but eventually theyd respect him and let him train with their warriors there were stories about that it was how things happened after he knew their secrets hed go to the snakes and foxes and receive answers on how to locate the shaido who had murdered his father from there tracking and killing them would be a quest worthy of its own story ill take noal he thought hes been everywhere he can be my guide he noal was dead sweat crawled down the side of olvers face as he stared at the rocky path ahead they passed more of those terrible trees and now everyone gave them a wide berth beside the path though one of the men pointed out a large patch of that killing mud it looked brown and thick and olver spotted several bones peeking out this place was horrible he wished noal were here noal had gone everywhere seen everything hed know how to get them out of this place but noal was gone olver had only heard the news recently filtered through things that the lady moiraine had shared about what happened at the tower of ghenjei everyones dying olver thought eyes still forward everyone mat had run off to the seanchan talmanes to fight alongside queen elayne one by one everyone in this group was being eaten by trees mud or monsters why did they all leave olver alone he rubbed at his bracelet noal had given it to him shortly before leaving woven of rough fibers it was of a type warriors wore in a faraway land so noal had told him it was the mark of a man who had seen battle and lived noal dead would mat die too olver felt hot tired and very frightened he nudged bela forward and fortunately she obeyed trotting a little faster up the slope so olver moved up the line theyd abandoned the wagons then left for some place called the blasted lands which required them to climb some foothills in the morning theyd entered a pass between the mountains though he felt warm the air was getting cooler as they climbed he didnt mind that at all it still smelled awful though like rotting corpses their group had started with fifty soldiers and almost half as many wagon drivers and workers there were also a handful of others like olver setalle and the halfdozen members of lady failes bodyguard so far theyd lost fifteen people to hazards of the blight including five killed by some horrible threeeyed things that had attacked the camp yesterday morning hed overheard lady faile saying that she considered them lucky to have lost only fifteen so far that it could have been worse it didnt seem lucky to olver this place was awful and he wanted to be out of it the waste wouldnt be as bad as this would it cha failes men and women acted like aiel a little bit like aiel maybe theyd done as olver wanted to and trained in the waste hed have to ask them he rode on for another halfhour or so eventually he coaxed bela up to the front of the line lady failes brilliant black mare looked fast why couldnt olver have been given a horse like that one faile had mats chest tied to the back of her horse at first olver had been pleased with that as he figured mat would want that tabac pretty badly mat always complained about not having good tabac then olver had heard faile explaining to someone else that the chest had simply been a convenient place to stow some of her things had she thrown away the tabac mat wouldnt like that faile looked at him and olver grinned giving it as much confidence as he could it wouldnt do for her to see how scared he was most women liked his grin hed been practicing it though he didnt use mats grin as a model mats always made him look guilty you learned grins when you were forced to fend for yourself and olver needed one that made him seem innocent and he was innocent mostly faile did not smile back olver figured that she was pretty good to look at despite that nose she wasnt very soft though bloody ashes but she had a glare that could rust good iron faile rode between aravine and vanin though they spoke softly olver could hear what they were saying he made sure to stare in the other direction so theyd think he wasnt eavesdropping and he wasnt he just wanted to be out of the trail dust of the other horses yes vanin was whispering it may not seem it but were close to the blasted lands burn my own mother i cant believe were going there but do you feel the air its getting cooler we havent seen anything really nasty since those threeeyed things yesterday morning we are close aravine agreed soon we will be near the dark one in a land where nothing grows corrupted or not where there is no life not even the nastier things from the blight i suppose that should be a comfort not really vanin said wiping his brow because the shadowspawn up here are more dangerous if we survive it will be because theres a bloody war going on the shadowspawn are all locked in battle if were lucky the blasted lands except right around shayol ghul will be as empty as a mans purse after a deal with the bloody sea folk pardon my language my lady olver squinted at the approaching mountain peak thats where the bloody dark one lives olver thought and thats probably where mat is not merrilor mat talked about staying away from danger but he always found his way to it anyway olver figured that mat was just trying to be humble but was bad at it why else would you say you dont want to be a hero then always bloody end up charging right into danger and this path faile asked vanin you said there might have been traffic here recently wouldnt that indicate that this place is far from as empty as you so colorfully described vanin grunted it does look used so someone has been moving wagons through the area aravine said i dont know if that is a good sign or a bad one i dont think there are any good signs up here vanin said maybe we should just pick someplace nearby and hole up waiting he sighed wiping his brow again though olver didnt see why it was growing pretty coldhe could tell even through the course of the day and there seemed to be fewer plants too he was just fine with that he glanced over his shoulder at the stand of trees that had taken that poor mans life there didnt seem to be any others like it nearby particularly not ahead of them along the path we cant afford to wait vanin faile said i intend to get back to merrilor one way or another the dragon reborn will be fighting at thakandar thats where we need to go to get out of this forsaken place vanin groaned but olver smiled he would find his way to mat and show how dangerous he could be in battle then well then maybe mat wouldnt leave him like the others had that would be good as olver was going to need mats help tracking down those shaido after all hed learned training with the band he was certain nobody would push him around and nobody would take those he loved from him ever again there are accounts in the archives that explain what we saw cadsuane picked up her cup of tea to warm her hands the aiel girl aviendha sat on the floor of the tent what i wouldnt give to have that one in the tower cadsuane thought these wise ones they had fight to them real bite like the best of the women in the white tower cadsuane was increasingly convinced that the shadow for years had been carrying out a complex plan to undermine the white tower it went deeper than siuan sanches unfortunate unseating and elaidas reign it might be decades centuries before they understood the extent of the shadows planning however the sheer number of black sistershundreds not the few dozen cadsuane had guessedshouted of what had happened for now cadsuane had to work with what she had that included these wise ones poorly trained in using weaves but never lacking in grit useful like sorilea despite her weakness in the one power who sat farther back in the tent watching i have made some inquiries child cadsuane said to aviendha what this woman does is indeed traveling however the only fragments of documents mentioning it date back to the war of power aviendha frowned i saw no weaves cadsuane sedai cadsuane masked a smile at the respectful tone the althor boy had put this girl in commandand in truth better her than some others however he should have chosen cadsuane and aviendha likely knew it that is because the woman was not weaving the one power cadsuane replied what else would it be do you know why the dark one was originally freed aviendha looked as if remembering something ah yes then they are channeling the dark ones power it is called the true power cadsuane said the accounts say that traveling by true power works in the way you have seen this woman move few saw it happen the dark one was miserly with his essence during the war of power and only the most favored were granted access i surmise from this fact that this is most definitely one of the forsaken from your description of what she did to poor sarene i would suspect it is graendal the stories never mentioned graendal being so ugly sorilea said softly if you were one of the forsaken easily recognized by description would you not wish to change your appearance to remain unknown perhaps sorilea said but then i would not use this true power as you name it that would defeat the purpose of my disguise from what aviendha has told us cadsuane noted the woman did not have much of a choice she had to escape quickly cadsuane and sorilea met eyes and each nodded in agreement they would hunt this forsaken the two of them i wont have you dying on me now boy cadsuane thought glancing over her shoulder toward where althor nynaeve and moiraine continued their work every channeler in the camp could feel that pulsing at least not until youve done what you need to do cadsuane had expected the forsaken to be here it was why shed come to this battlefront wind shook the tent chilling cadsuane down deep this place was awful even when the battle slowed the dread that hung here was like that of a funeral for a child it stifled laughter killed smiles the dark one watched light but it would be good to leave this place aviendha drank her tea the woman still looked haunted although she had obviously lost allies in battle before i left them to die she whispered phaw cadsuane said to her you are not to blame for what one of the forsaken did child you dont understand aviendha said we were in a circle and they tried to break freei felt thembut i didnt know what was happening i held on to their power and so they couldnt fight her i left them helpless well from now on dont leave those in your circle behind cadsuane said briskly you could not have known what would happen if you suspect this one is nearby aviendha sorilea said you will send word to cadsuane me or amys there is no shame in admitting that another is too strong to face alone we will defeat this woman together and protect the caracarn very well aviendha said but you will do the same for me all of you she waited cadsuane reluctantly agreed as did sorilea faile crouched in a dark tent the air had grown even colder now that they were close to thakandar she ran her thumb along the hilt of her knife breathing in slowly and evenly then releasing the breath in the same manner she stared at the tent flaps unblinking shed placed the horns chest there with one corner sticking out into the night she felt more alone here on the border of the blasted lands surrounded by supposed alliesthan she had in the shaido camp two nights ago shed been called out of her tent to inspect some odd tracks that had worried the men they hadnt lost anyone since drawing so close to the blasted landsthat part of the plan was workingbut tensions were still high shed been gone only a few minutes but when shed returned the horns chest in her tent had been moved just slightly someone had tried to open it light fortunately they hadnt managed to break the lock and the horn had still been there when shed looked the traitor could be anyone one of the redarms a wagon driver a member of cha faile faile had spent the past two nights being extra even obviouslyvigilant with the chest to frustrate the thief then tonight shed complained of a headache and allowed setalle to fix her some tea to help her sleep shed brought the tea back to her tent had not taken a sip and now crouched waiting the chests corner would be obvious poking out into the night would they try again as a precaution shed removed the horn from the chest and taken it when she went out to answer the call of nature shed hidden it there in a cubby of rock and upon returning had put cha faile on patrol duty for the night away from her tent they had not liked leaving her unguarded but faile had made it clear that she was worried about tensions among the men that would be enough light let it be enough hours passed with faile crouched in that same position ready to leap up and call the alarm the moment someone tried to enter her tent surely they would try again tonight when she was supposedly ill nothing her muscles ached but she didnt move the thief could be out there in the dark waiting wondering if this was the right moment to strike to grab the horn and run off to his or her masters it a scream shattered the night faile wavered a distraction that scream she thought judging the direction it came from just west of here near where shed hidden the horn faile cursed making a snap decision the chest was empty if she took the bait and it really was just a distraction then she would not lose anything if on the other hand the thief had anticipated her she darted from the tent as others scrambled from bedrolls members of cha faile raced through the camp the yell came again it was accompanied by a haunting screech a type that had been following them in the distance she crashed through some thin blightstained weeds running through them was a foolish move in a place where a twig could kill but she was not thinking clearly she arrived first on the scene reaching the area where shed hidden the horn there stood not only vanin but harnan as well vanin clutched the horn of valere in thick arms while harnan fought against some kind of beast with dark fur shouting and swinging his sword vanin looked at faile and grew as pale as a whitecloaks shirt thief faile shouted stop him he has stolen the horn of valere vanin cried out tossing the horn as if it had bitten him then dashing away light but he could move quickly for one of his bulk he grabbed harnan by the shoulder pulling him to the side as the beast screamed that haunting wail other roars came in the distance faile skidded to the ground grabbing the horn and clutching it close these men were no common thieves they had not only seen through her plan but anticipated exactly where shed hidden the horn she felt like a farmgirl who had just fallen for a townsmans threecup scam those who had come running with her stood stunned either by the sight of the horn or the monster the creature screechedit looked like some kind of bear with too many arms though it was larger than any bear faile had seen she stumbled to her feet there was no time to look for the thieves as the beast smashed its way into failes guards it ripped the head off a member of cha faile screeching faile shouted flinging a knife at the thing as arrela hacked at one of its shoulders with her sword just then a second beast came lumbering over the rocks next to faile she cursed leaping away flinging a knife she hit itor at least the thing cried out in what sounded like anger and pain as mandevwin rode up on horseback bearing a torch the light revealed that the horrible things had faces like those of insects with a multitude of fanglike teeth failes knife protruded from one bulblike eye protect the lady mandevwin yelled throwing spears to nearby redarms who rammed them at the first monster pushing it back from arrelawho scrambled away bleeding the woman hadnt lost her sword though faile fell back as cha faile organized around her then looked down at what she held the horn of valere itself pulled from the sack in which shed hidden it she could blow it no she thought it is bound to cauthon to her it would be just an ordinary horn steady mandevwin said dancing his warhorse back as one of the beasts lunged at it verdin laandon we need more spears go the things fight like boars draw them forward impale them the tactic worked on one of the monsters but as mandevwin yelled the other one charged at him and grabbed his horse by the neck the beast brushed aside soldiers who tried to strike and mandevwin crashed to the ground groaning still clutching the horn faile dashed past where a group of redarms had managed to skewer the other beast she grabbed a freshly lit torch and threw it at the other monster lighting the fur on its back the thing bellowed as fire raced up its spine the fur burning like dry tinder it dropped mandevwins dead horse the head ripped nearly free as it thrashed yelling and howling grab the wounded faile ordered she took a member of the band by the arm see to mandevwin the man looked down at the horn she held eyes wide then shook himself and nodded calling for two others to help him lift the man my lady aravine asked standing near the bushes behind what is happening two redarms tried to steal what i have been carrying faile said now were going to ride away into the night but listen faile said pointing into the darkness distantly a dozen different screeches sounded responding to the cries of the dying beast the screams will draw further horrors as will the scent of spilled blood we go if we can get deeply enough into the blasted lands tonight we might be safe rouse the camp and get the wounded onto horses prepare everyone else for a forced quick march quickly aravine nodded scrambling off faile spared a glance in the direction harnan and vanin had gone she longed to hunt them down but tracking them in the night would require them to move slowly and that would mean death this night besides who knew what resources a pair of darkfriends had access to they would flee and light she hoped that she hadnt been deceived more than it seemed if vanin had somehow known to prepare a dummy horn a replica to drop and leave for faile to rescue as he fled shed never know shed reach the last battle with a fake horn and perhaps doom them all that possibility haunted her as the caravans members hastily moved into the darkness hoping in light and luck to escape the dangers of the night chapter unchangeable things something was wrong with rand nynaeve clutched the stalagmite deep within the pit of doom holding herself from being pulled by the winds into that nothingness in front of her moiraine had called it the dark ones essence but wouldnt that make it the true power worse if his essence was in the world wouldnt that mean that he had broken free whatever it was its nature was pure evil and it filled nynaeve with a terror like none she had ever felt before in her life it pulled with a powerful force drawing all that was nearby into it she feared that if she let go she would be yanked in already it had stolen her shawl making it vanish if that nothingness pulled her in her life would end perhaps her soul as well rand nynaeve thought could she do something to help him he stood before moridin the two of them locked together sword against sword frozen as if in a moment sweat trickled down rands face he did not speak he didnt so much as blink his foot had touched the darkness at that moment he had frozen and so had moridin they were like statues the air howled around them but did not seem to affect them as it did nynaeve theyd been standing like that frozen for a good fifteen minutes all in all it had been less than an hour since the group of them had entered the pit to face the dark one nynaeve watched rocks slide across the ground then be sucked into that blackness her clothing rippled and flapped as if in a strong wind as did moiraine s who huddled nearby holding to her own tooth of stone mercifully the stench of sulfur that had filled the cavern was drawn away here into the blackness she couldnt use the one power rand drew every bit of it she could hold though he didnt seem to be doing anything with it could she reach moridin he didnt seem to be able to move what if she took a rock to his head it would be better than waiting nynaeve tested her weight against the pull of the nothingness ahead relaxing her grip on the stalagmite she immediately started to slip and pulled herself back i am not spending the last battle dinging to a rock she thought not the same one the whole time at the very least she had to risk moving going directly forward seemed too dangerous but if she moved sideways yes there was another stalagmite nearby to her right she managed to let go of her hold and halfslip halfscuttle to the next stalagmite from there she picked out another one carefully eased off her hold and grabbed it instead the process was very slow rand you woolheaded fool she thought if hed let her or moiraine lead the circle then maybe they could have done something while he was fighting she reached another stalagmite then stopped as she saw something to her right she almost screamed a woman huddled there hidden against the wall sheltered from the wind by the rocks she appeared to be crying nynaeve glanced at rand who was still locked in stasis with moridin then approached the woman the greater number of stalagmites here meant that nynaeve could crawl more safely the stones blocking the pull of the nothingness nynaeve reached the woman she was chained to the wall alanna nynaeve shouted over the wind light what are you doing here the aes sedai blinked reddened eyes at nynaeve her eyes stared dully as if she had no mind as nynaeve examined the woman she noticed that the entire left side of alannas body was bloodied from a knife wound to the gut light nynaeve should have known that from the paleness of the womans face why stab her and leave her here she bonded rand nynaeve realized oh light it was a trap moridin had left alanna bleeding then confronted rand when alanna died randas her warderwould be driven mad with rage making him easy for moridin to destroy why hadnt he noticed nynaeve fished at her pouches for herbs then stopped short could herbs do anything at this point she needed to use the one power to heal such a wound nynaeve ripped the womans clothing making a bandage then tried to draw saidar for healing rand had it and he wouldnt let go frantic she tried to batter him away but rand held tight tighter as she tried to push against him he did seem to be channeling it somehow but she couldnt see the weaves she could feel something but with the howling wind and the strange nature of the pit it was like a tempest swirling around her the power was wrapped up in that somehow blast it she needed saidar it wasnt rands fault he could not give her any power while leading the circle nynaeve pressed her hand against alannas wound feeling helpless dared she call for rand to release her from the circle if she did moridin would undoubtedly turn on her and attack alanna what to do if this woman died rand would lose control that likely would be the end of him and of the last battle mat hacked at the wood with his axe to sharpen it to a point see he said it doesnt need to be fancy save your pretty carpentry to impress the mayors daughter the watching men and women nodded with grim determination they were farmers villagers and craftsmen like people hed known back in the two rivers mat had thousands of them under his command hed never have suspected that there would be so many the good people of the land had come to fight mat figured they were insane to a person if he had been able to escape he would be hiding in a basement somewhere burn him but he would have tried those dice rattled in his head just as theyd been doing ever since egwene gave him control of all of the armies of the light being bloody taveren was not worth two beans he kept at it shaping his stake for the palisade one fellow watched particularly carefully an old farmer with skin so leathery that trolloc swords would likely just bounce off he looked familiar to mat for some reason burn these memories mat thought undoubtedly this fellow resembled someone from one of those old memories mat had been given yes that felt right he could not quite remember a cart a fade come on renald the fellow said to one of his companionsanother farmer borderlander stock from the looks of him lets go on down the line and see if we can hurry the other lads up the two headed off as mat finished his stake then wiped his brow he reached for another length of woodhe had better give these sheepherders another demonstrationwhen a cadinsorclad figure ran up along the mostly finished palisade wall urien had bright red hair kept short save for the tail in the back he raised a hand to mat as he passed they are agitated matrim cauthon urien said not stopping i believe they are coming in this direction thanks mat called i owe you the aiel turned as he ran jogging backward for a second and facing mat just win this battle i have bet a skin of oosquai upon our success mat snorted the only thing more discomforting than a stoic aiel was a grinning one bet on the outcome of this battle what kind of bet was that if they lost nobody would live long enough to collect mat frowned actually that was a pretty good bet to be making who did you find to take that bet mat called urien but the man was already too far away to hear mat grumbled but handed his axe to one of the people nearby a slender tairen woman keep them in line cynd yes lord cauthon im no bloody lord mat said by habit as he picked up his ashandarei he walked off then turned to look at the palisade being erected and caught sight of a handful of deathwatch guards walking along the rows of working people like wolves among the sheep mat hurried on his armies did not have much time left to prepare using gateways had put them ahead of the trollocs but they had not escaped light there was no escape mat had been given his choice of battlefields though and this merrilor place would work best like picking the plot for your own grave mat thought sure id rather not have to choose in the first place the palisade was rising in front of the woods east of the field he did not have time to section off or surround the entire area with a palisade and doing so would not make much sense anyway with those sharan channelers the shadow could rip through walls like a sword through silk but some palisades with catwalks on top would give his archers height to target trollocs mat had two rivers to work with here the river mora flowed in a southwest direction running between the heights and dashar knob its southern bank was in shienar the northern bank in arafel it joined the river erinin which ran directly westward at the southern edge of the field those rivers would serve better than any walls particularly now that he had the resources to defend them correctly well if you could call them resources half his soldiers were as new as spring grass and the other half had fought near to death the week before the borderlanders had lost two men out of threelight two out of three a lesser army would have disbanded counting everyone he had mat would be outnumbered four to one when those trollocs arrived at least according to the reports from the fists of heaven it was going to be messy mat pulled his hat down further then scratched at the side of the new eyepatch that tuon had given him red leather he liked it here now he said passing some of the new tower guard recruits they were sparring with quarterstaffsspearheads were still being forged to go on the ends the men looked more likely to hurt themselves than the enemy mat handed his ashandarei to a man then took a quarterstaff from another as the first hastily saluted most of these men were not old enough to need to shave more than once a month if the boy whose staff he had taken was a day over fifteen mat would eat his boots he would not even boil them first you cant cringe every time the staff hits something mat said close your eyes on the battlefield and youre dead didnt you lot pay any attention last time mat held up the staff showing them where to grip it then put them through the blocking practice his father had shown him back when he had been young enough to think fighting might actually be fun he worked up a sweat hitting at each of the new recruits in turn forcing each to block burn me but you will figure this out mat said loudly to all of them i wouldnt care so much as you lot seem to have the wits of stumps but if you get yourselves killed your mothers will be expecting me to send them word i wont do it mind you but i might feel a little guilty between games of dice and i hate feeling guilty so pay attention lord cauthon said the lad who had given him the staff im not he stopped well yes what is it cant we just learn the sword light mat said whats your name sigmont sir well sigmont how much time do you think we have maybe you could wander out talk to the dreadlords and the shadowspawn and ask them to give me a few more months time so i can train you all properly sigmont blushed and mat handed back his staff city boys he sighed look here all i want is for you lot to be able to defend yourselves i dont have time to make you great warriors but i can teach you to work together keep a formation and not shy away when the trollocs come that will get you farther than any kind of fancy swordplay trust me the youths nodded reluctantly get back to your practice mat said wiping his brow and looking over his shoulder bloody ashes the deathwatch guards were heading his way he grabbed his ashandarei and rushed off then ducked around the side of a tent only to stumble into a group of aes sedai approaching on the path mat egwene asked from the middle of the group of women are you well theyre bloody chasing me he said glancing around the side of the tent who is chasing you egwene said deathwatch guards mat said im supposed to be back at tuons tent egwene waved a few fingers sending the other women off except her two shadowsgawyn and that seanchan womanwho remained with her mat egwene said in a suffering tone im glad youve finally decided to see reason and leave the seanchan camp but couldnt you have waited until after the battle was over to defect sorry he said only halflistening but can we walk on toward the aes sedai quarter of camp they wont follow me there maybe not if all deathwatch guards were like karede maybe they would karede would dive after a man falling off a cliff in order to catch him egwene started back seeming displeased with mat how was it aes sedai could be so perfectly emotionless yet still let a man know they disapproved of him come to think of it an aes sedai would probably follow a man off a cliff too if only to explain to himin detailall the things he was doing incorrectly in the way he went about killing himself mat wished so many of his thoughts lately did not involve feeling like he was the one jumping off the cliff well have to find a way to explain to fortuona why you ran egwene said as they approached the aes sedai quarter mat had placed it as far from the seanchan as was reasonable the marriage is going to present a problem i suggest that you wait egwene mat said what are you talking about you are running from the seanchan guards egwene said werent you listening of course you werent it is pleasant to know that as the world crumbles a few things are completely unchangeable cuendillar and mat cauthon im running from them mat said looking over his shoulder because tuon wants me to sit in judgment any time a soldier is seeking the empresss mercy for a crime im the one who is supposed to bloody hear his case you egwene said passing judgment i know mat said too much bloody work if you ask me ive been dodging guardsmen all day trying to steal a little time for myself a little honest work wouldnt kill you mat now you know thats not true soldiering is honest work and it gets men killed all the bloody time gawyn trakand was apparently practicing to be an aes sedai sometime because he kept giving mat glares that would have made moiraine proud well let him gawyn was a prince he had been raised to do things like pass judgment he probably sent a few men to the gallows each day at his lunch break just to keep in practice but mat mat was not going to order men to be executed and that was that they passed a group of aiel sparring together was this group what urien had been running to reach once they had passedmat trying to make the others walk faster so the seanchan would not catch uphe drew closer to egwene have you found it yet he asked softly no egwene said eyes forward no need to mention what it was how could you have lost the thing after all the work we bloody went through to find it we from the telling i hear rand loial and the borderlanders had far more to do with finding it than you i was there mat said i rode across the entire bloody continent didnt i burn me first rand then you is everybody going to chivvy me about those days gawyn you want a turn yes please he sounded eager shut up mat said it seems that nobody can remember straight but me i hunted down that bloody horn like a madman and ill mention it was me blowing the thing that let you all escape falme is that how you remember it egwene asked sure mat said i mean i have some holes in there but ive pieced it mostly together and the dagger that trinket hardly worth anyones time he caught himself reaching to his side to where he had once carried it egwene raised an eyebrow at him anyway thats not the point were going to need that bloody instrument egwene well need it we have people searching she said were not sure exactly what happened there was a traveling residue but its been a while and light mat were trying i promise it its not the only thing the shadow has stolen from us recently he glanced at her but she gave him no more flaming aes sedai has anyone seen perrin yet he asked i dont want to be the one to tell him his wife has gone missing nobody has seen him egwene said i assume he is at work helping rand bah mat said can you make a gateway for me up to the top of the knob i thought you wanted to go to my camp its on the way mat said well sort of it was and those deathwatch guards wont expect it burn me egwene but i think theyve guessed where we were heading egwene after pausing for a momentopened them a gateway to the traveling ground atop the knob they stepped through onto it more than a hill less than a mountain dashar knob rose a good hundred feet into the air near the middle of the battlefield the rock formation was unscalable and gateways were the only way to reach the top from here mat and his commanders would be able to watch the entire battle play out i have never known anyone else egwene said to him who will work so hard to avoid hard work matrim cauthon you havent spent enough time around soldiers mat waved at the men who saluted him as he walked out of the traveling grounds he looked north toward the river mora and across it into arafel then northeast toward the ruins of what had once been some kind of fort or watchtower eastward toward the rising palisade and the forest he continued to turn southward to gaze at the river erinin in the far distance and the strange little grove of tall trees that loial was so in awe of they said rand had grown those during the meeting where the treaty had been signed mat looked southwest toward the only good ford on the mora nearby named hawal ford by the locals who had farmed this area beyond the ford on the arafel side was a large expanse of bogs westward across the mora lay polov heightsa fortyfoottall plateau with a steep slope on the east and more gradual slopes on the other sides between the base of the southwestern slope and the bogs was a corridor roughly two hundred paces across well worn by travelers who used the ford to cross between arafel and shienar mat could use these features to his advantage he could use them all would that be enough he could feel something pulling on him tugging him northward rand would need him soon he turned ready to bolt as someone approached across the top of the knob but it was not the deathwatch guards it was just leatherfaced jur grady i fetched those soldiers for you grady said pointing mat could see a small force coming through a gateway to the traveling grounds near the palisade a hundred men of the band led by delarn flying a bloody red flag the redarms were accompanied by some five hundred people in worn clothing what was the point of this grady asked you sent those hundred to a village in the south to recruit i assume that and more i saved your life man mat thought trying to pick delarn out of the group and then you volunteer for this bloody fool delarn acted as if it were his fate take them upriver mat said the maps show there is only one good place to block the mora a narrow canyon a few leagues northeast of here all right grady said there will be channelers involved you will have to handle them mat said mostly though i want you to let those six hundred men and women defend the river dont risk your self too much let delarn and his people do the work pardon grady said but that doesnt seem like a very large force most of them arent trained soldiers i know what im doing mat said i hope grady nodded reluctantly and moved off egwene watched mat with curious eyes we cant fall back from this fight mat said softly we dont retreat there isnt anywhere to go we stand here or we lose it all there is always a retreat egwene said no mat said not anymore he rested his ashandarei on his shoulder his other hand out palm forward he scanned the landscape memories appearing as if from light and dust before him rion at hune hill naath and the san dma shadar the fall of pipkin hundreds upon hundreds of battlefields hundreds of victories thousands of deaths mat watched figments of memories flash across the field have you spoken to the supply masters were out of food egwene we cant win a protracted war fighting and falling back the enemy will overwhelm us if we do that just like eyal in the marches of maighande we are at our strongest now broken though we are fall back and we resign ourselves to starvation as the trollocs destroy us rand egwene said we just have to hold out until he is victorious thats true in a fashion mat said turning toward the heights in his minds eye he saw what could come the possibilities he imagined riders on the heights like shadows he would lose if he tried to hold those heights but maybe if rand loses it wont matter the wheel is bloody broken and we all become nothing if were lucky well we cant do anything more about it but heres the thing if he does what hes supposed to we could still losewe will lose if we dont stop the shadows armies he blinked seeing it the entire battlefield spread before him fighting at the ford arrows from the palisade we cant just beat them egwene mat said we cant just stand and hold on we have to destroy them drive them away then hunt them to the last trolloc we cant just survive we have to win how are we going to do that egwene asked mat youre not talking sense werent you just saying yesterday how outnumbered well be he looked toward the bog imagining shadows trying to slog through it shadows of dust and memory i have to change it all he said he could not do what they would expect he could not do what spies might have reported he was planning blood and bloody ashes one last toss of the dice everything we have piled into a heap a group of men in dark armor came through a gateway to the top of the knob panting deeply as if theyd had to chase down a damane to get them up here their breastplates were lacquered a deep red but this batch did not need a fearsome display to be frightening they looked furious enough to scramble eggs with a stare you said the lead deathwatch guard a man named gelen pointing at mat are needed at the mat held up a hand to cut him off i will not be denied again gelen said i have orders from mat shot the man a glare and he stopped short mat turned northward again a cool somehow familiar wind blew across him rippling his long coat brushing at his hat he narrowed his eye rand was tugging on him the dice still tumbled in his head theyre here mat said what did you say egwene asked theyre here the scouts the scouts are wrong mat said he looked up and noticed a pair of taken speeding back toward the camp they had seen it the trollocs must have marched through the night sharans will come first mat thought to give the trollocs a breather theyll have arrived through gateways send runners mat said pointing at the deathwatch guards get the men and women to their posts and warn elayne that im going to change the battle plan what egwene said theyre here mat said turning on the guards why arent you bloody running go go above the raken screeched gelen to his credit saluted then ranpounding in that massive armorwith his companions this is it egwene mat said take a deep breath a last pull on the brandy or burn your final pinch of tabac have a good look at the ground before you as its soon going to be covered in blood in an hour well be in the thick of it the light watch over us all perrin drifted in darkness he felt so tired slayer still lives a piece of himself thought graendal is corrupting the great captains the end is near you cant slip away now hold on hold on to what he tried to open his eyes but was so exhausted he should should have gotten out of the wolf dream sooner his entire body felt numb except except for his side moving fingers that felt like bricks he touched the warmth his hammer it was blazing hot that warmth seemed to move up his fingers and perrin took a deep breath he needed to wake up he hovered at the edges of consciousness as when he was close to sleep but still partially aware in that state he felt as if he faced a forked pathway before him one path led deeper into darkness and one led he couldnt see but he knew that it meant it meant waking up warmth from the hammer radiated up his arm his mind gathered sharpness awaken that was what slayer had done he had awakened somehow perrins life was trickling away not much time left half within deaths embrace he gritted his teeth drew in a deep breath and forced himself to wake the silence of the wolf dream shattered perrin hit soft earth and entered a place of shouts something about a battlefront about preparing the lines nearby someone cried out and then someone else and others perrin he knew that voice perrin lad master luhhan perrins eyelids felt so heavy he couldnt open them arms grabbed him hang on i have you lad i have you hang on chapter the last battle dawn broke that morning on polov heights but the sun did not shine on the defenders of the light out of the west and out of the north came the armies of darkness to win this one last battle and cast a shadow across the earth to usher in an age where the wails of suffering would go unheard from the notebook of loial son of arent son of halan the fourth age lan held his sword aloft as he galloped mandarb through camp above the morning clouds began to bleed red reflecting enormous fireballs rising from the massive sharan army that was approaching from the west they arced in the sky gracefully seeming slow because of the great distance groups of riders broke out of the camp joining lan the remaining malkieri rode just behind him but his force had swelled like a tide andere joined him at the front the flag of malkierthe golden craneacting as a banner for all of the borderlands they had been bloodied but not beaten knock a man down and you saw what he was made of that man might run if he didntif he stood back up with blood at the corner of his mouth and determination in his eyes then you knew that man was about to become truly dangerous the fireballs seemed to move more quickly as they dropped crashing to the camp in bursts of red fury explosions shook the ground nearby screams rose to accompany the thunder of hoofbeats still men joined him mat cauthon had spread word through all of the camps that more cavalry were needed to join lans advance and replace lost soldiers he had also disclosed the cost of doing so the cavalry would be at the forefront of the fighting breaking trolloc and sharan lines and would find little rest theyd carry the brunt of the casualties this day still men joined him borderlanders who should have been too old to ride merchants who had put aside the money pouch and taken up the sword a surprising number of southerners including many women wearing breastplates and steel or leather caps carrying spears there werent enough lances to go around half of those joining look like farmers more than soldiers andere called to him over the hoofbeats have you ever seen a man or woman from the two rivers ride andere lan yelled back i cant say that i have watch and be surprised lans cavalry reached the river mora where a man with long curling hair wearing a black coat stood with hands clasped behind his back logain now had forty aes sedai and ashaman with him he eyed lans force then raised a hand toward the sky crumpling an enormous falling fireball as if it were a piece of paper the sky cracked like lightning and the breaking fireball gushed sparks to every side smoke churning in the air ashes drifted down burning out hitting the rushing river and scattering black and white on its surface lan slowed mandarb as he approached hawal ford just south of the heights logain thrust his other hand toward the river the waters churned then lurched up into the air as if flowing over an invisible ramp they crashed down on the other side a violent waterfall while some of the water spilled over the banks of the river lan nodded to logain and continued on guiding mandarb under the waterfall and crossing the stillwet rocks of the ford sunlight filtered through the river waters above sparkling down on lan as he thundered through the tunnel andere and the malkieri behind him the waterfall roared down to his left spraying a mist of water lan shivered as he burst back out into the light then charged through the corridor toward the sharans to his right rose the heights to his left the bogs but there was a passage of solid level ground here up on the heights archers crossbowmen and dragoners prepared to release volleys at the oncoming foes sharans at the front a huge force of trollocs gathering up behind all directly west of the heights the thunder of dragonfire shook the air from the top of the heights and soon the sharans had explosions of their own to contend with lan set his lance took aim at a sharan soldier charging toward polov heights then braced himself elayne whipped her head up turning to the side that terrible song a croon a hum beautiful yet terrible at the same time she heeled moonshadow drawn toward that soft sound where was it it rose from somewhere deeper in the seanchan camp at the base of dashar knob chewing out mat for not telling her his plan of war could wait she needed to find the source of that sound that wonderful sound that elayne birgitte said elayne kicked her horse forward elayne draghkar draghkar elayne shook herself then looked up to find the creatures falling like drops of water into the camp around them guardswomen lowered their swords eyes opening wide as the crooning continued elayne wove a thunderclap it burst from her splitting the air washing across the guardswomen and making them cry out and cover their ears pain stabbed elaynes head and she cursed closing her eyes at the shock and then then she heard nothing that was the point she forced her eyes open to see draghkar all around with their spindly bodies and inhuman eyes they opened their lips to croon but elaynes deafened ears could not hear the song she smiled then wove whips of fire striking the creatures down she could not hear their screeches of pain which was a pity elaynes guardswomen rallied rising from knees lowering hands from ears she could tell from their dazed looks that they had been deafened birgitte soon had them striking at the surprised draghkar three of the creatures tried to leap up and fly away but birgitte took each one with a whitefletched arrow dropping the last so that it crashed into a nearby tent elayne waved getting birgittes attention the first draghkar sounds hadnt come from above but from farther into camp elayne pointed kicking moonshadow into motion leading her troops among the seanchan all about men lay staring into the sky mouths open many seemed to be breathing but they stared with dead eyes the draghkar had consumed their souls but left the bodies alive like the crust cut off a rich mans bread sloppy this group of draghkarlight there were well over a hundred of themcould have taken a man each killed him then retreated before their presence was discovered the distant roars of the battlethe bleating horns the booming dragons the hissing fireballs all of which elayne now felt but could only barely make out with her broken earshad covered the draghkar attack the creatures could have struck and fled but they were greedy her guards scattered hacking at the surprised draghkarmany of whom were holding soldiers the beasts were not strong fighters if measured by strength of arm elayne waited preparing weaves those draghkar who tried to flee she burned from the sky once the last of them were deadat least the ones they could see elayne waved birgitte to approach the air smelled sharply of burned flesh elayne wrinkled her nose and reached down from horseback to take birgittes head in her hands healing the womans ears the babes kicked as she did so did they react to times when she healed someone or was that her fancy elayne reached down to hold her stomach with one arm as birgitte stepped back looking about the warder nocked an arrow and elayne felt her alarm birgitte loosed and a draghkar stumbled back from cover inside a nearby tent a seanchan stumbled out eyes glassed over the feeding had been interrupted halfway through the poor fellow would never be right in the mind again elayne turned her horse and saw some seanchan troops charging into the area birgitte spoke to them then turned to speak to elayne elayne just shook her head and birgitte hesitated then said something else to the seanchan elaynes guards grouped around her again watching the seanchan with distrust elayne understood the sentiment perfectly birgitte waved her forward and they continued on in the direction they had been going as they did a damane and suldam approached and surprisinglycurtsied to elayne perhaps this fortuona had given them orders to respect foreign monarchs elayne hesitated but what was she going to do she could return to her own camp for healing but that would take time and it was urgent that she speak with mat what was the point of spending days drawing up war plans if he was going to throw them aside she trusted himlight she had tobut shed still rather know what he intended to do she sighed then held out her foot to the damane the woman frowned then glanced to the suldam both seemed to take it as an insult elayne had certainly intended it as one the suldam nodded and her damane reached to touch elaynes leg just above her booted foot elaynes sturdy boots looked like something a soldier would wear not a queen but she didnt intend to ride into battle wearing slippers a small icy shock of healing ran through her and her hearing returned slowly the low pitches returned first explosions the distant boom of dragonfire the rush of the river nearby several seanchan talking midranges came next then a flood of sound flaps rustling screams of soldiers calls of horns tell them to heal the others elayne said to birgitte birgitte raised an eyebrow probably wondering why elayne wouldnt just give the order herself well these seanchan paid very close attention to which people could speak to one another elayne would not give them the honor of speaking to them directly birgitte relayed the order and the suldam s lips drew to a line she had had the sides of her hair shaved she was highborn light willing elayne had managed to insult her again i will do it the woman said though why any of you would want to be healed by an animal is beyond me the seanchan didnt believe in letting damane heal at least that was what they kept claimingthat hadnt stopped them from reluctantly teaching the weaves to their captive women now that theyd seen firsthand what an advantage it was in battle from what elayne had heard the highborn rarely accepted that healing however lets go elayne said riding forward she waved for her soldiers to stay behind and be healed birgitte eyed her but did not object the two of them hurried on birgitte mounting her horse and riding with elayne toward the seanchan command building one story perhaps the size of a small farmhouse it sat in a large highwalled cleft at the southern base of dashar knobtheyd moved it from the top as mat worried it would be too exposed the top would continue to be used for overseeing the battle at short intervals elayne allowed birgitte to help her dismountlight but she was starting to feel unwieldy it was as if she were a ship in dry dock she took a moment to properly compose herself smooth features emotions in control she picked at her hair straightened her dress then walked into the building what she bellowed as she stepped in in the name of a bloody twofingered trolloc haystackgrunter do you think you are doing matrim cauthon unsurprisingly the curse made the man grin as he looked up from the map table he wore his hat and coat over some very nice silken clothing that looked as if it had been tailored to match the hats color and to include tooled leather at the cuffs and collar so as to not be so out of place it smelled of some kind of compromise why was his hat banded with pink ribbon though hello elayne mat said i figured that i could look forward to seeing you soon he waved to a chair bearing the red and gold of andor at the side of the room it was extra cushioned with a cup of warm tea steaming on the stand beside it burn you matrim cauthon she thought when did you grow so clever the seanchan empress sat on her own throne at the head of the room min at her side draped in enough green silk to supply a shop in caemlyn for two weeks elayne did not miss the fact that fortuonas throne was two fingers higher than elaynes bloody insufferable woman mat there are draghkar in your camp burn it he said where i should say there were draghkar in your camp elayne said we dealt with them you need to tell your archers to keep better watch ive told them mat complained bloody ashes somebody check on the archers i great prince a seanchan messenger said skidding through the doorway he went to his knees then prostrated himself with a smooth motion never stopping his narrative archer bank is down hit by sharan outriders they masked their attack by smoke from fireballs blood and bloody ashes mat said send sixteen damane and suldam down there now send to the northern archery units and bring squads fortytwo and fifty down and tell the scouts ill have them flogged if they let anything like this happen again great one the scout said saluting and scrambling to his feet backing out of the room without looking up to avoid the risk of meeting mats gaze all in all elayne was impressed by how easily the scout mixed his obeisance and his report she was also sickened no ruler should demand such of her subjects a nations strength came from the strength of its people break them and you were breaking your own back you knew i was coming elayne said after mat gave a few more orders to his aides and you anticipated the anger your changing of plans would cause burn you matrim cauthon why did you feel the need to do this i thought our battle plan was sound it was mat said then why change it elayne mat said glancing at her everyone put me in charge against my will because i cant have my mind changed by the forsaken right that was the general idea elayne said though id guess it has less to do with that medallion of yours and more to do with you having too thick a head for compulsion to penetrate bloody right mat said anyway if the forsaken are using compulsion on people in our camps they probably have a few spies in our meetings i suppose so so they know our plan our great plan that we spent so long preparing they know it elayne hesitated light mat said shaking his head the first and most important rule to winning a war is knowing what your enemy is going to do i though the first rule was to know your terrain elayne said folding her arms that too anyway i realize that if the enemy knows what were going to do we have to change immediately bad battle plans are better than ones your enemy will anticipate why didnt you guess this would happen elayne demanded he looked at her expressionless one side of his mouth twitched up then he pulled his hat down shading his eyepatch light elayne said you knew you spent this whole week planning with us and you knew the entire time youd throw it out with the dishwater thats giving me too much bloody credit mat said looking back at his maps i think a part of me might have known all along but i didnt figure it out until just before the sharans got here so what is the new plan he didnt reply youre going to keep it in your head elayne said her legs feeling weak youre going to lead the battle and none of us are going to know what in the light youre planning are we otherwise someone might overhear and the news would travel to the shadow he nodded creator shelter us she whispered mat scowled you know thats what tuon said on the heights uno held his ears as the nearby dragons belched fire at the trollocs and sharans west of them the scent of something pungent burned in the air and the blasts were so deafening he couldnt hear his own bloody cursing down below lan mandragorans riders were sweeping the sides of the assault force keeping them contained so that the dragons could do more damage the sharans had trollocs with them theyd have channelers with them too lots of them farther upriver another large army of trollocs the ones that had done so much damage to dai shans forces had come down from the northeast and would soon reach the field of merrilor the dragons stilled momentarily the dragoners stuffing the maws again with whatever it was that made them work uno wasnt going to step bloody close to them bad luck those were he was certain of it the leader of the dragoners was a wiry cairhienin and uno had never had much use for those folk they bloody scowled at him whenever he talked this one sat haughtily upon his horse and didnt flinch when the dragons fired again the amyrlin seat had thrown her lot in with these men and with the seanchan too uno wasnt going to flaming complain they needed every sword they could get cairhienin and bloody seanchan included you like our dragons captain the leadertalmanescalled to uno captain uno had bloody been promoted he now led a force of newly recruited tower pikemen and light cavalry he shouldnt have been in charge of bloody anything he had been happy as a regular soldier but he had both training and battle experience things that were in slim supply these days or so queen elayne had said so now he was a flaming officer and leading cavalry and foot soldiers no less well he knew his way around a pike if he had to use one though he usually preferred to fight on horseback his men were ready to defend the rim of the heights should the enemy make it up the slope so far the archers situated in front of the dragoners had prevented that but soon enough the archers would have to pull back and then it would be bloody regular soldiers doing the bloody fighting below the sharans pulled aside to let the main trolloc forces storm up onto the slope the pikemen would advance resisting the trolloc attack and pikes would work well here as the trollocs would be pushing uphill add in some flaming cavalry on their flanks and some bloody archers shooting through those gateways made high up in the air and they could probably sit here for days maybe weeks when they were pushed off by superior numbers theyd let go inch by inch clinging to every speck of ground uno figured there was no way he was going to survive this flaming battle he was surprised hed made it this long really flaming masema should have had his head or the seanchan near falme or a trolloc here and there he had tried to keep himself lean so hed taste flaming terrible when they stuffed him in one of those flaming cookpots the dragons fired again blasting enormous holes in the hordes of advancing trollocs uno clapped his hands to his ears warn a man when you do that you flaming bits hanging from a goats the next shot drowned him out the trollocs below were blown into the air the dragons pulverizing the ground beneath them those eggs exploded once they were shot from those cursed tubes what kind of thing other than the one power could make metal explode uno was certain he flaming didnt want to know talmanes stepped up to the rim of the heights inspecting the damage he was joined by a taraboner woman the one who had invented these weapons she looked over and saw uno then tossed him something a small bit of wax the taraboner woman tapped her ear then began speaking with talmanes gesturing he might have command of the troops but the woman had charge of the devices she told the men where to position the dragons to fight uno grumbled but pocketed the wax a fist of trollocs had pushed through the blast about a hundred strong and he didnt have time to bother with his ears uno grabbed a pike leveling it and signaling for his men to do the same they all wore the white of the tower uno himself wore a white tabard he shouted orders readying his pike by standing sideways near the top of the slope the heel of its shaft raised one hand gripped the shaft in front of him to guide and reinforce the thrust the other hand palm down gripping it an arms length from the heel would drive home the thrust as the trollocs came into range several ranks of pikemen behind uno stood ready to advance following the initial impact steady with the pikes you flaming sheepherders uno bellowed steady the trollocs scrambled up the hill crashing into the line of pikes the beasts in the vanguard tried to knock the pikes aside with sweeps of their weapons but unos men stepped forward skewering trollocs often two pikes per beast uno grunted pulling his pike back into line to catch a trolloc through the throat first rank back uno yelled pulling his pike backward to free it from the trolloc hed killed his companions did the same pulling their weapons free and leaving the corpses to roll down the slope the pikemen in the front rank fell back as those in the second rank came forward between them ramming pikes into snarling trollocs each rank rotated up front in succession until minutes later the entire group of trollocs was dead nice work uno said raising his pike to the upright position a trickle of rancid trolloc blood winding down the shaft from the pike head nice work he glanced toward the dragoners who were feeding more eggs down those tubes he hastily pulled the wax out of his pocket yes they could hold this flaming position they could hold it well they just needed to a cry from above stopped him from putting the wax in something thumped to the ground beside uno a lead ball with streamers dropped from high up flaming seanchan goat uno yelled looking up and shaking his fist that nearly took me in the crown you lover of rotting worms the raken flew off probably without its rider hearing a word of what uno had shouted bloody seanchan he stooped down removing the letter from the ball retreat down the southwestern slope of the heights youre bloody kicking me uno muttered kicking me in the head while im sleeping allin you bloody fool can you read this allin a darkhaired andorman wore a halfbeard shaved at the sides uno had always thought those looked flaming ridiculous retreat allin said now theyve flaming lost their minds uno said nearby talmanes and the taraboner woman were receiving a messengerand she was relaying the same news by the looks of the taraboner womans scowl retreat cauthon had better bloody know what hes doing uno said shaking his head he still didnt understand why anyone would put cauthon in charge of anything he remembered that boy always snapping at people eyes sunken in his head halfdead halfspoiled uno shook his head but hed do it hed sworn to the bloody white tower so hed do it pass the word he said to allin stuffing the wax in his ears as aludra at the dragons prepared a last volley before leaving were pulling back from the bloody heights and a clap of sound hit uno physically vibrating through him bloody near stopping his heart his head hit the ground before he realized hed fallen he blinked dust from his eyes groaning and rolling over as another flash then another struck the heights where the dragons were lightning his soldiers were down on their knees eyes shut hands over ears talmanes was already up however shouting orders that uno could barely hear waving for his men to pull back a dozen fireballs enormous and incredibly fast rose from the sharan army behind the trollocs uno cursed and threw himself in a depression for cover rolling into place moments before the entire hill shook like an earthquake clods of earth fell upon him almost burying him everything was coming at them everything every bloody sharan channeler in the army seemed to focus on the heights at once his people had aes sedai placed to protect the dragons but from the look of things they would be hardpressed to fight back against that the attack lasted for what seemed an eternity when it subsided uno crawled free some of the flaming dragons were in pieces and aludra was working with the dragoners to salvage those and protect the rest talmanes holding a bloody hand to his head was shouting uno pried the wax from one of his earsthat had probably saved his hearingand scrambled toward talmanes where are your bloody aes sedai uno shouted theyre bloody supposed to be stopping this they had four dozen of them ordered to cut weaves from the air or knock them aside to protect the dragons they had claimed to be able to keep the heights safe from anything but the coming of the dark one now they were in shambles the lightning strikes having fallen in their midst trollocs were advancing up the hill again uno ordered allin to form the pikewall and hold the creatures back then ran toward the aes sedai with a few guards he joined warders helping the women up looking for their leader kwamesa sedai uno asked finding the aes sedai in charge who was dusting herself off the slender darkskinned arafellin was muttering softly under her breath what was that she demanded uh uno said that question wasnt intended for you she said scanning the sky einar why didnt you spot those weaves an ashaman rushed over they came so quickly they were upon us before i had time to give warning and light whoever sent them was strong stronger than ive ever seen stronger than a line of light split the air behind them it was enormous as long as the keep of fal dara it rotated upon itself opening a vast gateway that split the ground at the center of the heights standing on the other side was a man in brilliant armor made of silver coinlike rings his helmetless head bearing dark hair and a strong nose he held before him a scepter of gold the top shaped like an hourglass or a fine goblet kwamesa reacted immediately raising her hand and releasing a stream of fire the man waved his hand and the stream of fire deflected then he pointedalmost indifferentlyand something thin hot and white connected him to kwamesa her form glowed and then she was gone motes drifting toward the ground uno jumped away einar joining him as he rolled behind the rubble of a broken dragon i come for the dragon reborn the figure in silver announced you will send for him either that or i will see that your screams bring him the ground beneath the dragons heaved into the air just a few feet from uno he threw his arm up in front of his face bits of wood and soil flying across him light help us einar said im trying to stop him but hes in a circle a full circle seventytwo ive never seen such power before i a bar of whitehot light cut through the broken dragon vaporizing it and striking einar the man was gone in an instant and uno scrambled back cursing he ducked away as the wreckage of dragons crashed to the ground around him uno yelled for his men to fall back whipping them into motion delaying only long enough to grab a wounded man under the arm and help him away he no longer questioned the order to retreat from the heights it was the finest bloody order any man had ever given logain ablar released the one power he stood beside the mora below the heights and felt the attacks up above releasing the one power today was one of the most difficult things hed ever done more difficult than the decision to name himself dragon more difficult than keeping himself from strangling taim during their early days together in the black tower the power drained out of him as if his veins had been opened and he was bleeding out across the ground he took a deep breath holding that much of the one powerthat of thirtynine people in a circlehad been intoxicating letting go reminded him of his gentling when the power had been stolen from him when every breath had encouraged him to find a knife and slit his own throat he suspected this was his madness the terror that releasing the one power would cause him to lose it forever logain androl asked logain turned his head toward the shorter man and his companions they were loyal logain didnt know why but they were loyal the whole lot of them fools faithful fools can you feel that androl asked the otherscanler emarin jonnethwere staring at the heights the power being released there it was amazing demandred emarin said it must be him logain nodded slowly such power even one of the forsaken could not be so strong he must carry a saangreal of immense strength with such a tool his thoughts whispered no man or woman could ever take the power from you again taim had done it during logains imprisonment held him captive shielded unable to touch the one power the attempts to turn him had been painful crushing but being without saidin strength he thought watching that powerful channeling the lust to be so strong almost drowned out his hatred of taim for now we will not engage him logain said split yourselves into the prearranged teams those would be one woman and five or six men in each team the woman and two men could form a circle while the other two offered support we will hunt the traitors of the black tower pevara standing at androls side raised an eyebrow you mean to go hunting taim already didnt cauthon want you here to help move men ive made it clear to cauthon logain said i will not spend this battle delivering soldiers around the field as for orders we have a directive from the dragon reborn himself rand althor had called them his last orders for them a note delivered with a small angreal of a man holding a sword the shadow has stolen the seals of the dark ones prison find them if you can please find them during their captivity androl had heard what he thought was taim bragging about the seals it was their only lead logain scanned the distance their forces were retreating from the heights logain could not see the array of dragons from where he stood but the thick lines of smoke did not speak well for their safety he still gives orders logain thought am i inclined to obey them any longer for the chance at revenge on taim yes he would follow rand althors orders once he wouldnt have questioned doing so nearly as much that had been before his captivity and torture go logain said to his ashaman you have read what the lord dragon wrote we must recover the seals at all costs nothing is more important than this we must hope that taim indeed has them watch for signs of men channeling hunt them kill them it didnt matter if those men channeling were sharans the ashaman would help this battle by removing enemy channelers anyway they had discussed the tactic earlier when they sensed channeling from men they could use gateway jumps to pinpoint where they were then try to surprise them and attack if you see one of taims men logain said try to capture him so we can pry out of him where taim has set up his base he paused if were lucky the mhael himself will be here be wary that he might be carrying the seals it would not do to destroy them in our attack if you see him return and bring me word of his location logains teams moved off they left him with gabrelle arel malevin and karldin manfor it was well that at least some of his more skilled men had been absent from the tower during taims betrayal gabrelle looked at logain with level eyes what of toveine she asked we will kill her if we find her it is that simple for you yes she would you rather live gabrelle if you were she live and serve him she closed her mouth lips drawn tight she still feared him he could sense that good was this what you wished for his mind whispered when you raised the banner of the dragon when you sought to save mankind did you do it to be feared hated he ignored that voice the only times he had accomplished anything in life had come when hed been feared it was the only edge hed had against siuan and leane the primal logain that something deep inside that drove him to keep living needed people to fear him can you sense her gabrelle asked i released the bond her envy was sharp and immediate it shocked him he had thought that she was beginning to enjoy or at least suffer their place together but of course it was all an act so that she could try to manipulate him that was the aes sedai way yes he had felt lust from her before perhaps even affection he wasnt certain he could trust what he thought hed felt from her it seemed that for all he had tried to be strong and free his strings had been pulled since hed been a youngling demandreds channeling radiated strength such power a loud boom sounded from the heights logain laughed throwing his head back bodies like leaves were thrown off the heights and into the air link to me he commanded those who remained with him join me in a circle and let us hunt the mhael and his men as well light send that i can find himmy table deserves only the finest of meat the head stag himself and after that who knew he had always wanted to test himself against one of the forsaken logain seized the source again holding to the thrashings of saidin as if it were a serpent writhing and trying to bite him he used his angreal to draw more and then the power from the others streamed into him he laughed louder gawyn felt so tired this week of preparation would normally have rested him but he felt today as if hed hiked for tens of leagues there was no helping it he forced his attention toward the gateway in the table in front of him overlooking the battlefield youre certain they cannot see this he asked yukiri im certain she replied it has been tested exhaustively she was becoming skilled with these viewing gateways she had created this one on top of a table brought through to their camp from tar valon he was looking down at the battleground as he would a map if you have truly made the other side invisible egwene said speculatively this might be useful indeed it would be easier to spot from up close yukiri admitted this one is so high in the sky that nobody below will be able to make it out gawyn didnt like egwene standing there head and shoulders hanging out over the battlefield he held his tongue the gateway was as safe as they could make it he couldnt protect her from everything light bryne said softly theyre cutting us to pieces gawyn glanced at him the man rebuffed suggestionseven strong onesthat he return to his estates he insisted that he was still capable of holding a sword he just couldnt be allowed to lead besides he argued any of them could be under compulsion in a way knowing that he was gave them an advantage at least him they could watch and siuan did holding to his arm protectively the only others in the tent were silviana and doesine the battle was not going well cauthon had lost the heights already the original plan had been to hold there as long as possibleand the dragons were in pieces demandreds attack with the one power had come far more powerfully than any of them had anticipated and the other large trolloc army had arrived from the northeast and were pressing cauthons defenders upriver what is he planning egwene said tapping the side of the table distant yells drifted through the opening if this keeps up our armies are going to be surrounded hes trying to bait the trap bryne said what kind of trap it is a guess bryne said and light knows my own assessment cannot be trusted as it once was it looks like cauthon is planning to heap everything into one battle no delaying no trying to wear the trollocs down the way this is going it will be decided in days maybe hours that sounds exactly like something mat would do egwene said resigned the strength of those weaves lelaine said that power demandred is in a circle egwene said eyewitnesses say a full circle something that hasnt been seen since the age of legends and he has a saangreal some of the soldiers saw ita scepter gawyn watched the fighting far below his hand on his sword he could hear men scream as demandred aimed wave after wave of fire at them the forsakens voice boomed suddenly reaching high into the air where are you lews therin you were seen at each of the other battlefields in disguise are you here too fight me gawyns hand tightened on his sword soldiers flooded down the southwestern side of the heights to cross the ford a few small groups held on the slopes and dragoners theretiny as insects to gawynled the remaining dragons to safety pulled by mules demandred flung destruction at the fleeing troops he was an army unto himself hurling bodies into the air exploding horses burning and destroying around him his trollocs seized the high ground their brutish cheers floated through the gateway were going to have to deal with him mother silviana said soon hes trying to draw us out egwene said he has that saangreal we could build a circle of seventytwo ourselves but what then fall into his trap be slaughtered what choice have we mother lelaine asked light hes killing thousands killing thousands and here they stood gawyn stepped back nobody seemed to notice his withdrawal other than yukiri who eagerly stepped up and took his place beside egwene gawyn slipped out of the tent and when the tent guards glanced at him said he needed some fresh air egwene would approve she sensed how tired he was lately shed mentioned it to him several times his eyelids felt as if they had weights of iron pulling them down gawyn looked toward the blackened sky he could hear the distant booms how long would he just stand around and do nothing while men died you promised he thought to himself you said you were willing to stand in her shadow that didnt mean he had to stop doing important work did it he fished in his pouch and took out a ring of the bloodknives he put it on and immediately his strength returned his exhaustion fleeing he hesitated then took out the other rings and slipped them on as well on the south bank of the river mora in front of the ruins northeast of dashar knob tam althor summoned the void as kimtin had taught him all of those years ago tam imagined the single flame and poured his emotions into it he grew calm then the calmness left him leaving nothing like a newly painted wall beautiful and white that had just been washed everything melted away tam was the void he drew his bow the good black yew bending arrow to his cheek he took aim but this was only a formality when he was this strongly within the void the arrow would do exactly as he commanded he didnt know this any more than the sun knew that it would rise or the branches knew that their leaves would fall these were not things known they were things that were he released bowstring snapping arrow drilling through the air another followed then another he had five in the air at once each one aimed in anticipation of the shifting winds the first five trollocs fell as they tried to make their way across one of several of the raft bridges they had managed to place on the river here trollocs hated water even shallow water daunted them whatever mat had done to protect the river upstream it was working for now and the river was still flowing the shadow would try to stop it was trying to stop it occasionally a trolloc or mule carcass floated past from far upriver tam continued to launch arrows abell and the other two rivers men joining him sometimes they aimed into the mass not picking out an individual trollocthough that was rare a regular soldier might shoot unsighted and assume his arrow would find flesh but not a good two rivers archer arrows were cheap to soldiers but not to woodsmen trollocs fell in waves beside tam and the two rivers men crossbowmen cranked their weapons and loosed wave after wave into the shadowspawn fades behind whipped at the trollocs trying to urge them across the riverwith little success tams arrow hit a fade right where its eyes should have been nearby a large man named bayrd whistled in appreciation leaning on his axe and watching the arrows fall he was part of the group of soldiers set just behind the archers to move in and protect them once the trollocs were forced to cross bayrd was one of the mercenary leaders who had drifted into the army and though he was an andoran neither he nor the hundred or so men he led would speak of where theyd come from i need to get one of those bows bayrd said to his companions burn me do you see that nearby abell and azi smiled continuing to shoot tam did not smile there was no humor within the void though outside of the void a thought did flutter tam knew why abell and azi had smiled having a two rivers bow did not make one into a two rivers archer i think galad damodred said from horseback nearby that youd likely do more harm to yourself than to the enemy should you try to use one of those althor how long tam released another arrow five more he said reaching for the next arrow in his side quiver he raised it shot it then continued two three four five five more trollocs dead in all hed loosed over thirty arrows hed missed once but only because abell had killed the trolloc that tam had aimed for archers halt tam yelled the two rivers men pulled back tam releasing the void as a straggling group of trollocs stumbled onto the riverbank tam still led perrins troops to an extent whitecloaks ghealdanin and the wolf guard all looked to tam for final say but each had their own leaders as well he personally commanded the archers perrin youd better heal up strong when haral had found the boy lying in the grass on the outskirts of camp the day before bloodied and near death light that had given them all a fright perrin was safely in mayene where he would likely spend the rest of the last battle a man didnt quickly recover from the type of wound the lad had taken even with aes sedai healing it would probably drive perrin near mad to miss the fighting but sometimes that happened it was part of being a soldier tam and the archers retreated back to the ruins to get a better vantage to watch the battle and he organized his archers in case they were needed while runners brought them more arrows mat had positioned all of perrins troops alongside the dragonsworn led by tinna a statuesque woman tam had no idea where shed come from or why she was in commandshe had the bearing of a lady the build of an aiel and the coloring of a saldaean the others seemed to listen to her dragonsworn made little sense to tam so he stayed out of their way tams army had been told to hold mat had expected the sharan and trolloc attack from the west to be the strongest therefore tam was surprised to see mat sending more reinforcements upriver from the ford the whitecloaks were a recent arrival and their clothing rippled as they charged along the riverbank cutting through the trollocs stumbling off their unstable bridges arrows started to fly from the trollocs on the other bank toward galad and his men the clanks and pings of arrowheads on the whitecloak armor and shields sounded like hail on a roof tam ordered arganda to bring in their foot soldiers including bayrd and the mercenaries they didnt have enough pikes so argandas men held halberds and spears men began to scream and die trollocs howling near tams rearward position alliandre came riding up surrounded by wellarmed foot soldiers tam raised the bow to her and she nodded then settled back to watch she had wanted to be here for the battle tam couldnt blame her nor could he blame her for ordering her soldiers to carry her off at the first sign that this battle was turning against them tam tam dannil came riding up and tam waved for abell to take command of the archers he strode over to dannil meeting the lad in the shade of the ruins inside those broken walls tams reserves watched the battle with nervousness most of them were archers pulled from among the mercenaries and dragonsworn many of that latter group had never been in battle before well neither had most of the two rivers men until a few months back theyd learn quickly hitting a trolloc with an arrow wasnt so different from hitting a deer though if you missed the deer it didnt gut you with a sword a few seconds later what is it dannil tam asked word from mat hes sending you infantry banners from the legion of the dragon dannil said he says to hold the river here no matter what what is that boy up to tam said looking toward the heights the legion of the dragon had good infantry welltrained crossbowmen who would be useful here but what was happening on the heights the flashes of light reflected off columns of thick black smoke rising from the heights toward the clouds above the fighting was in earnest up there i dont know tam dannil said mat hes changed i hardly think i know him any longer he was always a bit of a scoundrel but now light tam hes like someone from one of the stories tam grunted weve all changed mat would probably say similar things about you dannil laughed oh i doubt that tam though i do wonder sometimes what would have happened if id gone with the three of them i mean moiraine sedai was looking for boys the right age and i guess i was just a little too old he seemed wistful dannil could say and think what he wantedbut tam doubted he would have liked to endure the things that had forced mat perrin and rand to become the people they now were take command of this lot tam said nodding to the reserve archers ill see that arganda and galad know were being reinforced thick trolloc arrows sprayed around pevara as she desperately wove air her gust blew away the arrows like stones swept off the board by a furious player sweating she clung to saidar and wove a stronger shield of air moving it into the sky to defend against further volleys its safe she yelled go a group of soldiers dashed out from underneath an overhang on the steep riverside slope of the heights more thick black shafts fell from above they hit her shield it slowed them to the point that once they passed through they dropped as idly as feathers the soldiers shed helped dashed for the rallying point at hawal ford others decided to stand and fight as trolloc bands poured down the slopes most of the shadowspawn stayed atop the heights to secure the position and finish pushing humans off where androls furious thought came to her a soft whisper inside her mind here she sent him not completely a thought more an image a sense of place a gateway split beside her and he dashed through emarin on his heels both men carried swords but emarin spun and thrust his hand backward a streak of fire shooting through the open gateway screaming sounded from the other side human screaming you went all the way to the sharan army pevara demanded logain wanted us to stay together so you care about what he wants now androl asked grinning youre insufferable she thought around them arrows clattered to the ground the trollocs above hooted in anger nice weave androl said thank you she glanced at the sword im a warder now he shrugged might as well look like one eh he could cut a trolloc in half with a gateway at three hundred paces and summon fire from inside dragonmount itself and he still wanted to carry a sword it was she decided a male thing i heard that androl sent her emarin to me pevara sedai if youd graciously agree to accompany us she sniffed but joined the other two as they moved along the southwestern base of the heights passing some wounded stumbling toward the rallying point androl glanced at them then wove a gateway back to their camp the flagging men cried out in surprise and thanks and shambled through it to safety androl had grown more confident since they had left the black tower when theyd first met hed displayed hesitation about whatever he did a kind of nervous humility no more androl emarin said pointing up the slope with his sword i see them androl said above trollocs poured over the top of the heights like pitch boiling over the side of a pot behind androls gateway closed that group of soldiers safe others cried out as they saw it close you cant save them all pevara thought sternly to androl sensing his spike of anguish stay focused on the task at hand the three of them moved through the soldiers angling toward several channelers they could feel ahead jonneth canler and theodrin were there throwing fire at groups of trollocs their position was being overrun jonneth canler to me androl said charging past them and opening a gateway in front of him pevara and emarin ducked through after him finding themselves on the top of the heights a few hundred paces away jonneth and the others followed joining them as the group dashed past a group of startled trollocs channeling pevara yelled light but it was hard to run in these skirts androl did know that didnt he androl opened another gateway for them as a few bursts of flame came from the direction of some sharans atop the heights pevara ran through beginning to pant they appeared on the other side of the sharans who were firing at where pevara had been moments before pevara opened her senses trying to spotor feeltheir quarry the sharans turned on them and pointed but then cried out as androl brought an avalanche of snow down on them from a gateway to the side he had tried making those deathgates that the other ashaman used but the weave was apparently just different enough that he had trouble instead he stuck to what he was good at doing groups of tower guards still fought atop the heights holding ground against orders pieces of the dragons including the large bronze firing tubes lay smoldering nearby amid burned corpses thousands upon thousands of trollocs howled most at the edges of the heights loosing arrows on those below their joyous roars set pevara on edge and she wove earth and sent the flows toward the ground near a group of them a large chunk of ground trembled then split off dumping two dozen trollocs over the edge were drawing attention again emarin said setting ablaze a myrddraal that had been slinking toward them it thrashed in the flames screeching in an inhuman voice refusing to die sweating pevara lent her fire to emarins burning the creature until it was nothing more than bones well thats not all bad androl said if we draw enough attention sooner or later one of the black ajah or one of taims men will decide to confront us jonneth cursed thats a little like jumping into an anthill and waiting to be bitten actually its a lot like that androl said keep watch ill deal with the trollocs thats quite a strong assertion pevara sent to him his answer was warm like heat off a cooking plate it sounded heroic i assume you could use some added strength yes please he sent she iniated the link he drew in her strength taking control of their circle as always linking with him was an overwhelming experience she felt her own emotions bounce back against him and to her again and that made her blush did he sense how she was starting to regard him foolish as a girl in kneelength skirts she thought at herselfcareful to shield her thoughts from himbarely old enough to know the difference between boys and girls and in the middle of a war too she found it hard to steel her emotionsas an aes sedai should while linked with androl their selves mixed like swirling paints poured in the same bowl she fought against it determined to maintain her own identity this was vital when linking and she had been taught it time and time again androl flung his hand forward at a group of trollocs that had begun loosing arrows at him the gateway went up consuming the arrows she glanced about and found them falling on another group of trollocs gateways opened in the ground dropping trollocs through making them appear hundreds of feet in the air a tiny gateway split the head off a myrddraal at the neck leaving it to thrash about pumping inky blood on the soil androls team stood near the western section of the heights where the dragons had once been positioned there were shadowspawn and sharans on all sides androl channeling she could feel it rising above them on the heights something powerful taim androls immediate flare of anger felt as if it would burn her away in it was the loss of friends and fury at betrayal by one who should have protected them careful she sent we dont know its him the one attacking them was in a circle with men and women otherwise pevara would not have been able to feel him of course she could only see the weaves of saidar a thick column of air struck at them fully a pace wide the heat of it enough to redden the rocky ground beneath androl put a gateway up in time barely catching the column of fire and directing it back the way it had come twin streams burned trolloc corpses and caused weeds and patches of grass to burst alight pevara didnt see what happened next androls gateway vanished as if ripped from him and an explosion of lightning struck right next to them pevara hit the ground in a heap androl slamming into her in that moment she let go of herself she did it by accident because of the shock of impact in most cases the link would have slipped away but androl had a powerful grip the dam holding back pevaras self from his own broke and they mixed it was like stepping through a mirror then looking back on herself she forcibly pulled herself out again but with an awareness she couldnt describe we need to get out of here she thought still linked with androl the others all seemed alive but that would not last long if their enemy brought more lightning pevara began the complex weave for a gateway by instinct though it wouldnt do anything androl was leading their circle so only he the gateway snapped open pevara gaped shed done that not him this was among the most complex most difficult and most powerintensive weaves she knew but shed done it as easily as waving her hand while in a circle someone else was leading theodrin stumbled through first the lithe domani woman tugged a stumbling jonneth after her through the gateway emarin followed limping one arm hanging uselessly at his side androl regarded the gateway stunned i thought you arent supposed to be able to channel if someone else is leading a circle you are in you arent she said i did it by accident accident but through the gateway you knothead pevara said shoving him toward it she followed then collapsed on the other side damodred i need you to stay where you are mat said he did not look up but he heard galads horse snort through the open gateway one is led to question your sanity cauthon galad replied mat finally looked up from his maps he was not sure he would ever grow accustomed to these gateways he stood in their command building the one tuon had erected in the cleft at the foot of dashar knob and there was a gateway in his wall outside it galad sat his horse wearing the gold and white of the children of the light he was still positioned near the ruins where a trolloc army was trying to push its way across the mora galad damodred was a man who could have used a few stiff drinks in him he could have been a statue with that pretty face and unchanging expression no statues had more life youll do as youre told mat said looking back to his maps you are to hold the river up there and do as tam tells you i dont care if you think your place isnt important enough very well galad said voice as cold as a corpse in the snow he turned his horse away and mika the damane closed the gateway its a bloodbath out there mat elayne said light her voice was colder than galads you all put me in charge let me do my job we made you commander of the armies elayne said you are not in charge trust an aes sedai to argue over every little word it he looked up frowning min had just said something softly to tuon what is it he asked i saw his body alone on a field min said as if dead matrim tuon said i am concerned for once we agree elayne said from her throne on the other side of the room mat their general is outmatching you its not so bloody simple mat said fingers on the maps its never that bloody simple the man leading the shadow was good very good its demandred mat thought im fighting one of the bloody forsaken together mat and demandred were composing a grand painting each responded to the others moves with subtle care mat was trying to use just a little too much red in one of his paints he wanted to paint the wrong picture but still a reasonable one it was hard he had to be capable enough to keep demandred back but weak enough to invite aggression a feint ever so subtle it was dangerous possibly disastrous he had to walk on a razor edge there was no way to avoid cutting his feet the question was not whether he would be bloodied but whether he would reach the other side or not move in the ogier mat said softly fingers on the map i want them to reinforce the men at the ford the aiel fought there guarding the way as the white towers men and the members of the band of the red hand retreated off the heights per his order the command was relayed to the ogier stay safe loial mat thought making a notation on the map where he had sent the ogier alert lan hes still on the western side of the heights i want him to swing around the back of the heights now that most of the shadows forces are on top and back toward the mora behind the other trolloc army trying to cross near the ruins hes not to engage them just stay out of sight and hold his position the messengers ran to do his bidding and he made another notation one of the sojhin brought him some kaf the cute one with the freckles he was too absorbed by the battle to smile at her sipping his kaf mat had the damane make him a gateway on the tabletop so he could see the battlefield itself he leaned out over it but kept one hand on the rim of the table only a bloody fool would let someone shove him through a hole two hundred feet over the ground he set down his kaf on a side table and took out his looking glass the trollocs were moving down the heights toward the bogs yes demandred was good the hulking beasts he had sent toward the bogs were slow but thick and powerful like a rockslide also a group of mounted sharans were about to ride down from the heights light cavalry they would hit mats troops holding hawal ford and keep them from attacking the trolloc left flank a battle was a sword fight on a grand scale for every move there was a counteroften three or four you responded by moving a squad here a squad there trying to counter what your enemy did while putting pressure on him in places where he was thin back and forth back and forth mat was outnumbered but he could use that relay the following to talmanes mat said eye still to the looking glass remember when you bet me i couldnt throw a coin into a cup from across the entire inn yes great one the seanchan messenger said mat had responded to the bet by saying he would try it once he was drunkerotherwise there would have been no sport to it then mat had pretended to get drunk and provoked talmanes to up the bet from silver to gold talmanes had figured him out and insisted he really drink i still owe him a few marks for that dont i mat thought absently he pointed the looking glass to the northern part of the heights a group of sharan heavy cavalry had gathered to move down the slope he could make out their long steeltipped lances they were preparing to charge down the slope to intercept lans men as they swung around the northern side of the heights but the order hadnt even reached lan yet it confirmed mats suspicions demandred not only had spies in the camp he had one in or near the command tent someone who could send messages as soon as mat gave orders that probably meant a channeler here inside the tent and masking their ability bloody ashes mat thought as if this werent tough enough the messenger returned from talmanes great one he said prostrating himself nose to the floor your man says that his forces are completely ruined he wishes to follow your order but says that the dragons will not be available for the rest of this day it will take weeks to repair them they are im sorry great one but these were his exact words they are worse off than a barmaid in sabinel i do not know what it means barmaids there work for tips mat said with a grunt but people in sabinel dont tip that was of course a lie sabinel was a town where mat had tried to make talmanes help him win over a pair of barmaids talmanes had suggested that mat feign a war wound to get sympathy good man the dragons could still fight but they probably looked busted up something good they had an advantage there nobody knew how they worked except mat and aludra bloody ashes and even he worried that each time one went off it would somehow blow up the wrong way five or six dragons were completely functional mat had pulled them through a gateway to safety aludra had those set up south of the ford aimed toward the heights mat would use them but leave the spy with the impression that the bulk of them had been destroyed talmanes could instead patch them up then mat could use them again but the moment i do he thought demandred will bring everything he has down on them it had to be just the right moment bloody ashes lately his life had been completely about trying to find the right moments he was running out of those kinds of moments for now he ordered aludra to use the halfdozen functional dragons to pound trollocs across the river who were coming down the southwestern slope of the heights she was far enough away from the heights and she would keep moving so demandred would have a difficult time pinpointing her and bringing the dragons down the smoke they made would obscure her position quickly mat elayne said from her throne on the side of the room he noticed with amusement that in shifting it about for comfort she had somehow gotten birgitte to wedge it up a few inches so she now sat exactly level with tuon maybe an inch higher please can you at least explain some of what youre doing not without letting that spy hear too he thought glancing about the room who was it one of the three pairs of damane and juidarrii could a damane be a darkfriend without her suldam knowing what about the opposite that noblewoman with the white streak in her hair looked suspicious or was it one of the many generals galgan tylee bannergeneral gerisch she stood at the side of the room glaring at him honestly women she did have a nice backside but mat had only mentioned it to be friendly he was a married man the fact was there were so many people moving about mat figured he could have spread millet on the floor and had flour by the end of the day supposedly they were all absolutely trustworthy and incapable of betraying the empress might she live forever which she would not if spies kept slipping in mat elayne said someone else needs to know what you are planning if you fall we have to continue your plan well that was a good enough argument hed considered it himself assured that his current orders were being followed he stepped over to elayne he glanced about the room then smiled to the others innocently they need not know he was suspicious of them why are you leering at everyone elayne asked softly im not bloody leering mat said outside i want to walk and take in some fresh air knotai tuon asked standing he did not look toward herthose eyes could drill through solid steel instead he casually made his way out of the command building elayne and birgitte followed a few moments later what is this elayne asked softly there are many ears in there mat said you suspect a spy inside of the command wait mat said taking her arm pulling her away he nodded agreeably to some deathwatch guards they grunted in reply for deathwatch guards that was downright talkative you can speak freely elayne said i just wove us a ward against eavesdropping thanks mat said i want you away from the command post ill tell you what im doing if something goes wrong youll have to pick another general all right mat elayne said if you think theres a spy i know theres a spy mat said and so im going to use the fellow its going to work trust me yes and youre so confident that youve already made a backup plan in case you fail he ignored that nodding to birgitte she looked around them idly watching for anyone who tried to draw too close how good are you at cards elayne mat asked at mat this isnt the time for gambling its the exact time for gambling elayne do you see how badly were outnumbered do you feel the ground when demandred attacks were lucky he didnt decide to travel directly to the command post here and attack usi suspect hes afraid that rand is hiding here somewhere and hell get ambushed but blood and bloody ashes hes strong without a gamble were dead finished buried she grew silent heres the thing about cards mat said holding up a finger cards arent like dice in dice you want to win as many throws as possible lots of throws lots of wins its random see but not cards in cards you need to make the other fellows start betting betting well you do that by letting them win a little or a lot thats not so hard here since were outnumbered and overwhelmed the only way to win is to bet everything on the right hand in cards you can lose ninetynine times but come out ahead if you win that right hand so long as the enemy starts gambling recklessly so long as you can ride the losses and thats what youre doing elayne asked youre faking that were losing bloody ashes no mat said i cant fake that hed see through it i am losing but im also watching holding back for that last bet the one that could win it all so when do we move when the right cards come along mat said he raised his hand stilling her objection ill know elayne i just will bloody know thats all i can say she folded her arms above her swollen belly light it seemed bigger every day fine what are your plans for andors forces i already have tam and his men committed along the river at the ruins mat said as for the rest of your armies id like you to go help at the ford demandred is probably counting on those trollocs north of here to cross the river and herd our defenders downriver on the shienaran side while the rest of the trollocs and the sharans come off the heights to push us back across the ford and upriver theyll try to squeeze us tight envelop us and that will be that only demandred sent a force up the mora to stop the river from flowing and its going to succeed very soon well see if theres a way to make that work for us but once the rivers gone well need a solid defense in place to stop the trollocs when they try to surge over the riverbed thats what your forces are for well go elayne said we birgitte barked im riding with my troops elayne said walking toward the horselines its increasingly obvious that i wont be able to do anything here and mat wants me away from the command position ill bloody go then into battle birgitte said were already in battle birgitte elayne said the sharan channelers could have ten thousand men assaulting dashar knob and this cleft in minutes come i promise ill let you put so many guards around me that i wont be able to sneeze without spraying a dozen of them birgitte sighed and mat gave her a consoling look she nodded farewell to him then walked off with elayne all right mat thought turning back toward the command building elayne was doing what she had to and talmanes had caught his signal now the real challenge could he coax tuon into doing what he wanted galad led the cavalry of the children of the light in a sweeping attack along the mora near the ruins the trollocs had constructed more raft bridges here and bodies floated as thick as autumn leaves on a pond the archers had done their work well those trollocs that finally crossed now had the children to contend with galad leaned in low lance held firmly as he split the neck of a hulking bearfaced trolloc he continued forward lance tip streaming blood the trolloc falling to its knees behind him he guided his mount sidama into the mass of trollocs knocking them down or causing them to leap out of the way the power of a cavalry charge was in numbers and those galad forced aside could be trampled by the horses following him after his charge came a volley from tams men who launched arrows into the main body of trollocs as they stumbled onto the banks of the river those behind pushed over them trampling the wounded golever and several other children joined galad as their charge which swept lengthwise across the front rank of trollocsran out of enemies he and his men reared and turned lances up galloping back to locate small groups of men separated and fighting alone the battlefield here was enormous galad spent the better part of an hour hunting out such groups rescuing them and ordering them to the ruins so that tam or one of his captains could form them into new banners slowly as their numbers dwindled original formations became mixed with one another mercenaries were not the only ones who now rode with the children galad had ghealdanin winged guardsmen and a couple of warders under his command kline and alix both had lost their aes sedai galad didnt expect those two to last long but they were fighting with terrible ferocity after sending another group of survivors back toward the ruins galad brought sidama down to a slow walk listening to the horses labored breath this field beside the river had become a bloody churn of bodies and mud cauthon had been right to leave the children in position here perhaps galad gave the man too little credit how long have we been fighting would you say golever asked from beside him the other childs tabard had been ripped free exposing his mail a section of links along the right side had been crushed by a trolloc blade the mail had held but the stain of blood there indicated that many of the links had been driven through golevers quilted gambeson and into his side the bleeding didnt look bad so galad said nothing weve hit midday galad guessed though he could not see the sun for the clouds he was reasonably certain theyd been fighting for four or five hours now think theyll stop for the night golever asked doubtful galad said if this battle lasts that long golever looked at him with concern you think i cannot follow what is happening cauthon sent so many troops up here and he pulled everyone off the heights from what i can tell i dont know why and the water in the river does it seem to be flowing in fits and spurts to you the struggle upstream must be going poorly he shook his head perhaps if i could see more of the battlefield i could understand cauthons plan he was a soldier a soldier need not understand the whole of the battle in order to follow his orders however galad was usually able to at least piece together his sides strategy from commands given have you ever imagined a battle this large golever asked turning his head argandas infantry was crashing into the trollocs at the river more and more of the shadowspawn were getting acrosswith alarm galad realized that the river had stopped flowing completely the shadowspawn had gotten a footing in the last hour it was going to be a tough fight but at least the numbers were more even now with all the trollocs they had killed earlier cauthon had known the river would stop flowing that was why hed sent so many troops up here to stem this onslaught from the other side light galad thought im watching the game of houses on the battlefield itself yes he had not given cauthon nearly enough credit a lead ball with a red streamer suddenly fell from the sky about twenty paces ahead hitting a dead trolloc in the skull far overhead the raken screeched and continued on its way galad heeled sidama forward and golever climbed down to fetch the letter for him gateways were useful but raken could see the battlefield in its expanse search out banners for specific men and deliver orders golever handed him the letter and galad pulled his list of ciphers from the leather envelope he carried in the top of his boot the ciphers were simplea list of numbers with words beside them if orders didnt use the right word and the right number together then they were suspect damodred the orders read bring yourself and a dozen of the best men from your twentysecond company and move along the river toward hawal ford stop when you can see elaynes banner and hold there for more orders p s if you see any trollocs with quarterstaffs i suggest you let golever fight them instead as i know you have trouble with those types mat galad sighed showing the letter to golever the cipher authenticated it the number twentytwo and the word quarterstaff were paired what does he want of us golever asked i wish i knew galad said he really did ill gather some men golever said i assume youll want harnesh mallone brokel he continued through an entire list galad nodded a good list well i cant say im sad for this order my sister has entered the field it appears i would keep watch on her beyond that he wanted to look over another section of the battlefield perhaps that would help him understand what cauthon was doing as you order lord captain commander golever said the dark one attacked it was an attempt to tear rand apart to destroy him bit by bit the dark one sought to claim the very elements that made up rands essence then annihilate them rand couldnt gasp couldnt cry out this attack wasnt at his body for he had no true body in this place just a memory of one rand held himself together with difficulty in the face of this awesome attack any notion of defeating the dark oneof killing him vanished rand couldnt defeat anything he could barely hold on he could not have described the sensation if hed tried it was as if the dark one was shredding him while at the same time trying to crush him entirely coming at rand from infinite directions all at once in a wave rand fell to his knees it was a projection of himself that did so but it felt real to him an eternity passed rand suffered it the crushing pressure the noise of destruction he weathered it on his knees fingers taut like claws sweat streaming from his brow he suffered it and looked up that is all you have rand growled i will win you made me strong rand said voice ragged each time you or your minions tried to destroy me your failure was like the blacksmiths hammer beating against metal this attempt rand took a deep breath this attempt of yours is nothing i will not break you mistake this is not an attempt to destroy you this is preparation for what to show you truth fragments of the pattern threads suddenly spun before rand splitting from the main body of light like hundreds of tiny flowing streams he knew this was not actually the pattern no more than what he saw as himself was actually his body in interpreting something so vast as the fabric of creation his mind needed some kind of imagery this was what his consciousness chose the threads spun not unlike threads in a weave of the one power only there were thousands upon thousands of them and the colors were more varied more vibrant each was straight like a string pulled taut or a beam of light they came together like the product of a loom creating a vision around him a ground of slimy soil plants speckled with black trees with limbs that drooped like arms bereft of strength it became a place a reality rand pushed himself to his feet and could feel the soil he could smell smoke in the air could hear moans of sorrow rand turned and found that he was on a mostly barren slope above a dark city with black stone walls buildings huddled inside squat and dull like bunkers what is this rand whispered something about the place felt familiar he looked up but could not see the sun for the clouds that dominated the sky it is what will be rand felt for the one power but drew back in revulsion the taint had returned but it was worsefar worse where it had once been a dark film on the molten light of saidin it was now a sludge so thick that he could not pierce it he would have to drink in the darkness envelop himself in it to seek out the one power beneathif indeed it was even still there the mere thought made bile rise in his throat and he had to fight to keep his stomach from emptying he was drawn toward that fortress nearby why did he feel he knew this place he was in the blight the plants made that clear if that wasnt enough he could smell rot in the air the heat was like that of a bog in the summersweltering oppressive despite the clouds he walked down the shallow hillside and caught sight of some figures working nearby men with axes hacking at trees there were maybe a dozen of them as rand approached he glanced to the side and saw the nothing that was the dark one in the distance consuming part of the landscape like a pit on the horizon a reminder that what rand was seeing wasnt real he passed stumps of cut trees were the men gathering firewood the thock thock of axesand the postures of the workershad none of the steadfast strength rand associated with woodsmen the beats were lethargic the men working with slumped shoulders that man on the left as rand grew closer he recognized him despite the bent posture and wrinkled skin light tam had to be at least seventy perhaps eighty why was he out working so hard its a vision rand thought a nightmare the dark ones own creation not real yet while standing within it rand found it difficult not to react as if this were indeed real and it was after a fashion the dark one used shadowed threads of the patternthe possibilities that rippled from creation like waves from a dropped pebble in a pondto create this father rand asked tam turned but his eyes didnt focus on rand rand took tam by the shoulder father tam stood dully for a moment then went back to his work raising his axe nearby dannil and jori hacked at a stump they had aged as well and were now men well into their middle years dannil seemed sick with something awful his face pale his skin having broken out in some kind of sores joris axe bit deep into the bitter earth and a black flood seeped from the soilinsects that had been hiding at the base of the stump the blade had pierced their lair the insects swarmed out and sped up the handle to cover jori he screamed batting at them but his open mouth let them climb inside rand had heard of such a thing a deathswarm one of the many dangers of the blight he raised a hand toward jori but the man slumped to the side dead as quickly as a man could draw breath tam yelled in horror and broke away running rand spun as his father crashed into a thicket of brush nearby trying to flee the deathswarm something jumped from a branch quick as a snapping whip and wrapped around tams neck jerking him to a halt no rand said it wasnt real he still couldnt watch his father die he seized the source punching through the sickly darkness of the taint it seemed to suffocate him and rand spent an excruciating time trying to find saidin when he did grasp it only a trickle came through he wove anyway roaring sending a ribbon of flame to kill the vine that had grabbed his father tam dropped from its grip as the vines writhed dying tam didnt move his eyes stared upward dead no rand turned on the deathswarm he destroyed it with a weave of fire only seconds had passed but all that remained of jori was bones the insects popped as he burned them a channeler dannil breathed cowering nearby eyes wide as he looked at rand others of the woodsmen had fled into the wilderness rand heard several scream rand could not stop himself from retching the taint it was so awful so putrid he could not hold to the source any longer come dannil said and grabbed rands arm come i need you dannil rand croaked standing up you dont recognize me come dannil repeated towing rand toward the fortress im rand rand dannil the dragon reborn no understanding shone in dannils eyes what has he done to you rand whispered they do not know you adversary i have remade them all things are mine they will not know that they lost they will know nothing but me i deny you rand whispered i deny you denying the sun does not make it set denying me does not prevent my victory come dannil said towing rand please you must save me end this rand said end it there are no endings adversary it is i have created it you imagine it please dannil said rand allowed himself to be pulled along toward the dark fortress what were you doing out there dannil rand demanded why gather wood in the blight itself it isnt safe it was our punishment dannil whispered those who fail our master are sent out and told to bring back a tree they have cut down with their own hands if the deathswarms or the twigs dont get you the sound of cutting wood draws other things rand frowned as they stepped onto a road leading to the town and its dark fortress yes this place was familiar the quarry road rand thought with surprise and that ahead the fortress dominated what had once been the green at the center of emonds field the blight had consumed the two rivers the clouds overhead seemed to push down on rand and he heard joris screams in his head he again saw tam struggling as he was strangled it isnt real this was what would happen if rand failed so many people depended on him so many some he had already failed he had to fight to keep from going over in his head the list of those who had died in his service even if he saved others he had failed to protect these it was an attack of a different kind from the one that had tried to destroy his essence rand felt it the dark one forcing his tendrils into rand infecting his mind with worry doubt fear dannil led him to the walls of the village where a pair of myrddraal in unmoving cloaks guarded the gates they slid forward you were sent to gather wood one whispered with toowhite lips i i brought this one dannil said stumbling away a gift for our master he can channel i found him for you rand growled then plunged toward the one power again swimming in filth he reached the trickle of saidin seizing it it was immediately knocked from his grasp a shield slid between him and the source it isnt real he whispered as he turned to see who had channeled nynaeve strode through the city gates dressed in black a wilder she asked undiscovered how did he survive this long you have done well dannil i give you back your life do not fail again dannil wept for joy then scrambled past nynaeve into the city it isnt real rand said as nynaeve tied him in weaves of air then dragged him into the dark ones version of emonds field the two myrddraal rushing in ahead of her it was a large city now the houses had the feel of mice clustered together before a cat each one of the same uniform dullness people scuttled through alleyways eyes down people scattered before nynaeve sometimes calling her mistress others named her chosen the two myrddraal sped through the city like shadows when rand and nynaeve reached the fortress a small group had gathered in the courtyard twelve peoplerand could sense that the four men in the group held saidin though he only recognized damer flinn from among them a couple of the women were girls he had known in the two rivers thirteen of them and thirteen myrddraal gathering beneath that clouded sky for the first time since the start of the vision rand felt fear not this anything but this what if they turned him this wasnt real but it was a version of reality a mirror world created by the dark one what would it do to rand if they turned him here had he been trapped that easily he began to struggle panicked against the bonds of air it was useless of course you are an interesting one nynaeve said turning to him she didnt look a day older than when he had left her in the cavern but there were other differences she wore her hair in a braid again but her face was leaner more harsh and those eyes the eyes were all wrong how did you survive out there she asked him how did you go undiscovered so long i come from a place where the dark one does not rule nynaeve laughed ridiculous a tale for children the great lord has always ruled rand could see it his connection to the pattern the glimmering of halftruths and shadowed ways this possibility it could happen it was one path the world could take the dark one here had won the last battle and broken the wheel of time that had allowed him to remake it to spin the pattern in a new way everyone alive had forgotten the past and now knew only what the dark one had inserted in their minds rand could read the truth the history of this place in the threads of the pattern he had touched earlier nynaeve egwene logain and cadsuane were now members of the forsaken turned to the shadow against their will moiraine had been executed for being too weak elayne min aviendha they had been given over to torture endlessly at shayol ghul the world was a living nightmare each member of the forsaken ruled as a despot over their own little section of the world an endless autumn played out as they threw armies dreadlords and factions against one another an eternal battle the blight had extended to every ocean seanchan was no more ruined and scorched until not even rats and crows could survive there anyone who could channel was discovered as a youth and turned the dark one did not like the risk that someone would bring hope back to the world and nobody ever would rand screamed as the thirteen began to channel this is your worst rand yelled they pressed their wills against his own he felt them like nails being pounded into his skull parting his flesh he pushed back with everything he had but the others started a thrumming pressure each thump like the chop of an axe came closer and closer to boring into him and so i win the failure hit rand hardthe knowledge that what happened here was his fault nynaeve egwene turned to the shadow because of him those he loved becoming playthings for the shadow rand should have protected them i win again you think i am the same youth that ishamael tried so hard to frighten rand shouted fighting down his terror and shame the fight is over it has not yet begun rand screamed the reality around him shattered again into ribbons of light nynaeves face shredded coming apart like lace with a loose thread the ground disintegrated and the fortress ceased to exist rand dropped from bands of air that had never been completely there the reality the dark one had created fragile unwove into its component parts threads of light spiraled out quivering like the strings of a harp they waited to be woven rand drew breath deeply through his teeth and looked up at the darkness beyond the threads i will not sit passively and suffer it this time shaitan i will not be captive to your nightmares i have become something greater than i once was rand seized those threads spinning about him taking themhundreds upon hundreds of them there was no fire air earth water or spirit here these were somehow more base somehow more varied each one was individual unique instead of five powers there were thousands rand took them gathered them and in his hand held the fabric of creation itself then he channeled it spinning it into a different possibility now rand said breathing deeply trying to banish the horror of what he had seen now i will show you what is going to happen bryne bowed the men are in position mother egwene took a deep breath mat had sent the white towers forces across the dry riverbed below the ford and around the western side of the bogs it was time for egwene to join them she hesitated for a moment looking through the gateway to mats command post egwene met the eyes of the seanchan woman across the table where she sat imperiously on her throne i have not finished with you egwene thought lets go she said turning waving for yukiri to close the gateway to mats building she fingered voras saangreal held in one hand as she strode out of her tent she hesitated when she saw something there something slight on the ground tiny spiderweb cracks in the rocks she bent down there are more and more of those around mother yukiri said stooping down beside her we think that when dreadlords channel the cracks can spread particularly if balefire is used egwene felt them though they seemed like ordinary cracks to the touch they looked down into pure nothing blackness far too deep for simple cracks to have caused through shadows of the light she wove all five powers together testing at the cracks yes she wasnt certain exactly what she did but the fledgling weave covered the cracks like a bandage the darkness faded leaving behind only ordinary cracksand a thin film of crystals interesting yukiri said what was that weave i dont know egwene said it felt right gawyn have you she trailed off gawyn egwene stood up with a start she vaguely remembered him leaving her command tent for some air how long ago had it been she turned around slowly sensing where he was the bond let her tell his direction she stopped when she was pointing toward him she was looking toward the riverbed just up from the ford where mat had positioned elaynes forces oh light what silviana asked gawyn has gone to fight egwene said keeping her voice calm with effort that woolheaded idiot of a man could he not wait an hour or two until her armies were in position she knew that he was eager to fight but he should have at least asked bryne groaned softly send someone to fetch him egwene said now her voice was cold angry she could not make it otherwise he has apparently joined the andoran armies i will do it bryne said one hand on his sword his other arm raised toward one of the grooms i cannot be trusted to lead armies at least i can do this it made sense take yukiri with you she said once youve found my fool warder travel to us west of the bogs bryne bowed then retreated siuan watched him hesitant you may go with him egwene said is that where you need me siuan asked actually egwene lowered her voice i want someone to join mat and the seanchan empress and listen with ears accustomed to hearing what is not spoken siuan nodded approvaleven pridein her expression egwene was amyrlin she had no need of either emotion from siuan and yet it lifted a little of her grinding fatigue you look amused egwene said when moiraine and i set out to find the boy siuan said i had no idea the pattern would send you to us as well your replacement egwene said as a queen ages siuan said she begins to think about her legacy light every goodwife probably starts to think the same things will she have an heir to hold what she has created as a woman grows in wisdom she realizes that what she alone can accomplish pales compared to what her legacy can achieve well i suppose i cant claim you entirely as my own and i wasnt exactly pleased to be succeeded but it is comforting to know ive had a hand in shaping what is to come and if a woman were to wish for a legacy she could not dream of greater than one such as you thank you ill watch this seanchan woman for you maybe help poor min crawl out of the fangfish net shes found herself in siuan moved away calling for yukiri to make her a gateway before going with bryne egwene smiled watching her give the general a kiss siuan kissing a man in the open silviana channeled and egwene climbed into daishars saddle as a gateway opened for them she embraced the source holding voras saangreal before her and trotted through behind a group of tower guards she was immediately assaulted by the scent of smoke high captain chubain waited for her on the other side the darkhaired man had always struck her as being too young for his position but she supposed not every commander had to be silvered like bryne after all they were entrusting this battle to someone only a bit older than she and she herself was the youngest amyrlin ever egwene turned toward the heights and found that she could barely see them through fires that were burning along the slope and the eastern edge of the bogs what happened she asked flaming arrows chubain said fired by our forces at the river i thought cauthon was mad at first but i can see his reasoning now he fired at the trollocs to set the fields alight there on the heights and at their base to give us cover the undergrowth over there is dry and brittle as tinder the fires drove the trollocs and sharan cavalry back up the slope for the time being and i think cauthon is counting on the smoke masking our movement around the bogs the shadow would know someone was moving over here but how many troops and in what configuration they would have to rely on scouts rather than their superior vantage atop the heights our orders chubain said he didnt tell you egwene asked he shook his head he just put us in position here we continue on up the west side of the bog and come at the sharans from behind she said chubain grunted this is fragmenting our forces a great deal and now he assaults them on the heights after relinquishing it to them she didnt have an answer to that well she had been the one essentiallyto put mat in charge she spared a glance across the bogs again toward where she sensed gawyn he would be fighting at the egwene hesitated her previous position had let her sense gawyn in the direction of the river but after moving through the gateway she had a better sense of his position he wasnt at the river with elaynes armies gawyn was on the heights themselves where the shadow held the strongest oh light she thought gawyn what are you doing gawyn strode through smoke black tendrils of it curled around him and the heat of smoldering grass warmed his boots but the fire had mostly burned out here atop the heights leaving the ground dark with ash bodies and some broken dragons lay blackened like heaps of slag or coal gawyn knew that sometimes to renew a field farmers would burn the previous years weeds the world itself was alight now as he slipped through the twisting black smokehis kerchief wetted and tied across his facehe prayed for a renewal there were spiderweb cracks all over the ground the shadow was destroying this land most of the trollocs were gathering on the heights overlooking hawal ford though a handful busied themselves prodding at bodies on the slope perhaps they had been drawn by the scent of burning flesh a myrddraal emerged from the smoke and began scolding them in a language gawyn did not understand it lashed a whip at the trollocs backs gawyn froze in place but the halfman did not notice him it drove the stragglers toward where the rest of the trollocs had gathered gawyn waited breathing softly through his handkerchief feeling the shadows of the bloodknives wreathe him the three rings had done things to him he felt heady and his limbs moved too quickly when he stepped it had taken time to grow accustomed to the changes to keep his balance each time he moved a wolffeatured trolloc rose up from behind a nearby pile of rubble and sniffed the air looking after the fade the trolloc then crept out of hiding a corpse thrown over its shoulder it walked past gawyn passing not five feet away where it paused and sniffed the air again then hunching low it continued the body it carried over its shoulder trailed the cloak of a warder poor symon he would never play another hand of cards gawyn growled softly and before he could stop himself leaped forward he moved into kissing the adder spinning and relieving the trollocs shoulders of its head the carcass crashed down to the ground gawyn stood with sword out then cursed himself crouching and moving back into the smoke it would mask his scent and the twisting blackness his blurred form fool to risk exposing himself to kill one trolloc symons corpse would end up in a cookpot anyway gawyn couldnt kill the entire army he was here for one man gawyn crouched waiting to see if his attack had been noticed perhaps they wouldnt have been able to see himhe wasnt certain how much the rings clouded himbut anyone watching would have seen the trolloc fall no warning call gawyn rose and continued only then did he notice that his fingers were showing red among the black of the ash he had burned them the pain was distant the rings he had difficulty thinking straight but that didntfortunatelystop his ability to fight if anything his instincts were stronger now demandred where was demandred gawyn sped back and forth across the top of the heights cauthon had troops stationed at the river near the ford but the smoke made it impossible to see who was involved on the other side the borderlanders were engaged with a sharan cavalry unit yet here on top it was peaceful despite the presence of shadowspawn and sharans now gawyn crept along the back lines of the shadowspawn keeping to the rougher patches of deadwood and weeds nobody seemed to notice him there were shadows here and shadows were protection down below in the corridor between heights and bog the fires were going out that seemed too quick for them to have burned themselves out channeling he had intended to find demandred by seeking the origin of the mans attacks but if he was just channeling to put out fires then the shadows army charged racing down the slope toward hawal ford though the sharans remained behind the bulk of the trollocs moved they obviously intended to push over the nowdry riverbed and engage cauthons army if cauthon had intended to lure all of demandreds forces off the heights he had failed many sharans remained behind infantry and cavalry units watching impassively as the trollocs thundered toward battle explosions pounded along the slope throwing trollocs into the air like dirt from a beaten rug gawyn hesitated crouching low dragons the few working ones mat had set them up somewhere across the river it was difficult to see an exact position because of the smoke by the sound there were only half a dozen or so but the damage they caused was enormous particularly considering the distance a burst of red light from nearby atop the heights launched toward the smoke of the dragons gawyn smiled thank you kindly he put his hand on his sword time to test just how well these rings worked he dashed low and quick out of cover most of the trollocs were piling down the slope loping toward the dry riverbed crossbow bolts and arrows assaulted them and another round of dragon fire came from a slightly different location cauthon had the dragons moving and demandred had trouble pinpointing them gawyn ran between howling shadowspawn the ground thumped like a beating heart from the impacts along the ground behind him smoke whipped around him thick in his throat his hands had been blackened and he assumed his face had been as well he hoped that would help keep him hidden trollocs turned about screeching or grunting but none of them fixed upon him they knew something had passed but to them he was merely a blur egwenes anger poured through the bond gawyn smiled he had not expected her to be pleased as he ran arrows slicing the earth around him he found peace with his choice once perhaps he would have done this for the pride of the battle and the chance to pit himself against demandred that was not his heart now his heart was the need someone had to fight this creature someone had to kill him or they would lose this battle they could all see it risking egwene or logain would be too great a gamble gawyn could be risked no one would send him to do thisno one would darebut it was necessary he had a chance to change things to really matter he did it for andor for egwene for the world itself ahead demandred bellowed his now familiar challenge send me althor not these socalled dragons another streak of fire flew from him gawyn passed the charging trollocs and came up behind a large group of sharans with strange bows almost as big as those of the two rivers they surrounded a mounted man in interlinking armor of coins bound at holes in the centers with a gorget and armguards the faceplate on his fearsome helmet was open that proud face was eerily familiar to gawyn handsome and imperious this will have to be quick gawyn thought and light id better not give him a chance to channel the sharan archers stood at the ready but only two of them turned as gawyn slipped between them gawyn pulled his knife from his belt sheath hed have to drag demandred off his horse then go for the face with his knife it felt like a cowards attack but it was the best way trip him and gawyn could demandred spun suddenly and looked toward gawyn a second later the man thrust his hand forward and a beam of whitehot firethin as a twigshot for gawyn it missed striking just beside gawyn as he leaped away cracks opened all across the ground nearby deep black cracks that seemed to open into eternity itself gawyn leaped forward cutting at demandreds saddle so fast these rings let him react while demandred was still staring in confusion the saddle came off and gawyn rammed his knife into the horses side the beast screamed and reared throwing demandred backward saddle and all gawyn leaped bloodied knife out as the horse bolted and the sharan archers cried out he loomed over demandred knife raised in two hands the forsakens body suddenly jolted and the man was pushed to the side air blew about the blackened ground raising flakes of ash as weaves of air caught demandred and spun him about depositing him on his feet with a clink sword unsheathed the forsaken crouched and released another weavegawyn felt air spinning next to him as if threads of it had tried to grab him he was too quick and demandred obviously had trouble hitting him because of the rings gawyn backed away and switched his knife to his off hand unsheathing his sword in his right so demandred said an assassin and lews therin always spoke of the honor of facing a man facetoface i wasnt sent by the dragon reborn with nights shade surrounding you a weave that none from this age remember do you know that what lews therin has done to you will leak your life away you are dead little man then you can join me in the grave gawyn said demandred stood up taking his sword in two hands in an unfamiliar battle stance he seemed able to track gawyn somewhat despite the rings but his responses were a hair slower than they should have been apple blossoms in the wind with three quick strikes forced demandred back several sharans came forward with swords but demandred raised a gauntleted hand to warn them off he did not smile at gawyn this man did not seem as if he ever smiledbut he performed something that was similar to lightning of three prongs gawyn replied with the boar rushes down the mountain demandred was good with the edge granted by the rings gawyn narrowly escaped demandreds riposte the two danced through a small circle of open ground guarded by the watching sharans distant booms threw iron spheres at the hillside making the ground shake there were only a few dragons still firing but they seemed to be concentrating on this position gawyn grunted throwing himself into storm shakes the branch trying to push inside demandreds guard he would need to be close and ram his sword into the armpit or between the seams of the coin armor demandred responded with skill and finesse gawyn was soon sweating beneath his mail he felt faster than hed ever been his reactions like the darting movements of a hummingbird yet try as he did he could not land a hit who are you little man demandred growled walking back with sword raised at his side you fight well gawyn trakand the little queens brother demandred said you realize who i am a murderer and has your dragon not murdered demandred said has your sister never killed to keep dare i say seize her throne thats different so everyone always says demandred stepped forward his sword forms were smooth his back always straight but relaxed and he used the broad sweeping movements of a dancer he had absolute mastery of his sword gawyn had not heard that demandred was known for his swordsmanship but this man was as good as any man gawyn had ever faced better truly gawyn performed cat dances on the wall a beautiful sweeping sword form that matched demandreds then he ducked in with the serpents tongue dances hoping his previous form would have lulled demandred into letting a thrust slip past something crashed into gawyn throwing him to the ground he rolled coming up in a crouch his breathing grew labored he did not feel pain because of the rings but he had probably broken a rib a rock gawyn thought he channeled and brought a rock in to hit me he had trouble hitting gawyn with weaves because of the shadows but something large could be tossed at the shadows and still hit him you cheat gawyn said with a sneer cheat demandred asked are there rules little swordsman as i recall you tried to stab me in the back while hiding in a shroud of darkness gawyn breathed in and out holding his side a dragons iron sphere thumped into the ground just a short distance away then exploded the blast ripped apart some sharans their bodies shielding gawyn and demandred from the brunt of the blast the soil rained down like a spray of surf on the deck of a ship at least one of the dragons was still working you name me a murderer demandred said and i am i am also your savior whether you wish it or not youre mad hardly demandred walked around him cutting the air with a few sweeps of his sword that man you follow lews therin telamon he is mad he thinks he can defeat the great lord he cannot that is simple fact youd have us join the shadow instead yes demandreds eyes were cold if i kill lews therin in victory i will be given the right to remake the world as i wish the great lord cares nothing for rule the only way to protect this world is to destroy it and then shelter its people is that not what your dragon claims he can do why do you keep calling him my dragon gawyn said then spat blood to the side the rings they urged him forward his limbs pulsed with strength energy fight kill you follow him demandred said i do not lies demandred said or perhaps you are simply fooled i know that lews therin leads this army at first i was uncertain but no longer that weave about you is proof enough but i have a greater one no mortal general has such skill as this day has shown i face a true master on the battlefield perhaps lews therin wears the mask of mirrors or perhaps he leads by sending messages to this cauthon through the one power it does not matter i see the truth i dice with lews therin this day i was always the better general i will prove it here i would have you tell that to lews therin but you will not live long enough little swordsman prepare yourself demandred raised his sword gawyn stood dropping his knife taking his sword in two hands demandred stalked toward him using forms that were different from those gawyn knew they were still familiar enough for him to counter but despite his greater speed time and time again demandred caught his sword and deflected it harmlessly to the side the man did not strike he barely moved feet set wide apart sword in two hands battering aside each and every attack gawyn hurled at him the dove takes flight the falling leaf leopards caress gawyn gritted his teeth growling through them the rings should have been enough why werent the rings enough gawyn stepped back then ducked backward as another stone came hurtling toward him it missed him by inches thank the light for these rings he thought you fight with skill demandred said for one of this age but you still wield your sword little man what else would i do become the sword yourself demandred said as if baffled that gawyn did not understand gawyn growled and came in again battering at demandred gawyn was still faster demandred didnt attack he was on the defensive then although he didnt retreat he just stood there turning aside each blow demandred closed his eyes gawyn smiled then thrust in black lances last strike demandreds sword became a blur something struck gawyn he gasped pulling to a stop he wobbled and fell to his knees looking down at a hole in his gut demandred had thrust straight through the mail then pulled his sword free in a single fluid motion why cant why cant i feel anything if you do survive this and see lews therin demandred said tell him i am very much looking forward to a match between the two of us sword against sword i have improved since we last met demandred whipped his sword around catching the back of the blade in the crook between his thumb and forefinger he pulled the sword across stripping the blood from the steel and splattering it to the ground he slid the weapon into his sheath he shook his head then released a ball of fire toward a stillfiring dragon it fell silent demandred strode away along the edge of the steep slope facing the river his sharan guard forming around him gawyn collapsed to the ground stunned spurting his life onto the burned grass he tried to hold in the blood through trembling fingers somehow gawyn managed to push himself up to his knees his heart cried out he needed to return to egwene he began to crawl blood mixing with the earth beneath him as it seeped from his wound through eyes clouded with cold perspiration he spotted several cavalry mounts twenty paces ahead poking at blackened tufts of grass at their feet and tethered to a picketline after minutes of struggle an impossible interval of time that left him drained he pulled himself up on to the back of the first horse he could reach and untether gawyn hunched over dazed grasping its mane in one hand summoning his remaining strength he kicked his heel into the animals rib cage my lady mandevwin said to faile i have known those two men for years they are not without a few spots in their past no man comes to the band without a few of those but light provide they are not darkfriends faile ate her midday rations in silence listening with as much patience as she could muster to mandevwins protests she wished perrin were here so she could have a good argument she felt as if she would burst from pressure they were close to thakandar horribly close the black sky rumbled with lightning and they hadnt seen a living creaturedangerous or notin days nor had they seen vanin or harnan again though faile set a double guard each night the minions of the dark one did not give up she now carried the horn in a large bag tied to her waist the others knew it and moved between pride in their duty and horror at the import of it at least she shared that with them now my lady mandevwin said kneeling down vanin is out there nearby somewhere he is a very gifted scout the best in the band we will not see him unless he wants us to but i would swear that he is following us where else would he go perhaps if i call out to him invite him in to tell his story so we can resolve this i will consider it mandevwin faile said he nodded the oneeyed man was a good commander but had the imagination of a brick uncomplicated men assumed others to have uncomplicated motivations and he could not imagine someone like vanin or harnan helping the band for so longunder orders undoubtedly to avoid suspiciononly to now do something so terrible at least now she knew that she hadnt been worried without cause that look of pure terror in vanins eyes when hed been caught was confirmation enough if catching him with the horn in his hands hadnt been she had not expected two darkfriends and they had outsmarted her in their thievery however they had also underestimated the dangers of the blight she hated to think what would have happened if they hadnt drawn the attention of the bearthing faile would have remained in her tent anticipating the arrival of thieves who had already disappeared with one of the most powerful artifacts in the world the sky rumbled dark shayol ghul loomed ahead rising out of the valley of thakandar in a range of smaller mountains the air had grown chill almost wintery reaching that peak would be difficultbut one way or another she was going to bring this horn to the forces of the light for the last battle she rested her fingers on the sack at her side feeling the metal within nearby olver scampered across the lifeless gray rock of the blasted lands wearing his knife at his belt like a sword perhaps she should not have brought him then again boys his age in the borderlands learned to run messages and carry supplies to besieged forts they wouldnt go out with a war band or be given a post until they were at least twelve but their training started much earlier my lady faile looked toward selande and arrela as they approached faile had put selande in charge of the scouts now that vanin had revealed himself the pale little woman looked less like an aiel than many of the others in cha faile but the attitude helped yes movement my lady selande said softly what faile stood what kind some kind of caravan in the blasted lands faile asked show me it wasnt just a caravan there was a village out there faile could make it out through the looking glass though only as a smudge of darkness to indicate buildings it was settled into the foothills near thakandar a village light faile moved the looking glass down to where a caravan crept across the bleak landscape heading toward a supply station set up a good distance outside the village theyre doing what we did she whispered whats that my lady arrela lay on her stomach beside faile mandevwin was on her other side peering through his own looking glass its a central supply station faile explained looking over the stacks of boxes and bundles of arrows shadowspawn cant move through gateways but their supplies can they neednt have carried arrows and replacement weapons as part of the invasion instead the supplies are being collected here then sent to the battlefields when needed indeed down below a ribbon of light announced a gateway opening a large train of dirtylooking men trudged through it with packs on their backs followed by dozens of others pulling small carts wherever those supplies are going faile said slowly there will be fighting nearby those carts carry arrows but no food as the trollocs are dragging corpses away to feast on each night so if we could slip through one of those gateways mandevwin said arrela snorted as if the conversation were a joke she looked at faile and the smile slipped from her lips youre serious both of you we are still a long hike from thakandar faile said and that village blocks our way it might be easier to sneak through one of those gateways than try to work our way into the valley wed end up behind the enemy lines were already behind their lines faile said grimly so nothing would change there arrela fell silent that will be a problem mandevwin said softly turning his looking glass look at the fellows approaching the camp from the village faile raised her looking glass again aiel she whispered light the shaido have joined with the forces of the dark one even the shaido dogs would not do that arrela said then spat to the side the newcomers did look different they wore their veils up as if for killing but the veils were red either way sneaking past aiel would be nearly impossible likely only the fact that her group was so distant had saved them from discovery that and the fact that no one would expect to find a group like failes here back faile said inching back down the hillside we need to do some planning perrin awoke feeling as if he had been tossed into a lake during winter he gasped lie down you fool janina said putting her hand on his arm the flaxenhaired wise one looked as exhausted as he felt he was in someplace soft too soft a nice bed clean sheets outside the windows waves broke gently against a shore and gulls called he also heard moans echoing from some place nearby where am i perrin asked at my palace berelain said she stood near the doorway and he hadnt noticed her before the first wore her diadem the hawk in flight and had on a crimson dress with yellow trim the room was lavish with gold and bronze on the mirrors windows and bedposts i might add berelain said that this is a somewhat familiar situation for me lord aybara i took precautions this time in case you were wondering precautions perrin sniffed the air uno he could smell the man indeed berelain nodded to the side and perrin turned to find uno sitting in a chair nearby his arm in a sling uno what happened to you perrin asked bloody trollocs happened to me uno grumbled waiting my turn for healing those with lifethreatening wounds are healed first janina said she was the most accomplished of the wise ones at healing shed apparently decided to stay with the aes sedai and berelain you perrin aybara were healed to the point of survival only just to the point of survival it wasnt until now that we could take care of the wounds that did not threaten your life wait perrin said he struggled to sit light he was exhausted how long have i been here ten hours berelain said ten hours i have to go the fighting the fighting will continue without you berelain said im sorry perrin growled softly so tired moiraine knew a method of wiping away a mans fatigue do you know this janina i wouldnt do it for you if i did janina said you need sleep perrin aybara your participation in the last battle is over perrin gritted his teeth then moved to stand step out of that bed janina said turning her eyes toward him and ill bundle you in air and leave you hanging there for hours perrins first instinct was to shift away he began forming the thought in his head and felt foolish hed somehow returned to the real world he couldnt shift here he was as helpless as a babe he leaned back in his bed frustrated be of good cheer perrin berelain said softly walking up to the bed you should be dead how did you reach that battlefield if haral luhhan and his men hadnt spotted you lying there perrin shook his head what hed done defied explanation for one who did not know the wolf dream what is happening berelain the war our armies she pursed her lips i can smell the truth on you perrin said worry anxiety he sighed i saw that the battlefronts had moved if the two rivers men are at the field of merrilor as well all three of our armies have been pushed back to the same place everyone but those at thakandar we dont know how the lord dragon is doing she said softly gliding onto a stool beside his bed beside the wall janina took uno by the arm he shivered as the healing coursed through him rand still fights perrin said too much time has passed she said there was something she wasnt telling him something she was dancing around he could smell it on her rand still fights perrin repeated if he had lost we wouldnt be here he leaned back exhaustion deep in his bones light he couldnt just lie here while men died could he time is different at the bore i visited it and saw firsthand it has been many days out here but ill bet it has only been a day for rand maybe less that is well i will pass what you say to the others berelain perrin said i need you to do something for me i sent elyas with a message to our armies but i dont know if he delivered it graendal is interfering with the minds of our great captains will you find out for me if his message arrived it arrived she said almost too late but it arrived you did well sleep now perrin she rose berelain he asked she turned back to him faile he said what of faile her anxiety sharpened no her supply caravan was destroyed in a bubble of evil perrin berelain said softly im sorry was her body recovered he forced himself to ask no then she still lives it she still lives perrin insisted he would have to assume that was true if he didnt there is of course hope she said then walked to uno who was flexing his healed arm and nodded for him to join her as she left the room janina was puttering around the washstand perrin could still hear moaning in the hallways outside and the place smelled of healing herbs and of pain light he thought failes caravan had carried the horn did the shadow now have it and gaul he had to return to gaul hed left the man in the wolf dream guarding rands back if perrins exhaustion was any guide gaul couldnt hold much longer perrin felt as if he could sleep for weeks janina returned to his bedside then shook her head there is no good purpose in trying to force yourself to hold your eyes open perrin aybara i have too much to do janina please i need to return to the battlefield and you will stay here perrin aybara you are of no use to anyone in your state and will gain no ji by trying to prove otherwise if the blacksmith who brought you here knew id let you stumble off and die on the battlefield i believe hed come try to hang me out the window by my heels she hesitated and that one i almost think he could manage it master luhhan perrin said recalling faintly those moments before he blacked out he was there he found me he saved your life janina said that man threw you on his back and ran you to an aes sedai for a gateway you were seconds from death when he arrived considering your size just lifting you is some feat i dont really need sleep perrin said feeling his eyes droop i need i need to get im sure you do janina said perrin let his eyes shut that would convince her that he was going to do as she said then when she left he could stand up im sure you do janina repeated her voice growing softer for some reason sleep he thought im falling asleep again he saw the three paths before himself this time one led to ordinary sleep another to the wolf dream while sleeping the path he usually took and between them a third path the wolf dream in the flesh he was sorely tempted but in the moment he chose not to take that path he chose ordinary sleep asin a moment of understandinghe knew that his body would die without it androl lay gasping for breath staring up at the sky somewhere far from the battlefield following their flight from the top of the heights that attack it had been so powerful what was that he sent to pevara it wasnt taim she replied standing up dusting off her skirts i think it was demandred i purposefully brought us to a place far from where he was fighting yes how dare he move and interfere with the group of channelers attacking his forces androl sat up groaning you know pevara you are unusually smartlipped for an aes sedai he was surprised by her amusement you dont know aes sedai nearly as well as you assume she walked over to check on emarins wounds androl took a deep breath filled with the scents of autumn fallen leaves stagnant water an autumn that had come too early their hillside looked down on a valley where in defiance of the way the world was going some farmers had tilled the earth in large squares nothing had grown nearby theodrin pulled herself up its madness back there she said her face flushed androl could feel pevaras disapproval the girl should not have been so free with her emotions she hadnt learned proper aes sedai control yet she isnt a proper aes sedai pevara sent him reading his thoughts regardless of what the amyrlin claims she hasnt been through the testing yet theodrin seemed to know what pevara thought and the two kept their distance from one another pevara healed emarin who took it stoically theodrin healed a cut on jonneths arm he seemed bemused at the motherly ministration shell have him bonded before long pevara sent him notice how she let one of the other women take her one of the fifty then started following him about weve barely been rid of her since the black tower what if he bonds her back androl sent then well see if what you and i have is unique or not pevara hesitated we are stumbling upon things that have never been known he met her eyes she was referring to whatever had happened during their linking this last time she had opened a gateway but had done it as he would have were going to need to try that again he sent her shortly she said delving emarin to be certain her healing had taken i am quite all right pevara sedai he said courteous as always and if i might note you seem as if you could use some healing of your own she looked down at the burned cloth on her arm she was still timid about letting a man heal her but also annoyed at her own timidity thank you she said her voice level as she let him touch her arm and channel androl unhooked the small tin cup from his belt and absently lifted his hand fingers downward he pressed his fingers as if pinching something between them and when he spread them a small gateway opened in the middle water poured out filling the cup pevara sat down beside him accepting the cup as he offered it she drank then sighed as cool as mountain springwater thats what it is androl said that reminds me ive been meaning to ask you something how do you do that do this he said its just a small gateway thats not what i mean androl you just got here you couldnt possibly have had time to memorize this area well enough to open a gateway to some mountain spring hundreds of miles away androl stared blankly at pevara as if he had just heard a surprising piece of news i dont know maybe its something to do with my talent see pevara was silent a moment by the way what happened to your sword androl reached by reflex to his side the sheath hung there empty hed dropped his sword when the lightning had struck near them and he hadnt had the presence of mind to grab it as they fled he groaned garfin would send me to grind barley at the quartermasters for weeks straight if he heard of this its not that important pevara said you have better weapons its the principle androl said carrying a sword reminds me its like well seeing a net reminds me of fishing around mayene and springwater reminds me of jain small things but small things matter i need to be a soldier again we have to find taim pevara the seals well we cant find him the way weve been trying do you agree he sighed but nodded excellent she said i hate being a target what do we do instead we approach this with careful study not with swinging swords she probably had a point and what we did pevara you used my talent we shall see she said sipping from her cup now if only this were tea androl raised his eyebrows he took the cup back opened a small gateway between two fingers and dropped a few dried tea leaves into the cup he boiled it for a moment with a thread of fire then dropped in some honey through another gateway had some back in my workshop in the black tower he said handing the cup back it looks like nobody moved it she sipped the tea then smiled warmly androl you are wonderful he smiled light how long had it been since hed felt this way about a woman love was supposed to be something for young fools wasnt it of course the young fools never could see straight theyd look for a pretty face and stop there androl had been around long enough to know that a pretty face was nothing compared to the type of solidity a woman like pevara displayed control steadiness determination these were things that only proper seasoning could bring it was the same way with leather new leather was fine but really good leather was leather that had been used and worn like a strap that had been cared for over the years you never knew for certain if you could rely on a new strap once it had been your companion for a few seasons you knew im trying to read that thought pevara said did you just compare me to an old strap of leather he blushed ill assume its a leatherworkers thing she sipped her tea well you keep comparing me to what is it a bunch of little figurines she smiled my family the ones killed by darkfriends im sorry it happened very very long ago androl he could sense that she was still angry about it though light he said i keep forgetting that youre older than most trees pevara hmm she said first im a strap of leather now im older than trees i assume that despite the several dozen jobs youve had in your life none of your training involves how to speak with a lady he shrugged when younger he might have been embarrassed to have his tongue tied in such knots but hed learned that there was just no way to avoid it trying to do so only made it worse oddly the way he reacted pleased her women liked to see a man flummoxed he supposed her mirth died down however as she happened to glance at the sky he was reminded suddenly of the empty fields below the dead trees the growling thunder this was not a time for mirth not a time for love for some reason though he found himself clinging to both precisely because of that we should be moving soon he said what is your plan taim will always be surrounded by minions if we continue attacking as we have well be cut to ribbons before we can get to him we need to reach him stealthily and how are we going to manage that that depends how crazy can you be if the situation warrants the valley of thakandar had become a place of smoke mayhem and death rhuarc stalked through it trask and baelder at his sides they were brothers of his from the red shields he had never met these two before coming to this place but they were brothers nonetheless and their bond had been sealed by the spilled blood of shadowspawn and traitors lightning broke the air striking nearby as rhuarc walked his feet crunched on sand that had been turned to shards of glass by the lightning he reached coversome trolloc corpses in a pileand crouched down trask and baelder joining him the tempest had finally come furious winds assaulting the valley nearly enough to pull the veil from his face it was difficult to make out anything the fog had blown away but the sky had darkened and the storm kicked up dust and smoke many people fought in prowling packs there were no more battle lines earlier in the day a myrddraal attack and an allout trolloc assault afterwardhad finally broken the defenders hold on the mouth of the valley the tairens and dragonsworn had pulled back into the valley toward shayol ghul and now most of them fought near the base of the mountain fortunately the trollocs that had piled through didnt have overwhelming numbers the killing in the pass and the long siege had reduced the numbers of trollocs at thakandar in all the trollocs remaining probably equaled the number of defenders that still would be a problembut in his opinion the honorless who wore red veils were a far greater threat those roved across the expanse of the valley as did the aiel in this open killing field obscured with fog and swirling dust to ruin visibility rhuarc hunted occasionally he would run across trollocs in groups but most had been driven by the fades to fight the regular forces the tairens and domani rhuarc waved to his brothers and they moved through the tempest along one side of the valley the light send that the regular forces and the channelers could hold the path up to the mountain where the caracarn fought sightblinder rand althor would need to complete his battle soon for rhuarc suspected it would not be long before the shadow won this valley he and his brothers passed a group of aiel dancing the spears with the traitors who wore the red veils while many of the redveils could channel it seemed that none in this group could rhuarc and his two leaped into the dance spears thrusting these redveils fought well trask woke from the dream during this fight though he slew one of the redveils as he fell the skirmish ended when the remaining redveils fled rhuarc killed one of them with the bow and baelder downed another shooting men in the back it was a thing they would not have done if fighting true aiel these creatures were worse than shadowspawn the three remaining aiel they had helped nodded in thanks they joined with him and baelder and together they moved back toward the pit of doom to check on the defenses there thankfully the army at this place still held many were of those dragonsworn who had come to the battle last and who were made up primarily of common men and women yes there were some aes sedai among them even some aiel and a couple of ashaman however most of them held old swords that hadnt seen use in years or staffs that had probably once been farming tools they fought like cornered wolves against the trollocs rhuarc shook his head if the treekillers had fought so savagely perhaps laman would still have his throne a bolt of lightning came from the air killing a number of the defenders rhuarc blinked the flash from his eyes turned to the side and scanned the surroundings through the blowing winds there he motioned for his brothers to stay behind then slipped forward in a crouch he grabbed a handful of the gray ashlike dust that covered the ground and rubbed it into his clothing and onto his face the wind whipped some of it from his fingers he went prone on the ground a dagger clenched in his jaw his prey stood atop a small hill watching the fight one of the redveils with his veil down grinning the creatures teeth were not filed to points the ones with teeth filed to points could all channel some without teeth like that could as well rhuarc did not know what that meant this fellow was a channeler revealed as he summoned fire like a spear and launched it toward fighting tairens nearby rhuarc crept forward slowly inching along the ground in a depression in the rocks he was forced to watch the redveil killing defender after defender but he did not speed up he continued his excruciatingly slow crawl listening to the fire sizzle as the redveil stood with hands behind his back weaves of the one power striking around him the redveil didnt see him though some of these men fought like aiel many did not they were not quiet as they stalked and did not seem to know the bow or the spear as well as they should men like the one in front of him rhuarc doubted they had ever had to move quietly sneak up on a foe kill a deer in the wilderness why would they want to when they could channel the man didnt notice as rhuarc slid around a trolloc corpse near the redveils feet then reached out and sliced the mans hamstrings he dropped with a cry and before he could channel further rhuarc cut his throat then slipped back into hiding between two corpses two trollocs came to see what the fuss was rhuarc killed the first then dropped the second even as it turned before they had a chance to see him then once again he melted into the landscape no more shadowspawn came to investigate so rhuarc retreated back toward his men as he movedrising to a crouching runhe passed a small pack of wolves finishing off a pair of trollocs the wolves turned to him muzzles bloodied and ears raised they let him pass moving silently out into the storm of wind to find other prey wolves they had come with the rainless tempest and now fought alongside men rhuarc did not know much of how the overall battle was going he could see that some of king darlins troops in the distance still held formation the crossbowmen had set up next to the dragons worn last rhuarc had seen theyd nearly run out of bolts and the strange steambelching wagons that had been delivering supplies now lay in ruins aes sedai and ashaman continued to channel against the onslaught but not with the energy he had seen from them earlier the aiel did what they did best kill so long as those armies held the pathway to rand althor perhaps that would be enough perhaps something hit him he gasped falling to his knees he looked up and someone beautiful stepped through the storm to inspect him she had wonderful eyes though the two were offset from one another hed never before realized how horribly balanced everyone elses eyes were thinking of it nauseated him and all other women had too much hair on their heads this creature with thinning hair was far more marvelous she neared wonderful amazing incredible she touched his chin as he knelt on the ground and her fingertips were as soft as clouds yes youll do she said come my pet join the others she gestured toward a group following her several wise ones a pair of aes sedai a man with a spear rhuarc growled would this man try to take the affection of his beloved he would kill the man for that he would his mistress chuckled and moridin thinks this face a punishment well you dont care what face i wear do you my pet her voice grew softer and at the same time harsher when im through nobody will moridin himself will praise my beauty for he will see through eyes that i grant him just like you pet just like you she patted rhuarc he joined her and the others and moved through the valley leaving behind the men he had called brothers rand stepped forward as a roadway formed itself from threads of light in front of him his foot fell on a bright clean paving stone and he passed from nothingness into majesty the road was wide enough to let six wagons pass one another at a time but no vehicles clogged the roadway only people vibrant people in colorful clothing chatting calling eager sounds filled the emptinessthe sounds of life rand turned looking at the buildings as they grew around him tall houses lined the thoroughfare ribbed with columns in front long and thin they abutted one another their faces toward the roadway beyond them lay domes and marvels buildings that stretched toward the sky it was like no city he had ever seen though the workmanship was ogier partly ogier work that was nearby workers repaired a stone facade that had broken during a storm thickfingered ogier laughed rumbling laughs as they worked alongside men when the ogier had come to the two rivers to repay rand for his sacrifice intending to build a monument here the towns leaders had wisely requested help improving their city instead over the years the ogier and two rivers people had worked closely togetherto the extent that now two rivers craftsmen were sought the world over rand walked up the roadway moving among people from all nationalities domani trailing colorful filmy clothing tairensthe division between commoner and noble vanishing more and more by the dayin baggy clothing and shirts marked by striped sleeves seanchan wearing exotic silks borderlanders with noble airs even some sharans all had come to emonds field the city now bore little resemblance to its name and yet there were hints more trees and open green spaces dotted the landscape than one would find in other great cities like caemlyn or tear in the two rivers craftsmen were revered and their marksmen were the best the world knew an elite group of two rivers men armed with the new firing sticks men were calling rifles served with the aiel in their peacekeeping campaigns in shara it was the only place war was known in the world oh there were disputes here and there the flare up between murandy and tear five years back had nearly given the land its first real war in the century since the last battle rand smiled as he moved through the crowd not jostling but listening with pride to the joy in peoples voices the flareup in murandy had been dynamic by fourth age standards but in truth it had been nothing a single disgruntled nobleman had fired on an aiel patrol three wounded none dead and this was the worst fighting in years outside of the sharan campaigns above sunlight broke through the thin cloud cover bathing the roadway in light rand finally reached the city square which had once been the green in emonds field what to think of the quarry road now that it was wide enough to march an army down he walked around the massive fountain at the center of the square a monument to those who had fallen in the last battle crafted by the ogier he saw familiar faces among the statuary in the center of the fountain and turned away not final yet he thought this isnt real yet hed built this reality out of threads of what could be of mirrors of the world as it now played out it wasnt set for the first time since entering this vision of his own design his confidence shook he knew the last battle wasnt a failure but people were dying did he think to stop all death all pain this should be my fight he thought they shouldnt have to die wasnt his sacrifice enough so hed asked time and time again the vision quivered fine stones beneath his feet buzzing buildings shaking and wavering the people stopped in place motionless sound dying down a small side street he saw a darkness appear like a pinprick that expanded engulfing everything near itsucking them in it grew to the size of one of the houses slowly expanding your dream is weak adversary rand asserted his will and the quivering stopped people who had frozen in place resumed walking and the comfortable chatter sprang up again soft wind blew down the walkway rustling banners on poles proclaiming celebration i will see that it happens rand said to the darkness this is your failing happiness growth love these people are mine now i will take them you are darkness rand said loudly darkness cannot push back light darkness exists only when light fails when it flees i will not fail i will not flee you cannot win so long as i bar your path shaitan we shall see rand turned from the darkness and continued doggedly around the fountain on the other side of the square a large set of majestic white steps led up to a building four stories high and of incredible craftsmanship carved with reliefs topped by a gleaming copper roof the building was decked with banners one hundred years a hundred years of life a hundred years of peace the woman who stood at the top of the steps had a familiarity to her features some saldaean heritage but also dark curls of hair that felt distinctly two rivers lady adora perrins granddaughter and mayor of emonds field rand walked up the steps as she gave her speech of commemoration nobody noticed him he made it so that they didnt he slipped like a gray man behind her as she proclaimed the day of celebration then he entered the building it was not a government office though it might seem so from the front it was much more important a school to the right grand hallways were hung with paintings and ornaments to rival those of any palacebut these depicted the great teachers and storytellers of the past from anla to thom merrilin rand strolled that hallway looking in at rooms where any could come and gain knowledge from the poorest farmer to the children of the mayor the building had to be large to accommodate all who wanted to learn your paradise is flawed adversary darkness hung in a mirror to rands right it reflected not the hallway but instead his presence you think you can eliminate suffering even if you win you will not on those perfect streets men are still murdered at night children go hungry despite the efforts of your minions the wealthy exploit and corrupt they merely do so quietly it is better rand whispered it is good it is not enough and will never be enough your dream is flawed your dream is a lie i am the only honesty your world has ever known the dark one attacked him it came like a storm a burst of wind so terrible it threatened to rip rands skin from his bones he stood tall eyes toward the nothing crossing his arms behind his back the attack ripped away the visionthe beautiful city the laughing people the monument to learning and peace the dark one consumed it and once again it became mere possibility silviana held the one power felt it flooding her lighting the world when she held saidar she felt as if she could see all it was a glorious feeling so long as she acknowledged that it was merely a feeling it was not truth the lure of saidars power had coaxed many a woman into foolhardy gestures certainly many blues had made them at one point or another silviana sculpted fire from horseback leveling sharan soldiers she had trained her gelding stinger to never be skittish around channeling archers fall back chubain yelled from just behind her go go heavy infantry companies advance the armored foot soldiers marched past silviana with axes and maces to confront the disoriented sharans on the slopes pikes would have been better but they didnt have nearly enough of those for everyone she wove one more burst of fire into the enemy preparing the way then turned her attention to the sharan archers higher up on the slope once egwenes forces had rounded the bogs they had split into two assault groups the aes sedai had moved in with the white tower infantry attacking sharans on the heights from the west by this time the fires had been extinguished and most of the trollocs had moved off the heights to attack below the other half of egwenes army mainly cavalry were sent into the corridor that skirted the bogs and led toward the ford they attacked the vulnerable rear flanks of the trollocs that had come down the slopes to hit elaynes troops defending the area around the ford the first groups main job was to make its way up the western slope silviana began aiming a careful series of lightning blasts at the sharans who were advancing to repel them once the infantry has forced its way up the slope a ways chubain said from beside egwene well have the aes sedai start mother chubains voice had risen silviana spun on horseback looking with alarm at egwene the amyrlin wasnt channeling her face had grown pale and she was trembling was she being attacked by a weave not one silviana could see figures gathered at the top of the slope pushing aside the sharan infantry they began to channel and lightning fell on the white tower army each with a crack shattering the air and a flash of light bright enough to stun mother silviana kneed her horse up beside egwenes mount demandred must be attacking her touching the saangreal in egwenes hands for an extra boost of power silviana wove a gateway the seanchan woman who rode behind egwene grabbed the amyrlins reins and yanked the horse to safety through the gateway silviana followed yelling stand against those sharans warn the male channelers of demandreds attack on the amyrlin seat no egwene said weakly wavering in her saddle as the horses clopped into a large tent silviana would have liked to take her farther away but she had not known the area well enough for a long jump no its not whats wrong silviana asked pulling up beside her and letting the gateway vanish mother its gawyn she said pale trembling hes been hurt badly hes dying silviana oh light silviana thought warders she had feared something like this from the moment shed seen that fool boy where silviana asked on the heights im going to find him ill use gateways travel in his direction light mother silviana said do you have any idea how dangerous that will be stay here and lead the white tower i will try to find him you cant sense him pass his bond to me egwene froze you know it is the right thing to do silviana said if he dies it could destroy you let me have his bond it will let me find him and it will protect you should he die egwene was aghast how dare silviana even suggest this but then she was a redand they concerned themselves little with warders silviana did not know what she was asking no egwene said no i wont even consider it besides if he dies that would only protect me by shifting the pain to you i am not the amyrlin no if he dies i will survive it and keep fighting jumping to him by gateway would be foolish as you say and i will not let you do it either he is on the heights we will force our way up there as ordered and that way we can reach him it is the best choice silviana hesitated then nodded that would do together they returned to the western side of the heights but silviana stewed fool man if he died egwene would have a very difficult time continuing to fight the shadow didnt need to fell the amyrlin herself to stop her it just had to kill one idiot boy what are those sharans doing elayne asked softly birgitte steadied her horse taking the looking glass from elayne she raised it looking across the dry river toward the slope of the heights where a large number of sharan troops had gathered she grunted theyre probably waiting for the trollocs to be filled with arrows you dont sound very certain elayne said retrieving the looking glass she held the one power but wasnt using it for now her army had been fighting here at the river for two hours the trollocs had surged into the riverbed all up and down the mora but her troops were holding them off from stepping onto shienaran soil the bogs prevented the enemy from swinging around her left flank her right flank was more vulnerable and would need to be watched it would be much worse if all the trollocs were pushing to cross the river but egwenes cavalry was hitting them from behind that took some of the pressure off her army men held the trollocs back with pikes and the small flow of water still trickling through the bed had turned completely red elayne sat resolute watching and being seen by her troops the finest of andor bled and died holding back the trollocs with difficulty the sharan army appeared to be readying a charge off the heights but elayne was unconvinced they would launch an attack just yet the white tower assault on the western side had to be a concern to them mat sending egwenes army to attack from behind the heights was a stroke of genius im not very certain of what i said birgitte said softly not at all not about much any more elayne frowned shed thought the conversation over what was birgitte saying what about your memories the first thing i remember now is waking up to you and nynaeve birgitte said softly i can remember our conversations about being in the world of dreams but i cannot remember the place itself its all slipped away from me like water between my fingers oh birgitte the woman shrugged i cant miss what i dont remember the pain in her voice belied the words gaidai birgitte shook her head nothing i feel that im supposed to know someone by that name but i dont she chuckled like i said i dont know what ive lost so its all right are you lying bloody ashes of course i am its like a hole inside of me elayne a deep gaping hole bleeding out my life and memories she looked away birgitte im sorry birgitte turned her horse and moved off a way obviously not wanting to discuss the matter further her pain radiated its spikes in the back of elaynes mind what would it be like to lose so much birgitte didnt have a childhood parents her entire life all she remembered usually spanned less than a year elayne started to go after her but her guards moved aside to let galad approach attired in the armor tabard and cloak of the lord captain commander of the children of the light elayne tightened her lips galad sister galad said i assume that it would be completely futile to inform you how inappropriate it is for a woman in your condition to be on the battlefield if we lose this war galad my children will be born into captivity to the dark one if they are born at all i think fighting is worth the risk so long as you refrain from holding the sword personally galad said shading his eyes to inspect the battlefield the words implied that he was giving her permissionpermissionto lead her troops streaks of light shot from the heights striking at the last dragons firing from the field just behind her troops such strength demandred had power that eclipsed rands if he turns that power against my troops why would cauthon bring me down here galad said softly he wanted a dozen of my best men youre not asking me to guess the mind of matrim cauthon are you elayne asked im convinced that mat only acts simple so that people will let him get away with more galad shook his head she could see a group of his men gathered nearby they were pointing toward the trollocs that were slowly making their way upriver on the arafellin bank elayne realized her right flank was in jeopardy send for six companies of crossbowmen elayne said to birgitte guybon needs to reinforce our troops upriver light this is starting to look bad the white tower was out there on the west slope of the heights where the channeling was most furious she couldnt see much of it but she could feel it smoke billowed over the top of the heights lit by splashing explosions of lightning like a beast of storm and hunger stirring amid the blackness its eyes flashing as it woke elayne was suddenly aware of the pervasive scent of smoke in the air the cries of pain from men thunder from the sky trembles in the earth the cold air resting upon a land that would not grow the breaking weapons grinding of pikes against shields the end it really had come and she stood upon its precipice a messenger galloped up bearing an envelope he gave the proper pass codes to elaynes guard dismounted and was allowed to step up to her and galad he addressed galad handing the letter to him from lord cauthon sir he said youd be here galad took the letter and frowning opened it he slipped a sheet of paper from inside elayne waited patientlypatientlyto a count of three then moved her horse up beside galads mount and craned her neck to read honestly one would think hed take concern for the comfort of a pregnant woman the letter was written in mats hand and elayne noticed with amusement the handwriting was much neater and the spelling much better in this one than the one hed sent her weeks ago apparently the pressure of battle made matrim cauthon into a better clerk galad not much time to be flowery youre the only one i trust with this mission youll do what is right even when nobody bloody wants you to the borderlanders might not have the stomach for this but ill bet i can trust a whitecloak take this get a gateway from elayne do what has to be done mat galad frowned then upended the envelope dumping out something silvery a medallion on a chain a single tar valon mark slid out beside it elayne breathed out then touched the medallion and channeled she could not this was one of the copies shed made one of those shed given mat mellar had stolen another one it protects the wearer against channeling elayne said but why send it to you galad turned the sheet of paper over apparently noticing something written on the back in a hastier scrawl was ps in case you dont know what do what needs to be done means it means that i want you to go bloody slaughter as many of those sharan channelers as you can ill bet you a full tar valon mark its only been shaved on the sides a littlethat you cant kill twenty mc thats bloody devious elayne breathed out blood and bloody ashes it is hardly fitting language for a monarch galad said folding the message and placing it in the pocket of his cloak he hesitated then put the medallion around his neck i wonder if he knows what he is doing by giving one of the children an artifact that makes one immune to the touches of the aes sedai the orders are good ones i will see them carried out you can do it then elayne asked kill women perhaps once i would have hesitated galad said but that would have been the wrong choice women are as fully capable of being evil as men why should one hesitate to kill one but not the other the light does not judge one based on gender but on the merit of the heart interesting what is interesting galad asked you actually said something that doesnt make me want to strangle you perhaps there is hope for you someday galad damodred he frowned this is neither the place nor the time for levity elayne you should see to gareth bryne he appears agitated she turned surprised to find the aging general speaking with her guards general she called to him bryne looked up then bowed formally from horseback did my guard stop you elayne asked as he approached had word of brynes compulsion spread no your majesty he said his horse was lathered he had been riding hard i did not wish to bother you personally something is troubling you elayne said out with it your brother has he come this way gawyn she asked looking to galad i havent seen him nor i galad said the amyrlin was certain hed be with your forces bryne said shaking his head he went to fight on the front lines perhaps he came in disguise why would he he was gawyn he would want to fight yet sneaking to the front lines in disguise didnt seem like him he might gather some men loyal to him and lead a few charges but sneak gawyn it was difficult to imagine i will spread word elayne said as galad bowed to her then withdrew on his mission perhaps one of my commanders has seen him ah mat thought face so close to the maps that it was nearly level with them then he waved to the side having mika the damane open a gateway mat could have traveled to the top of dashar knob to get an overview however the last time he had done so enemy channelers had targeted him shearing off part of the summit and despite being so high dashar knob did not allow him to see everything happening below the western side of polov heights he scrambled over hands on the lip of the gateway in the table inspecting the landscape below elaynes line at the river was being pushed back they had run archers to their right flank good blood and bloody ashes those trollocs had nearly the weight behind them of a cavalry push hed need to send word to elayne to get her cavalry lined up behind the pikes like when i fought sana ashraf at the falls of pena he thought heavy cavalry horseback archers heavy cavalry horseback archers one after another taerain dhai hochin dieb sene mat could not remember being this engaged by a battle the fight against the shaido had not been nearly so gripping though mat had not been leading that battle entirely the fight against elbar had not been this satisfying either of course that had been on a much smaller scale demandred knew how to gamble mat could sense it through the movements of troops mat was playing against one of the best who had ever lived and the stake this time was not wealth they diced for the lives of men and the final prize was the world itself blood and bloody ashes but that excited him he did feel guilty about that but it was exciting lan is in position mat said straightening up and returning to his maps making some notations tell him to strike the trolloc army crossing the riverbed by the ruins needed to be crushed hed moved the borderlanders around the heights to attack their vulnerable rear flanks while tam and his combined forces continued to pound them from the front tam had killed large numbers of them before and after the river had stopped that trolloc horde was close to being broken and a coordinated action on two sides could do it tams men would be tired could they hold long enough for lan to arrive and hit the trollocs from behind light mat hoped they could if they didnt someone darkened the doorway of the command position a tall man with dark curling hair wearing the coat of an ashaman he had the expression of a man who had just drawn a losing hand light a trolloc would have found that stare unnerving min who had been speaking with tuon choked off logain seemed to have a special glare for her mat straightened dusting off his hands i hope you didnt do anything too nasty to the guards logain the weaves of air will untie on their own in a minute or two the man said voice harsh i didnt think they were likely to allow me in mat glanced at tuon she had grown stiff as a wellstarched apron seanchan did not trust women who could channel let alone someone like logain logain mat said i need you to fight alongside the white tower army those sharans are pounding them logain had locked eyes with tuon logain mat said if you havent noticed were fighting a bloody war here it is not my war this is our war mat snapped every one of us i stood forth to fight logain said and what was my reward ask the red ajah they will tell you the reward of a man abused of the pattern he barked a laugh the pattern demanded a dragon and so i came too soon just a little too soon listen here mat said stepping up to logain youre angry because you didnt get to be the dragon nothing so petty logain said i follow the lord dragon let him die i wish no part of that feast i and mine should be with him not fighting here this battle for the little lives of men is nothing compared to the battle happening at shayol ghul and yet you know we need you here mat said you would already be gone otherwise logain said nothing go to egwene mat said take everyone you have and keep those sharan channelers busy what of demandred logain asked softly he cries out for the dragon he has the power of a dozen men none of us can face him but you want to try dont you mat replied thats why youre really here right now you want me to send you against demandred logain hesitated then nodded he cannot have the dragon reborn he will have to take me instead the dragons replacement if you will blood and bloody ashes theyre all insane unfortunately what else was mat going to do against one of the forsaken right now his battle plan revolved around keeping demandred occupied forcing the man to respond if demandred had to act as general he couldnt do as much damage channeling he would have to come up with something to deal with the forsaken he was working on that hed been working on it the whole bloody battle and hadnt come up with anything mat glanced back through his gateway elayne was being pressed too hard he had to do something send in the seanchan he had them positioned at the southern end of the field on the banks of the erinin they would be a wildcard to demandred preventing him from committing all his troops in the battles being waged below the heights in addition he had plans for them important ones logain didnt have much of a shot against demandred in mats estimation but hed have to deal with the man somehow if logain wanted to try then so be it you may fight him mat said do it now or wait until he is weakened a little light i hope we can weaken him anyway i leave it to you pick your time and attack logain smiled then made a gateway right in the middle of the room and strode through hand on his sword he had enough pride to be the dragon reborn that was for certain mat shook his head what he would give to be done with all of these high heads mat might be one of them now but that could be fixed all he had to do was convince tuon to forsake her throne and run off with him that would not be easy but bloody ashes he was fighting the last battle compared to the challenge he now faced tuon seemed to be an easy knot to untie glory of men min whispered its still to come someone go check on those guards mat said returning to his maps tuon we may want to move you this place never has been secure and logain has just proven it i can protect myself she said haughtily too haughty he raised an eyebrow at her and she nodded really mat thought this is what you want to fight about he was not certain the spy would buy it too flimsy a reason his plan with tuon was to take a cue from what rand had once done with perrin if mat could fake a split between himself and the seanchan and in so doing make tuon pull her forces back perhaps the shadow would ignore her mat needed an edge of some sort two guards came in no three that one fellow was easy to miss mat shook his head at tuonthey needed to find something more realistic to argue overand glanced back at his maps something itched at him about the little guard looks more like a servant than a soldier mat thought he forced himself to look up though he really should not let himself become distracted by common servants yes there the fellow was standing beside mats table not worth paying attention to even if he was pulling a knife out a knife mat stumbled back as the gray man attacked mat yelled reaching for one of his own knives just as mika screamed channeling nearby min threw herself at fortuona as the wall of the command post went up in flame sharans in strange armor made of bands of metal painted gold ripped through the blazing opening channelers with tattooed faces accompanied them the women in long stiff black dresses the men shirtless trousers ragged min took this in just before she tipped fortuonas throne over fire burned through the air above min singeing her ornate silks and consuming the wall behind them fortuona scrambled out of mins grip lying low and min blinked in surprise the woman had left her bulky costume behindit was made to break awayand underneath wore sleek silken trousers and a tight shirt both black tuon came up with a knife in her hand growling softly in an almost feral way nearby mat fell backward to the ground a knifewielding man on top of him where had that man come from she didnt remember him entering tuon ran for mat as sharan channelers began to pound the command post with fire min struggled to her feet in the awful clothing she pulled a dagger out and huddled by the throne putting her back to it as the ground heaved she couldnt reach fortuona so she forced herself out the back wall which was made of the paperlike stuff the seanchan called tenmi she coughed at the smoke but now that she was outside the air was clearer none of the sharans were here on this side of the building they were all attacking from the other directions she sprinted along the wall channelers were dangerous but if she could put a knife in one all of the one power in the world wouldnt matter she peeked around the corner and was surprised by a man crouching there a feral look in his eyes he had an angular face his bloodred neck tattoos looked like claws cupping his lightskinned head and chin he growled and min threw herself backward to the ground ducking a ribbon of fire and throwing her knife the man caught it in the air he prowled forward in a crouch bestial smiling at her then he jerked suddenly and fell over thrashing a trickle of blood came from his lips that a woman said nearby a sound of utter distaste in her tone is something im not supposed to know how to do but stopping someones heart with the one power is quiet it requires very little power surprisingly which is pertinent to me siuan min said youre not supposed to be here lucky for you i am siuan said with a snort inspecting the body staying low bah nasty business that but if youre going to eat a fish you should be willing to gut it yourself whats wrong girl youre safe now no need to look so pale youre not supposed to be here min said i told you stay near gareth bryne i did stay near him almost near as his own smallclothes ill have you know we saved one anothers lives because of it so i guess the viewing was right are they ever wrong no ive told you that min whispered never siuan i saw an aura around bryne that meant you had to stay together or the two of you would die it hangs above you right now whatever you think you did the viewing has not been accomplished yet its still there siuan stood frozen for a moment cauthon is in danger but i dont care girl nearby the ground trembled with the force of the one power the damane were fighting back if cauthon falls this battle is lost i dont care if we both die from this we must help move min nodded then joined her as she moved around the side of the ragged building the firefight outside was a raw mix of explosions smoke and flames members of the deathwatch guard charged the sharans swords out heedless of their companions being slaughtered around them that at least was keeping the channelers busy the command post burned with such heat that min had to shy back raising an arm hold on siuan said then used the one power to draw a small column of water out of a nearby barrel spraying them both ill try to dampen the flames she said redirecting the small column of water to the command post all right lets go min nodded bursting through the flames siuan joining her the tenmi walls inside had all started aflame burning away quickly fire dripped from the ceiling there min said blinking away tears from the heat and the smoke she pointed toward dark figures struggling near the center of the building and mats blazing map table there seemed to be a group of three or four people fighting mat light they were all gray mennot just one of them tuon was down min ran past the corpse of a suldam alongside several guards siuan used the one power to haul one of the gray men away from mat guards corpses created shadows of firelight on the floor one damane still lived huddled in a corner looking terrified her leash on the floor her suldam lay a distance away unmoving her grip had been knocked free it appeared and then she was killed as she tried to get back to her damane do something min shouted at the girl grabbing her by the arm the damane shook her head crying burn you min said the ceiling of the structure groaned min ran for mat one gray man was dead but there were two others wearing the uniforms of seanchan guards min had trouble seeing the living ones they were inhumanly average in every way utterly nondescript mat bellowed knifing one of the men but he didnt have his spear min didnt know where it was mat pushed forward reckless taking a gash along his side why tuon min realized stumbling to a halt one of the gray men knelt above her motionless form raising a dagger and min threw mat toppled to the ground a few feet from tuon the final gray man had him by the legs mins knife spun through the air reflecting flames and took the gray man over tuon in the chest min breathed out never in her life had she been so happy to see a knife fly true mat had cursed turning about booting his aggressor in the face he followed that with a knife then scrambled for tuon hauling her up onto his shoulder min met him siuan is here too she mat pointed siuan lay on the floor of the building her eyes stared sightlessly and all the images were gone from above her dead min froze heart wrenching siuan she moved toward the woman anyway unable to believe she was dead though her clothing burned from the explosion of fire that had taken her and about half of the wall nearby her out mat said coughing cradling tuon he threw his shoulder against a wall that was only halfburned breaking out into the air min groaned leaving siuans corpse blinking away tears both from grief and from the smoke she coughed as she followed mat out into open air the outside smelled so sweet so cold behind them the building groaned then collapsed in moments min and mat were surrounded by members of the deathwatch guard not a one tried to take tuonwho was still breathing if shallowlyaway from mat from the look in his eye min doubted theyd have been able to do so farewell siuan min thought looking back as guards ushered her away from the fighting below dashar knob may the creator shelter your soul she would send word to others to protect bryne but she knewdeep downit would be futile he would have gone into a vengeful rage the moment siuan died and discounting that there was the viewing she was never wrong sometimes min hated her accuracy but she was never wrong strike at their weaves egwene yelled ill attack she didnt wait to see if she was obeyed she struck holding as much power as she could drawing it through voras saangreal and heaving three different bands of fire upslope at the entrenched sharans around her brynes welltrained troops struggled to maintain battle lines as they fought sharan soldiers working their way up the western side of the heights the hillside was pocked with hundreds of furrows and holes created by weaves from one side or the other egwene fought forward desperately she could feel gawyn above but she thought he was unconscious his spark of life was so faint that she could barely sense his direction her only hope was to fight through the sharans and reach him the ground rumbled as she vaporized a sharan woman above saerin doesine and other sisters concentrated on deflecting the enemy weaves while egwene focused on sending attacks she stepped forward one step after another im coming gawyn she thought growing frantic im coming we come to report wyld demandred ignored the messengers for the moment he flew upon the wings of a falcon inspecting the battle through the birds eyes ravens were better but each time he tried using one of those one borderlander or another shot it down of all the customs to remember through the ages why did it have to be that one no matter a falcon would work even if the bird did resist his control he guided it about the battlefield inspecting formations deployments advancements of troops he did not have to rely upon the reports of others it should have been an almost insurmountable advantage lews therin could not use such an animal this was a gift only the true power could grant demandred could channel only a thin trickle of the true power not enough for destructive weaves but there were other ways to be dangerous unfortunately lews therin had his own advantage gateways that looked down upon a battlefield it was discomforting the things people of this time discovered things that hadnt been known during the age of legends demandred opened his eyes and broke his bond to the falcon his forces were advancing but each step was a grueling ordeal tens of thousands of trollocs had been slain he had to be careful their numbers were not limitless he was currently on the eastern side of the heights looking down at the river below and northeast of the place where lews therins assassin had tried to kill him here demandred was nearly opposite the hill that moghedien said they called dashar knob the rock formation rose high in the air its base was a fine position for a command post sheltered from attacks by the one power it was so tempting to strike there himself to travel to it and lay waste but was that what lews therin wanted demandred would fight the man he would however traveling into the enemys stronghold and possibly a trap surrounded as it was by those high rock walls better to draw lews therin to him demandred dominated this battlefield he could choose where their confrontation would occur the riverbed had been slowed to a muddy trickle below and demandreds trollocs fought to seize the southern bank the defenders held for now but he would have them soon far upriver mhael had done his work well in diverting that water though he had reported unusual resistance townspeople and a small unit of soldiers an oddity that demandred had not yet deciphered he had almost wished for failure from mhael though demandred himself had been the one to recruit the man he had not expected mhael to rise to the rank of chosen so quickly demandred turned to the side before him bowed three women in black with white ribbons next to them shendla shendla he had thought himself long past caring for a woman again how could affection thrive beside the burning passion that was his hatred for lews therin and yet shendla devious capable powerful almost it was enough to change his heart what is your report he asked the three bowing women in black the hunt was a failure galbrait said her head low he escaped yes wyld i have failed you he heard the pain in the womans voice one was leader of the female ayyad you were not meant to kill him demandred said he is a foe beyond your skill you have disrupted his command post yes galbrait said we killed half a dozen of his channelers set the building aflame and destroyed his maps did he channel did he reveal himself she hesitated then shook her head so he could not know for certain yet if this cauthon was lews therin in disguise demandred suspected he was but there were reports from shayol ghul that lews therin had been seen there on the slopes of the mountain he had proven devious in the last battle before jumping between battlefields showing himself here and there the more demandred maneuvered against the enemy general the more he believed that lews therin was here it would be very like lews therin to send a decoy north while coming to fight this battle himself lews therin had difficulty letting others fight for him he always wanted to be doing everything himself leading every battleevery charge if he could yes how else could demandred explain the skill of the enemy general only a man with the experience of an ancient was so masterly at the dance of battlefields at their core many battle tactics were simple avoid being flanked meet heavy force with pikes infantry with a welltrained line channelers with other channelers and yet the finesse of it the little details these took centuries to master no man from this age had lived long enough to learn the details with such care during the war of power the only thing that demandred had ever done better than his friend was as a battle general it stung to admit that but he would no longer hide from that truth lews therin had been stronger in the one power lews therin had been better at capturing the hearts of men lews therin had taken ilyena but demandred demandred had been better at war lews therin had never been able to correctly balance caution and boldness the man would hold back and deliberate worrying over his decisions until boiling forward in a reckless military action if this cauthon was lews therin the man had grown better at that the enemy general knew when to flip the coin and let fate rule but did not let too much ride on each result he would have made an excellent card player demandred would still defeat him of course the battle would merely be more interesting he rested his hand on his sword considering his scan of the battlefield moments before his trollocs continued their attack at the riverbed and lews therin had formed his pikemen opposite them into disciplined square formations a defensive move behind demandred the shaking booms of channelers marked the greater war that between his sharan ayyad and the aes sedai he held the advantage there his ayyad were far better at war than the aes sedai when would cauthon commit those damane moghedien had reported some dissension between them and the aes sedai could demandred widen the fracture there somehow he gave orders and the three ayyad nearby retreated shendla remained waiting his permission to leave he had her scouting the area nearby and watching for more assassins are you worried he asked her you know now for which side we fight so far as i know you have not given yourself to the shadow ive given myself to you wyld and for me you fight beside trollocs halfmen creatures from nightmare you said some would call your actions evil she said but i do not see them as such our path is clear once you are victorious you will remake the world and our people will be preserved she took his hand and something stirred within him it was quickly smothered by his hatred i would cast it all away he said looking into her eyes everything for a chance at lews therin you have promised to try she said that will be enough and if you destroy him you will destroy one world and preserve another i will follow you we will follow you her voice seemed to imply that perhaps once lews therin was dead demandred would be able to become his own man again he was not certain rule only interested him insofar as he could use it against his ancient enemy the sharans devoted and faithful were just a tool but within him there was something that wished it was not so that was new yes it was the air nearby warped bending no weaves were visiblethis was a ripping of the fabric of the pattern traveling by the true power mhael had arrived demandred turned and shendla released his arm but did not leave his side mhael had been given access to the great lords essence that did not make demandred jealous mhael was another tool still it made him wonder was anyone denied the true power these days you are going to lose the battle near the ruins demandred mhael said with an arrogant smile your trollocs there will be crushed you had the enemy vastly outnumbered and yet they still will defeat you i thought you were supposed to be our greatest general yet you lose to this rabble im disappointed demandred raised his hand casually two fingers up mhael jerked as two dozen nearby sharan channelers slammed shields between him and the one power they wrapped him in the air jerking him backward he fought back the airwarping aura of the true power surrounding him but demandred was faster he wove a true power shield building it from burning threads of spirit the threads trembled in the air each one barbed with twisting strands of energy so small the ends vanished into nothing the true power was so volatile so dangerous a shield crafted from it had a strange effect drinking in the power of another trying to channel it demandreds shield stole mhaels power and used the man like a conduit demandred gathered the true power and wove it into a crackling ball of force above his hand only mhael would be able to see it and the mans proud eyes opened wide as demandred drained him it was not unlike a circle the pulling of energy made mhael tremble sweat as he was held up by the weaves of demandreds ayyad this flow could burn mhael out if uncheckedcould flay his soul with the rushing of the true power like a river surging beyond its banks the twisting mass of threads in demandreds hands pulsed and crackled warping the air beginning to unravel the pattern tiny spiderweb cracks spread out on the ground from him cracks into nothingness he walked up to mhael the man began to have a seizure froth dripping from his lips you will listen to me mhael demandred said softly i am not as the other chosen i do not care one whit for your political games i dont care which of you the great lord favors which of you moridin pats on the head i care only for lews therin this is my fight you are mine i brought you to the shadow and i can destroy you if you interfere with what i do here i will snuff you out like a candle i realize you think yourself strong with your stolen dreadlords and untrained channelers you are a child an infant take your men create what chaos you wish but stay out of my way and stay away from my prize the enemy general is mine mhaels eyes though his body betrayed him with trembles were full of hatred not fear yes this one always had shown promise demandred turned his hand and launched a stream of balefire with the gathered true power the whitehot line of liquid destruction burned through the armies at the river below vaporizing each man or woman it touched their forms became points of light then dust hundreds of them vanishing he left a long line of burned ground like a furrow cut by an enormous cleaver release him demandred said allowing the true power shield to unravel mhael stumbled back keeping his feet sweat dripping from his face he gasped hand raised to his chest stay alive through this battle demandred said to him turning away and beginning a weave to summon his falcon back if you do so perhaps i will show you how to do as i just did you may think you wish to kill me now but know that the great lord watches beyond that consider this you may have a hundred pet ashaman i have over four hundred of my ayyad i am this worlds savior when he looked back mhael was gone having traveled away with the true power it was amazing that he could summon the strength after what demandred had just done he hoped he wouldnt have to kill the man he should prove useful i will win eventually rand stood before the blowing winds stood strong though his eyes watered as he stared into the darkness how long had he been in this place a thousand years ten thousand for the moment he concerned himself only with defiance he would not bend before this wind he could not give in for a fraction of a heartbeat the time has come finally time is nothing to you rand said it was true and it was not rand could see the threads swirling around him forming the pattern as it formed he saw the battlefields below him those he loved fighting for their lives these were not possibilities this was the truth what was actually happening the dark one wrapped around the pattern unable to take it and destroy it but able to touch it tendrils of darkness spines touched the world at points all along its length the dark one lay like shadow upon the pattern when the dark one touched the pattern time existed for him and so while time was nothing to the dark one heor it as the dark one had no gendercould only work within its bounds like like a sculptor who had marvelous visions and dreams but was still bound by the reality of the materials he worked with rand stared at the pattern resisting the dark ones attack he did not move or breathe breath wasnt needed here people died below rand heard their screams so many fell i will win eventually adversary watch them scream watch them die the dead are mine lies rand said no i will show you the dark one spun possibility again gathering up what could be and thrust rand into another vision juilin sandar was not a commander he was a thiefcatcher not some nobleman certainly not a nobleman he worked on his own except apparently when he ended up on a battlefield put in charge of a squad of men because he had successfully captured dangerous men as a thiefcatcher the sharans pressed against his men aiming for the aes sedai they fought on the western side of the heights and his squads job was to protect the aes sedai from sharan infantry aes sedai how had he ever gotten tangled up with aes sedai him a good tairen hold juilin yelled to his men hold he yelled it for his own benefit too his squad held to their spears and pikes forcing the sharan infantry backward up the slope he wasnt sure why he was here or why they were fighting in this sector he just wanted to stay alive the sharans shouted and cursed in an unfamiliar tongue they had a lot of those channelers but the outfit he faced was made up of regular troops who used a variety of hand weapons mostly swords and shields corpses littered the ground and that made it difficult for both sides as juilin and his men followed orders pushing against the sharan troops while the aes sedai and enemy channelers traded weaves juilin wielded a spear a weapon he was only mildly familiar with an armored sharan squad forced its way between myk and charns pikes the officers wore breastplates strangely wrapped in cloth of a variety of colors while the common rank and file wore leather fitted with strips of metal they all had their backs painted with strange patterns the leader of the sharan troop wielded a wicked mace smashing one pikeman then the other the man shouted at juilin curses he didnt understand juilin feinted and the sharan raised his shield so juilin rammed his spear into the mans armor at the gap between breastplate and arm light he didnt even flinch he smashed his shield into juilin forcing him back the spear slipped from juilins sweaty fingers he cursed reaching for his sword breaker a weapon he knew well myk and the others fought nearby engaging the rest of this sharan squad charn tried to help juilin but the crazed sharan brought his mace down on charns headsplitting it in two like a cracked walnut die you bloody monster juilin cried leaping forward and ramming his sword breaker into the mans neck just above the gorget other sharans were moving quickly toward his position juilin fell back as the man in front of him collapsed and died just in time as a sharan to his left tried to take his head off with a broad swing of his sword the tip of the sword went by his ear and juilin instinctively raised his own blade his opponents weapon broke in two and he quickly dispatched the man with a backhand slice to the mans throat juilin scrambled to pick up his spear fireballs fell nearby attacks from the aes sedai behind and the sharans on the heights ahead soil coated juilins hair and stuck in clumps to the blood on his arms hold juilin shouted to his men burn you we need to hold he attacked another sharan who came at him one of the pikemen raised his weapon in time to pin the man on the shoulder and juilin speared him through his leatherclad chest the air trembled his ears rang faintly from all of the explosions juilin pulled back yelling orders to his men he wasnt supposed to be here he was supposed to be someplace warm with amathera thinking about the next criminal he needed to catch he figured that every man on the field felt they should be someplace else the only thing to do was keep on fighting you look good in black androl sent to pevara as they moved through the enemy army on top of the heights that she replied back is something one should never never say to an aes sedai ever his only response was a sense of nervousness through the bond pevara understood theywearing inverted weaves of the mask of mirrors walked among darkfriends shadowspawn and sharans and it was working pevara wore a white dress and a black cloak over itthose werent part of a weavebut anyone looking into her cloaks hood would see the face of alviarin a member of the black ajah theodrin wore the face of rianna androl and emarin wore weaves that gave them the faces of nensen and kash two of taims cronies jonneth looked very unlike himself wearing the face of a nondescript darkfriend and he played the part well skulking behind and carrying their gear one would never have seen the goodnatured two rivers man in that hawkfaced man with the greasy hair and nervous manner they moved at a brisk pace along the back lines of the shadows army on the heights trollocs hauled bundles of arrows forward others left the lines to feast on piles of corpses cookpots boiled here that shocked pevara they were stopping to eat now only some of them androl sent its common for human armies too though these moments dont make it into the ballads the fighting has lasted all day and soldiers need energy while fighting usually you rotate in three batches your front lines your reserves and your offdutytroops who will trudge away from the fight and eat as quickly as they can before grabbing a little sleep then back to the front lines shed once seen war differently shed imagined every man committed every moment of the day a true battle however was not a sprint it was an extended soulgrinding trudge it was late afternoon already approaching evening to the east below the heights battle lines extended far in both directions along the dry riverbed many thousands of men and trollocs fought back and forth there large numbers of trollocs fought there but others were rotated back up the heights to either eat or collapse into unconsciousness for a time she did not look too closely at the cookpots though jonneth fell to his knees and sicked up beside the path he had noticed the body parts floating in the thick stew as he emptied his stomach onto the ground a passing group of trollocs snorted and hooted in mockery why are they pushing off the heights to take the river she sent to androl it seems to be a better position up here maybe it is androl sent but the shadow is the aggressor if they stay in this position it serves cauthons army demandred needs to keep pressing him that means crossing the river so androl understood tactics too interesting ive picked up a few things he sent i wont be leading a battle any time soon just curious how many lives youve led androl an odd statement coming from a woman who is old enough to be my grandmothers grandmother they continued along the eastern side of the heights distant on the far western side the aes sedai were battling their way up to the topbut for now the heights were held by demandreds forces this area pevara walked through was full of trollocs some bowed in a lumbering way as pevara and the others passed others curled up on the stones to sleep with no cushions or blankets each one kept its weapon at hand this does not look promising emarin said softly from behind his mask i do not see taim associating with trollocs any more than he has to ahead androl said look there the trollocs were separated from a group of sharans who could be seen up ahead wearing unfamiliar uniforms they wore armor that was wrapped in cloth so none of the metal showed except on the very back though the shape of the breastplates was still obvious pevara looked to the others i could see taim being part of that group emarin said its likely to smell far less putrid than over here among the trollocs for one thing pevara had been ignoring the stenchshe had learned to do that years ago snuffing out powerful scents in the same way she ignored heat and cold as emarin said it however a hint of what the others were smelling seeped through her defenses she quickly regained control it was awful will the sharans let us pass jonneth asked we shall see pevara said setting off toward the sharans their group fell in around her the sharan guards maintained an uneasy line against the trollocs watching them as they would enemies this alliance or whatever it was did not sit terribly well with the sharan soldiers they didnt try to mask their looks of disgust and many had tied cloths around their faces to mask the odors as pevara passed their line a noblemanor such she assumed him to be from his armor of brazen ringsmoved to confront her a wellpracticed aes sedai look staved him off i am far too important for you to bother that look said it worked beautifully and they were in the sharan reserve camp was orderly as men rotated in from the west where they fought the white tower forces the fierce channeling from that direction kept drawing pevaras attention like a bright light what do you think androl sent to her were going to need to talk to someone the battlefield is just too big for us to find taim on our own he sent back his agreement not for the first time pevara found their bond distracting she not only had to deal with her own nervousness but androls as well that crept from the back of her mind and she had to constrain it forcefully using breathing exercises shed learned when first in the tower she stopped in the center of the camp looking about trying to decide whom to approach she could distinguish servants from nobles approaching the former would be less dangerous but also less likely to yield results maybe you pevara started spinning around you should not be here the aged sharan was completely bald with a short gray beard twin sword hilts in the shape of serpents heads peeked out over his shoulders he wore the blades crossed at his back and he carried a staff that had strange holes along its length a flute of some sort come the man said his accent so thick pevara could barely make it out the wyld will need to see you who is the wyld pevara sent androl he shook his head feeling as baffled as she did this could turn out very badly the old man stopped ahead of them with an annoyed expression what would he do if they refused pevara was tempted to create a gateway for them to flee we follow androl thought striding forward were never going to find taim in this unless we talk to someone pevara frowned as he walked after the man the other ashaman joining him she hurriedly caught up i thought we had decided i was in charge she thought to him no he replied i thought that wed decided you would act like you were in charge she sent back a calculated mix of cold displeasure and an implication that the conversation was not yet finished androl sent back amusement did you just glare at me mentally thats impressive were taking a risk she sent back this man could lead us into anything yes he replied something smoldered inside of him something only hinted at until now you want taim that badly yes i do she nodded you understand he sent i lost friends to him as well androl she replied i watched then be taken right in front of me we have to be careful though we cant take too many risks not yet its the end of the world pevara androl sent back if we cant take risks now when will we she followed without further argument wondering at the determined focus she sensed in androl taim had awoken something inside of him by taking his friends and turning them to the shadow as they followed the old sharan pevara realized that she didnt understand what androl was feeling not completely aes sedai friends of hers had been taken but it wasnt the same as androl losing evin evin had trusted androl looked to androl for protection the aes sedai with pevara had been acquaintances friends but it was different the old sharan led them to a larger group of people many of whom wore fine clothing the highest noblemen and women among the sharans didnt seem to fight for not one of them carried a weapon they made way for the older man though several looked at his swords and sneered jonneth and emarin moved in around pevara and theodrin one to each side like bodyguards they eyed the sharans hands on weapons and she suspected that both were holding the one power well that would probably be expected of dreadlords who were walking among allies they didnt fully trust they didnt need to protect pevara in such a way but it was a nice gesture she had always thought it would be useful to have a warder she had gone to the black tower with the intention of taking multiple ashaman as warders perhaps androl immediately felt jealous what are you some green with a flock of men fawning over her she sent back amusement why not theyre too young for you he sent back jonneth is anyway and theodrin would fight you for him im considering bonding them she sent back not bedding them androl honestly besides emarin prefers men androl paused he does of course he does havent you been paying attention androl seemed baffled sometimes men could be surprisingly dense even observant ones like androl pevara embraced the one power as they reached the center of the group would she have time to make a gateway if something went wrong she did not know the area but so long as she traveled somewhere nearby that wouldnt matter she felt as if she was walking up to a noose and inspecting it deciding how well it would fit her neck a tall man in armor made of silvery discs with holes in the middle stood at the center of the group dispensing orders as they watched a cup moved toward him through the air androl stiffened hes channeling pevara demandred then it must be pevara let saidar flood her with its warm glow letting it wash away emotions the old man who had been leading them stepped forward and whispered something to demandred despite the enhanced senses of saidar pevara could not hear what was said demandred turned toward the group of them what is this has mhael so quickly forgotten his orders androl dropped to his knees as did the others though it galled her pevara went down as well great one androl said we were merely no excuses demandred yelled no games mhael is to take all of his dreadlords and destroy the white tower forces if i see any of you away from that fight i will make you wish id given you to the trollocs instead androl nodded eagerly then began backing away a whip of air pevara could not seealthough she could feel his pain through the bondcracked him in the face the rest of them followed after him scrambling away with heads low that was foolish and dangerous pevara thought at androl and effective he replied eyes ahead hand to his cheek blood seeping between the fingers we know taim is on the battlefield for sure and we know where to find him lets move galad scrambled through a nightmare he had known that the last battle might be the end of the world but now now he felt it channelers on both sides scourged one another shaking polov heights lightning had struck so often that galad could barely hear any longer and his eyes watered from the pain of seeing blasts strike nearby he threw himself up against the hillside digging his shoulder into the ground and ducking for cover as a series of explosions ripped up the earth in front of him his teamtwelve men in tattered white cloaksdove for cover with him the white towers forces were strained under the attacks but so were the sharan forces the power of so many channelers was incredible the main bulk of white tower infantry and a large number of sharan troops fought here on the western heights galad stayed on the perimeter of that battle looking for sharan channelers alone or in small groups in many places here the battle lines on both sides had fractured not surprising it was near impossible to maintain solid battle lines with all of that power being flung back and forth bands of soldiers scrambled about seeking cover in blownout holes in the rock others protected groups of channelers nearby women and men roamed about in small groups destroying soldiers with fire and lightning these were what galad hunted he raised his sword pointing at a trio of sharan women holding at the top of the heights he and his men were more than halfway up the slope three three would be difficult they turned their attention on a small band of men wearing the flame of tar valon lightning struck the unfortunate soldiers galad held up four fingers plan four he leaped out of his hollow and dashed toward the three women his men waited a count of five then followed behind the women saw him if theyd remained turned away galad would have gained the advantage one raised a hand and summoned fire hurling the weave at him the flame struck him and though he could feel its heat the weave unraveled and dissipatedleaving him singed but mostly unharmed the sharans eyes opened with shock that look that look was becoming familiar to galad now it was the look of a soldier whose sword had broken in battle the look of one who had seen something that should not be what did you do when the one power failed the thing you relied upon to raise you above common folk you died galads sword took the womans head off as one of her companions tried to seize him with air he felt the metal grow cold at his chest and sensed the rush of air moving around him a poor choice galad thought ramming his sword into the chest of a second woman the third proved smarter and she slammed him with a large rock he barely raised his shield before the rock smashed into his arm throwing him backward the woman raised another stone right as galads team hit her she fell to their swords galad caught his breath his head back pain radiating from the impact of the rock he groaned sitting up nearby his men hacked at the third sharan womans body they didnt need to be so thorough but some children had strange ideas about what aes sedai could do hed caught laird cutting off one of the sharan womens heads to bury it separate from the body unless you did that laird claimed they would return to life at the next full moon as the men butchered the other two corpses golever came over and offered galad a hand light burn me golever said a wide grin splitting his bearded face if this isnt the finest work weve ever done my lord captain commander i dont know what is galad stood up it is what must be done child golever i wish it had to be done more often this is what the children have awaited for centuries you are the first to deliver it the light illumine you galad damodred the light illumine you may the light illumine a day when men need not kill at all galad said tiredly it is not fitting to take joy in death of course my lord captain commander golever continued grinning galad looked across the bloody pandemonium of the western slope of the heights the light send cauthon could make some sense of this battle for galad certainly could not lord captain commander a frightened voice cried galad spun about hand on his sword it was alhanra one of his scouts what is it child alhanra galad asked as the spindly man ran up no horses they were on an incline and the animals would not have reacted well to the lightning better to trust ones own feet you need to see this my lord alhanra said panting its its your brother gawyn impossible no he thought not impossible he would be with egwene fighting on their front galad ran after alhanra golever and the others falling in around him gawyns body lay ashenfaced in a gap between two rocks on the top of the heights nearby a horse was munching on grass a trail of blood streaming down its side by the looks of it not the horses blood galad knelt down beside the younger mans corpse gawyn had not died easily but what of egwene peace brother galad said resting a hand on the body may the light galad gawyn whispered his eyes fluttering open gawyn galad asked shocked gawyn had a nasty gut wound he wore some strange rings there was blood everywhere his hand chest his entire body how could the man still be alive the warder bond he realized we need to carry you to a healer one of the aes sedai he reached into the hollow scooping up gawyn galad i failed gawyn stared at the sky eyes blank you did well no i failed i should have i should have stayed with her i killed hammar did you know that i killed him light i should have picked a side galad cradled his brother and began running along the slope toward the aes sedai he tried to shelter gawyn amid the attacks of channelers after only a few moments an explosion of earth ripped up among the children flinging them aside tumbling galad to the ground he dropped gawyn as he collapsed to the earth beside him gawyn trembled eyes staring distantly galad crawled over and tried to pick him up again but gawyn grabbed his arm meeting his eyes i did love her galad tell her if you are truly bonded then she knows this will hurt her gawyn said through pale lips and at the end of it i failed to kill him him demandred gawyn whispered i tried to kill him but i wasnt good enough ive never been quite good enough galad found himself in a very cold place he had seen men die he had lost friends this hurt more light but it did he had loved his brother loved him deeplyand gawyn unlike elayne had returned the sentiment i will bring you to safety gawyn galad said picking him up shocked to find tears in his eyes i will not be left without a brother gawyn coughed you wont be you have another brother galad one you do not know a son of tigraine who went into the waste son of a maiden born on dragonmount oh light dont hate him galad gawyn whispered i always hated him but i stopped i stopped gawyns eyes stopped moving galad felt for a pulse then sat back looking down at his dead brother the bandage gawyn had made for himself at his side seeped blood onto the dry ground below which hungrily soaked it up golever moved up to him helping alhanra whose blackened face and burned clothing smelled of smoke from the lightning strike take the wounded to safety golever galad said standing he reached up and felt the medallion at his neck take all of the men and go and you lord captain commander golever asked i will do what needs to be done galad said cold inside cold as winter steel i will bring light to the shadow i will bring justice to the forsaken gawyns thread of life vanished egwene lurched to a stop on the battlefield something severed within her it was as if a knife suddenly tore into her and scooped out the piece of gawyn inside leaving only emptiness she screamed falling to her knees no no it couldnt be she could feel him just ahead shed been running for him she could she could he was gone egwene howled opening herself to the one power and drawing in as much as she could hold she let it out as a wall of flames toward the sharans who were all around now they had once held the heights the aes sedai below but it was madness now she assailed them with the power clutching voras saangreal she would destroy them light it hurt it hurt so badly mother silviana cried seizing her arm you are out of control mother you will kill our own people please egwene breathed in gasps nearby a group of whitecloaks stumbled by carrying wounded down the hillside so close oh light he was gone mother silviana said egwene barely heard she touched her face and found tears there she had been bold before she had claimed she could keep fighting through the loss how naive that was she let the fire of saidar die within her with that gone life went out of her she slumped to the side and felt hands carrying her away through a gateway off the battlefield tam used his last arrow to save a whitecloak it wasnt something hed have ever imagined himself doing but there he was the wolfish trolloc stumbled back with the arrow through its eye refusing to go down until the young whitecloak pulled himself from the mud and struck at its knees his men were now positioned on the catwalks of the palisade shooting volleys of arrows at the trollocs that had surged across the riverbed here their numbers were depleted but there were still so many of them until this point the battle had been going well tams combined forces spread out mightily along the river on the shienaran side downriver the legion of the dragon crossbow banners and heavy cavalry stemmed the trolloc advance the same events were being played out here farther upriver with archers foot soldiers and cavalry stopping the trolloc incursion at the riverbed until the supplies began to dwindle and tam was forced to withdraw his men to the relative safety of the palisade tam looked to the side abell held up his bow shrugging he was out of arrows as well all up and down the catwalk the two rivers men held up their bows no arrows no more will be coming abell said softly the lad said that batch was the last the whitecloak army fought desperately mixed with members of perrins wolf guard but they were being pushed back from the riverbed in droves they fought on three sides and another force of trollocs had just swung around to box them in entirely the banner of ghealdan flew closer to the ruins arganda held that position along with nurelle and the remnants of the winged guard if this were any other battle tam would have had his men save their arrows to cover a retreat there would be no retreat this day and the order to loose had been the right one the lads had taken their time with each shot theyd likely killed thousands of trollocs during the hours of fighting but what was an archer without his bow still a two rivers man tam thought and still not willing to let this battle be lost off the catwalks and form up with weapons tam called to the lads leave the bows here we will fetch them when more arrows come our way more arrows wouldnt come but the two rivers men would be happier pretending that they might go back to their bows they formed up into ranks as tam had taught them armed with spears axes swords even some scythes everything and anything theyd had on hand along with shields for those with axes or swords and good leather armor for them all no pikes unfortunately after the heavy infantry had been outfitted there hadnt been any of those left stay tight tam said to them form into two wedges well push into the trollocs around the whitecloaks best thing to doat least the best tam could come up withwas to hit those trollocs that had just come around the back of the whitecloaks fragment them and help the whitecloaks break free the men nodded though they probably had very little understanding of the tactics it didnt matter so long as they kept disciplined ranks as tam had taught them they started forward running and tam was reminded of another battlefield snow cutting into his face blown by terrible winds in a way that battlefield had begun this all now it ended here tam placed himself at the point of the first wedge then put deoana man from deven ride who had served in the andoran armyat the point of the other tam guided his men forward briskly not letting them or himself dwell too much on what was about to happen as they approached the hulking trollocs with their swords polearms and battleaxes tam sought the flame and the void nervousness vanished all emotion evaporated he unsheathed the sword rand had given him the one with the dragons painted on the sheath it was as fine a weapon as tam had ever seen those folds in the metal whispered of ancient origin it seemed too good a weapon for tam he had felt that way about every sword hed ever used remember hold formation tam yelled back at his men dont let them break us apart if someone falls one man steps up and takes his place while another pulls the fallen man into the center of the wedge they nodded back at him and then they hit the trollocs in the back where they had surrounded the children of the light at the river his formations hit pounding forward the huge trollocs turned to fight fortuona waved away the sojhin who tried to replace her regal clothing she smelled of smoke from the fire and her arms had been burned and scored in several places she would not accept damane healing fortuona thought healing to be a useful developmentand some of her people were changing their attitudes toward itbut she was not certain the empress should submit to it besides her wounds were not dire the deathwatch guards kneeling before her would need some form of punishment this was the second time they had allowed an assassin to reach her and while she did not blame them for the failure to deny them punishment would be to deny them their honor it twisted her heart about but she knew what she would have to do she gave the order herself selucia as her voice should have done it but selucias wounds were being tended and karede deserved this small honor of receiving his execution order from fortuona herself you will go to engage the enemy marathdamane directly she ordered karede each of you who was on duty fight valiantly for the empire there and try to slay the enemys marathdamane she could see karede relax it was a way to continue serving he would probably have fallen on his own sword if given the choice himself this was a mercy she turned away from the man who had cared for her during her youth the man who had defied what was expected of him all for her she would find her own penance for what she must do later at this point she would grant him the honor she could darbinda she said turning to the woman who insisted upon calling herself min despite the honor of a new name that fortuona had given her it meant girl of pictures in the old tongue you have saved my life and possibly that of the prince of the ravens i name you of the blood doomseer let your name be venerated for generations to come darbinda folded her arms how like knotai she was stubbornly humble these mainlanders they were actually proudproudof their lowborn heritage baffling knotai himself sat on a nearby stump receiving battle reports and snapping out orders the aes sedai battle for the western heights was descending into chaos he met her eyes across the small gap between them then nodded once if there was a spyand fortuona would be surprised if there was not onethen now was the time to mislead them everyone who had survived the attack was gathered around fortuona had insisted on having them close ostensibly for the purpose of rewarding those who had served her well and meting punishment to those who had not each and every guard servant and noble could hear as she spoke knotai she said we have yet to discuss what i should do about you the deathwatch guard has charge of my safety but you have charge of the defense of this camp if you suspected that our command post was not safe why did you not speak earlier are you bloody suggesting that this is my fault knotai stood up and stilled the scouts reports with a gesture i gave you command here fortuona said the ultimate responsibility for failure is yours then is it not nearby general galgan frowned he did not see it this way others looked toward knotai with accusing eyes noble sycophants they would blame him because he wasnt born of the seanchan impressive that knotai had converted galgan so quickly or was galgan telegraphing his emotions purposefully was he the spy he could have been manipulating suroth or simply have been a redundant plant if suroth failed im not taking responsibility for this tuon knotai said you are the one who bloody insisted on watching from the camp when you could have been somewhere safe perhaps i should have done just that she replied coldly this entire battle has been a disaster you lose ground each moment you talk lightly and joke refusing proper protocol i do not think you approach this with the solemnity befitting your station knotai laughed it was a loud genuine laugh he was good at this fortuona thought she was the only one who saw the twin lines of smoke rising exactly behind him from the heights an appropriate omen for knotai a large gamble would yield large rewards or a great cost ive had it with you knotai said waving a hand at her you and your bloody seanchan rules just keep getting in the way then i have had it with you as well she said raising her head we should never have joined this battle we would be better preparing to defend our own lands to the southwest i will not let you throw away the lives of my soldiers go then knotai snarled what do i care she spun about stalking away come she said to the others gather our damane all but those deathwatch guards will travel to our armys camp at the erinin then we will all return to ebou dar we will fight the true last battle there once these fools have bloodied the shadowspawn for us her people followed had the ploy been convincing the spy had seen her consign to death men who loved her would that show that she was reckless reckless and selfimportant enough to pull her troops away from knotai it was plausible enough in a way she wanted to do as she said and fight in the south instead to do that of course would be to ignore the breaking sky the trembling land and the dragon reborns fight these were not omens she could let pass her by the spy did not know that it could not know her the spy would see a young woman foolish enough to want to fight on her own so she hoped the dark one spun a web of possibility around rand rand knew this struggle between themthe fight for what could be was vital to the last battle rand could not weave the future he was not the wheel nor anything like it for everything that had happened to him he was still merely a man yet in him was the hope of humankind humankind had a destiny a choice for its future the path they would take this battle would decide it his will clashing with that of the dark one as of yet what could be might become what would be breaking now would be to let the dark one choose that future behold the dark one said as the lines of light came together and rand entered another world a world that had not yet happened but a world that very well might soon come to be rand frowned looking up at the sky it was not red in this vision the landscape not ruined he stood in caemlyn much as he knew it oh there were differences steamwagons rattled down the streets mingling with the traffic of horsedrawn carriages and crowds walking the city had expanded beyond the new wallhe could see that from the height of the central hill he stood upon he could even make out the place where talmanes had blown a hole in the wall it had not been repaired instead the city had spilled out through it buildings covered what had once been fields outside rand frowned turning and walking down the street what game was the dark one playing surely this normal even prosperous city would not be part of his plans for the world the people were clean and did not look oppressed he saw no sign of the depravity that had marked the previous world the dark one had created for him curious he walked up to a stand where a woman sold fruit the slender woman gave him an inviting smile gesturing toward her wares welcome good sir i am renel and my shop is a second home to all seeking the finest of fruits from around the world i have fresh peaches from tear peaches rand said aghast everyone knew those were poisonous ha fear not good sir these have had the toxin removed they are as safe as i am honest the woman smiled taking a bite of one to prove it as she did a grubby hand appeared from under the fruit standan urchin hid underneath a young boy that rand had not noticed earlier the little boy snatched a red fruit of a type rand did not recognize then dashed off he was so thin that rand could see his ribs pressing against the skin of his toosmall form and he ran on legs so slender that it was a wonder the boy could walk the woman continued smiling at rand as she reached to her side took out a small rod with a lever at the side for her finger she pulled the lever and the rod cracked the urchin died in a spray of blood he fell sprawling to the ground people moved around him in the flow of traffic though somebodya man with many guardsdid scoop up the piece of fruit he wiped the blood off of it and took a bite continuing on his way a few moments later a steamwagon rolled over the corpse pressing it into the muddy roadway rand aghast looked back at the woman she tucked away her weapon a smile still on her face were you looking for any type of fruit in particular she asked him you just killed that child the woman frowned in confusion yes did it belong to you good sir no but light the woman didnt show a hint of remorse or concern rand turned and nobody else seemed to care in the slightest about what had happened sir the woman asked i feel as if i should know you that is fine clothing if a little out of style to which faction do you belong faction rand asked looking back and where are your guards the woman asked a man as rich as you has them of course rand met her eyes then ran to the side as the woman reached for her weapon again he ducked around a corner the look in her eyes utter lack of any kind of human sympathy or concern shed have killed him in a moment without a second thought he knew it others on the street saw him they nudged companions gesturing toward him one man he passed called out speak your faction others gave chase rand ducked around another corner the one power dared he use it he didnt know what was going on in this world as before he had trouble separating himself from the vision he knew that it wasnt completely real but he couldnt help believing himself part of it he didnt risk the one power and trusted his own feet for now he did not know caemlyn terribly well but he did remember this area if he reached the end of this street and turned yes there ahead he saw a familiar building with a sign out front showing a man kneeling before a woman with redgold hair the queens blessing rand reached the front doors as those chasing him piled around the corner behind they stopped as rand scrambled up to the door passing a brutish fellow standing to the side a new door guard rand did not know him did basel gill still own the inn or had it changed hands rand burst into the large common room heart thumping several men nursing pitchers of afternoon ale looked up at him rand was in luck basel gill himself stood behind the counter rubbing a cup with a cloth master gill rand said the stout man turned frowning do i know you he looked rand up and down my lord its me rand gill cocked his head then grinned oh you id forgotten you your friend isnt with you is he the one with the dark look to his eyes so people did not recognize rand as the dragon reborn in this place what had the dark one done to them i need to speak with you master gill rand said striding toward a private dining chamber what is it lad gill asked following after are you in trouble of some sort again rand shut the door after master gill what age are we in the fourth age of course so the last battle happened yes and we won gill said he looked at rand closely narrowing his eyes are you all right son how could you not know i spent my time in the woods these last years rand said frightened of what was happening ah then you dont know about the factions no light son youre in some meaty trouble here ill get you a faction symbol youll need one in a hurry gill pulled open the door and bustled out rand folded his arms noticing with displeasure that the fireplace in the room contained a nothingness beyond it what have you done to them rand demanded i let them think they won why many who follow me do not understand tyranny what does that have to do with rand cut off as gill returned he bore no faction symbol whatever that was instead hed gathered three thicknecked guards he pointed in toward rand gill rand said backing away and seizing the source what are you doing well i figure that coat will sell for something gill said he didnt sound the least bit apologetic and so youll rob me well yes gill seemed confused why wouldnt i the thugs stepped into the room looking rand over with careful eyes they carried cudgels because of the law rand said why would there be laws against theft gill asked shaking his head what manner of person are you to think such things if a man cannot protect what he has why should he have it if a man cannot defend his life what good is it to him gill waved the three men forward rand bound them in cords of air you took their consciences didnt you he asked softly gills eyes widened at the use of the one power he tried to run rand grabbed him in cords of air as well men who think they are oppressed will someday fight i will remove from them not just their will to resist but the very suspicion that something is wrong so you leave them without compassion rand demanded looking into gills eyes the man seemed terrified that rand would kill him as did the three thugs no remorse not a bit of it compassion is not needed rand felt deathly cold this is different from the world you showed me before what i showed before is what men expect it is the evil they think they fight but i will make a world where there is not good or evil there is only me do your servants know rand whispered the ones you name chosen they think they fight to become lords and rulers over a world of their own making instead you will give them this the same world except one without light there is only me no light no love of men the horror of it sank deep within rand shaking him this was one of the possibilities that the dark one could choose if he won it didnt mean he would or that it had to happen but oh light this was terrible far more terrible than a world of captives far more terrible than a dark land with a broken landscape this was true horror this was a full corruption of the world it was taking everything beautiful from it leaving behind only a husk a pretty husk but still a husk rand would rather live a thousand years of torture retaining the piece of himself that gave him the capacity for good than live a moment in this world without light he turned enraged upon the darkness it consumed the far wall growing larger you make a mistake shaitan rand yelled at that nothingness you think to make me despair you think to shatter my will this will not do it i swear to you this makes me sure to fight something rumbled inside of the dark one rand yelled pushing outward with his will shattering the dark world of lies and men who would kill without empathy it exploded into threads and rand was once again in the place outside of time the pattern rippling around him you show me your true heart rand demanded of the nothingness as he seized those threads i will show you mine shaitan there is an opposite to this lightless world you would create a world without shadow mat stalked away calming his anger tuon had seemed really angry at him light she would come back when he needed her to would she not mat min said hurrying up beside him go with her mat said keep an eye on her for me min but she doesnt need much protecting mat said shes a strong one bloody ashes but she is she does need watching though she worries me min anyway i have this bloody war to win i cant do that and go with her so would you go and watch her please min slowed then gave him an unexpected hug luck matrim cauthon luck min farshaw mat said he let her go then shouldered his ashandarei the seanchan had begun leaving dashar knob pulling back to the erinin before leaving the field of merrilor altogether demandred would let them go he would be a fool not to blood and bloody ashes what was mat getting himself into he had just sent away a good quarter of his troops theyll come back he thought if his gamble worked if the dice fell as he needed them only this battle was not a game of dice there was too much subtlety to it for that it was cards if anything mat usually won at cards usually to his right a group of men in dark seanchan armor marched toward the battlefield hey karede mat yelled the large man gave mat a dark look suddenly mat knew what an ingot of metal felt like when perrin eyed it hefting a hammer karede stalked up and though he obviously was making an effort to keep his face calm mat could feel the thunder coming off him thank you karede said voice stiff for helping protect the empress may she live forever you think i should have kept her someplace secure mat said not at the command post it is not my place to question one of the blood great one karede said youre not questioning me mat said youre thinking of sticking something sharp in me entirely different karede breathed out a long deep breath excuse me great one he said turning to leave i must take my men and die i dont think so mat said youre coming with me karede turned back toward him the empress may she live forever ordered you to the front lines mat said shading his eye as he scanned the riverbed swarming with trollocs great where do you bloody think im going you ride to battle karede asked i was thinking more of a saunter mat said he shook his head i need a feel for what demandred is doing im going out there karede and putting you fellows between me and the trollocs sounds delightful are you coming karede did not reply though he did not continue walking away either look what are your choices mat asked ride out there and die for really no purpose or come try to keep me alive for your empress im almost certain that shes fond of me maybe shes a hard one to read tuon is you do not call her by that name karede said ill call her what i bloody well want not if were to come with you karede said if i am to ride with you prince of the ravens i would not have my men hearing such from your lips it would be a bad omen well we wouldnt want any of those mat said right then karede lets dive back into this mess and see what we can do in fortuonas name tam raised his sword as if to begin a duel but found no honorable foes here only grunting howling ferocious trollocs drawn away from the beleaguered whitecloaks at this battle near the ruins the trollocs turned on the two rivers men and attacked tam holding the point of the wedge fell into reed in wind he refused to take a single step backward he bent this way and that but held firm as he broke the trolloc line slashing with his sword in quick movements the men of the two rivers pushed forward a thorn to the dark ones foot and a bramble to his hand in the chaos that followed they shouted and cursed and fought to drive the trollocs apart but soon their focus turned to holding their ground the trollocs surged around the men the wedge formation normally an offensive tactic worked well here too trollocs moved down the sides of the wedge taking hits from the two rivers men with their axes swords and spears tam let the lads training guide them he would have preferred to be in the center of the wedge calling out encouragement as dannil now did but he was one of the few who had any real battle training and the wedge formation depended on having a point who could hold steady so hold steady he did calm within the void he let the trollocs break upon him he moved from shake dew from the branch to apple blossoms in the wind to stones fall in the pondall forms that stabilized him in one position while fighting multiple opponents despite practice over the last few months tam wasnt nearly as strong as he had been in his youth fortunately a reed did not need strength he was not as practiced as he once had been but no reed practiced how to bend in the wind it simply did years of maturing years of age had brought tam an understanding of the void he understood it now better than he ever had years teaching rand responsibility years of living without kari years of listening to the wind blow and the leaves rustle tam althor became the void he brought it to the trollocs showed it to them and sent them into its depths he danced around a goatfeatured trolloc sweeping his sword to the side and slicing the beasts leg at the heel it stumbled and tam turned letting the men behind take it he flashed his sword upthe weapon trailing bloodand sprayed the dark droplets across the eyes of a charging trolloc with nightmare features it howled blinded and tam flowed forward arms out and opened its stomach below the breastplate it stumbled in front of a third trolloc who brought an axe down toward tam but hit its ally instead each step was part of a dance and tam invited the trollocs to join him he had only fought like this once before long ago but memory was something that the void did not allow he did not think of other times he did not think of anything if he knew that hed done this once before it was because of the resonance of his motions an understanding that seemed to permeate his muscles themselves tam stabbed the neck of a trolloc with a face that was nearly human with only a little too much hair on its cheeks it fell backward and collapsed and tam suddenly found no more foes he stopped bringing his sword up feeling a soft wind blow across him the dark beasts were thundering away downriver in a rout chased by horsemen flying borderlander flags shortly they would hit a wall of troops the legion of the dragon and be crushed between them and the pursuing borderlanders tam cleaned his blade leaving the void the gravity of the situation hit him light his men should be dead if those borderlanders hadnt arrived he placed his sword back into its lacquered sheath the red and gold dragon caught sunlight sparkling though tam wouldnt have thought there was anything to catch with that cloud cover above he searched for the sun and found itbehind the cloudsnearly at the horizon it was almost night fortunately it looked like the trollocs here at the battle by the ruins were finally breaking already weakened severely by the drawnout river crossing they now crumbled as lans men hit them from behind in a short time it was done tam had held nearby a black horse trotted up its rider lan mandragoranwith standardbearer and guards behindlooked over the two rivers men i had long wondered lan said to tam about the man who had given rand that heronmarked blade i wondered if he had truly earned it now i know lan raised his own sword in salute tam turned back toward his men an exhausted bloodied group clutching weapons the path of their wedge showed easily on the trampled plain dozens of trollocs lay behind where the wedge had cut into them to the north the men of the second wedge raised their weapons they had been pushed back nearly to the forest but theyd held there and some had survived tam couldnt help but see that dozens of good folk had died his exhausted men sat down right there on the battlefield surrounded by corpses some weakly began tying their own bandages or seeing to the wounded theyd pulled into the interior of the wedge to the south tam spotted a dismaying sight were those the seanchan pulling out from their camp at dashar knob have we won then tam asked far from it lan said weve seized this part of the river but it is the lesser fight demandred pressed his trollocs hard here to keep us from drawing resources to the larger battle at the ford downriver lan turned his horse gather your men blademaster this battle will not end with the setting sun you will be needed again in the coming hours taishar manetheren lan thundered toward his borderlanders taishar malkiertam called after him belatedly so were not done yet dannil asked no lad were not but well take a break get the men healed and find some food he saw gateways opening beside the field cauthon had been smart enough to send a means for tam to take his wounded to mayene it people poured through the openings hundreds of them thousands tam frowned nearby the whitecloaks were picking themselves uptheyd been hit hard by the trolloc attacks but tams arrival had kept them from being destroyed argandas force was forming up at the ruins and the wolf guard hoisted their flag high bloodied heaps of trolloc corpses surrounding them tam trudged across the field now his limbs felt like dead weights he felt more exhausted than if hed spent a month pulling stumps at the first of the gateways he found berelain herself standing with a few aes sedai the beautiful woman was terribly out of place here in this mud and death her gown of black and silver the diadem in her hair light she didnt belong here tam althor she said you command this force near enough tam said pardon my lady first but who are all of these people the refugees from caemlyn berelain said i sent some people to see if they needed healing they refused it and insisted that i bring them to the battle tam scratched at his head to the battle any manand many womenwho could hold a sword had already been drawn into the army the people he saw coming through the gateways were mostly children and the elderly and some matrons who had remained back to care for the young pardon tam said but this is a killing field so i tried to explain berelain said a hint of exasperation in her voice they claim they can be of use better than waiting out the last battle huddled together on the road to whitebridge so they say tam watched frowning as children scattered onto the field his stomach lurched at them investigating the gruesome dead and many did shy back at first others began picking through the fallen looking for signs of those people who were still alive and could be healed a few aged soldiers who had been set to guard the refugees went among them watching for trollocs that werent quite dead women and children began to pick arrows out from among the fallen that would be helpful very helpful with surprise tam saw hundreds of tinkers pour out of one gateway they went searching for the wounded under the direction of several yellow sisters tam found himself nodding it still worried him allowing the children to see such sights well he thought theyll see a worse sight if we fail here if they wanted to be of use they should be allowed tell me tam althor berelain asked is galad damodred well i see his men here but not his banner he was called to other duties my lady first tam said downriver i havent heard from him in hours im afraid ah well lets heal and feed your men perhaps word of lord damodred will be forthcoming elayne touched gareth brynes cheek softly she closed his eyes one then the other before nodding to the soldiers who had found his body they carried bryne away legs dangling over the edge of his shield head hanging down on the other side he just went riding off screaming birgitte said right into the enemy lines there was no stopping him siuan is dead elayne said feeling an almost overpowering sense of loss siuan siuan had always been so strong with effort elayne stilled her emotions she had to keep her attention on the battle is there word from the command post the camp at dashar knob has been abandoned birgitte said i dont know where cauthon is the seanchan have forsaken us raise my banner high elayne said until we hear from mat im taking command of this battlefield bring forward my advisors birgitte moved to give the orders elaynes guardswomen watched shuffling nervously as the trollocs pushed against the andorans at the river theyd totally filled the corridor between heights and bogs and threatened to spill out on to shienaran soil part of egwenes army had hit the trollocs from the other side of the corridor which had taken some pressure off her own troops for a time but more trollocs had attacked from above and it looked as if egwenes men were getting the worst of it elayne had had solid lessons in battlefield tactics though little experience on the field and she could see how badly things were going yes she had received news that the trollocs position upriver had been destroyed by the arrival of lan and the borderlanders but that brought scant relief with the situation here at the ford the sun began to slip beneath the horizon the trollocs made no sign of pulling back and her soldiers reluctantly began to light bonfires and torches organizing her men into square formations made for better defense but it meant giving up any hope of pushing forward the aiel fought here as well as did the cairhienin but those pike squares were the core of their battle plan theyre slowly surrounding us she thought if the trollocs did so they could squeeze until the andorans popped light this is bad the sun made a sudden blazing fire behind the horizon clouds with night the trollocs gained another advantage the air had grown cold in the advent of darkness her early assumptions that this battle would last days now seemed silly the shadow pushed with all of its might humankind did not have days remaining but hours majesty captain guybon said riding up with her commanders their dented armor and bloodied tabards proved that nobody not even the senior officers could be spared from direct fighting advice elayne said looking at him theodohrcommander of the cavalryand birgitte who was captaingeneral retreat guybon asked do you really think we could disengage birgitte replied guybon hesitated then shook his head right then elayne said how do we win we hold said theodohr we hope the white tower can win their fight against the sharan channelers and come to our aid i dont like just sitting here birgitte said it a blazing beam of whitehot fire sliced through elaynes guards vaporizing dozens of them guybons horse vanished beneath him though he narrowly missed being hit himself elaynes horse reared swearing she wrestled her mount under control that had been balefire lews therin a powerenhanced voice rang over the field i hunt a woman you love come to me coward fight the earth exploded near elayne heaving her standardbearer into the air the flag bursting into flames this time elayne was thrown from horseback and she hit hard grunting my babes she groaned rolling over as hands grabbed her birgitte the woman hauled elayne into the saddle behind her helped by several guardswomen can you channel birgitte asked no never mind theyll be watching for that celebrain raise another banner ride downriver with a squadron of guards i will take the queen the other way the woman standing beside birgittes horse saluted it was a death sentence birgitte no elayne said demandred has decided youll draw out the dragon reborn for him birgitte said turning her horse im not about to let that happen hya she pushed her horse into a gallop as lightning struck elaynes guards blowing bodies into the air elayne ground her teeth her armies were in danger of being overwhelmed surroundedall while demandred laid down blast after blast of balefire lightning and weaves of earth that man was as dangerous as an army himself i cant leave elayne said from behind birgitte yes you can and you are she replied gruffly as their horse galloped on if mat has fallenlight send that isnt the casethen well need to set up a new command post theres a reason demandred struck at dashar knob and then directly at you hes trying to destroy our command structure your duty is to assume command from someplace safe and secret once were far enough away that demandreds scouts cant sense you channeling well make a gateway and you will be back in control right now though elayne you need to shut your mouth and let me protect you she was right burn her she was elayne hung on as birgitte galloped across the battlefield her horse churning clods of dirt behind them in a flight toward safety at least hes making it easy to find him galad thought as he rode watching the lines of fire streak from the enemy position toward elaynes army galads heels dug into the flanks of his stolen horse tearing across the heights toward its eastern edge over and over he saw gawyns dying body in his arms face me lews therin the thunder of demandreds shout shook the ground from up ahead he had taken galads brother now the monster hunted galads sister the right thing had always seemed clear to galad before but never had it felt as right as this those streaks of light were like indicators on a map arrows pointing his way the light itself guided him it had prepared him placed him here at this moment he ripped through the back lines of the sharan force to where demandred stood just above the riverbed looking down on elaynes troops arrows sank into the earth around him archers firing heedless of the risk of hitting their own men sword out galad pulled his leg from the stirrup preparing to leap free an arrow struck the horse galad threw himself from the animal he hit hard skidding to a stop and sliced the hand from a crossbowman nearby a growling male channeler came for him and the foxhead medallion grew cold against galads chest galad rammed his blade through the mans neck the man raved blood spurting from his neck with each beat of his heart he didnt seem surprised as he died just angry his howls drew more attention demandred galad yelled demandred you call for the dragon reborn you demand to fight him he is not here but his brother is will you stand against me dozens of crossbows were raised behind galad his horse collapsed expelling a bloody froth from its nostrils rand althor his brother the shock of gawyns death had numbed galad to this revelation he would have to deal with it eventually if he survived he still did not know if he would be proud or ashamed a figure in strange coinlink armor stepped through the sharan ranks here demandred was a proud man one needed see only his face to know that he looked like althor actually they had a similar sense about them demandred inspected galad who stood with bloody sword out the dying channeler scraped the ground with clawed fingers before him his brother demandred said son of tigraine galad said who became a maiden of the spear who gave birth to my brother on dragonmount the tomb of lews therin i had two brothers you killed the other on this battlefield you have an interesting artifact i see demandred said as the medallion grew cold again surely you dont think that is going to keep you from meeting the same fate as your pathetic brother the dead one i mean do we fight son of shadows or do we talk demandred unsheathed his sword herons on the blade and hilt may you give me a better match than your brother little man i grow displeased lews therin can hate me or rail against me but he should not ignore me galad stepped forward into the ring of crossbowmen and channelers if he won he would still die but light let him take one of the forsaken with him it would be a fitting end demandred came at him and the contest began her back pressed against a stalagmite seeing only by the light of callandor reflected against the walls of the cavern nynaeve worked to save alannas life there were those who in the white tower had mocked her reliance on ordinary healing techniques what could two hands and thread do that the one power could not if any of those women had been here instead of nynaeve the world would have ended the conditions were horrible little light no tools besides the implements she kept in her pouch still nynaeve sewed using the needle and thread she always carried she had mixed a draught of herbs for alanna and forced it through her lips it wouldnt do much but every little bit might help it would keep alannas strength up help her with the pain keep her heart from giving out as nynaeve worked the wound was messy but she had sewn messy wounds before though she trembled inside nynaeves hands were steady as she sewed up the wound and coaxed the woman back from the very precipice of death rand and moridin did not move but she felt something thrumming from them rand was fighting fighting a fight she could not see matrim cauthon you bloody fool youre still alive mat glanced over as davram bashere rode up beside him in the early evening darkness mat had moved with the deathwatch guard to the back of the andoran lines fighting at the river bashere was accompanied by his wife and a guard of saldaeans judging by the blood on her clothing she had seen her share of fighting yes im alive mat said im usually pretty good at staying alive ive only failed one time that i remember and it hardly counts what are you doing here arent you they dug into my bloody mind bashere said scowling that they did man deira and i talked it over im not going to lead but why should that stop me from killing a few trollocs mat nodded at tenobias fall this man had become king of saldaea but he had refused the crown so far the corruption in his mind had shaken him all he had said was that saldaea fights alongside malkier and told the troops to look toward lan the throne would be sorted out if they all survived the last battle what happened to you bashere asked i heard the command post fell mat nodded the seanchan have abandoned us blood and ashes bashere cried as if this werent bad enough bloody seanchan dogs the deathwatch guards who stood around mat made no response to that elaynes forces held along the riverbank just barelybut trollocs were slowly working around them upriver elaynes lines held only because of tenacity and careful training each huge square of men held pikes outward bristling like a hedgehog those formations could be separated if demandred drove wedges between them in the right way mat employed cavalry sweeps of his own including andoran cavalry and the bandtrying to keep the trollocs from penetrating the pike squares or surrounding elayne the rhythm of the battle pulsed beneath mats fingertips he felt what demandred was doing to anyone else the end of the battle probably seemed a simple matter now attack in force break the pike formations crack mats defenses it was so much more subtle lans borderlanders had finished crushing the trollocs upriver and needed orders good mat needed those men for the next step in his plan three of the enormous pike formations were flagging but if he could place a channeler or two in each center he could shore them up light shelter whoever had distracted demandred the forsakens attacks had destroyed entire pike formations demandred didnt need to kill each man individually he needed only to launch attacks of the one power to shatter the square that let the trollocs overwhelm them bashere mat said please tell me that someone has heard from your daughter nobody has deira said fm sorry bloody ashes mat thought poor perrin poor him how was he going to do this without the horn light he was not certain he could do it with the bloody horn go mat called as they rode ride to lan hes upriver tell him to engage those trollocs trying to move around the andorans right flank and tell him ill have other orders for him coming soon but i i dont care if youve bloody been touched by the shadow mat said every man has had the dark ones fingers on his heart and thats the bloody truth you can fight through it now ride to lan and tell him what needs to be done bashere stiffened at first thenstrangelyhe smiled a broad smile beneath drooping mustaches bloody saldaeans they liked being yelled at mats words seemed to give him heart and he galloped off wife at his side she threw mat a fond look which made him uncomfortable now he needed an army and a gateway he needed a bloody gateway fool he thought he had sent the damane away could he not have at least kept one though they did make his skin crawl as if it were covered in spiders mat halted pips the deathwatch guards stopping with him a few of them lit torches they had certainly gotten the drubbing they had wanted joining mat in fighting the sharans they seemed to itch for more though there mat thought heeling pips toward a force of troops south of elaynes pike formations the dragonsworn before the seanchan left dashar knob mat had sent this army to reinforce elaynes troops he still did not know what to make of them he had not been at the field when they had gathered but he had heard reports people from all ranks and stations all nationalities who had joined together to fight in the last battle heedless of loyalties or national borders rand broke all vows and all other bonds mat rode at a quick trotthe deathwatch guards jogging to keep uparound the back of the andoran lines light the lines were buckling this was bad well hed made his bet now he could only ride the bloody battle and hope it did not buck too much as he galloped for the dragonsworn he heard something incongruous singing mat pulled to a halt the ogier had been caught up fighting the trollocs and had pushed across the dry riverbed to help fight at elaynes left flank across from the bogs to keep trollocs from coming around that way they stood their ground here as immovable as oaks before a flood hacking with axes as they sang trollocs lay in piles around them loial mat yelled standing up in his stirrups loial one of the ogier stepped back from the fighting and turned mat was taken aback his usually calm friend had ears laid low teeth clenched in anger and a bloodsoaked axe in his fingers light but that expression sent terror through mats body he would rather stare down ten men who thought he had been cheating than fight a single angry ogier loial called something to the others and then rejoined them in the fighting they continued to lay into the trollocs nearby cutting them down trollocs and ogier were near the same size but the ogier somehow seemed to tower over the shadowspawn they did not fight like soldiers but like woodsmen felling trees chop one way then the next breaking trollocs but mat knew that ogier hated felling trees while they seemed to relish felling trollocs the ogier broke the trolloc fist theyd been fighting making them flee elaynes soldiers moved in and blocked off the rest of the trolloc army and the several hundred ogier pulled back to mat among them mat noticed were more than a few of the seanchan ogierthe gardeners he had not ordered that the two groups fought together but barely seemed to look at one another now every one of the ogier male and female had numerous cuts on their arms and legs they did not wear armor but many of the cuts seemed trivial as if their skin had the strength of bark loial walked up to mat and the deathwatch guards raising his axe to his shoulder loials trousers were dark up to the thighs as if he had been wading in wine mat loial said drawing a deep breath we have done as you asked fighting here no trolloc got by us you did well loial mat said thank you he waited for a reply something longwinded and eager no doubt loial stood breathing in and out with lungs that could hold enough air to fill a room no words the others with him though many were senior to loial offered no words either some lifted torches the glow of the sun had vanished beneath the horizon night was fully upon them quiet ogier now that was strange ogier at war though it was not something mat had ever seen he did not have any memory of it in the memories that were not his i need you mat said we have to turn this battle around or were finished come on the hornsounder commands loial bellowed up axes mat winced if he ever needed someone to yell a message from caemlyn to cairhien for him he knew who to ask only they would probably hear it all the way up in the blight too he heeled pips into motion the ogier falling in around him and the deathwatch guards the ogier had no trouble keeping up honored one karede said i and mine are ordered to to go die on the front lines im bloody working on that karede keep your sword out of your own gut for the moment kindly the mans expression darkened but he held his tongue she doesnt really want you dead you realize mat said he could not say more without revealing the plot to bring her back if my death serves the empress may she live forever then i give it willingly youre bloody insane karede mat said unfortunately so am i youre in good company you there who leads this force they had reached the back ranks where the reserves of the dragonsworn were located the wounded and those who were resting from their time at the front ranks my lord one of the scouts said that would be lady tinna go fetch her mat said those dice kept rattling in his head he also felt a pull from the north a tugging as if some threads around his chest were yanking on him not now rand he thought im bloody busy no colors formed only blackness dark as a myrddraals heart the tugging grew stronger mat dismissed the vision not now he had work to do here he had a plan light let it work tinna turned out to be a pretty girl younger than he had expected tall and strong of limb she wore her long brown hair in a tail though curls of it seemed to want to break out here and there she wore breeches and had seen some fighting judging by that sword on her hip and the dark trolloc blood on her sleeves she rode up to him looking him up and down with discerning eyes youve finally remembered us have you lord cauthon yes she definitely reminded him of nynaeve mat looked up at the heights the firefight between aes sedai and sharans up there had turned messy youd better win there egwene im counting on you your army mat said looking at tinna im told some aes sedai joined you some did she said cautiously youre one of them i am not not exactly not exactly what do you mean by that look woman i need a gateway if we dont have one this battle could be lost please tell me we have some channelers here who can send me where i need to go tinna drew her lips to a line im not trying to irritate you lord cauthon old habits make for strong ropes and i have learned not to speak of certain things i was turned out of the white tower myself for complicated reasons im sorry but i do not know the weave for traveling i do know for a fact that most who joined us are too weak for that weave it requires a great deal of the one power beyond the capacity of many who i can make one a woman in a red dress stood up from the lines of wounded where she had apparently been healing she was thin and bony and had a sour expression on her face but mat was so happy to see her he could have kissed her like kissing broken glass that would have been hed have done it anyway teslyn he cried what are you doing here fighting in the last battle i believe she said dusting off her hands arent we all but the dragonsworn mat asked i did not find the white tower to be a comfortable place once i returned she said it had changed i availed myself of the opportunity here as this need superseded any others now you wish a gateway how large large enough to move as many of these troops as we can the dragonsworn the ogier and this cavalry banner from the band of the red hand mat said ill need a circle tinna teslyn said no complaining that you cant channel i can sense it in you and all former allegiances and promises are broken for us here gather the other women where are we going cauthon mat grinned to the top of those heights the heights karede said but you abandoned those at the beginning of the battle you gave them up to the shadowspawn yes i did and now now he had a chance to finish this elaynes forces holding along the river egwene fighting in the west mat had to seize the northern part of the heights he knew that with the seanchan gone and most of his own troops occupied around the lower part of the heights demandred would send a strong force of sharans and trollocs across the top to the northeast to swing down across the riverbed and behind elaynes armies the armies of light would be surrounded and at demandreds mercy his only chance was to keep demandreds troops from coming off the heights despite their superior numbers light it was a long shot but sometimes you had to take the only shot you had youre spreading us dangerously thin karede said you risk everything by moving armies that are needed here up to the heights you did want to go to the front lines mat replied loial are you with us a strike at the enemys core mat loial asked hefting his axe it will not be the worst place ive found myself following one of you three i do hope rand is all right you do think so dont you if rand were dead mat said wed know it hell have to watch out for himself without matrim cauthon saving him this time teslyn lets have that gateway tinna organize your forces have them ready to charge through the opening we need to seize the northern slope of those heights fast and then hold it no matter what the shadow tosses at us egwene opened her eyes though she shouldnt have been in a room at all she lay in one and a fine one the cool air smelled of salt and she rested on a soft mattress im dreaming she thought or perhaps she had died would that explain the pain such terrible pain nothingness would be better far better than this agony gawyn was gone a piece of herself snipped away i forget how young she is whispers drifted into the room that voice was familiar silviana care for her i must return to the battle how docs it go egwene knew that voice too rosil of the yellow she had gone to mayene with the novices and accepted helping heal the battle it goes poorly silviana was not one to put honey on her words watch her rosil she is strong i do not doubt she will pull through this but there is always a worry ive helped women with lost warders before silviana rosil said i assure you im quite capable shell be useless for the next few days but then she will begin to mend silviana sniffed that boy i should have known he would ruin her the day i first saw how she looked at him i should have taken him by his ears hauled him to a distant farm and set him to work for the next decade you cannot so easily control a heart silviana warders are a weakness silviana said that is all they have ever been and all they ever will be that boy that fool boy that fool boy egwene said saved my life from seanchan assassins i would not be here to mourn if he had not done so i would suggest that you remember that silviana when you speak of the dead the others were silent egwene tried to overcome the pain of loss she was in mayene of course silviana would have taken her to the yellows i will remember it mother silviana said she actually managed to sound contrite rest well i will rest is for the dead silviana egwene said sitting up silviana and rosil stood in the doorway of the beautiful room which was draped with blue cloth below the ceiling of worked motherofpearl inlays both women folded their arms and gave her stern looks youve been through something extremely hurtful mother rosil said near the doorway leilwin stood guard the loss of a warder is enough to stop any woman there is no shame in letting yourself deal with the grief egwene alvere can grieve egwene said standing up egwene alvere lost a man she loved and she felt him die through a bond the amyrlin has sympathy for egwene alvere as she would have sympathy for any aes sedai dealing with such loss and then in the face of the last battle the amyrlin would expect that woman to pick herself up and return to the fight she walked across the room each step firmer she held out her hand to silviana nodding toward voras saangreal which she held i will be needing that silviana hesitated unless the two of you wish to discover just how capable i am at present egwene said softly i would not suggest disobedience silviana looked to rosil who sighed and nodded reluctantly silviana handed over the rod i do not condone this mother rosil said but if you are insistent i am then i will give you this suggestion emotion will threaten to crush you this is the danger in the face of a lost warder summoning saidar will be difficult if you do manage it aes sedai serenity will likely be impossible this can be dangerous very dangerous egwene opened herself to saidar as rosil had suggested it was difficult to embrace the source too many emotions vied for her attention overwhelming her driving away her calm she blushed as she failed a second time silviana opened her mouth undoubtedly to suggest that egwene sit back down at that moment egwene found saidar the bud in her mind flowering the one power rushing into her she gave silviana a defiant look then began weaving a gateway you didnt hear the rest of my advice mother rosil said you will not be able to banish the emotions troubling you not completely your only choice is a bad one to overwhelm those emotions of grief and pain with stronger emotions that should not be difficult at all egwene said she drew a deep breath pulling in more of the one power she allowed herself anger fury at the shadowspawn who threatened the world anger at them for taking gawyn from her i will need eyes to watch me egwene said defying silvianas previous words gawyn had not been a weakness to her i will need another warder but rosil began egwene stopped her with a look yes most women waited yes egwene alvere was pained from her loss and gawyn could never be replaced but she believed in warders the amyrlin seat needed someone to watch her back beyond that every person with a warder bond was a better fighter than those without to go without a warder was to deny the light another soldier there was a person here who had saved her life no a piece of her said her eyes falling on leilwin not a seanchan another piece of her the amyrlin laughed at that stop being such a child she would have a warder leilwin shipless egwene said loudly will you take this duty the woman knelt bowing her head i yes egwene formed the weave for the bond leilwin stood looking less fatigued taking a deep breath egwene opened a gateway to the other side of the chamber then used her immediate knowledge of this room to open another one to where her people fought explosions screams and the beating of weapons against shields poured through egwene strode back onto the killing fields bringing the fury of the amyrlin with her demandred was a blademaster galad had assumed this would be the case but he preferred to test his assumptions the two danced back and forth inside the ring of watching sharans galad wore lighter armor mail under his tabard and stepped more quickly the interwoven coins demandred wore were heavier than simple mail but good against a sword you are better than your brother was demandred said he died easily the man was trying to enrage galad he did not succeed cold careful galad moved in the courtier taps his fan demandred responded with something very similar to the falcon stoops slapping away galads attack demandred stepped back walking around the perimeter of the ring sword out to the side at the beginning he had spoken a great deal now he made only the occasional gibe they circled each other in the darkness lit by torches held in sharan hands one rotation two come now demandred said im waiting galad remained silent each moment he stalled was a moment demandred was not sending destruction upon elayne or her armies the forsaken seemed to realize it for he came in swiftly three strikes down side backhand galad met each one their arms a blur motion to the side it came from a rock that demandred had thrown at galad by channeling galad dodged it barely then raised his sword against the blows that came next furious strikes downward the boar rushes down the mountain crashing against galads blade he held against that but was not able to stop the following twist of the blade that cut his forearm demandred stepped back his sword dripping galads blood they circled around again watching one another galad felt warm blood inside his glove from where it had seeped down his arm a little blood loss could slow a man weaken him galad breathed in and out abandoning thought abandoning worry when demandred next struck galad anticipated it stepping aside and striking down with two hands biting deeply into the leather behind demandreds knee guard the sword glanced off the side of the armor but cut true otherwise as galad whipped back around demandred was limping the forsaken grimaced youve blooded me he said it has been a very long time since someone did that the ground began to heave and break beneath galad desperate he leaped forward getting close to demandredforcing him to stop channeling lest he topple himself the forsaken grunted swinging but galad was inside his enemys guard too close to do a full swing galad raised his sword and bashed it pommel firstat demandreds face demandred caught galads hand with his but galad grabbed demandred by the helmet holding tightly trying to force the helmet down over the forsakens eyes he grunted both men locked neither moving then with a sickening sound galad heard quite distinctly his muscle ripped in the arm where hed been cut his sword slipped from numb fingers his arm spasming and demandred threw him backward and struck with a flash of the blade galad fell to his knees his right armsevered at the elbow by demandreds sliceflopped to the ground in front of him demandred stepped back panting he had been worried good galad held to his bleeding stump then spat at demandreds feet demandred snorted then swung his blade once more all went black androl felt as if hed forgotten what it was like to breathe fresh air the land around him smoldered and quaked smoke churning in the wind bringing with it the stench of burning bodies he and the others had moved up across the top of the heights to the western side searching for taim much of the sharan army fought here contending with the white tower army groups of channelers drew fire from one side or the other so androl crossed the horrid landscape alone he stepped over broken patches of smoking earth crouching low trying to give off the air of a solitary wounded man trying to creep to safety he still wore nensens face but with his head down and his posture low that mattered very little he sensed a spike of alarm from pevara who moved alone nearby what is it he sent are you all right after a tense moment her thoughts came im fine a scare with some sharans i convinced them i was on their side before they attacked its a wonder anyone can tell friend from foe here androl sent back he hoped emarin and jonneth were safe the two had gone together but if they androl froze up ahead through the shifting smoke he saw a ring of trollocs protecting something they stood on an outcropping of rock that jutted out of the hillside like the seat of a chair androl crept forward hoping to steal a peek androl pevaras voice in his mind made him jump nearly out of his skin what you were alarmed at something she said i was reacting to you he took a few calming breaths ive found something just a moment he drew close enough indeed to sense channeling inside the ring he didnt know if the trollocs parted as someone inside barked a command mishraile peered out then scowled its only nensen androls heart thumped inside his chest a man wearing black turned from his contemplation of the battle taim in his hands he carried a thin disc of black and white he rubbed his thumb across it as he overlooked the battlefield sneering as if disdainful of the lesser channelers struggling all about him well he barked at androl turning and dropping the disc into a pouch at his waist i saw androl androl said thinking quickly light the others expected him to approach he did so walking past the trollocs putting himself right in the belly of the beast if he could draw close enough i followed him for a while nensen always spoke in a rough gravelly voice and androl did his best to imitate it pevara could have worked the voice into the weave but hadnt known it well enough i dont care about that one fool what is demandred doing he saw me androl said he didnt like me being over there he sent me back to you and said that if he saw any of us away from this position hed kill us androl pevara sent worried he couldnt spare the concentration to reply it took all he had to keep from shaking as he stepped up close to taim taim rubbed his forehead with two fingers closing his eyes and i thought you could do this simple thing taim created a complex weave of spirit and fire it struck like a viper at androl pain suddenly moved up androls body starting in his feet surging through his limbs he screamed collapsing to the ground do you like that taim asked i learned it from moridin i do think hes trying to turn me against demandred androl screamed in his own voice that horrified him but the others did not seem to notice when taim finally released the weave the pain faded androl found himself groveling on the dirty ground his limbs still spasming from the memory of the pain get up taim growled androl began to lurch to his feet im coming pevara sent stay back he replied light he felt powerless as he stood up he stumbled into taim his legs refusing to work as they should fool taim said shoving androl back mishraile caught him stand still taim began another weave androl tried to pay attention but he was too nervous to catch the details of the weave it hovered in front of him then wrapped around him what are you doing androl asked he didnt have to fake the tremor in his voice that pain you said you saw androl taim said im placing a mask of mirrors on you and inverting the weave making you look like him i want you to pretend to be the pageboy find logain then kill him use a knife or a weave i dont care which youre making me look like androl androl said androl is one of logains pets taim said he shouldnt suspect you this is an exceptionally easy thing im asking of you nensen do you think for once you could avoid making a complete mess of it yes mhael good because if you fail ill kill you the weave fell into place and vanished mishraile grunted releasing androl and stepping back i think androl is uglier than that mhael taim snorted then waved at androl its good enough get out of my sight return with logains head or do not return at all androl scrambled away breathing heavily feeling the others eyes on his back once a good distance away he ducked around some brush that was only mostly burned and nearly tripped over pevara emarin and jonneth hiding there androl emarin whispered your disguise what happened was that taim androl sat down in a heap trying to still his heart then he held up the pouch he had pulled off taims belt while stumbling to his feet it was him youre not going to believe this but arganda cupped the piece of paper sitting in mightys saddle and pulling his list of ciphers out of his pocket those trollocs kept launching arrows so far hed avoided being hit as had queen alliandre who still rode with him at least she was willing to stay back a little way with his reserves where she was more sheltered in addition to the legion of the dragon and the borderlanders his force along with the wolf guard and the whitecloaks had moved downriver following the battle at the ruins arganda had more foot soldiers than the others and had trailed behind them theyd found plenty of fighting here with the trollocs and sharans in the dry riverbed trying to surround the armies of andor arganda had been fighting here for a few hours now as the sun set bringing on the shadows hed pulled back once he got the message however bloody awful handwriting arganda grumbled flipping through the little list of ciphers and turning it toward a torch the orders were authentic either that or someone had broken the cipher well turne asked cauthons alive arganda said with a grunt where is he dont know arganda said folding the paper and tucking away the ciphers the messenger said cauthon opened a gateway in front of him threw the letter in his face and told him to find me arganda turned to the south peering through the darkness in preparation for night his men had brought oil through gateways and set piles of wood alight by the firelight he could see the two rivers men heading his way sure as the orders had said ho tam althor arganda said raising a hand he hadnt seen his commander since parting after the battle at the ruins hours ago now the two rivers men looked as worn down as arganda felt it had been a long long day and the fighting was by no means over i wish gallenne were here arganda thought inspecting trollocs at the river as althors men approached i could use someone to argue with just downriver shouts and clangs sounded from where the andorans pike formations held offbarelythe trolloc waves by now this battle was strung out along the mora almost up to dashar knob his men had helped keep the andorans from being flanked what news arganda tam asked as he came over cauthon lives arganda said and thats bloody amazing considering that someone blew up his command post set fire to his tent killed a bunch of his damane and chased off his wife cauthon crawled out of it somehow ha abell cauthon said thats my boy he told me you were coming arganda said he said youd have arrows do you tam nodded our last orders sent us through the gateway to mayene for healing and resupply i dont know how mat knew arrows would be coming but a shipment from the women in the two rivers came right as we were getting ready to return here we have longbows for you to use if you need them i will cauthon wants all of our troops to move back upriver to the ruins cut across the riverbed and march up the heights from the northeastern side not sure what thats about but i suppose he knows what hes doing tam said together their forces moved upriver in the night leaving behind the fighting andorans cairhienin and aiel creator shelter you friends arganda thought they crossed the dry riverbed and began moving up the northeastern slopes it was quiet on top at this end of the heights but the glow from lines of torches was evident thats going to be a tough nut to crack if those are sharans up there tam said softly looking up the darkened slope cauthons note said wed have help arganda replied what kind of help i dont know he didnt thunder rumbled nearby and arganda winced most of the channelers were supposed to be fighting on the other side of the heights but that didnt mean he wouldnt see any here he hated that feeling the sensation that a channeler might be watching him contemplating whether to kill him with fire lightning or earth channelers the world would be just plain better without them but that sound didnt turn out to be thunder a group of galloping riders bearing torches appeared from the night crossing the riverbed to join arganda and his men they flew the golden crane at the center of an array of borderlander banners well ill be a bloody trolloc arganda called you borderlanders decided to join us lan mandragoran saluted by torchlight silvery sword glistening he looked up the slope so were to fight here arganda nodded good lan said softly from horseback i just received reports about a large sharan army moving northeast across the top of the heights its clear to me they want to swing down around behind our people fighting the trollocs at the river then wed be surrounded and at their mercy looks like its our job to keep that from happening he turned toward tam are you ready to soften them up for us archer i think we can manage that tam replied lan nodded then raised his sword a malkieri man at his side raised the golden crane high and then they charged right up that slope coming toward them was a huge enemy army spread out in wide ranks across the landscape the sky lit up by the thousands of torches they carried tam althor shouted for his men to line up and fire loose tam yelled sending flights of arrows at the sharans then arrows began to be returned in their direction now that the distance between the two armies had narrowed arganda figured that the archers wouldnt be nearly as accurate in the darkness as they might have been by daybut that would be true for both sides the two rivers men released a wave of death arrows as fast as diving falcons hold tam yelled to his men they stopped firing just in time for lans cavalry to hit the softened sharan lines where did tam get his battle experience arganda thought thinking of the times hed seen tam fight arganda had known seasoned generals with far less sense of a battlefield than this sheepherder the borderlanders pulled back letting tam and his men loose more arrows tam signaled to arganda lets go arganda called to his foot soldiers all companies forward the onetwo attack of archers and heavy cavalry was powerful but it had limited advantage once the enemy set their defenses soon the sharans would get a solid shieldandspear wall up to deflect the horsemen or the archers would pick them off thats where the infantry came in arganda unhooked his macethose sharans wore chain mail and leatherand raised it high leading his men across the heights meeting the sharans halfway as theyd advanced to engage tams troops were whitecloaks ghealdanin perrins wolf guard and the mayener winged guard but they viewed themselves as one army not six months ago arganda would have sworn on his fathers grave that men such as these would never fight togetherlet alone come to one anothers aid as the wolf guard did when the whitecloak forces were being overrun some trollocs could be heard howling and began moving up alongside the sharans light trollocs too arganda swung his mace until his arm burned then switched hands and kept going breaking bones smashing hands and arms until mightys coat was flecked with blood flashes of light suddenly launched from the opposite end of the heights toward the andorans defending below arganda barely noted it consumed by the fighting as he was but something inside of him whimpered demandred must have resumed his attack i have defeated your brother lews therin the voice boomed across the battlefield loud as a crack of thunder he dies now bleeding away his mortality arganda danced mighty back turning as a hulking trolloc with an almosthuman face shoved away the wounded sharan beside it and bellowed blood streamed from a cut on its shoulder but it didnt seem to notice it twisted heaving a shortchained flail with a head like a log covered in spikes the flail crashed to the ground right beside mighty spooking the horse as arganda fought for control the immense trolloc stepped forward and punched with its offhand slamming a ham fist into the side of mightys head knocking the horse to the ground have you any care for the flesh of this birth demandred thundered in the distance share you any love for the one who named you brother this man in white mightys head had cracked like an egg the horses legs spasmed and jerked arganda hauled himself to his feet he didnt remember leaping free as the horse fell but his instincts had preserved him unfortunately his roll had taken him away from his guards who fought for their lives against a group of sharans his men were advancing and the sharans were getting slowly pushed back he didnt have time to look though that trolloc was on him arganda hefted his mace and looked up at the towering beast before him whipping its flail over its head as it stepped over the dying horse never had arganda felt so small coward demandred roared you name yourself savior of this land i claim that title face me do i need to kill this kin of yours to draw you out arganda took a deep breath then leaped forward he figured that was the last thing the trolloc would anticipate indeed the beasts swing went wide arganda scored a solid crack at its side his mace hitting the trollocs pelvis crushing bone then the thing backhanded him arganda saw white and the sounds of battle faded screaming pounding of feet yelling screams and yells yells and screams nothing sometime laterhe didnt know how longhe felt himself being lifted up the trolloc he blinked intent on at least spitting in the face of his killer only to find himself being hauled into the saddle behind allan mandragoran im alive arganda said a wave of pain across his left side informed him that yes indeed he was you felled a big one ghealdanin lan said spurring his horse to a gallop toward their rear lines the other borderlanders were riding with them arganda saw the trolloc hit you in its death throes i thought you were dead but i could not come for you until we had pushed them back we would have been hard pressed if that other army hadnt surprised the sharans other army said arganda rubbing his arm cauthon had an army lying in wait on the northern side of the heights by the looks of it dragonsworn and a banner of cavalry probably part of the band about the time you were tussling with that trolloc they fell on the sharans left flank breaking them all apart its going to take them a while to regroup light arganda said then groaned he could tell his left arm was broken well he lived good enough for now he looked toward the front lines where his soldiers still held their ranks queen alliandre rode in their midst back and forth through the ranks encouraging them light he wished shed been willing to serve at the hospital in mayene there was peace here at the momentthe sharans had been hit hard enough that they had pulled back leaving a section of ground open between the opposing armies they probably hadnt been expecting such a sudden and strong attack but wait shadows approached from argandas right oversized figures walking from the darkness more trollocs he set his jaw against the pain hed dropped his mace but he still had his boot knife hed not go down without without ogier he realized blinking those arent trollocs theyre ogier trollocs wouldnt carry torches as these beings did glory to the builders lan called up to them so you were part of the army cauthon sent to attack the sharans flank where is he i would have words with him one of the ogier let out a rumbling laugh you are not the only one dai shan cauthon moves about like a squirrel hunting nuts in the underbrush one moment here another moment gone i am to tell you that we must hold back this sharan advance at all cost more light flashed from the distant side of the heights the aes sedai and sharans fought there cauthon was trying to box the shadows forces in arganda shoved aside his pain trying to think what of demandred arganda could now see another swath of destruction launched from the forsaken it burned through defenders across the river the pike formations had begun to shatter each burst of light killing hundreds sharan channelers in the distance on one side arganda mumbled and one of the forsaken on the other light i didnt realize how many trollocs there were theyre endless he could see them now confronting elaynes troops blasts of the one power showed thousands of them in the distance below were finished arent we lans face reflected torchlight eyes like slate a face of granite he did not correct arganda what will we do arganda said to win light to win wed need to break these sharans rescue the pikementhey will soon be surrounded by the trollocsand each man of ours would need to kill at least five of those beasts thats not even counting demandred no reply from lan were doomed arganda said if so lan said we stand atop the high ground and we fight until we die ghealdanin you surrender when youre dead many a man has been given less the threads of possibility resisted rand as he wove them together into the world he imagined he did not know what that meant perhaps what he demanded was highly unlikely this thing he did using threads to show what could be was more than simple illusion it involved looking to worlds that had been before worlds that could be again mirrors of the reality he lived in he didnt create these worlds he merely manifested them he forced the threads to open the reality he demanded and finally they obeyed one last time the darkness became light and the nothing became something he stepped into a world that did not know the dark one he chose caemlyn as a point of entry perhaps because the dark one had used the place in his last creation and rand wanted to prove to himself that the terrible vision was not inevitable he needed to see the city again but untainted he walked on the road before the palace taking a deep breath the butterchain trees were in bloom the bright yellow blossoms spilling out of the gardens and hanging over the courtyard walls children played in them throwing the petals into the air not a cloud marred the brilliant sky rand looked up raising his arms and stepped out from beneath the blossoming branches into the deep warming sunlight no guards stood at the way into the palace only a kindly servant who answered questions for some visitors rand strode forward feet leaving tracks in golden petals as he approached the entrance a child came toward him and rand stopped smiling at her she stepped up reaching to touch the sword at rands waist the child seemed confused what is it she asked looking up with wide eyes a relic rand whispered laughter from the other children turned the girls head and she left him giggling as one of the children threw an armful of petals into the air rand walked on is this perfection for you the dark ones voice felt distant he could pierce this reality to speak to rand but he could not appear here as he had in the other visions this place was his antithesis for this was the world that would exist if rand killed him in the last battle come and see rand said to him smiling no reply if the dark one allowed himself to be drawn too fully into this reality he would cease to exist in this place he had died all things turned and came again that was the meaning of the wheel of time what was the point of winning a single battle against the dark one only to know that he would return rand could do more he could do this i would like to see the queen rand asked of the servant at the palace doors is she in you should find her in the gardens young man the guide said he looked at rands sword but out of curiosity not worry in this world men could not conceive that one would want to hurt another it didnt happen thank you rand said walking into the palace the hallways were familiar yet different caemlyn had nearly been razed during the last battle the palace burned the reconstruction resembled what had been there before but not completely rand strolled the hallways something worried him a discomfort from the back of his mind what was it do not be caught here he realized do not be complacent this world was not real not completely not yet could this have been a plan of the dark one to trick rand into creating paradise for himself only to enter it and be trapped while the last battle raged people were dying as they fought he had to remember that he could not let this fancy consume him that was difficult to remember as he entered the gallerya long hallway lined with what appeared to be windows only those windows did not look out at caemlyn these new glass portals allowed one to see other places like a gateway always in place rand passed one that looked out into a submerged bay colorful fish darting this way and that another gave a view of a peaceful meadow high in the mountains of mist red flowers pushed up through the green like specks of paint scattered on the floor following a painters daily work on the other wall the windows looked at the great cities of the world rand passed tear where the stone was now a museum to the days of the third age with the defenders as its curators none of this generation had ever carried a weapon and were baffled by the stories of their grandparents having fought another showed the seven towers of malkier built strong againbut as a monument not a fortification the blight had vanished upon the dark ones death and the shadowspawn had fallen dead immediately as if the dark one had been linked to them all like a fade leading a fist of trollocs doors did not bear locks coinage was a nearly forgotten eccentricity channelers helped create food for everyone rand passed a window to tar valon where the aes sedai healed any who came and created gateways to bring loved ones together all had everything they needed he hesitated beside the next window it looked out at rhuidean had this city ever been in a desert the waste bloomed from shara to cairhien and here through the window rand saw the chora fieldsa forest of them surrounding the fabled city though he could not hear their words he saw the aiel singing no more weapons no more spears to dance once again the aiel were a people of peace he continued on bandar eban ebou dar the seanchan lands shara each nation was represented though these days people didnt pay much heed to borders another relic who cared who lived in what nation and why would someone try to own land there was enough for all the blooming of the waste had opened up room for new cities new wonders many of the windows rand passed looked at places he did not know though he was pleased to see the two rivers looking so majestic almost like manetheren come again the last window gave him pause it looked upon a valley in what had once been the blasted lands a stone slab where a body had been burned long ago rested here alone overgrown with life vines grass flowers a furry spider the size of a childs hand scurried across the stones rands grave the place where his body had been burned following the last battle he lingered a long while at that window before finally forcing himself to move on leaving the gallery and making his way to the palace gardens servants were helpful whenever he spoke to them nobody questioned why he wanted to see the queen he assumed that when he found her she would be surrounded by people if anyone could see the queen wouldnt that demand all of her time yet when he approached her sitting in the palace gardens beneath the boughs of the palaces chora tree she was alone this was a world without problems a world where people worked out their own grievances easily a world of giving not dispute what would someone need of the queen elayne was as beautiful as shed been when theyd last parted she was no longer pregnant of course a hundred years had passed since the last battle she appeared to have not aged a day rand approached her glancing at the garden wall that he had once fallen over tumbling down to meet her for the first time these gardens were far different but that wall remained it had weathered the scouring of caemlyn and the coming of a new age elayne looked at him from her bench her eyes widened immediately and her hand went to her mouth rand he fixed his gaze on her hand resting on the pommel of lamans sword a formal posture why had he taken it elayne smiled is this a prank daughter where are you have you used the mask of mirrors to trick me again it is no trick elayne rand said sinking down onto one knee before her so that their heads were level he looked into her eyes something was wrong oh but how can it be she asked that wasnt elayne was it the tone seemed off the mannerisms wrong could she have changed so much it had been a hundred years elayne rand asked what has happened to you happened why nothing the day is grand wonderful beautiful and peaceful how i like to sit in my gardens and enjoy the sunlight rand frowned that simpering tone that vapid reaction elayne had never been like that we shall have to prepare a feast elayne exclaimed clapping her hands i will invite aviendha it is her week off from singing though she is probably doing nursery duty she usually volunteers there nursery duty in rhuidean elayne said everyone so likes to play with the children both here and there there is grand competition to care for the children but we understand the need to take turns aviendha tending children and singing to chora trees there was nothing wrong with that really why shouldnt she enjoy such activities but it was wrong too he thought aviendha would be a wonderful mother but to imagine her seeking to spend all day playing with other peoples children rand looked into elaynes eyes looked into them deeply a shadow lurked back there behind them oh it was an innocent shadow but a shadow nonetheless it was like like that like that shadow behind the eyes of someone who had been turned to the dark one rand jumped to his feet and stumbled backward what have you done here he shouted into the sky shaitan answer me elayne cocked her head she wasnt afraid fear did not exist in this place shaitan i swear i remember that name it has been so long i get forgetful sometimes shaitan rand bellowed i have done nothing adversary the voice was distant this is your creation nonsense rand said youve changed her youve changed them all did you think that removing me from their lives would leave them unaltered the words thundered through rand aghast he stepped away as elayne rose obviously concerned for him yes he saw it now the thing behind her eyes she was not herself because rand had taken from her the ability to be herself i turn men to me shaitan said it is true they cannot choose good once i have made them mine in that way how is this any different adversary if you do this we are one no rand screamed holding his head in his hand falling to his knees no the world would be perfect without you perfect unchanging ruined do this if you wish adversary in killing me i would win no matter what you do i will win rand screamed curling up as the dark ones next attack washed over him the nightmare rand had created exploded outward ribbons of light spraying away like streaks of smoke the darkness around him shook and trembled you cannot save them the patternglowing vibrantwrapped around rand again the real pattern the truth of what was happening in creating his vision of a world without the dark one he had created something horrible something awful something worse than would have been before the dark one attacked again mat pulled back from the fighting resting his ashandarei on his shoulder karede had demanded the chance to fightthe more hopeless the situation the better well the man should be bloody well pleased with this he should be dancing and laughing he had his wish light but he did mat sat down on a dead trolloc the only seat available and drank deeply from his waterskin he had the pulse of the battle its rhythm the beat it played was forlorn demandred was clever he had not gone for mats bait at the ford where he had positioned a smaller army demandred had sent trollocs there but held back his sharans had demandred abandoned the heights to attack elaynes army mat would have swept his own armies across the top of the heights from the west and the northeast to smash the shadow from behind now demandred was trying to get his troops behind elaynes forces and mat had stopped him for the time being but how long could he hold the aes sedai were not doing well the sharan channelers were winning that fight luck mat thought well need more than a little of you today dont abandon me now that would be a fitting end for matrim cauthon the pattern did like to laugh at him he suddenly saw its grand prank offering him luck when it meant nothing then seizing it all away when it really mattered blood and bloody ashes he thought putting away the empty waterskin seeing only by a torch that karede carried mat could not feel his luck at the moment that happened sometimes he did not know if it was with him or not well if they could not have a lucky matrim cauthon they would at least have a stubborn matrim cauthon he did not intend to die this day there was still dancing to be done there were still songs to be sung and women to be kissed one woman at least he stood and rejoined the deathwatch guards the ogier tams army the band the borderlanderseveryone he had put up here the battle had resumed and they fought hard even pushing the sharans back a couple of hundred paces but demandred had seen what he was doing and had started sending trollocs at the river up the slope to join the fray it was the steep onehardest to climbbut demandred would know he had to pressure mat those trollocs were a real danger there were enough of them at the river to potentially surround elayne and fight their way up to the heights if any one of mats armies broke he was done for well mat hd thrown his dice and sent out his orders there was nothing more to do dut fight bleed and hope a spray of light like liquid fire flared from the western side of the heights burning drops of molten stone fell through the dark air at first mat thought that demandred had decided to attack from that direction but the forsaken was still intent on destroying the andorans another flash of light that was where the aes sedai fought through the darkness and smoke mat was certain he saw sharans fleeing across the heights from west to east mat found himself smiling look he said slapping karede on the shoulder and drawing the mans attention what is it i dont know mat said but its setting sharans on fire so im mostly certain that i like it keep fighting he led karede and the others in another charge against sharan soldiers olver walked hunched under the bundle of arrows tied to his back they had to have real weight hed insisted what would happen if one of the shadows people inspected the goods and found that his pack had light cloth stuffed in the middle setalle and faile didnt need to keep looking at him as if hed break any moment the bundle wasnt that heavy of course that wouldnt stop him from squeezing some sympathy from setalle once they were back he needed to practice doing things like that or hed end up as hopeless as mat their line continued forward toward the supply dump here in the blasted lands and as it did he admitted to himself that he wouldnt have minded a pack that was a little lighter not because he was growing tired how was he going to fight if he needed to hed have to drop the pack quickly and this didnt seem the type of pack that let one do anything quickly gray dust coated his feet no shoes and his clothing now wouldnt make good rags earlier faile and the band had attacked one of the pitiful caravans trailing toward the shadows supply depot it hadnt been much of a fightonly three darkfriends and one oily merchant guarding a string of wornout halffed captives many of their supplies bore the mark of kandor a red horse in fact many of those captives had been kandori faile had offered them freedom sending them southward but only half had gone the rest had insisted on joining her and marching for the last battle though olver had seen beggars on the streets with more meat on them than those fellows still they helped failes line look authentic that was important olver glanced up as they approached the supply dump the path lined with torches in the cold night several of those redveiled aiel stood to the side watching the line pass olver looked down again lest they see his hatred hed known that aiel couldnt be trusted a couple of guardsnot aiel but more of those darkfriendscalled out for the line to stop aravine walked forward wearing the clothing of the merchant theyd killed faile was obviously saldaean and it had been decided that she might be too distinctive to play the part of the merchant darkfriend where are your guards the soldier asked this is lifas run isnt it what happened those fools aravine said then spat to the side olver hid a smile her entire countenance changed she knew how to play a part theyre dead where i left them i told them not to wander at night i dont know what took the three but we found them at the edge of camp bloated their skin black she looked sick i think something laid eggs in their hollowedout stomachs we didnt want to find what hatched the soldier grunted you are pansai aravine said lifas business partner since when has lifa had a business partner since i stabbed her and took over her run what information they had on lifa had come from the rescued captives it was thin olver felt himself sweating the guard gave aravine a long look then began walking down the line of people failes soldiers were mixed among the kandori captives they tried their best to hold the right posture you woman the guard said pointing at faile a saldaean eh he laughed i thought a saldaean woman would kill a man before letting him take her captive he shoved faile on the shoulder olver held his breath oh blood and bloody ashes lady faile wasnt going to be able to take that the guard was looking to see if the captives were really beaten down or not failes posture her manner would give her away she was noble and faile slumped down becoming small and whimpered a reply that olver could not hear olver found himself gaping then forced his mouth shut and looked down at the ground how how had a lady like faile learned to act like a servant the guard grunted go on he said waving to aravine wait there until we send for you the group shuffled to a patch of ground nearby where aravine ordered everyone to sit down she stood to the side arms folded tapping one toe as she waited thunder rumbled and olver felt an odd chill he looked up and into the eyeless face of a myrddraal a shock ran through olver like hed been dropped into an icy lake he couldnt breathe the myrddraal seemed to glide as it moved its cloak motionless and dead as it rounded the group after a horrible moment it moved on back toward the supply camp searching for channelers faile whispered to mandevwin light help us the man whispered back the wait was nearly insufferable eventually a plump woman in white clothing strode up and wove a gateway aravine barked for them all to climb to their feet then waved them through olver joined the line walking near faile and they passed from the land of red soil and cold air to a place that smelled like it was on fire they entered a ramshackle camp filled with trollocs several large cookpots boiled nearby just behind the camp a slope led up sharply to some kind of large plateau streams of smoke rose from the top of it and from there and somewhere to olvers left could be heard the sounds of combat turning away from the slope the boy saw the darkened outline of a tall narrow mountain far in the distance rising from the flat plain like a candle in the middle of a table he looked back up the slope behind the camp and his heart leaped a body was plummeting down from the top of the slope still clutching in its hand a bannera banner that bore a large red hand the band of the red hand the man and banner fell among a group of trollocs eating sizzling pieces of meat around a fire sparks flew in all directions and the enraged beasts yanked the intruder out of the flames but he was long past caring what they did to him faile he whispered i see it her bundle concealed the sack with the horn in it she added more to herself light how are we going to reach mat they moved off to the side as the rest of her group came through the gateway they had swords but carried them bundled up like arrows in packs atop the backs of a few of the men as if they were tiedup supplies for the battlefield blood and ashes mandevwin whispered joining the two of them captives whimpered from a pen nearby maybe theyll put us in there we could sneak out in the night faile shook her head theyll take our bundles leave us unarmed then what do we do mandevwin asked glancing to the side as a group of trollocs passed dragging corpses harvested from the front lines start fighting hope lord mat sees us and sends help olver didnt think much of that plan he wanted to fight but those trollocs were big one passed nearby and its wolffeatured head swung his way eyes that could have belonged to a man looked him up and down as if hungry olver stepped back then reached toward his bundle where hed hidden his knife well run faile whispered once the trolloc passed scatter in a dozen different directions and in doing so try to disorient them maybe a few of us will escape she frowned what is delaying aravine almost as she said it aravine strode through the gateway the woman in white who had channeled followed her out and then aravine pointed at faile faile jerked into the air olver gasped and mandevwin cursed throwing down his bundle and digging for his sword while arrela and selande shouted all three were hauled into the air by weaves moment later and aiel in red veils ran through the gateway weapons out pandemonium followed a few of failes soldiers fell as they tried to fight back with their fists olver dove for the ground hunting for his knife but by the time he had his hand on its hilt the skirmish was over the others were all subdued or tied in air so fast olver thought with despair why hadnt anyone warned him that fighting happened so quickly they seemed to have forgotten him but he didnt know what to do aravine walked up to faile still hanging in the air what was happening aravine she had betrayed them i am sorry my lady aravine said to faile olver could barely hear nobody paid any attention to him the aiel kept watch on the soldiers shoving them into a group to be guarded more than a few of their number lay bleeding on the ground faile struggled in the air her face growing red as she strained her mouth was obviously gagged faile would never remain quiet at a time like this aravine untied the horns bag from failes back then checked inside it her eyes widened she pulled the sack tight at the top and held it close i had hoped she whispered to faile to leave my old life behind to start fresh and new i thought i could hide or that i would be forgotten that i could come back to the light but the great lord does not forget and one cannot hide from him they found me the very night we reached andor this is not what i intended but it is what i must do aravine turned away a horse she called i will deliver this package to lord demandred myself as i have been commanded the woman in white walked up beside her and the two started arguing in hushed tones olver glanced about nobody was looking at him his fingers started trembling hed known that trollocs were big and that they were ugly but these things were nightmares nightmares all around oh light what would mat do dovieandi se tovya sagain olver whispered unsheathing his knife with a cry he threw himself at the woman in white and rammed his knife into her lower back she screamed faile dropped free of her bonds of air and then suddenly the captive pens burst open and a group of yelling men scrambled to freedom raise it higher doesine cried flaming quickly leane obeyed weaving earth with the other sisters the ground trembled in front of them buckling and slumping like a bunchedup rug they finished then used the mound for cover as fire dropped from upslope doesine led the motley bunch a dozen or so aes sedai a smattering of warders and soldiers the men clutched their weapons but lately those had proven about as effective as loaves of bread the power crackled and sizzled in the air the improvised bulwark thumped as sharans pounded it with fire leane peeked above the defences clutching the one power she had recovered from her encounter with the forsaken demandred it had been an unsettling experienceshe had been totally in his power and her life could have been snuffed out in an instant she had also been unnerved by the intensity of his ravings his hatred of the dragon reborn was unlike anything she had ever seen a group of sharans moved down the slope and together they sent weaves at the makeshift fortification leane sliced one weave from the air working like a surgeon cutting away withered flesh leane was much weaker in the one power now than she had once been she had to be more efficient with her channeling it was remarkable what a woman could achieve with less the bulwark exploded leane threw herself aside as clods of soil rained down she rolled through curling smoke coughing and clinging to saidar it was those sharan men she couldnt see their weaves she picked herself up her dress tattered from the explosion her arms scored by scratches she caught a hint of blue peeking from a furrow nearby doesine she scrambled over she found the womans body there not her head though leane felt an immediate almost overpowering sense of loss and grief doesine and she had not been close but they had been fighting together here it was wearing on leanethe loss the destruction how much could they take how many more would she have to watch die she steeled herself with difficulty light this was a disaster they had anticipated enemy dreadlords but there were hundreds upon hundreds of those sharans an entire nations worth of channelers all trained in war the battlefield was strewn with bright bits of color fallen aes sedai their warders charged up the hillside screaming in rage at the loss of their aes sedai as they were cut down by blasts of the power leane stumbled toward where a group of reds and greens fought from a hollowed out piece of ground on the western slope the terrain protected them for now but how long could the women hold out still she felt proud outnumbered and overwhelmed the aes sedai kept fighting this was nothing like the night the seanchan attacked when a fractured tower had broken from the inside out these women held firm each time a pocket of them was scattered they grouped back together and continued fighting fire fell from above but nearly as much flew back and lightning struck on either side leane carefully made her way over to the group joining raechin connoral who crouched next to a boulder while launching weaves of fire at the advancing sharans leane watched for return weaves then deflected one with a quick weave of water making the ball of fire burn away in tiny sparks raechin nodded to her and here i thought youd stopped being useful for anything other than batting your eyes at men the domani art is about achieving what you want raechin leane said coolly with as little effort as possible raechin snorted and launched a few fireballs toward the sharans i should ask advice from you on that sometime she said if there really is a way to make men do as you like i should like very much to know it that idea was so absurd as to nearly make leane laugh despite the terrible circumstances a red putting on paints and powders and learning the domani arts of manipulation well why not leane thought striking down another fireball the world was changing and the ajahsever so subtlychanging with it the sisters resistance was attracting the attention of more sharan channelers well have to abandon this position soon raechin said leane only nodded those sharans the red growled look at that leane gasped many of the sharan troops in this quarter had withdrawn earlier in the fightsomething seemed to have drawn them away but the channelers had replaced them with a large group of frightenedlooking people and were herding them at the front of their line to absorb attacks many carried sticks or tools of some sort for fighting but they bunched together holding the weapons timidly blood and bloody ashes raechin said causing leane to raise an eyebrow at her she continued weaving trying to send lightning down behind the lines of the frightened people it still hit many of them leane felt sick but joined in the attacks as they worked manda wan crawled up to them sootstained and blackened the green looked horrible probably much as i do leane thought glancing down at her own scratched and sooty arms were pulling back manda said maybe well have to use gateways and go where leane said abandon the battle the three grew silent no there was no retreat from this fight it was win here or nothing we are too fragmented manda said we must at least fall back to regroup we need to bring the women together and this is the only thing i can think of unless you have a better idea manda looked to raechin leane was too weak in the power now for her opinion to hold much weight she started cutting down weaves as the two continued to speak in hushed tones the aes sedai nearby began pulling back out of the hollow and moving back down the slope theyd regroup make a gateway toward dashar knob and decide what to do next wait what was that leane sensed powerful channeling nearby had the sharans created a circle she squinted they were well into night now but enough of the landscape burned to give firelight it also raised a lot of smoke leane wove air to blow the smoke out of the way but it lifted on its own split as if by a powerful wind egwene alvere strode past them up the slope glowing with the power of a hundred bonfires that was more than leane had ever seen a woman hold the amyrlin walked forward with her hand thrust out holding a white rod egwenes eyes seemed to shine with a burst of light and force egwene released a dozen separate flows of fire a dozen they battered the hillside above throwing the bodies of sharan channelers into the air manda leane said i think we have found you a better rallying point talmanes lit a twig off the lantern then used it to light his pipe he took one puff before hacking and emptying the pipes bowl on the rock floor the tabac had gone bad somehow horribly bad he coughed and ground the offending tabac into the floor with his heel you all right my lord melten asked walking past idly juggling a pair of hammers with his right hand as he walked im still bloody alive talmanes said which is far more than i likely have a right to expect melten nodded without expression and continued on joining one of the teams working on the dragons the deep cavern around them echoed with the sounds of hammers on wood as the band did its best to reconstruct the weapons talmanes tapped the lantern judging the oil it smelled awful when it burned though he was growing used to that they had enough for a few more hours yet that was good sinceso far as he knewthis cavern had no exits to the battleground above it was accessible only by gateway some ashaman had known of it strange fellow what kind of man knew of caverns that could not be reached except through the one power anyway the band was trapped down here in a place of safety but isolation only rare bits of information came in mats messages talmanes strained thinking he could hear the distant sounds of channelers fighting above but it was mere fancy the land was silent and these ancient stones had not seen the light since the breaking if then talmanes shook his head walking to one of the working teams how goes it dennel gestured toward a few sheets of paper aludra had given him instructions on how to repair this particular dragon the woman herself gave precise directions to another of the work teams her lightly accented voice echoing in the chamber most of the tubes are solid dennel said if you think about it they were built to withstand a little fire and an explosion now and then he chuckled then fell silent looking at talmanes do not let my expression dampen your good humor talmanes said tucking his pipe away nor let it bother you that we are fighting at the end of the world that our armies are grossly outnumbered and that if we lose our very souls will be destroyed by the dark lord of all evil sorry my lord that was a joke dennel blinked that yes that was a joke yes you have an interesting sense of humor my lord dennel said so i have been told talmanes stooped down and inspected the dragon cart the scorched wood was held together with screws and extra boards this does not seem very functional it will work my lord we wont be able to move it fast though i was saying the tubes themselves fared well but the carts well weve done what we can with salvage and the supplies out of baerlon but we can only do so much with the time we have which is none talmanes said lord mat could call upon us at any moment if theyre still alive up there dennel said looking upward a discomforting thought the band could end its days trapped down here at least there wouldnt be many of those days either the world would end or the band would run out of food they wouldnt last a week buried here in darkness bloody ashes mat youd better not lose up there youd better not the band still had fight in them they were not going to end this one starving underground talmanes held up his lantern turning to go but noticed something the soldiers working on the dragons cast a twisted shadow on the wall like a man with a wide cloak and hat that obscured his face dennel followed the glance light it looks like were being watched over by old jak himself doesnt it that it does talmanes said then in a louder voice he shouted its too quiet in here by far lets have some singing men some of the men paused aludra stood up placing hands on her hips and gave him a displeased glance so talmanes started it himself well drink the wine till the cup is dry and kiss the girls so theyll not cry and toss the dice until we fly to dance with jak o the shadows silence then they started it up well give a yell with a bloody curse and hug the maids it could be worse as we ride away with the dark ones purse to dance with jak o the shadows their loud voices beat against the stones as they worked furiously preparing for the part they would play and they would play it talmanes would make certain they did even if they had to blast their way out of this tomb in a storm of dragonfire as olver stabbed the woman in white failes bonds vanished she dropped to the ground stumbling but remaining upright mandevwin dropped beside her with a curse aravine light aravine docile careful and capable aravine was a darkfriend she had the horn aravine glanced at the fallen aes sedai that olver had attacked then panicked grabbing the horse a servant had brought and jumping into the saddle faile dashed for her as captives roared out of the nearby pens throwing themselves at trollocs and trying to wrestle weapons free she had almost reached aravine before the woman galloped away carrying the horn with her she headed toward the gentler slopes that would allow her to ride to the top of the heights no faile screamed aravine dont do this faile started to run after her but saw that that was no use a horse she needed a horse faile looked around frantic and found the few pack animals they had brought through the gateway faile scrambled to belas side cutting free the saddleand all of its burdenswith a few swipes of the knife she leaped up onto the mare bareback and took the reins then kicked her into motion the shaggy mare galloped after aravine and faile leaned low on her back run bela faile said if youve kept any strength back now is the time to use it please run girl run bela charged across the trampled ground hoofbeats accompanying thunder from above the trolloc camp was a place of darkness lit by cook fires and the occasional torch faile felt as if she were riding through a nightmare ahead a few trollocs burst onto the path to head her off faile leaned lower praying to the light that theyd miss when they attacked bela slowed and then two horsemen charged up alongside faile bearing lances one pierced a trollocs neck and though the other rider missed his mark his horse shouldered another trolloc aside making way bela galloped between the disoriented trollocs catching up to two men riding ahead one large of girth the other lean harnan and vanin you two faile yelled ho my lady harnan said laughing how she yelled at them over the sound of the hooves we let a caravan find us harnan yelled back and let them take us captive they brought us through the gateway a few hours back and weve been preparing the captives to break free your arrival gave us the opportunity we needed the horn you tried to steal the horn no harnan yelled back we tried to steal some of mats tabac i thought you had buried it to leave it behind vanin yelled from the other side i figured mat wouldnt care he owes me a few marks anyway when i opened that sack and found the bloody horn of valere bloody ashes ill bet they heard my yell all the way in tar valon faile groaned imagining the scene the yell that faile had heard was a yell of surprise and it was what had drawn the bearthing to attack well there was no going back to that moment she clung to bela with her knees urging the horse forward ahead aravine galloped between trollocs heading toward where the steep slopes tapered off aravine yelled frantically for trollocs to help her the racing horses traveled faster than any trollocs could however demandred aravine had said she would take the horn to one of the forsaken faile growled softly leaning down further and amazingly bela pulled ahead of vanin and harnan she didnt ask where theyd found the horses she directed her entire attention toward aravine a cry went up through camp and vanin and harnan split off intercepting riders who came for faile she cut to the side urging bela to leap a pile of supplies and charging through the center of a group of people in strange clothing eating beside a small fire they yelled after her with thick accents inch by inch she gained on aravine bela snorted and puffed sweat darkening her coat the saldaean cavalry was among the best in the land and faile knew horses shed ridden all breeds in those minutes on the battlefield she would have put bela up against the tairen best the shaggy mare of no particular breed of note moved like a champion runner feeling the rhythm of the hoofbeats beneath her faile slipped a knife from her sleeve she urged bela to jump over a small dip in the land and they hung in the air for a moment faile judging the wind the fall the moment she reached her arm back and flipped the knife through the air right before belas hooves touched the ground the knife flew true burying itself in aravines back the woman slipped from the saddle crumpling to the ground sack sliding from her grip faile leaped off bela landing while still in motion and sliding to a stop beside the sack she untied the strings that secured its opening and saw the glittering horn inside im sorry aravine whispered rolling over her legs did not move dont tell aldin what i did he has such terrible taste in women faile stood up then looked down with pity pray that the creator shelters your soul aravine faile said and climbed back onto belas back for if not the dark one will have you as his i leave you to him she nudged bela back into motion there were more trollocs ahead and they fixed their attention on faile they shouted and several myrddraal slid forward pointing toward faile they began to shift around her blocking her path she set her jaw grim and heeled bela back in the direction she had come hoping to meet up with harnan vanin or anyone else who would help the camp was abuzz with activity and faile picked up riders chasing after her yelling she has the horn of valere somewhere high atop the hill mat cauthons forces fought the shadow so close an arrow hit the ground beside her followed by others faile reached the captive pens the broken fence lying in pieces and bodies littered about bela was huffing perhaps at the end of her strength faile caught sight of another horse nearby a roan gelding that was saddled nudging at a fallen soldier at his feet faile slowed what to do switch horses but then what she glanced over her shoulder and then ducked down as another arrow passed overhead shed picked up some dozen sharan soldiers on horseback all chasing her wearing cloth armor sewn with small rings they were followed by hundreds of trollocs even with afresh horse she thought i cant outrun them she led bela behind some supply wagons for cover and leaped off intending to dash for the fresh mount lady faile a small voice asked faile glanced down olver huddled beneath the wagon holding his knife the riders were almost upon her faile didnt have time to think she whipped the horn from its sack and pushed it into olvers arms keep this she said hide take it to mat cauthon later in the night youre leaving me olver asked alone i must she said stuffing some bundles of arrows into her sack her heart thundering in her chest once those riders pass find another place to hide they will come back to search where ive been after after they catch me she would have to take her knife to herself lest they torture out of her what shed done with the horn she gripped olver by the arm im sorry to place this upon you little one there is no one else you did well earlier you can do this take the horn to mat or all is lost she ran into the open making the sack she carried obvious some of those strangely dressed foreigners saw her pointing she lifted the sack high and climbed into the saddle of the roan then kicked it into a gallop the trollocs and darkfriends followed leaving the young boy and his heavy burden to huddle beneath a wagon in the middle of the trolloc camp logain turned the thin disc over in his fingers black and white split by a sinuous line cuendillar supposedly the flakes that rubbed off beneath his fingers seemed to make mockery of its eternal nature why didnt taim break them logain asked he could have these are as brittle as old leather i dont know androl said glancing at the others of his team maybe the time wasnt right yet break them at the right time and it will help the dragon said the man who called himself emarin he sounded worried break them at the wrong time and what nothing good i suspect pevara said a red would he ever have his vengeance against those who had gentled him once that hatredand it alonehad driven him to survive he now found a new hunger inside of him he had defeated aes sedai he had beaten them down and claimed them as his own vengeance seemed empty his longbuilding thirst to kill mhael filled a little of that emptiness but not enough what more once he had named himself the dragon reborn once he had prepared himself to dominate the world to make it heel he fingered the seal to the dark ones prison while standing at the periphery of the battle he was far to the southwest below the bogs where his ashaman held a small base camp distant rumbles sounded from the heightsexplosions of weaves firing back and forth between aes sedai and sharans a large number of his ashaman had fought there but the sharan channelers outnumbered the aes sedai and ashaman combined others prowled the battlefields hunting down dreadlords killing them he had been losing men faster than the shadow there were too many enemies he held up the seal there was a power to it power to protect the black tower somehow if they do not fear us fear me what will happen to us once the dragon is dead dissatisfaction radiated through the bond he met gabrelles eyes she had been inspecting the battle but now her eyes were upon him questioning threatening earlier had he really been thinking that hed tamed aes sedai the idea should have made him laugh no aes sedai could be tamed not ever logain pointedly placed the seal and its fellows in the pouch at his belt he drew its strings closed meeting gabrelles eyes her concern spiked for a moment hed felt that concern of hers to be for him not because of him perhaps she was learning how to manipulate the bond to send him feelings she thought would lull him no aes sedai could not be tamed bonding them hadnt contained them it had made more complications he reached to his high collar undoing the dragon pin he wore there and offered it to androl androl genhald you have walked into the pit of death itself and returned twice now i am in your debt i name you full ashaman wear the pin with pride he had already given the man back his sword pin restoring him to dedicated androl hesitated then reached out and took the pin in reverent hands and the seals pevara asked arms folded they belong to the white tower the amyrlin is their watcher the amyrlin logain said is as good as dead from what i have heard in her absence i am a fitting steward logain seized the source subjecting it dominating it he opened a gateway back to the top of the heights the war returned to him in full force the confusion the smoke and screams he stepped through the others following the powerful channeling from demandred shone like a beacon the mans booming voice continuing to taunt the dragon reborn rand althor was not here well the closest thing to him was logain himself another substitute im going to fight him he told the others gabrelle you will remain behind and wait for my return as i may need healing the rest of you deal with taims men and those sharan channelers let no man live who has gone to the shadow whether by choice or force bring justice to the one and mercy to the other they nodded gabrelle seemed impressed with him perhaps for his decision to strike at the enemys heart she did not realize not even one of the forsaken could be as powerful as demandred seemed to be demandred had a saangreal and a powerful one similar in power to callandor maybe stronger with that in logains hands many things in this world would change the world would know of him and the black tower and they would tremble before him as they never had for the amyrlin seat egwene led an assault the likes of which had not been seen in millennia the aes sedai pulled themselves out of their defensive fortifications and joined with her pushing up the western slope in a steady stride weaves flew in the air like an explosion of ribbons caught in the wind the sky broke with the light of a thousand bolts the ground groaning and trembling with the hits demandred continued to fire upon the andorans from the other side of the plateau and each shot of balefire sent ripples through the air the ground cracked with spiderwebs of black but now tendrils of something sickly began to sprout from those cracks it spread like a disease across the broken stones of the hillside the air felt alive with the power the energy so thick that egwene almost thought the one power had become visible to all through this she drew as much strength as she could hold through voras saangreal she felt as she had when fighting the seanchan only somehow more in control then her rage had been fringed by desperation and terror this time it was a whitehot thing like a metal heated beyond the point of being worked by a smith she egwene alvere had been given stewardship of this land she the amyrlin seat would not be bullied by the shadow any longer she would not retreat she would not bow as her resources failed she would fight she channeled air building a swirling storm of dust smoke and dead plants she held it before herself obscuring the view of those above as they tried to pinpoint her lightning crashed down around her but she wove earth digging deeply in the rock and bringing up a spurt of iron that cooled in a spire next to her the lightning struck at the spire sparing her as she sent the windstorm howling up the incline a movement at her side egwene felt leilwin nearing that one that one had proven faithful such a surprise having a new warder did not take the edge off her despair at gawyns death but it did help in other ways that knot in the back of egwenes mind had replaced itself with a new one very different yet shockingly loyal egwene raised voras saangreal and continued her attacks moving up the hillside leilwin at her side ahead sharans huddled down weathering the winds egwene struck them with ribbons of fire channelers tried to attack her through the windstorm but their weaves went astray their eyes clogged with dust three regular soldiers attacked from the side but leilwin dispatched them efficiently egwene brought the wind around and used it like hands scooping the channelers up and flinging them into the air the lightning bolts from above took the men in a fiery embrace and smoking corpses plummeted to the hillside egwene pressed forward her army of aes sedai advancing flinging weaves like arrows of light ashaman joined them those had fought alongside the white tower on and off but now they seemed committed in force dozens of men gathered as she led the way the air became thick with the one power the winds stopped the dust storm suddenly fell smothered like a candle beneath a blanket no natural force had done that egwene mounted a rocky outcrop looking up toward a man in black and red standing at the top his hand out she had finally drawn out the one who led this force his dreadlords fought alongside the sharans but she sought their leader taim mhael hes weaving lightning a man yelled behind her egwene immediately brought up a spire of molten iron and cooled it to draw the lightning that fell a moment later she glanced to the side the one who had spoken was jahar narishma merises ashaman warder egwene smiled looking toward taim keep the others off me she commanded loudly all but you narishma and merise narishmas warnings will prove useful she gathered her strength and began to release a storm at the traitor mhael ila picked through the dead on the battlefield near the ruins though the fighting had moved downriver she could hear distant shouts and explosions in the night she hunted for the wounded among the fallen and ignored arrows and swords when she found them others would gather those though she wished they would not swords and arrows had caused much of this death raen her husband worked nearby prodding at each body then listening for a heartbeat his gloves were stained red and blood smeared his colorful clothing because he had been pressing his ear against the chests of corpses once they confirmed someone was dead they left an x drawn on a cheek often in the persons own blood that would keep others from repeating the work raen seemed to have aged a decade in the last year and ila felt as if she had too the way of the leaf was an easy master at times providing a life of joy and peace but a leaf fell in calm winds and in the tempest dedication demanded that one accept the latter as well as the former being driven from country after country suffering starvation as the land died then finally coming to rest in the lands of the seanchan such had been their life none of it matched losing aram that had hurt far more deeply than had losing his mother to the trollocs they passed morgase the former queen who organized these workers and gave them orders ila kept moving she cared little for queens they had done nothing for her or hers nearby raen stopped raising his lantern to examine a full quiver of arrows that a soldier had been carrying as he died ila hissed lifting her skirts up to step around corpses and reach her husband raen peace ila he said im not going to pick it up yet i wonder he looked up toward the distant flashes of light downriver and atop the heights where the armies continued their terrible acts of murder so many flashes in the night like hundreds of lightning bolts it was well past midnight now theyd been on this field looking for the living for hours you wonder ila asked raen what would we have them do ila trollocs will not follow the way of the leaf there is plenty of room to run ila said look at them they came to meet the trollocs when the shadowspawn were barely out of the blight if that energy had been spent gathering the people and leading them away to the south the trollocs would have followed raen said what then ila we have accepted many masters ila said the shadow might treat us poorly but would it really be worse than we have been treated at the hands of others yes raen said softly yes ila it would be worse farfar worse ila looked at him he shook his head sighing i am not going to abandon the way ila it is my path and it is right for me perhaps perhaps i will not think quite so poorly of those who follow another path if we live through these times we will do so at the bequest of those who died on this battlefield whether we wish to accept their sacrifice or not he trailed away its just the darkness of the night she thought he will overcome it once the sun shines again thats the right of it isnt it she looked up at the night sky that sun would they be able to tell when it rose the clouds lit from the fires below seemed to be growing thicker and thicker she pulled her bright yellow shawl closer feeling suddenly cold perhaps i will not think quite so poorly of those who follow another path she blinked a few tears from her eyes light she whispered something twisting inside i shouldnt have turned my back on him i should have tried to help him return to us not cast him out light oh light shelter him nearby a group of mercenaries found the arrows and picked them up hey hanlon one called look at this when the brutish men had originally started helping with the tuathaan work she had been proud of them avoiding battle to help care for the wounded the men had seen beyond their violent past now she blinked and saw something else about them cowards who would rather pick through corpses and fish in their pockets than fight which was worse the men whomisguided though they werestood up to the trollocs and tried to turn them back or these mercenaries who refused to fight because they found this path easier ila shook her head she had always felt as if she knew the answers in life today most of those had slipped from her saving a persons life though that she could cling to she headed back among the bodies searching for the living among the dead olver scuttled back under the wagon clutching the horn as lady faile rode off dozens of riders followed her and hundreds of trollocs it had grown so dark alone hed been left alone again he squeezed his eyes shut but that didnt do much he could still hear men screaming and shouting in the distance he could still smell blood the captives who had been killed by the trollocs as they tried to escape beyond the blood he smelled smoke thick and itchy it seemed that the whole world was burning the ground trembled as if something very heavy had hit it somewhere close by thunder rumbled in the sky accompanied by sharp cracks as lightning struck time and time again at the heights olver whimpered how brave he had thought himself now here he was finally at the battle he could barely keep his hands from trembling he wanted to hide dig deep into the earth faile had told him to find another place to hide because they might come back looking for the horn dared he go out there dared he stay here olver cracked his eyes open then nearly screamed a pair of legs ending in hooves stood beside the wagon a moment later a snouted face leaned down and looked at him beady eyes narrowing nostrils sniffing olver yelled scrambling back clutching the horn the trolloc yelled something heaving the wagon over and nearly smashing it down on olver the wagons contents of arrows went scattering across the ground as olver dashed away looking for safety there was none dozens of the trollocs turned toward him and they called to one another in a language olver did not recognize he looked about horn in one hand knife in the other frantic no safety a horse snorted nearby it was bela chewing on some grain leaked from a supply cart the horse raised her head looking at olver she didnt have a saddle on only a halter and bridle blood and ashes olver thought running for her i wish i had wind this plump mare would end him in the cookpot for certain olver sheathed his knife and jumped up onto belas back seizing the reins in one hand clutching the horn in the other the pigsnouted trolloc from the wagon swung nearly taking off olvers arm he cried out kicking bela into motion and the mare galloped out from among the trollocs the beasts ran behind with howls and yells other calls sounded throughout the camp which was nearly emptying out as they converged on the boy olver rode as hed been taught down low guiding with his knees and bela ran light but she ran mat had said that many horses were frightened of trollocs and would throw their rider if forced near them but this animal did none of that she thundered right past howling trollocs right through the center of the camp olver looked over his shoulder there were hundreds of them back there chasing him oh light hed seen mats banner atop those heights he was sure of it but there were so many trollocs in the way olver turned bela to ride the way aravine had gone perhaps he could round the trolloc camp and get out that way then come up the back of the heights take the horn to mat or all is lost olver rode for all he was worth urging bela on there is nobody else ahead a large force of trollocs cut him off olver turned back the other way but others approached from that direction too olver cried out turning bela again but a thick black trolloc arrow hit her in the flank she screamed and stumbled then dropped olver tumbled free hitting the ground knocked the air from his lungs and made him see a flash of light he forced himself to crawl to his hands and knees the horn must reach matrim cauthon olver grabbed the horn and found that he was weeping im sorry he said to bela you were a good horse you ran like wind couldnt have im sorry she whinnied softly and drew a final breath then died he left her and ran beneath the legs of the first trolloc that arrived olver couldnt fight them he knew he couldnt he didnt unsheathe the knife he just ran up the steep slope trying to reach the top from where he had seen mats flag fall it might as well have been a continent away a trolloc grabbed at his clothing pulling him down but olver ripped free leaving cloth in its thick nails he scrambled over broken ground and with desperation spotted a little cleft in a rocky outcrop at the base of the slope the shallow crack looked up at the black sky he threw himself toward it then wiggled in clinging to the horn he barely fit trollocs milled around above him then began to reach in for him tearing at his clothing olver whimpered and closed his eyes logain hurled himself through the gateway weaves already forming before him as he struck at demandred the man stood on the smoldering slope that looked over the dried river and toward the failing andoran pike formations the aiel cairhienin and legion of the dragon fought there as well and all were in danger of being surrounded the pikes were all but shattered now it would soon be a rout logain launched twin columns of fire toward demandred but sharans threw themselves in the way interfering with his attack flesh burned away bones charring to dust their deaths gave demandred time to spin about and lash out with a weave of water and air logains burst of fire hit that and turned to steam then boiled away logain had hoped that after so much channeling demandred would be weakened not so a complex weave formed in front of the man a weave such as logain had never seen it made a field that rippled in the air and when logain next attacked his weave bounced free like a stick thrown against a brick wall logain leaped to the side rolling as lightning struck from the sky shards of rock pelted him as he wove spirit fire and earth slicing at the strange wall he ripped it down then lobbed broken bits of stone from the ground to intercept fire from demandred a diversion logain thought realizing that demandred had woven something else more complex behind the fire a gateway opened and shot across the ground opening to a maw of redness logain threw himself to the side as the deathgate passed but it left a trail of burning lava demandreds next attack was a jet of air that hurled logain backward toward that lava logain desperately wove water to cool the lava he hit shoulderfirst passing a burst of steam that scalded his skin but he had cooled the lava enough that it formed a crust atop the stillmolten flow beneath holding his breath against the steam he hurled himself to the side as another series of lightning bolts pulverized the ground where he had been those bolts shattered the crust hed made reaching into the molten rock drops of lava splashed across logain searing his skin burning pocks in his arm and face he screamed and wove through his rage to send lightning down on his foe a slice of spirit earth and fire cut his weaves from the air demandred was just so strong that saangreal was incredible the next flash of lightning blinded logain throwing him backward he hit a patch of broken shale the points of the rock biting into his skin you are powerful demandred said logain could barely hear the words his ears the thunder but you are not lews therin logain growled weaving through his tears hurling lightning at demandred he wove twice and though demandred cut one bolt from the air the other struck true but what was that weave it was another that logain did not recognize the lightning hit demandred but vanished somehow sent down into the ground and dissipated such a simple weave of air and earth but it rendered the lightning useless a shield rammed between logain and the source through his wounded eyes he watched the weave for balefire begin in demandreds hands snarling logain grabbed a piece of shale from the ground beside him the size of his fist and hurled it at demandred surprisingly the stone hit ripping skin causing demandred to stumble back the forsaken was powerful but he could still make the mistakes of common men never focus all of your attention on the one power despite what taim had always said in that moment of distraction the shield between logain and the source vanished logain rolled to the side beginning two weaves one a shield of his own that he did not intend to use the other a desperate final gateway the cowards choice demandred growled raising a hand to his face and lashing out with the power he chose to destroy the shield immediately recognizing it as the greater risk the gateway opened and logain rolled through letting it snap closed he collapsed on the other side his flesh scalded his arms flayed his ears ringing his sight almost gone he forced himself to sit up back in the ashaman camp below the bogs where gabrelle and the others awaited his return he howled in anger gabrelles concern radiated through the bond real concern he hadnt imagined it light quiet she said kneeling beside him you fool what have you done to yourself i have failed he said distantly he felt the strikes of demandreds power begin again as he continued bellowing for lews therin heal me youre not going to try that again are you she said i dont want to heal you only to let you i wont try again logain said voice ragged the pain was horrible but it paled compared to the humiliation of defeat i wont gabrelle stop doubting my word hes too strong some of these burns are bad logain these holes in your skin i dont know if i can heal them completely you will be scarred that is fine he growled that would be where the lava had splashed on his arm and the side of his face light he thought how are we going to deal with that monster gabrelle put her hands on him and healing weaves poured into his body the thunder of egwenes battle with mhael rivaled that of the crashing clouds above mhael a new forsaken his name proclaimed by his dreadlords across the battlefield egwene wove without thought hurling weave after weave toward the renegade ashaman she had not called upon the wind but still it rushed and roared about her whipping her hair and her dress catching her stole and flipping it about narishma and merise huddled with leilwin on the ground beside her narishmas voicebarely audible above the battle calling out weaves as mhael crafted them following her advance egwene stood upon the top of the heights on even ground with mhael she knew somewhere deep that her body would need rest soon for now that was an unaffordable luxury for now only the fight mattered fire flared toward her and she slapped it aside with air the sparks caught in the wind swirling about her in a spray of light as she wove earth she sent a ripple through the alreadybroken ground trying to knock mhael down but he split the wave with a weave of his own hes slowing she thought egwene stepped forward swollen with power she began two weaves one above each hand and spouted fire at him he responded with a bar of pure whiteness wirethin which missed her by less than a handspan the balefire left an afterimage in egwenes eyes and the ground groaned beneath them as the air warped those spiderwebs sprang out across the ground fractures into nothingness fool she yelled at him you will destroy the pattern itself already their clash threatened that this wind was not natural this sizzling air those cracks in the ground spread from mhael widening hes weaving it again narishma cried voice caught in the tempest mhael released this second weave of balefire fracturing the ground but egwene was ready she sidestepped her anger building balefire she needed to counter it they dont care what they ruin they are here to destroy that is their masters call break burn down kill gawyn she screamed in fury weaving column after column of fire one after another narishma shouted what mhael was doing but egwene couldnt hear for the rush of sound in her ears she saw soon anyway that he had constructed a barrier of air and fire to deflect her attacks egwene strode forward sending repeated strikes at him that gave him no time to recover no time to attack she stopped the rhythm only to form a shield that she held at the ready a spray of fire off his barrier made him stumble back his weave cracking and he raised his hand perhaps to attempt balefire again egwene slammed the shield between him and the source it didnt quite cut him off for he held it back by force of will they were near enough now that she could see his incredulity his anger he fought back but was weaker than she egwene pushed bringing that shield closer and closer to the invisible thread that connected him to the one power she forced it with all her strength mhael straining released a small stream of balefire upward through the gap where the shield had not yet fallen into place the balefire destroyed the weaveas it did the air and indeed the pattern itself egwene stumbled back as mhael directed the weave toward her but the whitehot bar was too small too weak to reach her it faded away before hitting mhael snarled then vanished warping the air in a form of traveling egwene did not know egwene breathed deeply holding her hand to her chest light she had almost been obliterated from the pattern he disappeared without forming a gateway the true power she thought the only explanation she knew next to nothing about itit was the dark ones very essence the lure that had coaxed channelers in the age of legends to drill the bore in the first place balefire light i was almost dead worse than dead she had no way to counter balefire its only a weave only a weave perrins words the moment was past now and mhael had fled she would have to keep narishma close to warn her if someone started channeling nearby unless mhael uses the true power again would another man be able to sense that being channeled mother egwene turned as merise gestured toward where most of the aes sedai and ashaman were still engaged in a resounding battle with the sharan forces many sisters in colorful dresses lay dead across the hillside gawyns death haunted her thoughts like an assassin in black egwene set her jaw and stoked her anger drawing in the one power as she launched herself at the sharans hurin his nostrils stuffed with cloth fought on polov heights with the other borderlanders even through the cloth he smelled the war so much violence the scents of blood of rotting flesh all around him they coated the ground his sword his own clothing he had already been ill violently several times during the battle still he fought he threw himself aside as a bearsnouted trolloc crawled over the bodies and swung down at him the beasts sword made the ground shake and hurin cried out the beast laughed an inhuman laugh taking hurins cry to indicate fear it lunged so hurin scuttled forward and under its reach then opened up its stomach as he ran past the creature stumbled to a stop watching at its own reeking innards pour out have to buy time for lord rand hurin thought backing away and waiting for the next trolloc to come over the bodies they were coming up the eastern side of the heights the river side this steep slope was hard for them to climb but light there were so many of them keep fighting keep fighting lord rand had come to him making apologies to him well hurin would do him proud the dragon reborn did not need the forgiveness of a little thieftaker but hurin still felt as if the world had righted itself lord rand was lord rand again lord rand would preserve them if they could give him enough time there was a lull in the action he frowned the beasts had seemed endless surely they hadnt all fallen he stepped cautiously forward looking over the corpses and down the slope no no they werent defeated the sea of beasts seemed nearendless still he could see them by the light of fires below the trollocs had paused their climb because they needed to move corpses out of their way on the slope many of whom had been cut down by tams archers below them at the riverbed the greater army of trollocs fought elaynes army we should have a few minutes lan mandragoran said to the soldiers from where he sat on horseback queen alliandre rode nearby as well talking calmly with her men two monarchs within sight surely they knew how to exercise command that made hurin feel better theyre preparing for a final charge lan said a push to force us away from the slope so they can fight us up here on even ground rest while they clear bodies peace favor your swords friends the next assault will be the worst one the next assault would be the worst one light behind them on the middle of the plateau the rest of mats army continued pressing the sharan army trying to push them back to the southwest if he could do that and force them down the slope into the trollocs fighting elaynes forces it could create a right mess that mat could take advantage of but for the moment the sharans were not giving an inch of ground in fact they were pushing back mats army which was beginning to founder hurin lay back listening to the moans all around the distant shouts and ringing of weapons hitting metal sniffing the stink of violence hanging around him in an ocean of stenches the worst still to come light help them berelain used a rag to wipe the blood from her hands as she strode into the feast hall of her palace the tables had been chopped apart for firewood to stoke the enormous hearths at either end of the long room in place of the furniture lay rows upon rows of wounded the doors from the kitchens burst open and a group of tinkers entered some carrying litters and others helping wounded men limp into the room light berelain thought more the palace was stuffed to bursting with the wounded no no she said stalking forward not in here the back hallway were going to have to start putting them there rosil we have new wounded the tinkers turned toward the hallway speaking in comforting tones to the wounded men only those who could be saved were brought back she had been forced to instruct the leaders among the tuathaan women as to which types of wounds took too much effort to heal better to save ten men with bad wounds than to expend the same energy trying to rescue one man who clung to life by a single blade of hope that moment of explanation had been one of the grimmest things shed ever done the tinkers continued moving in a line and berelain watched the wounded for glimpses of white clothing there were whitecloaks among them but not the one she sought so many she thought again the tinkers had no help moving the wounded every ablebodied man in the palace and most women had gone to the battlefield to fight or help the caemlyn refugees gather arrows rosil bustled up her clothing stained with blood that she ignored she immediately took charge of the wounded eyeing them for any who needed immediate attention unfortunately the doors to the kitchen burst open at that moment and a group of bloodied andorans and aiel stumbled through sent by the kinswomen from another area of the battlefield what followed was near madness as berelain chivvied out everyone she hadgrooms the elderly some children as young as fiveto help settle the newcomers only the worst of the aiel came through they had a tendency to remain on the battlefield as long as they could hold a weapon that meant many who came to her were beyond help she had to settle them in space she couldnt afford and watch them heave bloody gasps as they died this is foolish she said standing up her hands were wet with blood again and she hadnt a clean rag left light we need to send more help you she pointed to an aiel who had been blinded he sat with his back to the wall a bandage around his eyes you the blind aiel i am called ronja well ronja i have some gaishain here helping me by my count there should be a lot more of them where are they they wait until the battle is through so that they may minister to the victors were going to fetch them she said we need every person we can get to help fight they may come to you here berelain paendrag and help with tending the sick the man said but they will not fight it is not their place they will see reason she said firmly its the last battle you may be clan chief here the aiel said smiling but you are not caracarn even he could not command the gaishain to disobey jietoh then who could that seemed to surprise the man no one it is not possible and the wise ones they would not he said never we shall see berelain said the man smiled deeper i should think that no man or woman would wish to suffer your wrath berelain paendrag but if i had my eyes restored i would put them out again before i watched gaishain fight they dont need to fight then berelain said perhaps they can help carry the wounded rosil you have this group the tired woman nodded there wasnt an aes sedai in the palace who didnt look like shed sooner fall over than take another step berelain kept her feet by using some herbs she did not think rosil would approve well she could do no more here she might as well check on the wounded in the storage rooms they had my lady first a voice asked it was kitan one of the palace maids who had remained behind to help with the wounded the slight woman took her arm there is something you need to see berelain sighed but nodded what disaster awaited her now another bubble of evil locking away groups of wounded behind walls that hadnt been there before had they run out of bandages again she doubted there was a sheet drapery or piece of smallclothes in the city that hadnt already been made into a bandage the girl led her up the steps to berelains own quarters where a few of the casualties were being nursed she stepped into one of the rooms and was surprised to find a familiar face waiting for her annoura sat at a bedside wearing red slashed with gray her customary braids pulled back and tied in an unflattering way berelain almost didnt recognize her annoura rose at berelains entrance bowing though she looked about ready to fall over with fatigue in the bed lay galad damodred berelain gasped rushing to his side it was him though he bore a vicious wound to his face he still breathed but he was unconscious berelain lifted his arm to take his hand in hers but found that the arm ended in a stump one of the surgeons had already cauterized it to keep him from bleeding to death how berelain asked clutching his other hand closing her eyes his hand felt warm when she had heard what demandred bellowed defeating the man in white i felt that i owed it to you annoura said i located him on the battlefield after demandred announced what he had done i pulled him away while demandred fought against one of the black towers men she sat back down on the stool beside the bed then leaned forward drooping i could not heal him berelain it was all i could do to make the gateway to bring him here im sorry it is all right berelain said kitan fetch one of the other sisters annoura you will feel better once you have rested thank you annoura nodded she closed her eyes and berelain was shocked to see tears at the edges of her eyes what is it berelain asked annoura what is wrong it should not concern you berelain she said rising all are taught it you see do not channel if you are too tired there can be complications i needed a gateway back to the palace though to bring him to safety to restore annoura collapsed from her stool berelain dropped to her side propping up her head only then did she realize that it wasnt the braids that had made annoura look so different the face was wrong too changed no longer ageless but instead youthful oh light annoura berelain said youve burned yourself out havent you the woman had lapsed into unconsciousness berelains heart lurched the woman and she had had differences recently but annoura had been her confidanteand friendfor years before that the poor woman the way aes sedai spoke this was considered to be worse than death berelain lifted the woman onto the rooms couch and then covered her with a blanket berelain felt so powerless maybe maybe she can be healed somehow she went back to galads side to hold his hand for a time longer righting the stool and sitting upon it just a little rest she closed her eyes he lived it came at a terrible cost but he lived she was shocked when he spoke how she opened her eyes to find him looking at her how am i here he asked softly annoura she said she found you on the battlefield my wounds other healers will come when they can be spared she said your hand she steeled herself your hand is lost but we can wash away that cut to your face no he whispered it is only a little cut save the healing for those who would die without it he seemed so tired barely awake she bit her lip but nodded of course she hesitated the battle fares poorly doesnt it yes so now we simply hope he slipped his hand from hers and reached under his shirt when an aes sedai arrived they would have to undress him and care for his wounds only the stump had been tended to so far as it was the worst galad sighed then trembled his hand slipping away from his shirt had he been intending to remove it hope he whispered then fell unconscious rand wept he huddled in the darkness the pattern spinning before him woven from the threads of the lives of men so many of those threads ended so many he should have been able to protect them why couldnt he against his will the names began to replay in his mind the names of those who had died for him starting with only women but now expanded to each and every person he should have been able to savebut hadnt as humankind fought at merrilor and shayol ghul rand was forced to watch the deaths he could not turn away the dark one chose then to attack him in force the pressure came again striving to crush rand into nothing he couldnt move every bit of his essence his determination and his strength focused on keeping the dark one from ripping him apart he could only watch as they died rand watched davram bashere die in a charge followed quickly by his wife rand cried out at the fall of his friend he wept for davram bashere dear faithful hurin fell to a trolloc attack as it struck for the top of the heights where mat made his stand rand wept for hurin the man with so much faith in him the man who would have followed him anywhere jori congar lay buried beneath a trolloc body whimpering for help until he bled to death rand wept for jori as his thread finally vanished enaila who had decided to forsake far dareis mai and had laid a bridal wreath at the foot of the siswaiaman leiran speared through the gut by four trollocs rand wept for her karldin manfor who had followed him for so long and had been at dumais wells died when his strength for channeling gave out and he dropped to the ground in exhaustion sharans fell upon him and stabbed him with their black daggers his aes sedai beldeine stumbled and fell moments later rand wept for them both he wept for gareth bryne and siuan he wept for gawyn so many so very many you are losing rand huddled down further what could he do his dream of stopping the dark one he would create a nightmare if he did that his own intentions betrayed him give in adversary why keep fighting stop fighting and rest he was tempted oh how he was tempted light what would nynaeve think he could see her fighting to save alanna how ashamed would she and moiraine be if they knew that in that moment rand wanted to just let go pain washed across him and he screamed again please let it end it can rand huddled down writhing trembling but still their screams assaulted him death upon death he held on barely no he whispered very well the dark one said i have one more thing to show you one more promise of what can be the dark one spun threads of possibility one last time all became darkness taim lashed out with the one power thrashing mishraile with weaves of air go back then you fool fight we will not lose that position the dreadlord ducked back gathering his two companions and slinking away to do as ordered taim smoldered then shattered a nearby stone with a surge of power that aes sedai ridgecat how dare she best him mhael a calm voice said taim mhael he had to think of himself as mhael he crossed the hillside toward the voice that had called to him he had taken a gateway to safety panicked across the heights and he was now at the edge of the southeastern slope of the heights demandred used this location to monitor the battle below and to send destruction down into the formations of andorans cairhienin and aiel demandreds trollocs controlled the entire corridor between the heights and bogs and were wearing down the defenders at the dry river it was only a matter of time meanwhile the sharan army fought northeast of here on the heights it concerned him that cauthon had arrived so quickly to stop the advance of the sharans no matter that was a move of desperation for the man he wouldnt be able to stand up against the sharan army but the most important thing right now was destroying those aes sedai on the other side of the heights that was key to winning this battle mhael passed between suspicious sharans with their strange dress and tattoos demandred sat crosslegged at their center his eyes closed he breathed in and out slowly that saangreal he used it took something out of him something more than just the normal strength required for channeling would that provide mhael with an opening how it galled to continue to put himself beneath another yes he had learned much from this man but now demandred was obviously unfit to lead he coddled these sharans and he wasted energy on his vendetta with althor the weakness of another was mhaels potential opening i hear that you are failing mhael demandred said before them across the dry riverbed the andoran defenses were finally starting to buckle trollocs were always testing to find weak points in their lines and they were breaking through pike formations in various areas all up and down the river the legions heavy cavalry and the cairhienin light were in constant motion now making sweeps of desperation against trollocs as they broke through the andoran defenses the aiel were still holding them back down near the bogs and the legions crossbowmen combined with andoran pike were still keeping the trollocs from sweeping around their right flank but the pressure of the trolloc onslaught was relentless and elaynes lines were gradually bowing out moving deeper into shienaran territory mhael demandred said opening his eyes ancient eyes mhael refused to feel intimidated looking into them he would not be intimidated tell me how you failed the aes sedai witch mhael spat she has a saangreal of great power i almost had her but the true power failed me you are given only a trickle for a reason demandred said closing his eyes again it is unpredictable for one unaccustomed to its ways mhael said nothing he would practice with the true power he would learn its secrets the other forsaken were old and slow new blood would soon rule with a relaxed sense of inevitability demandred stood he gave off the impression of a massive boulder shifting its position you will return and kill her mhael i have slain her warder she should be easy meat the saangreal demandred held out his scepter with the golden goblet affixed atop it was this a test such power mhael had felt the strength radiating from demandred as he used it you say she has a saangreal demandred said with this you will have one as well i grant you sakarnen to take from you any excuse for failure succeed or die in this mhael prove yourself worthy to stand among the chosen mhael licked his lips and if the dragon reborn finally comes to you demandred laughed you think i would use this to fight him what would that prove our strengths must be matched if i am to show myself the better by all accounts he cannot use callandor safely and he foolishly destroyed the choedan kal he will come and when he does i will face him unaided and prove myself the true master of this realm darkness within taim thought hes gone completely mad hasnt he strange to look into those eyes which seemed so lucid and hear complete insanity from his lips when demandred had first come to mhael offering him the chance to serve the great lord the man had not been like this arrogant yes all of the chosen were arrogant demandreds determination to kill althor personally had burned like a fire within him but this this was something different living in shara had changed him weakened him certainly now this what man would willingly give such a powerful artifact to a rival only a fool mhael thought reaching for the saangreal killing you will be like putting down a horse with three broken legs demandred pity i had hoped to vanquish you as a rival demandred turned away and mhael pulled the one power through sakarnen drinking gluttonously of its bounty the sweetness of saidin saturated him a raging torrent of succulent power he was immense while holding this he could do anything level mountains destroy armies all on his own mhael itched to pull out flows to weave them together and destroy this man take care demandred said his voice sounded pathetic weak the squeaking of a mouse do not channel through that toward me i have bonded sakarnen to me if you try to use it against me it will burn you from the pattern did demandred lie could a saangreal be attuned to a specific person he did not know he considered then lowered sakarnen bitter despite the power surging through him i am not a fool mhael demandred said dryly i will not hand you the noose in which to hang me go and do as you are told you are my servant in this thing the hand that holds my axe to chop down the tree destroy the amyrlin use balefire we have been commanded and in this we will obey the world must be unraveled before we reweave it to our vision mhael snarled at the man but did as he was told weaving a gateway he would destroy that aes sedai witch then then he would decide how to deal with demandred elayne watched in frustration as her pike formations were pushed back that birgitte had managed to convince her to remove herself from the immediate area of combata trolloc breakthrough could come at any momentdid not sit well with her elayne had retreated almost to the ruins out of direct danger for the moment a double ring of guards surrounded her most of them sitting and eatinggaining what little strength they could during the moments between fights elayne did not fly her banner but she sent messengers to let her commanders know that she still lived though she had tried to guide her troops against the trollocs her efforts had not been enough her forces were clearly weakening we have to go back she said to birgitte they need to see me birgitte i dont know if it will change anything birgitte said those formations just cant hold in the face of both trollocs and that bloody channeling i what is it elayne asked birgitte turned away i swear i once remembered a situation like this elayne set her jaw she found birgittes loss of memory heartwrenching but it was only one womans problem thousands of her people were dying nearby the refugees from caemlyn still searched the area for arrows and wounded several groups approached elaynes guards speaking with them softly asking after the battle or the queen elayne felt a spike of pride at the refugees and their tenacity the city had broken but a city could be rebuilt the people the true heart of caemlyn would not fall so easily another lance of light plunged into the battlefield killing men disrupting the pikemen beyond that on the far side of the heights women channeled in a furious battle she could see the lights flashing in the night though that was all should elayne join them her command here had not been good enough to save the soldiers but it had provided guidance and leadership i fear for our army elayne birgitte said i fear that the day is lost the day cannot be lost elayne said because if it is we all are lost i refuse to accept defeat you and i will return let demandred try to strike us down perhaps seeing me will revitalize the soldiers make them a group of caemlyn refugees nearby attacked her guardsmen and guardswomen elayne cursed turning moonshadow and embracing the one power the group she had at first taken for refugees in dirty sootstained clothing wore mail beneath they fought her guards killing with sword and axe not refugees at all mercenaries betrayal birgitte called lifting her bow and shooting a mercenary through the throat to arms its not a betrayal elayne said she wove fire and struck down a group of three those arent ours watch for thieves in the clothing of beggars she turned as another group of refugees lunged at the weakened lines of guards they were all around they had crept up while attention had been focused on the distant battlefield as a group of mercenaries broke through she wove saidar to show them the folly of attacking an aes sedai she released a powerful weave of air as it hit one of the men charging her the weave fell apart unraveling elayne cursed turning her horse to flee but one of the attackers lunged forward and drove his sword into moonshadows neck the horse reared squealing in agony and elayne caught a brief glimpse of guards fighting all around as she fell to the ground panicked for the safety of her babes rough hands grabbed her by the shoulders and held her against the ground she saw something silver glisten in the night a foxhead medallion another pair of hands pressed it to her skin just above her breasts the metal was sharply cold hello my queen mellar said squatting beside her the former guardsmanthe one many people still assumed had fathered her children leered down at her youve been very hard to track down elayne spat at him but he anticipated her raising his hand to catch the spittle he smiled then stood up leaving her held by two mercenaries though some of her guards still fought most had been pushed back or killed mellar turned as two men dragged birgitte over she thrashed in their grip and a third man came over to help hold her mellar took out his sword regarded its blade for a moment as if inspecting himself in its reflective gleam then he rammed it into birgittes stomach birgitte gasped falling to her knees mellar beheaded her with a vicious backhand blow elayne found herself sitting very still unable to think or react as birgittes corpse flopped forward spilling lifeblood from the neck the bond winked away and with it came pain terrible pain ive been waiting to do that for a long time mellar said blood and bloody ashes but it felt good birgitte her warder was dead her warder had been killed that tough yet generous heart that tremendous loyaltydestroyed the loss made it made it hard to think mellar kicked at birgittes corpse as a man rode up with a body draped across the back of his saddle the man wore an andoran uniform and the facedown corpse dangled golden hair whoever the poor woman was she wore a dress exactly like elaynes oh no go mellar said the man rode off a few others forming around him fake guardsmen they carried elaynes banner and one started shouting the queen is dead the queen has fallen mellar turned to elayne your people still fight well that ought to disrupt their ranks as for you well apparently the great lord has a use for those children of yours ive been ordered to bring them to shayol ghul it occurs to me that you neednt be with them at the time he looked at one of his companions can you make it work the other man knelt beside elayne then pressed his hands against her belly a jolt of sudden fright pushed through her numbness and her shock her babes shes far enough along the man said i can probably keep the children alive with a weave if you cut them out it will be difficult to do right they are young yet six months along but with the weaves i was shown by the chosen yes i think i can keep them living for an hour but you will have to take them to mhael to get them to shayol ghul traveling with a regular gateway wont work there any longer mellar sheathed his sword and pulled a hunting knife from his belt good enough for me well send the children on as the great lord asks but you my queen you are mine elayne flailed but the mens grip was tight she clawed at saidar again and again but the medallion worked like forkroot she might as well have been trying to embrace saidin as reach saidar no she screamed as mellar knelt beside her no good he said i was hoping youd get around to screaming nothing rand turned he tried to turn he had no form or shape nothing he tried to speak but he had no mouth finally he managed to think the words and make them manifest shaitan rand projected what is this our covenant the dark one replied our accommodation our accommodation is nothing rand demanded yes he understood the dark one was offering a deal rand could accept this he could accept nothingness the two of them dueled for the fate of the world rand pushed for peace glory love the dark one sought the opposite pain suffering this was in a way a balance between the two the dark one would agree not to reforge the wheel to suit his grim desires there would be no enslaving of mankind no world without love there would be no world at all it is what you promised elan rand said you promised him an end to existence i offer it to you too the dark one replied and to all men you wanted peace i give it to you the peace of the void that you so often seek i give you nothing and everything rand did not reject the offer immediately he grasped the offer and cradled it in his mind no more pain no more suffering no more burdens an ending was that not what he had desired a way to end the cycles finally no rand said an end to existence is not peace i made this choice before we will continue the dark ones pressure began to surround him again threatening to rip him apart i will not offer again the dark one said i would not expect you to rand said as his body returned and the threads of possibility faded then the true pain began min waited with the gathered seanchan forces officers walking down the lines with lanterns to prepare the men they had not returned to ebou dar but instead had fled through gateways to a large open plain that she did not recognize trees with a strange bark and large open fronds grew here she could not tell if they were truly trees or just very large ferns it was particularly hard to tell because of the wilting the trees had grown leaves but now they drooped down at the sides as if they had not seen water in far too many weeks min tried to imagine what they would have looked like when healthy the air smelled different to herof plants she did not recognize and of seawater the seanchan forces waited in strict formations of troops ready to march each fourth man with a lantern though only one in ten of those were currently lit moving an army could not be done fast despite gateways but fortuona had access to hundreds of damane the retreat had been carried out efficiently and min suspected that a return to the battlefield could be accomplished swiftly if fortuona decided to return that was the empress sat atop a pillar in the night lifted up to it on her palanquin lit by blue lanterns it was not a throne but a pure white pillar about six feet high erected on the top of a small hill min had a seat next to the pillar and could hear reports as they arrived this battle is not going well for the prince of the ravens general galgan said he addressed his generals before fortuona speaking to them directly so that they could respond to him without formally addressing the empress his request for us to return came only just now he has waited far too long to seek our aid i hesitate to say this yulan said but though the empresss wisdom knows no bounds i do not have confidence in the prince he might be the chosen consort of the empress and he was obviously a wise choice for that role he has proven himself reckless in battle however perhaps he is overly strained by what is happening im sure he has a plan beslan said earnest you have to trust mat he knows what hes doing he impressed me earlier galgan said the omens seem to favor him he is losing captaingeneral yulan said losing badly the omens for a man can change quickly as can the fortune of a nation min narrowed her eyes at the short captain of the air he now wore the last two fingernails of each hand lacquered he had been the one to lead the strike on tar valon and the success of that attack had gained him great favor in fortuonas eyes symbols and omens spun around his head like those above galgansand indeed beslans light min thought am i really starting to think of omens like fortuona i need to leave these people theyre mad i feel that the prince views this battle too much as a game yulan said again though his initial gambles were keen ones he has over extended himself how many a man has stood around the table of dactolk and looked like a genius because of his bets when really just random chance made him seem capable the prince won at first but now we see how dangerous it is to gamble as he has yulan inclined his head toward the empress his assertions grew increasingly bold as she gave him no reason to quiet himself from the empress in this situation that was an indication he should continue i have heard rumors about him galgan said mats a gambler yes beslan said but hes uncannily good at it he wins general please you need to go back and help yulan shook his head emphatically the empressmay she live foreverpulled us away from the battlefield for good reason if the prince could not protect his own command post he is not in control of the battle bolder and bolder galgan rubbed his chin then looked at another person there min didnt know much of tylee she remained quiet at these meetings with graying hair and broad shoulders the darkskinned woman had an indefinable strength to her this was a general who had led her people directly in battle many times those scars proved it these mainlanders fight better than i ever assumed they would tylee said i fought alongside some of cauthons soldiers i think they will surprise you general i too humbly suggest that we return to help but is it in the best interests of the empire to do so yulan asked cauthons forces will weaken the shadow as will the shadows march to ebou dar from merrilor we can crush the trollocs with air attacks along the way the long victory should be our goal perhaps we can send damane to fetch the prince and bring him to safety he has fought well but he is obviously overmatched in this battle we cannot save his armies of course they are doomed min frowned leaning forward one of the images above yulans head it was so odd a chain why would he have a chain above his head hes a captive she thought suddenly light someone is playing him like an instrument mat feared a spy min felt cold the empress may she live forever has made her decision galgan said we return unless her mind in its wisdom has been changed he turned toward her a questioning look on his face our spy can channel min realized inspecting yulan that man is under compulsion a channeler black ajah darkfriend damane a male dreadlord it could be anyone and the spy would be wearing a weave for disguise too in all likelihood so then how would min ever spot this spy viewings aes sedai and other channelers always had viewings attached to them always could she find a clue in one of those she knew by instinct that yulans chain meant he was a captive of another he wasnt the true spy then but a puppet she started with the other nobility and generals of course many of them had omens above their heads and those types commonly did how would she spot something out of the ordinary min scanned the watching crowd and her breath caught as she noticed for the first time that one of the sojhin a youthful woman with freckles carried an array of images above her head min didnt recognize the woman had she been serving here the whole time min was certain shed have noticed earlier if the woman had come close to her people who were not channelers warders or taveren rarely had so many images attached to them oversight or happenstance though she hadnt thought to look specifically at the servants now the coverup was obvious to her min looked away so as to not raise the servants suspicions and considered her next move her instincts whispered that she should just attack take out a knife and throw it if that servant were a dreadlordor light one of the forsakenstriking first might be the only way to defeat her there was also a chance however that the woman was innocent min debated then stood up on her chair several of the blood muttered at the breach of decorum but min ignored them she stepped up onto the arm rest of her chair balancing there to put herself even with tuon min leaned in mat has asked for us to return min said softly how long will you debate doing what he asked tuon eyed her until i am convinced this is best for my empire he is your husband one mans life is not worth that of thousands tuon said but she sounded genuinely troubled if the battle really does go as badly as yulans scouts say you named me truthspeaker min said what exactly does that mean it is your duty to censure me in public if i do something wrong however you are untrained in the station it would be best for you to hold yourself back until i can provide proper min turned to face the generals and the watching crowd her heart beating frantically as truthspeaker to the empress fortuona i speak now the truth she has abandoned the armies of humankind and she withholds her strength in a time of need her pride will cause the destruction of all people everywhere the blood looked stunned it is not so simple young woman general galgan said from the looks others gave him it seemed he wasnt supposed to debate a truthspeaker he barreled forward anyway this is a complex situation i would be more sympathetic min said if i didnt know there was a spy for the shadow among us the freckled sojhin looked up sharply i have you min thought then pointed at general yulan abaldar yulan i denounce you i have seen omens that prove to me you are not acting in the interests of the empire the real spy relaxed and min caught a hint of a smile on her lips that was good enough as yulan protested loudly the accusation min dropped a knife into her hand and whipped it toward the woman it flipped end over endbut just before hitting the woman it stopped and hung in the air nearby damane and suldam gasped the spy shot min a hateful glare then opened a gateway throwing herself through weaves shot after her but she was gone before most of the people at the meeting realized what was happening im sorry general yulan min announced but you are suffering from compulsion fortuona it is obvious that the shadow is doing whatever it can to keep us from this battle with that in mind will you still pursue this course of indecision min met tuons eyes you play these games quite well tuon whispered voice cold and to think that i worried for your safety by bringing you into my court i should have worried for myself it appears tuon sighed ever so softly i suppose you give me the opportunity perhaps the mandate to follow what my heart would choose whether or not it is wise she stood general galgan gather your troops we will return to the field of merrilor egwene wove earth and destroyed the boulders behind which the sharans had hidden the other aes sedai struck immediately hurling weaves through the crackling air the sharans died in fire lightning and explosions this side of the heights was so piled with rubble and scarred with trenches it looked like the remains of a city following a terrible earthquake it was still night and they had been fighting light how long had it been since gawyn died hours upon hours egwene redoubled her efforts refusing to let the thought of him pull her down over the hours her aes sedai and the sharans had fought back and forth across the western side of the heights slowly egwene was pushing them eastward at times egwenes side had seemed to be winning but lately more and more aes sedai fell from the effects of fatigue or the one power another group of channelers approached through the smoke drawing on the one power egwene could sense them more than see them deflect their weaves egwene yelled standing at the forefront i will attack you defend other women took up the call yelling it along their battle line no longer did they fight in pockets alone women of all ajahs lined up to either side of egwene concentration on their ageless faces warders stood in front of them using their bodies to stop weaves was the only protection they could offer egwene felt leilwin approaching from behind the new warder took her duties seriously a seanchan fighting as her warder in the last battle why not the world itself was unraveling the cracks all around egwenes feet proved that those had not faded as earlier ones hadthe darkness remained balefire had been used too much in this area egwene launched a wave of fire like a moving wall corpses went up in flames as the wall passed leaving behind smoking piles of bones her attack scored the ground blackening it and the sharans banded together to fight back against the weave she killed a few of them before they shattered the attack the other aes sedai deflected or destroyed their return weaves and egwene gathered her strength to try again so tired a piece of her whispered egwene youre so tired this is becoming dangerous leilwin stepped up stumbling on broken rock but joining her at the front i bring word mother she said in that seanchan drawl the ashaman have recovered the seals their leader carries them egwene let out a relieved breath she wove fire and sent it forth in pillars this time the flames illuminating the broken ground around them those cracks that mhael had caused worried her deeply she began another weave then stopped something was wrong she spun around as balefirea column as wide as a mans armripped through the aes sedai line vaporizing half a dozen women explosions all around appeared as if from nowhere and other women went from battle to death in a heartbeat the balefire burned away women who had stopped weaves from killing us but those women had been removed from the pattern before they could weave those and could no longer have stopped the sharan attacks balefire burned a thread backward in the pattern the chain of events was catastrophic sharan channelers who had been dead were now alive again and they surged forwardmen clawing across the broken ground like hounds women walking in linked groups of four or five egwene sought out the source of the balefire she had never seen such an immense bar of it so powerful it must have burned threads a few hours back she found mhael standing atop the heights the air warped in a bubble around him black tendrilslike moss or lichencrept out of gaps in the rock around him a spreading sickness darkness nothing it would consume them all another bar of balefire burned a hole through the ground and touched women making their forms glow then vanish the air itself broke like a bubble of force that exploded from mhael the storm from before returned stronger i thought that id taught you to run egwene snarled climbing to her feet and gathering her power at her feet the ground cracked and opened into nothing light she could feel the emptiness in that hole she began a weave but another strike of balefire coursed across the battlefield killing women she loved the trembling underfoot threw egwene to the ground screams grew loud as sharan attacks slaughtered egwenes followers aes sedai scattered seeking safety the cracks on the ground spread as if the top of the heights here had been hit by a hammer balefire she needed her own it was the only way to fight him she rose to her knees and began crafting the forbidden weave though her heart lurched as she did it no using balefire would only push the world toward destruction then what its only a weave egwene perrins words when he had seen her in the world of dreams and stopped balefire from hitting him but it wasnt just another weave there wasnt anything like it so exhausted now that shed stopped for a moment she could feel her numbing fatigue in its depths she felt the loss the bitter loss of gawyns death mother leilwin said pulling her shoulder the woman had stayed with her mother we must go the aes sedai have broken the sharans overrun us ahead mhael saw her he smiled striding forward a scepter in one hand the other pointed toward her palm up what would happen if he burned her away with balefire the last two hours would vanish her rally of the aes sedai the dozens upon dozens of sharans she had killed just a weave no other like it that isnt the way it works she thought two sides to every coin two halves to the power hot and cold light and dark woman and man if a weave exists so must its opposite mhael released balefire and egwene did something the weave shed tried before on the cracks but of a much greater power and scope a majestic marvelous weave a combination of all five powers it slid into place before her she yelled releasing it as if from her very soul a column of pure white that struck mhaels weave at its center the two canceled one another like scalding water and freezing water poured together a powerful flash of light overwhelmed all else blinding egwene but she could feel something from what she did a shoring up of the pattern the cracks stopped spreading and something welled up inside of them a stabilizing force a growth like scab on a wound not a perfect fix but at least a patch she yelled forcing herself to her feet she would not face him on her knees she drew every scrap of the power she could hold throwing it at the forsaken with the fury of the amyrlin the two streams of power sprayed light against one another the ground around mhael cracking as the ground near egwene rebuilt itself she still did not know what it was she wove the opposite of balefire a fire of her own a weave of light and rebuilding the flame of tar valon they matched one another in stasis for an eternal moment in that moment egwene felt a peace come upon her the pain of gawyns death faded he would be reborn the pattern would continue the very weave she wielded calmed her anger and replaced it with peace she reached more deeply into saidar that glowing comfort that had guided her so long and she drew on more of the power her stream of energy pushed its way through mhaels balefire like a sword thrust spraying the power aside and traveling right up the stream into mhaels outstretched hand it pierced the hand and shot through his chest the balefire vanished mhael gaped stumbling eyes wide and then he crystallized from the inside out as if freezing in ice a multihued beautiful crystal grew from him uncut and rough as if from the core of the earth itself somehow egwene knew that the flame would have had much less effect on a person who had not given himself to the shadow she clung to the power shed held she had pulled in too much she knew that if she released her grip she would leave herself burned out unable to channel another drop the power surged through her in this last moment something trembled far to the north rands fight continued the gaps in the land expanded mhael and demandreds balefire had done its work the world here was crumbling black lines radiated across the heights and her minds eye saw them opening the land shattering and a void appearing here that sucked into it all life watch for the light egwene whispered mother leilwin still knelt beside her around them hundreds of sharans picked themselves up off the ground watch for the light leilwin egwene said as the amyrlin seat i command youfind the seals of the dark ones prison and break them do it the moment the light shines only then can it save us but egwene wove a gateway and wrapped leilwin in air shoving her through to safety as she went egwene released the womans bond severing their brief tie no leilwin cried the gateway closed black cracks into nothingness expanded all around egwene as she faced the hundreds of sharans her aes sedai had fought with strength and valor but those sharan channelers still remained they surrounded her some timid others smiling in triumph she closed her eyes and drew in the power more than a woman should be able to more than was right far beyond safety far beyond wisdom this saangreal had no buffer to prevent this her body was spent she offered it up and became a column of light releasing the flame of tar valon into the ground beneath her and high into the sky the power left her in a quiet beautiful explosion washing across the sharans and sealing the cracks created by her fight with mhael egwenes soul separated from her collapsing body and rested upon that wave riding it into the light egwene died rand screamed in denial in rage in sorrow not her not her the dead are mine shaitan rand yelled not her i will kill them all adversary rand bent over squeezing his eyes shut i will protect you he thought whatever else happens i will see you safe i swear it i swear it oh light egwenes name joined the list of the dead that list continued to grow thundering in his mind his failures so many failures he should have been able to save them the dark ones attacks persisted trying to rip rand apart and crush him all at once oh light not egwene rand closed his eyes and collapsed barely holding back the next attack darkness enclosed him leane raised her arm shading her eyes against the magnificent burst of light it washed the hillside of its darkness andfor a momentleft only brilliance sharans froze in place casting shadows behind them as they crystallized the column of power rose high in the air a beacon then faded leane dropped to her knees one hand resting on the ground to steady herself a blanket of crystals coated the ground growing over broken rock coating the scarred landscape where cracks had opened they were now filled with crystal looking like tiny rivers leane climbed to her feet and crept forward passing the sharans frozen in crystal dead in time at the very center of the explosion leane found a column of crystal as wide as an ancient leatherleaf tree rising some fifty feet in the air frozen at its center was a fluted rod voras saangreal there was no sign of the amyrlin herself but leane knew the amyrlin seat has fallen a nearby aes sedai cried amid the crystallized sharans the amyrlin seat has fallen thunder rumbled berelain looked up from the side of the bed then stood galads hand slipping from hers as she walked to the window set in the stone wall the sea churned and broke against the rocks outside roaring as if in anger perhaps pain white foam sprayed violent toward clouds where lightning cast a fractured light while she watched those clouds grew thicker in the night if that was possible darker dawn was still an hour off the clouds were so black though she knew she would not see the sun when it rose she went back to galads side sat down and took his hand when would an aes sedai come to heal him he was still unconscious save for nightmare whispers he twisted and something sparkled at his neck berelain reached under his shirt taking out a medallion it was in the shape of a foxs head she rubbed her finger across it back to cauthon galad whispered eyes closed hope berelain thought for a moment feeling that darkness outside as if it were the dark ones own smothering the land and crawling in through windows under doors she rose left galad and walked quickly away carrying the medallion the amyrlin seat is dead arganda reported blood and bloody ashes mat thought egwene not egwene too it hit him like a punch to the face whats more arganda continued the aes sedai report that they have lost over half their numbers the ones remaining claim and this is a quote that they couldnt channel enough of the one power to lift a feather theyre out of the battle mat grunted how many of the sharan channelers did they take he asked bracing himself all of them mat looked at arganda and frowned what all of the channelers arganda said all the ones that were fighting the aes sedai thats something mat said but egwene no no thinking of that right now she and her people had stopped the sharan channelers the sharans and trollocs fell back from the front lines to regroup mat took the opportunity to do the same his forceswhat remained of themwere strung out across the heights he had joined together everyone he had left the borderlanders the dragonsworn loial and the ogier tams troops the whitecloaks soldiers of the band of the red hand they fought hard but their foe greatly outnumbered them it was bad enough when they just had the sharans to contend with but once the trollocs had broken through on the eastern edge of the heights they were forced to defend themselves on two fronts over the past hour they had been pushed back more than a thousand paces in a northerly direction and their back ranks had almost reached the end of the plateau this would be the last push the end of the battle with the sharan channelers gone mat would not be wiped out immediately but light there were still so many bloody trollocs left mat had danced this dance well he knew he had but there was only so much a man could do even tuons return might not be enough if it came arganda handled reports from the other areas of the battlefieldthe man was wounded badly enough he could not fight and there was no one with enough of the power left to spare for healing he did his job well good man mat could have used him in the band the trollocs gathered for their push again moving bodies out of the way forming into fists with myrddraal leading them that would give mat five or ten minutes to get ready then it would come lan walked over expression grim what would you have my men do cauthon get ready to fight those trollocs mat said has anyone checked with mayene lately now would be a wonderful time to get back a few ranks of men who have been healed i will check on it for you lan said and then i will prepare my men mat dug in his saddlebags as lan withdrew he pulled out rands banner the one of the ancient aes sedai hed gathered it earlier thinking perhaps it might have some use somebody hoist this thing up were fighting in rands bloody name lets show the shadow were proud of it dannil took the banner finding a spear to use as a pole mat took a deep breath the way the borderlanders spoke they thought this would end in a glorious heroic suicidal charge that was how thoms songs always ended the kinds of songs mat had hoped to never find himself in faint hope that was now think think in the distance the trolloc horns started blowing tuon had delayed was she going to come he hoped secretly she would not with the battle going so poorly even the seanchan might not be enough he needed an opening come on luck another gateway opened and arganda went to collect the messengers report mat did not need to hear to realize the kind of news it was as when arganda returned he was frowning all right mat said sighing give me your news the queen of andor is dead arganda said bloody ashes not elayne mat felt a lurch inside rand im sorry who leads there bashere dead arganda said and his wife they fell during an attack against the andoran pikemen weve lost six aiel clan chiefs as well nobody leads the andorans or the aiel at the riverbed theyre crumbling fast this is the end demandreds augmented voice washed across mat from the other end of the plateau lews therin has abandoned you cry out to him as you die let him feel your pain they had arrived at the last few moves in their game and demandred had played well mat looked over his army of exhausted troops many of them wounded there was no denying it they were in a desperate situation send for the aes sedai mat said i dont care if they say they cant lift a feather maybe when it comes down to their lives theyll find a little strength for a fireball here and there besides their warders can still fight arganda nodded nearby a gateway opened and two beleagueredlooking ashaman stumbled out naeff and neald bore scorch marks on their skins and naeffs aes sedai was not with them well mat asked the three it is done neald said with a growl what of tuon they found the spy apparently naeff said the empress is waiting to return on your mark mat breathed in tasting the battlefield air feeling the rhythm of the fighting he had set up he didnt know if he could win even with tuon not with elaynes army in disarray not with the aes sedai weakened to the point of being unable to channel not without egwene her two rivers stubbornness her iron backbone not without a miracle send for her naeff mat said he called for paper and a pen and scribbled a note which he handed off to the ashaman he shoved aside the selfish desire to let tuon fly to safety bloody ashes there was no safety not anywhere give this to the empress naeff tell her these instructions must be followed exactly then mat turned to neald i want you to go to talmanes he said have him move forward with the plan the two channelers left off to deliver their messages will it be enough arganda asked no mat said then why because ill be a darkfriend before ill let this battle go without trying everything arganda lews therin demandred boomed come face me i know you watch this battle join it fight i sure am growing tired of that man mat said cauthon look those trollocs have regrouped arganda said i think they are about to attack then this is it lets form up mat said where is lan has he come back yet id hate to do this without him mat turned scanning the lines for him as arganda shouted orders his attention was drawn back suddenly as arganda grabbed his arm pointing toward the trollocs mat felt a chill as he saw in the light of bonfires a lone horseman on a black stallion charge into the right flank of the trolloc horde making for the eastern slope of the heights toward demandred lan had gone to fight a war on his own the trollocs ripped at olvers arm in the night reaching into the crack trying to pry him free others dug at the sides and soil streamed in onto him sticking to the tears on his cheeks and the blood flowing from his scratches he couldnt stop shaking he also couldnt make himself move he trembled terrified as the beasts pried at him with filthy fingers digging closer and closer loial sat on a stump resting before the battle picked up again a charge yes that would be a good way for this to end loial felt sore all over he had read a great deal about battle and had been in fights before so he had known what to expect but knowing a thing and experiencing it were completely different that was why hed left the stedding in the first place after more than a day of nonstop fighting his limbs burned with a deep inner fatigue when he raised his axe the head felt so heavy he wondered why it didnt break the shaft war he could have lived his life without experiencing this it was so much more than the frantic battle at the two rivers had been there at least theyd had time to remove the dead and care for their wounded there it had been a matter of standing firm and holding against waves of attacks here there was no time to wait no time to think erith sat down on the ground beside his stump and he put a hand on her shoulder she closed her eyes and leaned against him she was beautiful with perfect ears and wonderful eyebrows loial did not look at the bloodstains on her clothing he feared some of it was hers he rubbed her shoulder with fingers so tired he could barely feel them loial had taken some notes on the battlefield for himself and for others to keep track of how the battle had gone so far yes a final attack that would make for a good ending to the story once he wrote it he pretended that he would still write the story there was no harm to such a little lie one rider burst from the ranks of their soldiers galloping toward the trolloc right flank mat would not be happy about that one man alone would die loial was surprised that he could feel sorrow for that mans life lost after all of the death he had seen that man looks familiar loial thought yes it was the horse hed seen that horse before many times lan he thought numb lan is the one riding out alone loial stood erith looked up at him as he shouldered his axe wait loial said to her fight alongside the others i must go go i need to witness this loial said the fall of the last king of the malkieri he would need to include it in his book prepare to charge arganda yelled men form up archers at the front cavalry next foot soldiers prepare to come up behind a charge tam thought yes that is our only hope they had to continue their push but their line was so thin he could see what mat had been trying but it wasnt going to work they needed to fight it through anyway well he is dead a mercenary said from near tam nodding toward lan mandragoran as he rode toward the trolloc flank bloody borderlanders tam abell said from beside him above them the sky grew darker was that possible at night those terrible boiling clouds seemed to come lower and lower tam almost lost lans figure atop the midnight stallion despite the bonfires burning on the heights their light seemed feeble hes riding for demandred tam thought but theres a wall of trollocs in the way tam took out an arrow with a resinsoaked rag tied behind the head and nocked it into his bow two rivers men prepare to fire the mercenary nearby laughed thats a hundred paces at least youll fill him with arrows if anything tam eyed the man then took his arrow and thrust the end into a torch the bundled rag behind the head came alight with fire first rank on my signal tam yelled ignoring the other orders that came down the line lets give lord mandragoran a little something to guide his way tam drew in a fluid motion the burning rag warming his fingers and loosed lan charged toward the trollocs his lance and its three replacements had all shattered hours ago at his neck he wore the cold medallion that berelain had sent through the gateway with a simple note i do not know how galad ended up with this but i believe he wished me to send it to cauthon lan did not consider what he was doing the void did not allow such things some men would call it brash foolhardy suicidal the world was rarely changed by men who were unwilling to try being at least one of the three he sent what comfort he could to distant nynaeve through the bond then prepared to fight as lan neared the trollocs the beasts set up a spear line to stop him a horse would impale itself trying to push through that lan drew in breath calm within the void planning to slice the head off the first spear then ram his way through the line it was an impossible maneuver all the trollocs would need to do was squeeze together and slow him after that they could overwhelm mandarb and pull lan from the saddle but someone had to destroy demandred with the medallion at his neck lan raised his sword a flaming arrow streaked down from the sky and hit the throat of the trolloc right in front of lan without hesitation lan used the fallen trolloc as an opening in the line of spears he crashed between the shadowspawn trampling the fallen one he would need to another arrow fell dropping a trolloc then another fell and another in quick succession mandarb crashed through the confused burning and dying trollocs as an entire rain of burning arrows dropped in front of him malkier lan yelled heeling mandarb forward trampling corpses but maintaining speed as the way opened a hail of light dropped before him each arrow precise killing a trolloc that tried to stand before him he thundered through the ranks shoving aside dying trollocs flaming arrows guiding his way in the darkness like a roadway the trollocs stood thick on either side but those in front of him dropped and dropped until there were no more thank you tam lan cantered his steed along the eastern slope of the heights alone now past the soldiers past the shadowspawn he was one with the breeze that streamed through his hair one with the sinewy animal beneath him that carried him forward one with the target that was his destination his fate demandred stood at the sound of the hoofbeats his sharan companions rising in front of him with a roar lan heeled mandarb into the sharans that blocked his path the stallion leaped front legs driving the guards before him into the ground mandarb wheeled around his haunches knocking down more sharans his forelegs coming down on yet others lan threw himself from the saddlemandarb had no protection against channeling and so to fight from horseback would be to invite demandred to kill his mountand hit the ground at a run sword out another one demandred roared lews therin you are beginning to he cut off as lan reached him and flung himself into thistledown floats on the whirlwind a tempestuous offensive sword form demandred whipped his sword up catching the blow on his weapon and skidding backward a step at the force of it they exchanged three blows quick as cracks of lightning lan still in motion until the last blow caught demandred on the cheek lan felt a slight tug and a blood sprayed into the air demandred felt at the wound in his cheek and his eyes opened wider who are you demandred asked i am the man who will kill you min looked up from the back of her torm as it loped toward the gateway back to the battlefield at merrilor she hoped it would withstand the battle frenzy when they got there bonfires and torches shone in the distance fireflies illuminating scenes of valor and determination she watched the lights flicker the last embers of a fire that would soon be extinguished rand trembled distant far to the north the pattern spun around rand forcing him to watch he looked through eyes streaming with tears he saw the people struggle he saw them fall he saw elayne captive and alone a dreadlord preparing to rip their children from her womb he saw rhuarc his mind forfeit now a pawn of one of the forsaken he saw mat desperate facing down horrible odds he saw lan riding to his death demandreds words dug at him the dark ones pressure continued to tear at him rand had failed but in the back of his mind a voice frail almost forgotten let go lan held nothing back he did not fight as he had trained rand to fight no careful testing no judging the terrain no careful evaluation demandred could channel and despite the medallion lan couldnt give his enemy time to think time to weave and hurl rocks at him or open the ground beneath him lan burrowed deeply into the void allowing instincts to guide him he went beyond lack of emotions burning away everything he did not need to judge the terrain for he felt the land as if it were part of him he did not need to test demandreds strength one of the forsaken with many decades of experience would be the most skilled swordsman lan had ever faced lan was vaguely aware of the sharans spreading out to make a broad circle around the two combatants as they fought apparently demandred was confident enough of his skills that he did not allow interference from others lan spun into a sequence of attacks water flows downhill became whirlwind on the mountain which became hawk dives into the brush his forms were like streams blending into a larger and larger river demandred fought as well as lan had feared though the mans forms were slightly different from those lan knew the years had not changed the nature of a swordfight you are good demandred said with a grunt falling back before wind and rain a line of blood dripping from his chin lans sword flashed in the air reflecting the red light of a bonfire nearby demandred came back with striking the spark which lan anticipated countering he took a scratch along the side but ignored it the exchange set lan back a step and gave demandred the chance to pick up a rock with the one power and hurl it at lan deep within the void lan felt the stone coming it was an understanding of the fightone that ran deeply into him to the very core of his soul the way demandred stepped the direction his eyes flickered told lan exactly what was coming as he flowed into his next sword form lan brought his weapon up across his chest and stepped backward a stone the size of a mans head passed directly in front of him lan flowed forward arm moving into his next form as another stone flew under his arm tugging wind with it lan raised his sword and flowed around the path of a third stone which missed him by a thumbs width rippling his clothing demandred blocked lans attack but he breathed hoarsely who are you demandred whispered again no one of this age has such skill asmodean no no he couldnt have fought me like this lews therin it is you behind that face isnt it i am just a man lan whispered that is all i have ever been demandred growled then launched an attack lan responded with stones falling down the mountain but demandreds fury forced him back a few steps despite lans initial offensive demandred was the better swordsman lan knew this by the same sense that told him when to strike when to parry when to step and when to withdraw perhaps if they had come to the fight evenly it would be different they had not lan had been fighting for an entire day and though hed been healed from his worst wounds the smaller ones still ached beyond that a healing in and of itself was draining demandred was still fresh the forsaken stopped talking and engrossed himself in the duel he also stopped using the one power focused only on his swordplay he did not grin as he took the advantage he did not seem like a man who grinned very often lan slipped away from demandred but the forsaken pressed forward with boar rushes down the mountain again pushing lan back to the perimeter of the circle battering at his defenses cutting him on the arm then the shoulder then finally the thigh ive only time for one last lesson i have you demandred finally growled breathing heavily whoever you are i have you you cannot win you didnt listen to me lan whispered one last lesson the hardest demandred struck and lan saw his opening lan lunged forward placing demandreds sword point against his own side and ramming himself forward onto it i did not come here to win lan whispered smiling i came here to kill you death is lighter than a feather demandreds eyes opened wide and he tried to pull back too late lans sword took him straight through the throat the world grew dark as lan slipped backward off the sword he felt nynaeves fear and pain as he did and he sent his love to her chapter the place that was not rand saw lan fall and it sent a spasm of anguish through him the dark one pressed in around rand swallowing him shredding him fighting that attack was too hard rand was spent let go his fathers voice i have to save them rand whispered let them sacrifice you cant do this yourself i have to thats what it means the dark ones destruction crawled on him like a thousand crows picking at his flesh pulling it from his bones he could barely think through the pressure and the sense of loss the death of egwene and so many others let go it is their choice to make he wanted so badly to protect them the people who believed in him their deaths and the danger they faced were an enormous weight upon him how could a man just let go wasnt that letting go of responsibility or was it giving the responsibility to them rand squeezed his eyes shut thinking of all those who had died for him of egwene whom he had sworn to himself to protect you fool her voice in his head fond but sharp egwene am i not allowed to be a hero too its not that you march to your death yet you forbid anyone else from doing so i let go rand let us die for what we believe and do not try to steal that from us you have embraced your death embrace mine tears leaked from the corners of his eyes im sorry he whispered why ive failed no not yet you havent the dark one flayed him he huddled before that vast nothingness unable to move he screamed in agony and then he let go he let go of the guilt he let go of the shame for having not saved egwene and all the others he let go of the need to protect her to protect all of them he let them be heroes names streamed from his head egwene hurin bashere isan of the chareen aiel somara and thousands more one by onefirst slowly but with increasing speedhe counted backward through the list he had once maintained in his head the list had once been only women but had grown to include everyone he knew had died for him he hadnt realized how large it had become how much he had let himself carry the names ripped from him like physical things like doves aflight and each one carried away a burden weight vanished from his shoulders his breathing grew steadier it was as if perrin had come with his hammer and shattered a thousand chains that had been dragging behind rand ilyena was last we are reborn rand thought so we can do better the next time so do better he opened his eyes and placed his hand before him palm against blackness that felt solid his self that had fuzzed becoming indistinct as the dark one ripped at it pulled together he placed his other arm down then heaved himself to his knees and then rand althorthe dragon rebornstood up once again to face the shadow no no the beautiful shendla whispered looking down at demandreds body her heart sank down inside of her and she tore at her hair with both hands her body swaying as she gazed on her beloved shendla slowly drew breath deep into her chest and when it released it was a fearful shriek bao the wyld is dead the entire battlefield seemed to grow still rand faced the dark one in that place that was not surrounded by all time and nothing at the same time his body still stood in the cave of shayol ghul locked into that moment of battle against moridin but his soul was here he existed in this place that was not this place outside of the pattern this place where evil was born he looked into it and he knew it the dark one was not a being but a forcean essence as wide as the universe itself which rand could now see in complete detail planets stars in their multitudes like the motes above a bonfire the dark one still strove to destroy him rand felt strong despite the attacks relaxed complete with his burdens gone he could fight again he held himself together it was difficult but he was victorious rand stepped forward the darkness shuddered it quivered vibrated as if disbelieving i destroy them the dark one was not a being it was the darkness between between lights between moments between eyeblinks all is mine this time it was ever meant to be it will ever be rand saluted those who died the blood running across rocks the weeping of those who witnessed others fall the shadow threw all of it at rand intent on rands destruction but it did not destroy him we will never give in rand whispered i will never give in the vast shadow thundered and shook it sent jolts through and across the world the ground rent the laws of nature fractured swords turned against their owners food spoiled rock turned to mud it came upon rand again the force of nothingness itself trying to pull him apart the strength of the attack did not lessen and yet suddenly it felt like an idle buzzing they would not give up it wasnt just about rand all of them would keep fighting the dark ones attacks lost meaning if they could not make him yield if they could not make him relent then what were they within the tempest rand sought the void as tam had taught him all emotion all worry all pain he took it and fed it into the flame of a single candle he felt peace the peace of a single drop of water hitting a pond the peace of moments the peace between eyeblinks the peace of the void i will not give up he repeated and the words seemed a wonder to him i control them all i break them before me you have lost child of humankind if you think that rand whispered into the darkness then it is because you cannot see loial was panting hard when he returned to the northern end of the heights he gave the news to mat about how lan had fought so bravely before he went down taking demandred with him loials report affected mat deeply as it did all members of his army particularly the borderlanders who had lost a king a brother there was a disturbance among the sharans as well somehow news of demandreds death was already percolating through their ranks mat forced down his grief that wasnt what lan would have wanted instead mat raised his ashandarei taishar malkier he screamed with all the force he could lan mandragoran you bloody wonderful man you did it his shouts rang in the silence as he charged toward the shadow armies shouts rang behind him taishar malkier shouts from all nationalities all peoples borderlander and not they surged across the heights alongside mat together they attacked the stunned foe chapter those who fight you cannot fathom it can you rand demanded of the darkness it is beyond you you break us and still we fight why havent you killed us havent you ruined us you the dark one replied i have you rand stepped forward in this place of nothing the pattern seemed to swirl around him like a tapestry here is your flaw shaitan lord of the dark lord of envy lord of nothing here is why you fail it was not about me its never been about me it was about a woman torn and beaten down cast from her throne and made a puppeta woman who had crawled when she had to that woman still fought it was about a man that love repeatedly forsook a man who found relevance in a world that others would have let pass them by a man who remembered stories and who took fool boys under his wing when the smarter move would have been to keep on walking that man still fought it was about a woman with a secret a hope for the future a woman who had hunted the truth before others could a woman who had given her life then had it returned that woman still fought it was about a man whose family was taken from him but who stood tall in his sorrow and protected those he could it was about a woman who refused to believe that she could not help could not heal those who had been harmed it was about a hero who insisted with every breath that he was anything but a hero it was about a woman who would not bend her back while she was beaten and who shone with the light for all who watched including rand it was about them all he saw this over and over in the pattern arrayed about him rand walked through eons and ages his hand passing through ribbons of the patterns light here is the truth shaitan rand said taking another step forward arms out woven pattern spreading around them you cannot win unless we give up thats it isnt it this fight isnt about a victory in battle taking me it was never about beating me it was about breaking me thats what youve tried to do with all of us its why at times you tried to have us killed while other times you didnt seem to care you win when you break us but you havent you cant the darkness trembled the nothingness shook as if the arches of the heavens themselves were cracking the dark ones shout was defiant within the void rand continued forward and the darkness trembled i can still kill the dark one bellowed i can still take them all i am lord of the grave the battle lord he is mine all are mine eventually rand stepped forward hand stretched out in his palm sat the world and upon that world a continent and upon that continent a battlefield and upon that battlefield two bodies on the ground mat fought tam at his side with sword out karede and the deathwatch guard joined them then loial and the ogier the armies of a dozen nations and peoples fought many joining him as he rushed across the plateau they were outnumbered three to one mat fought bellowing in the old tongue for the light for honor for glory for life itself he slew one trolloc then another half a dozen in moments but he felt he was fighting with the surf itself wherever he struck down blackness more took its place trollocs moving in the shadows lit only by the occasional lantern or burning arrow stuck in the ground the trollocs didnt fight as one we can break them mat thought we have to break them this was his chance push now while the sharans were dazed at demandreds fall the son of battles i will take him i will take them all adversary as i took the king of nothing blood and bloody ashes what was that nothingness in his head mat beheaded a trolloc then wiped his brow karede and the deathwatch guards covering him for a moment mat could feel the battlefield in the night there were a lot of trollocs and sharans so many of them there are too many arganda called from nearby light theyll overwhelm us we need to fall back cauthon can you hear me i can do this mat thought i can win this battle an army could defeat superior numbers but mat needed momentum an opening a favorable toss of the dice rand stood above the pattern and looked down at the fallen men in a land where hope seemed to have died you have not been watching closely enough about one thing you are wrong so very wrong cornered and alone a boy huddled in a cleft in the rock horrors with knives and fangsthe shadow itself made fleshdug at his hiding place reaching with nails like knives and ripping his skin terrified crying bloodied the boy raised a golden horn to his lips mat squinted the battle seeming to dim around him so very wrong shaitan rands voice whispered in mats mind then the voice was no longer in mats mind it could be heard distinctly by everyone on the battlefield that one you have tried to kill many times rand said that one who lost his kingdom that one from whom you took everything lurching bloodied from the sword strike to his side the last king of the malkieri stumbled to his feet lan thrust his hand into the air holding by its hair the head of demandred general of the shadows armies that man rand shouted that man still fights mat felt the battlefield grow still all were frozen in place at that moment there rang out a soft but powerful sound a clear note golden one long tone that encompassed everything the sound of a horn pure and beautiful mat had heard that sound once before mellar knelt beside elayne pressing the medallion against her head to stop her from channeling this could have gone in a very different way my queen he said you should have been more accommodating light that leer was an awful thing he had gagged her of course but she did not give him the satisfaction of crying she would find a way to escape this she had to shake free of the medallion of course if she did there was still the channeler but if she could evade the medallion then strike quickly pity that your little captaingeneral isnt alive to watch mellar said fool that she was i really do think she believed that she was birgitte from the legends elayne heard a soft sound in the distance the ground vibrated an earthquake she tried to concentrate but she could only think that birgitte had been right all along it was fully possible for the babes to be safe as min had foretold while elayne herself was left dead white mist climbed up from the ground around them like the souls of the dead curling mellar stiffened suddenly elayne blinked looking up at him something silvery jutted from the front of mellars chest it looked like an arrowhead mellar turned knife dropping from his fingers behind him birgitte silverbow stood over her corpse one foot to either side of the headless body she raised a bow bright as newly polished silver and released another arrow which seemed to trail light as it struck mellar in the head and pitched him to the ground her next shot took mellars channeler killing the dreadlord with a silver arrow before the man could respond all around them mellars men stood as if paralyzed gaping at birgitte the clothing she now wore seemed to glow a short white coat a voluminous pair of pale yellow trousers and a dark cloak her long golden hair hung in an intricate braid down to her waist i am birgitte silverbow birgitte announced as if to dispel doubt the horn of valere has sounded calling all to the last battle the heroes have returned lan mandragoran held aloft the head of one of the forsakentheir battle commander supposedly invincible the shadows army could not ignore what had happened none of them wherever they were on the battlefield the voice that had come out of nowhere had proclaimed it that the attacker should stand while the chosen lay dead it stunned them frightened them and then the horn sounded in the distance press forward mat yelled press forward his army threw themselves ferociously on to the trollocs and sharans cauthon what was that sound arganda demanded stumbling up beside pips the man still had one arm in a sling and carried a bloodied mace in the other hand around mat the deathwatch guard fought and grunted cutting down trollocs mat yelled throwing himself into the fight that was the bloody horn of valere we can still win this night the horn how had the bloody horn been sounded well it looked like mat wasnt tied to the thing any longer his death at rhuidean must have broken him from it some other unlucky fool could bear that burden now mat howled a battlecry shearing the arm off a trolloc then stabbing it through the chest the shadows entire army became disoriented at the sound of the horn those trollocs nearest lan scrambled back clawing over one another in desperate urgency to escape him that left the trollocs fighting along the slope spread thin without reserves and nobody seemed to be in charge myrddraal nearby raised swords against their own trollocs trying to get those that were fleeing to turn back and fight but flaming arrows shot by the two rivers archers fell from the sky and riddled the fades bodies tam althor mat thought im going to bloody send you my best pair of boots light burn me but i will to me mat shouted all riders that can hold a flaming weapon to me mat kicked pips into a gallop shoving his way through trollocs that were still fighting mats attack opened the way for furyk karede and his few remaining men to punch the hole in the horde of trollocs wider following that the full force of the remaining borderlanders poured through after mat toward lan the sharan army showed signs of weakening but they continued their offensive their discipline forcing them to do what their hearts were calling them to end lans victory wouldnt win the battle outrightthere were far too many enemiesbut without demandred the shadow had lost direction even the fades were showing the lack of a leader the trollocs began to fall back and regroup mat and the borderlanders galloped southwest across the heights and came to where lan was standing mat jumped from his horse and grabbed lan by the shoulder as the malkieri king faltered lan looked at mat with grim thanks and then his eyes rolled back in his head and he started to fall dropping demandreds head to the ground a man in a black coat rode over mat hadnt realized that narishma was still there fighting alongside the borderlanders the kandori ashaman threw himself off his horse and took lan by the other arm then concentrated the brief healing was enough to bring lan back to consciousness get him on a horse narishma mat said you can work on him more when we get back to our army i dont want to be stuck behind enemy lines if those trollocs below decide to come back up the heights they rode back northeast laying into the back of the trollocs right flank with swords and lances as they swept past which unsettled the beasts even more once past the borderlanders swung their mounts around and charged directly into the trolloc hordes again who were looking around in all directions not sure where the next attack would be coming from mat and narishma continued to ride toward their own back lines with lan in tow narishma eased the malkieri off his horse and had him lie on the ground to continue the healing while mat paused to consider their situation behind them mist gathered mat was struck with a terrible thought he had ignored a terrible possibility the horn of valere still called a distantyet unmistakable sound oh light mat thought oh bloody stumps on a battlefield who blew it which side the fog formed like worms crawling out of the ground after a rainstorm it gathered into a billowing cloud a thunderhead on the ground and shapes on horses charged down it figures of legend buad of albhain as regal as any queen amaresu holding aloft her glowing sword hend the striker darkskinned a hammer in one hand and a spike in the other a figure rode through the mists at the front of the heroes tall and imperious with a nose like a beak artur hawkwing carried justice his sword on his shoulder as he rode though the rest of the hundredodd heroes followed flawkwing one broke off in a streak of mist galloping away mat didnt get a good look at the rider who had it been and where was he going so quickly mat pulled his hat on tighter nudging pips forward to meet the ancient king i suppose ill know which side summoned him mat thought if he tries to kill me mat lifted the ashandarei across his saddle could he fight artur hawkwing light could anyone beat one of the heroes of the horn hello hawkwing mat called gambler hawkwing replied do take better care of what has been allotted you almost i worried we would not be summoned for this fight mat let out a relaxing breath bloody ashes hawkwing you neednt have drawn it out like that you bloody goatkisser so you fight for us of course we fight for the light hawkwing said we would never fight for the shadow but i was told mat began you were told wrong hawkwing said besides hend said laughing if the other side had been able to summon us youd be dead by now i did die mat said rubbing at the scar on his neck apparently that tree claimed me not the tree gambler hawkwing said another moment one that you cannot remember it is fitting as lews therin did save your life both times remember him amaresu snapped i have seen you murmur that you fear his madness but all the while you forget that every breath you breatheevery step you takecomes at his forbearance your life is a gift from the dragon reborn gambler twice over blood and bloody ashes even dead women treated him the way nynaeve did where did they learn it were there secret lessons hawkwing nodded toward something nearby rands banner dannil still held it aloft we arrive here to gather at the banner we can fight for you because of it gambler and because the dragon leads youthough he does it from afar it is enough well mat said looking at the banner i guess since youre here you can fight the battle now ill pull my men back hawkwing laughed you think we hundred can fight this entire battle youre the bloody heroes of the horn mat said thats what you do isnt it we can be defeated said pretty blaes of matuchin dancing her horse to the side of hawkwings tuon couldnt be mad if he looked a little at a hero right people were supposed to stare at them if we are wounded in dire ways we will have to withdraw and recover in the world of dreams the shadow knows how to incapacitate us hend added bind us hand and foot and we can do nothing to aid the battle it doesnt matter if one is immortal when one cannot move we can fight well hawkwing said to mat and we will lend you our strength this is not our war alone we are just one part of it bloody wonderful mat said that horn was still sounding then tell me this if i didnt blow that thing and the shadow didnt do it who did thick trolloc nails scored olvers arm he kept blowing the horn through his tears eyes squeezed shut in the small cleft in the rocky outcrop im sorry mat he thought as a darkhaired hand scrabbled for a hold on the horn another grabbed him by the shoulder nails digging deeply making blood pulse down his arm the horn was ripped from his hands im sorry the trolloc yanked olver upward then dropped him olver tumbled to the ground dazed and then jumped as the horn fell into his lap he grabbed it shaking and blinking away his tears shadows churned above grunting what was happening cautiously olver raised his head and found someone standing above one foot planted on either side of him the figure fought in a blur facing down a dozen trollocs at once his staff whirling this way and that as he defended the boy olver caught sight of the mans face and his breath caught noal noal clubbed a trolloc arm forcing the creature back then glanced at olver and smiled though noal still appeared aged the weariness was gone from his eyes as if a great burden had been lifted from him a white horse stood nearby with a golden saddle and reins the most magnificent animal that olver had ever seen noal they said you died olver cried i did noal said then laughed the pattern was not finished with me son sound that horn sound it proudly hornsounder olver did so blowing the horn as noal fought the trollocs back in a small circle around olver noal noal was one of the heroes of the horn galloping horses announced others come to rescue olver from the shadowspawn suddenly olver felt a deep warmth he had lost so many people but one of them one had come back for him chapter wolfbrother elaynes captors looked at birgitte stunned and elayne took the moment to jerk her body sideways she rolled to her knees her pregnancy made her awkward but she was hardly incapable the medallion that mellar had been holding against her slipped to the ground and she found the glow of saidar awaiting her grasp she filled herself with the power and held her belly her children stirred within elayne wove flows of air knocking her captors backward nearby elaynes guards having rallied burst through mellars soldiers a few stopped when they saw birgitte keep fighting you daughters and sons of goats birgitte yelled loosing arrows at the mercenaries i might be dead but im still your bloody commander and you will obey orders that spurred them into motion the rising mist curled upward fogging the battlefield it seemed to glow faintly in the darkness in moments elaynes channeling birgittes bow and her guards work sent the remnants of mellars darkfriend mercenaries running birgitte dropped six of them with arrows as they fled birgitte elayne said through tears im sorry sorry birgitte turned to her sorry why do you mourn elayne i have it all back my memory has returned she laughed it is wonderful i dont know how you stood me these last few weeks i moped worse than a child whod just broken her favorite bow i oh light elaynes insides told her shed still lost her warder and the pain of the bond breaking was not a rational thing it didnt matter that birgitte stood before her perhaps i should bond you again it would not work birgitte said waving her hand with a dismissive gesture are you hurt nothing but my pride lucky for you but luckier that the horn was blown when it was elayne nodded im going to join the other heroes birgitte said you stay here and recover light burn that elayne said forcing herself to her feet im not bloody staying behind now the babes are all right im riding elayne my soldiers think im dead elayne said our lines are breaking our men dying they have to see me to know that there is still hope they wont know what this mist means if they have ever needed their queen this is the moment nothing short of the dark one could stop me from returning now birgitte frowned youre not my warder any longer elayne said but youre still my friend will you ride with me stubborn fool im not the one who just refused to stay dead together together birgitte said nodding aviendha pulled up short listening to new howls those didnt sound quite like wolves the tempest at shayol ghul continued she didnt know which side was winning everywhere lay bodies some ripped apart by wolves others still smoldering from attacks of the one power the storm winds whipped and raged though no rain fell and waves of dust and gravel washed across her she could feel channeling from the pit of doom but it was like a quiet pulse as opposed to the storm that had been the cleansing rand was he all right what was happening the white clouds brought in by the windfinders churned among the jet black storm clouds above swirling together in a massive writhing pattern above the mountain peak from what shed heard of the windfinders they had withdrawn up shayol ghul to a ledge far above the cave entrance still working the bowl of windsthey were at a breaking point more than two thirds of their numbers had collapsed from exhaustion soon the storm would consume everything aviendha prowled through the maelstrom seeking the source of those howls she didnt have any other channelers with whom to link now that rafela had left to join the dragonsworns last stand at the cavern out here in the valley different groups killed one another shifting back and forth maidens wise ones siswaiaman trollocs fades and wolves hundreds of them had joined the battle so far there were also some domani tairens and dragonswornthough most of those fought near the path up to rand something hit the ground beside her crooning and she lashed out before thinking the draghkar burst into flames like a stick dried by a hundred days of sunlight she took a deep breath looking around her howls hundreds upon hundreds of them she broke into a run toward those howls crossing the valley floor as she did so someone emerged from the dusty shadows a wiry man with a gray beard and golden eyes he was accompanied by a small pack of wolves they glanced at her then turned back in the direction theyd been going aviendha stopped golden eyes ho he who runs with wolves she called at the man have you brought perrin aybara with you the man froze he acted like a wolf careful yet dangerous i know of perrin aybara he called back but he is not with me he hunts in another place aviendha walked closer to the man he watched her wary and several of his wolves growled it did not seem they trusted her or her kind much more than they trusted trollocs these new howls she called over the wind they are from your friends no the man said eyes growing distant no not any longer if you know of women who can channel aiel you should bring them now he moved off toward the sounds his pack running with him aviendha followed him keeping her distance from those wolves but trusting their senses above her own they reached a small rise in the floor of the valley one that shed seen ituralde use on occasion for overseeing the defense of the pass pouring out of the pass were scores of dark shapes black wolves the size of small horses they loped across the rock and though they were out of her sight aviendha knew they were leaving footprints melted into the stone hundreds of wolves attacked the darker shapes leaping on their backs but were thrown free they didnt seem to be doing much good the man with the wolves growled darkhounds aviendha shouted yes he called back bellowing to be heard over the tempest this is the wild hunt the worst of their kind these cannot fall to mortal weapons the bites of common wolves will not harm them not permanently then why do they fight the wolfbrother laughed why do any of us fight because we must try to win somehow go bring aes sedai some of those ashaman if you can find them these creatures will roll over your armies as easily as a wave over pebbles the man took off down the slope his wolves joining him she understood why they fought they might not be able to kill the darkhounds but they could slow the creatures and that was their victory herebuying rand enough time to do what he needed to she turned alarmed running to gather the others the sensation of a powerful channeler wielding saidar nearby stopped her dead she spun looking toward the source of the sensation graendal was there up aheadjust barely visible she calmly sent deadly weaves at a line of defenders of the stone she had collected a small group of womenaes sedai wise onesand a few guards the women knelt around her and had to be feeding her their power considering the strength of the weaves she unleashed her guards were four aiel men with black veils not red under compulsion for certain aviendha hesitated wavering what of the darkhounds i have to take this chance she thought she wove releasing a ray of blue light into the skythe sign she amys and cadsuane had agreed upon that of course alerted graendal the forsaken spun on aviendha and lashed out with fire aviendha dodged rolling a shield came next trying to cut aviendha off from the source she desperately pulled in as much of the one power as she could hold drawing it through the turtle brooch cutting a woman off with a shield was like trying to snip a rope with shears the thicker the rope the more difficult it was to cut in this case aviendha had taken in enough saidar to rebuff the shield she gritted her teeth spinning weaves of her own light she hadnt realized how tired she was she almost slipped the threads of the one power threatening to drift from her control she drove them into place by force of will and released a weave of air and fire although she knew that those captives included friends and allies they would rather die than be used by the shadow she told herself as she dodged another attack the ground exploded around her and she dove to the ground no keep moving aviendha leaped to her feet and ran that saved her life as lightning began to rain down behind her its might sprawling her to the ground again she came up bleeding from several cuts on her arm and started making weaves she had to drop them as a complex weave came near her compulsion if that seized her aviendha would become another of the womans thralls forced to lend her strength to overthrowing the light aviendha wove earth into the ground in front of herself throwing up chips of rock dust smoke then she rolled away seeking a hollow in the ground peeking out carefully she held her breath and did not channel the whipping winds cleared the diversion shed created graendal hesitated in the middle of the field she could not sense aviendha who had earlier placed upon herself the weave that masked her ability if she channeled graendal would know but if she did not she would be safe graendals aiel thralls stalked outward their veils up searching for aviendha aviendha was tempted to channel right then and there to end their lives any aiel she knew would thank her for that she stayed her hand she didnt want to give herself away graendal was too strong she could not face the woman alone but if she waited a weave of air and spirit attacked graendal trying to cut her off from the source the woman cursed spinning cadsuane and amys had arrived stand stand for andor and the queen elayne galloped through groups of pikemen now in disarray her hair streaming behind her shouting with a poweraided voice she held aloft a sword though the light only knew what she would do with it if she had to swing it men turned as she passed some were cut down by trollocs as they did so the beasts were pushing through the defenses reveling in the broken lines and the slaughter my men are too far gone elayne thought oh light my poor soldiers the tale she saw was one of death and despair the andoran and cairhienin pike formations had folded after taking horrible casualties now men held in little bunches many scattering scrambling for their lives stand elayne cried stand with your queen more men stopped running but they didnt go back to the fighting what to do fight elayne attacked a trolloc she used the sword despite just moments ago thinking that shed be hopeless with it she was the boarheaded trolloc actually looked surprised as she flailed at it fortunately birgitte was there and shot the beast in the forearm as it swung for elayne that saved her life but still didnt let her kill the blasted thing her mountborrowed from one of her guardsmendanced around keeping the trolloc from cutting her down as she tried to stab it her sword didnt move in the direction she willed the one power was far more refined a weapon she would use that if she had to but she would rather fight for the moment she didnt have to struggle long soldiers surrounded her dispatching the beast and defending her from four others that had begun advancing on her elayne wiped her brow and pulled back what was that birgitte asked riding up beside her then loosing an arrow at a trolloc before it could kill one of the soldiers ratliffs nails elayne i thought id seen the extent of your foolishness elayne held up her sword nearby men began to cry out the queen lives they yelled for light and andor stand with the queen how would you feel elayne said softly if you saw your queen trying to kill a trolloc with a sword as you ran away id feel like i needed to bloody move to another country birgitte snapped loosing another arrow one where the monarchs dont have pudding for brains elayne sniffed birgitte could say what she wished but the maneuver worked like a bit of yeast the force of men shed gathered grew expanding to either side of her and building a battle line she kept the sword raised high shouting andafter a moment of indecisioncreated a weave that made a majestic banner of andor float in the air above her the red lion to light the night that would draw direct fire from demandred and his channelers but the men needed the beacon she would fight off attacks as they came they did not as she rode down the battle lines shouting words that gave hope to her men for light and andor your queen lives stand and fight mat thundered forward across the top of the heights with the remains of a oncegreat army pushing southwest the trollocs were massed ahead on his left side the sharan army ahead on the right facing the enemy were the heroes borderlanders karede and his men ogier two rivers archers whitecloaks ghealdanin and mayeners mercenaries tinna and her dragonsworn refugees and the band of the red hand his own men he remembered within those memories that were not his leading forces far grander armies that were not fragmented halftrained wounded and exhausted but light help him he had never been so proud despite all that had happened his men took up the shouts of attack and threw themselves into the battle with renewed vigor demandreds death gave mat a chance he felt the armies surging and through them flowed that instinctive rhythm of the battle this was the moment he had been seeking it was the card upon which to bet everything he had ten to one odds still but the sharan army the trollocs and fades had no head no general to guide them different contingents took conflicting actions as various fades or dreadlords tried to give orders ill have to watch those sharans mat thought theyll have generals who can reinstitute command for now he needed to hit hard hit powerfully push the trollocs and sharans off the heights down below the trollocs filled the corridor between the bogs and the heights pressing hard the defenders at the riverbed elaynes death had been a lie her troops had been in disarraythey had lost more than a third of their soldiersbut just as they were about to be routed by the trollocs she rode into their midst and rallied them now they were miraculously holding their lines despite being pushed back well into shienaran territory they could not resist much longer though with or without elayne more and more pikes on the front lines were being mobbed soldiers were falling all across the field and her cavalries and the aiel were working furiously with increasing difficulty to contain the enemy light if i can push the shadow off these bloody heights into those beasts below theyll fall all over each other lord cauthon tinna shouted nearby she leveled a bloody spear from horseback pointing to the south light shone distantly toward the river erinin mat wiped his brow was that gateways in the sky dozens of them and through them poured toraken in flight carrying lanterns a fiery flight of arrows launched at the trollocs in the corridor the toraken carrying archers flew in formation over the ford and the corridor beyond over the battle mat heard sounds that must have made the enemys blood run cold hundreds maybe thousands of animal horns blared out in the night their call to war a thunderstorm of drums began to beat out a unified cadence that became louder and louder and a rumble of footfalls made by an advancing army man and animal alike slowly approaching polov heights in the dark no one could see them in the predawn blackness but everyone on the battlefield knew who they were mat let out a whoop of joy he could see the seanchan movements playing out in his minds eye now half their army would march directly north from the erinin joining with elaynes harried army at the mora to crush the trollocs trying to force their way into shienar the other half would swing to the west around the bogs to the western side of the heights crushing the trollocs in the corridor from behind now the falling hail of arrows was accompanied by glowing lights popping into existence in the airdamane making more light for their army to see bya display that would have done the illuminators proud indeed the ground shook as the massive seanchan army marched across the field of merrilor thunder shattered the air off mats right flank on the heightsa deeper thunder talmanes and aludra had mended the dragons and were firing directly from the cavern through gateways into the sharan army the pieces were almost all in place there was one more bit of business that needed tending to before the final toss of the dice mats armies pressed forward jur grady fingered the letter from his wife sent with androl from the black tower he couldnt read it in this darkness but that didnt matter so long as he could hold it hed memorized the words anyway he watched this canyon ten or so miles to the northeast along the river mora where cauthon had positioned him he was well out of sight of the battlefield at merrilor he didnt fight light it was hard but he didnt fight he watched trying not to think of the poor people who had died trying to hold the river here it was the perfect place for itthe mora passed through a canyon here where the shadow could stop the river and it had oh the men mat had sent had tried to fight the dreadlords and the sharans what a fools task that had been gradys anger smoldered at cauthon everyone claimed that he was a good general then he went and did this well if he was a genius why had he had sent five hundred simple folk from a mountain village in murandy to hold this river yes cauthon had also sent about a hundred soldiers from the band but that wasnt nearly enough theyd died after holding the river for a few hours there were hundreds upon hundreds of trollocs and several dreadlords at the river canyon well those folk had been slaughtered to a man light there had been children in that group the townsfolk and the few soldiers had fought well defending the canyon for far longer than grady would have thought possible but then theyd fallen and hed been ordered not to help them well now grady waited in the darkness atop the canyon walls hiding among a cluster of rocks distant from him perhaps a hundred paces trollocs moved by torchlightthe dreadlords needed that to see they too were atop the canyon walls which gave them the height and position to look down on the river belowwhich had become a lake the three dreadlords had broken up large chunks of the canyon walls and created the barrier of rock that dammed the river that had dried out the mora at merrilor and let the trollocs cross the river with ease grady could open that dam in a momenta strike with the one power would open it up and release the water from the canyon so far he hadnt dared cauthon had ordered him not to attack but beyond that hed never be able to defeat three strong dreadlords on his own theyd kill him and dam the river again he caressed his wifes letter then prepared himself cauthon had ordered him to make a gateway at dawn to that same village doing so would reveal grady he didnt know the purpose of the order the basin below was filled with water covering the bodies of the fallen i guess now will do as well as any time grady thought taking a deep breath dawn should be almost here though the cloud cover kept the land dark hed follow his orders light burn him but he would but if cauthon survived the battle downriver he and grady would have words stern ones a man like cauthon born of ordinary folk should have known better than to throw away lives he took another deep breath then began to weave a gateway he opened it at that village the people had come from yesterday he didnt know why he was to do this the village had been depopulated to make up the group that had fought earlier he doubted anybody remained what had mat called it hinderstap people roared through the gateway yelling holding aloft cleavers pitchforks rusty swords with them came more soldiers of the band like the hundred who had fought here before except except by the light of the dreadlords fires the faces of those soldiers were the same as the ones who had fought here before fought here and died grady gaped as he stood up in the darkness watching those people attack they were all the same the same matrons the same farriers and blacksmiths the very same people hed watched them die and now they were back again the trollocs probably couldnt tell one human from another but the dreadlords saw itand understood that these were the same people those three dreadlords seemed stunned one of the dreadlords yelled out about the dark lord abandoning them he started flinging weaves at the people those people just charged on heedless of the danger as many of their number were blown apart they fell on the dreadlords hacking at them with farming implements and kitchen knives by the time the trollocs attacked the dreadlords were down now he could shaking off his stupor grady gathered his power and destroyed the dam blocking the canyon and in doing so he released the river chapter a smile cauthon has the dragons back and fighting again jonneth said trying to peer through the smoke listen to them pounding echoed across the top of the heights pevara smiled she androl jonneth emarin and canler had joined logain and the other ashaman along with some of the aes sedai who were bonded to them they stood at the edge of the steep slopes opposite dashar knob a half mile up from where demandreds headless corpse lay another round of dragonfire sounded across the heights though in the darkness they couldnt see the smoke those dragons wont last long not if taims men have mixed in with the sharans pevara said the dragoners cant defend themselves against channelers and theyre too easy to locate because of the noise i doubt cauthon has a choice but to use them androl said he cant hold anything back now ashaman logain appeared through the smoke striding among them gabrelle at his side it is time to move were going to go defend those dragons androl asked around them dozens of other exhausted ashaman hauled themselves to their feet turning to logain no logain said were going to move west to the west pevara folded her arms thats away from the battle it is where your amyrlin fought taim logain said turning away from her the ground there as well as many of the sharans was entombed in crystal i want every ashaman soldier and dedicated to whom i have not given other specific orders to begin searching there is the ground shook rumbling ominously and pevara stumbled androl caught her by the arm though she sensed exhaustion through the bond to match her own they didnt have much left in them as the trembling subsided logan continued somewhere inside that mass of crystals is a golden scepter taim was said to have been holding it when egwene alvere defeated him were going to find it if any of you see it do not touch it send for me logain shouted the same orders to the next group of ashaman androl watched him go and pevara sensed his frustration if that scepter is an angreal or saangreal emarin said it could be of great use to us maybe pevara said i think those dragons need protecting more than we need that rod i swear theres something about that horn sounding we should be attacking now not searching for battle spoils the other ashaman can do that androl said we dont have to what canler said scowling youre going to disobey no androl said he said this is for men who didnt have any other orders we do back at the start of the battle he told us to watch for taims lackeys and to do something about them im not sure he remembers that order androl emarin said rubbing his chin and i dont know that if he did remember hed want us to follow it now he seems pretty intent on that scepter he gave us the order nonetheless androl said androl canler said sitting on his heels i feel so tired i could hardly gather the strength to curse you if i wanted none of these lads look any better and you struggle to open a small gateway how are we going to stand up to mishraile and the others androl frowned but had no argument in return however something occurred to pevara a way perhaps to accomplish something while exhausted androl perked up and his eyes widened and then he grinned youre a genius pevara thank you she said primly canler haul yourself to your feet ill bet you gentlemen anything that well find taims men trying to destroy those dragons were going to give them something of a surprise what a mess this had become moghedien kicked demandreds corpse it had been abandoned the sharans having gone to fight cauthons army and avenge their leader demandred the fool had let himself become distracted if you focused too much on personal grudges or if you let yourself be entangled with the worms you worked with well demandred had earned his reward death and likely eternal punishment at the great lords hands now that demandred was indeed dead she reached for the one powerand found something else a glowing river ten times as powerful ten times as sweet with so many of the chosen having fallen the great lord had opened himself to her survival was truly the best way to prove oneself to him this changed her plans dramatically first she burned demandreds corpse to powder then she quickly wove the mask of mirrorsoh how sweet the true power was and replaced her form with an image of demandreds she always made certain she could imitate the other chosen demandred would be difficult as he had changed so much recently but she had paid close attention no one touching her would be fooled she would be careful disguise in place she traveled to the back lines of the sharan army fighting cauthons troops here were the reserve units waiting to move forward as well as supply carts and some of the wounded the sharans stopped sorting supplies to look at her gaping they had been preparing to flee the battlefield itself they were aware as was everyone that the huge seanchan army had joined in the fight she noticed that there were a handful of ayyad in this grouponly three she could see two women with tattoos and a grimy male channeler who squatted at their feet most of the others had been killed in the conflict with the aes sedai the seanchan thinking of them and that imperious leader of theirs made moghedien writhe when the great lord discovered the mess shed made no he had given her the true power moghedien had outlasted the others and only that mattered for now he could not see everywhere and probably did not yet know that shed been uncovered how had that girl seen through her disguise it shouldnt have been possible someone must have betrayed her still she had been working closely with demandred during this battle and though she had never been as good a tactician as henone of the chosen had been except maybe sammaelshe understood the battle well enough to take charge she hated to do it as it left her exposed in a way she disliked but desperate times made for desperate actions and actually as she considered she thought that events were going fairly well for her demandred down defeated by his own pride mhael that upstart was also deadand had conveniently removed the leader of the aes sedai from the battlefield she still had the bulk of demandreds shadowspawn and some dreadlords some of the black ajah and a dozen of the turned men mhael had brought this is not him said an older man wearing the robes of a sharan monk he pointed at moghedien this is not our wyld it is moghedien burned the man to nothingness as his bones fell in a heap she remembered offhandedly from her eyesandears that demandred had shown that old man fondness better you should die old one she said to the corpse speaking as demandred than live to denounce the one you should have loved does anyone else wish to deny me the sharans remained silent ayyad moghedien said to the three did you see me craft weaves both women and the grimy man shook their heads i kill without weaves moghedien said only i your wyld could have done this she had to remember not to smile even in victory as the people bowed their heads demandred was always solemn as the people fell to their knees moghedien had to hold in her joy by force yes demandred had done good work here and had handed her the army of an entire nation to play with this would go quite well indeed dragonslayer said a kneeling ayyad woman she was weeping how weak these sharans were we saw that you had fallen how could i fall you have prophecies do you not the women looked at one another they say you will fight dragonslayer the woman said but gather five fists of the trollocs from the back lines moghedien said turning to the commander of the reserve unit and send them upriver to the ruins the ruins the man asked only the caemlyn refugees are in that direction exactly you fool refugeeschildren the elderly women who search for the dead they cant fight back tell the trollocs to start slaughtering our enemies are weak an attack like this will force them to break off and protect the ones that true warriors would just let die the general nodded and she saw approval in his face he accepted her as demandred good he ran off to give the order now moghedien said as the dragons fired in the distance why havent any of our ayyad gone to remove those weapons from the battle the ayyad kneeling before moghedien bowed her head we have fewer than a dozen ayyad left wyld your excuses are weak moghedien said listening as the explosions stopped perhaps some of mhaels remaining dreadlords had just resolved the problem of the dragons she felt her skin itch as the sharan commander strode toward a myrddraal across the field she hated being in the open like this she was meant to remain in shadows letting others lead battles however she would never have it said that when the situation demanded it she was too frightened to go and a gateway split open behind her and several of the sharans yelled out moghedien spun opening her eyes wide as she looked into what appeared to be a dark cavern dragons pointed out of it fire a voice yelled close the gateway talmanes shouted and the portal winked shut this was one of lord mats ideas wasnt it daerid yelled standing beside talmanes as the dragons were reloaded they both had wax in their ears what do you think talmanes yelled back if the dragons were vulnerable when firing what did you do you fired them from a hidden location talmanes smiled as neald opened the next gateway in front of ten dragons the fact that many of the dragon carts were too broken to roll well meant nothing when you could open a gateway in front of them pointing them wherever you wanted this gateway opened up on several fists of trollocs engaged in fierce combat against whitecloaks some of the shadowspawn turned horrified eyes toward the dragons fire talmanes shouted waving his hand down to give a visual cue in case any of the men couldnt hear him smoke filled the cavern explosions echoing against talmanes earplugs as the dragons recoiled releasing a storm of death into the trollocs they broadsided the fists sweeping them out of the way leaving them broken and dying the nearby whitecloaks cheered and raised swords neald shut the gateway and the dragoners reloaded their weapons neald then made a gateway above them facing downward to vent the dragon smoke out of the cavern complex and away into empty air somewhere distant are you smiling daerid asked yes talmanes said satisfied blood and bloody ashes lord talmanes that expression is horrifying on you daerid hesitated you should probably do that more often talmanes grinned as neald opened the next gateway to a point on dashar knob where aludra stood with spyglass and scouts deciding on the next place to target she yelled through a position neald nodded and they set up the next shot chapter impossibilities aviendha felt as if the world itself were cracking breaking apart being consumed the lightning that fell on the valley of shayol ghul was no longer under control not by the windfinders not by anyone it slew shadowspawn and defender alike unpredictable the air smelled of fire burned flesh and something elsea distinctive clean odor she had come to recognize as the scent of a lightning strike aviendha moved like the twisting wind itself trying to stay ahead of graendal who hurled bar after bar of whitehot balefire at her with each shot the ground trembled black lines spread all across the rocks the defenders of the valley had nearly fallen those people who had not retreated to the very back near the path up the mountain were being destroyed by darkhounds the ground shook and aviendha stumbled nearby a group of trollocs broke from the windy shadows snarling the creatures did not see her but turned and attacked something else other trollocs they were fighting each other she wasnt surprised it was not unusual for trollocs to fight one another if not closely controlled by the eyeless but what was that odd mist aviendha heaved herself to her feet and ran away from the trollocs moving up a nearby incline maybe from that vantage she could pinpoint graendals location at the top she found that she was standing on an impossibility an enormous chunk of rock that was floating precariously with very little underneath it it had ripped from the ground and risen here all around the valley were similar impossibilities a group of fleeing domani horsemen galloped over a section of rock that rippled like water and all four men and mounts sank into it vanishing that deep mist had started to enter the valley on one side men and trollocs alike ran from it screaming a liquid bar of balefire broke through the floating chunk of rock passing just inches from her head aviendha gasped falling flat against the ground she heard a scrambling nearby and she rolled over preparing a weave amysher wise ones clothing blackened and burned the side of her face reddenedhurried up to aviendha and huddled down beside her have you seen cadsuane or the others no amys cursed softly we all need to attack the shadowsouled at once you go round the right i will go left when you sense me weaving join in together perhaps we can fell her aviendha nodded they rose and parted somewhere fighting here was cadsuanes handpicked team talaan a windfinder who had somehow made her way to the dragonsworn alivia the former damane they with amys and aviendha were some of the most powerful channelers the light had the origin of the balefire was at least some indication of where graendal was aviendha rounded the floating rockthe balefire had punctured it rather than destroying it completelygrowing disturbed as she saw other chunks of stone rising randomly across the valley it was a bubble of evil only on a much grander scale as she crept she heard a low thrumming sound coming from the mountain the ground began to tremble chips of stone bouncing about aviendha stayed low only to see that the valley had begun to sproutincrediblynew plants the oncebarren ground turned vibrantly green the plants seeming to writhe as they grew tall patches of those plants sprouted all across the valley violent bursts of greenery above the white and black clouds swirled together white on black black on white lighting crashed then froze to the ground the lightning impossibly seemed to have become a towering glass column jagged in the shape of the bolt that had struck though it was no longer glowing those clouds above formed a pattern that looked familiar black on white white on black its the symbol she realized with a start the ancient symbol of the aes sedai under this sign shall he conquer aviendha held tightly to the one power that thrumming sound was him somehow the life growing was him as the dark one ripped the land apart rand stitched it back together she had to keep moving she crouched as she ran using the newly grown plants as cover they had come right where she needed them to hide her approach happenstance she chose to believe otherwise she could feel him in the back of her mind he fought a true warrior his battle lent her strength and she tried to return the same determination honor glory fight on shade of my heart fight on she came upon graendalstill surrounded by minions under compulsionexchanging lethal flows of the one power with cadsuane and alivia aviendha slowed watching the three of them lob bursts of fire at one another slicing at one anothers weaves with spirit warping the air with heat and tossing weaves so quickly that it was difficult to make out what was happening she itched to help but amys was right if she and aviendha attacked together particularly while graendal was occupied they had a better chance of killing the forsaken assuming cadsuane and alivia could hold out waiting was the better choice could they hold out though cadsuane was powerful more powerful than aviendha had thought those hair ornaments of hers included angreal and terangreal for certain though aviendha hadnt been able to handle them and tell for certain using her talent graendals women captives lay against the ground obviously flagging two had collapsed sarene had fallen to her knees and stared ahead with vacant eyes cadsuane and alivia didnt seem to mind if they hit the captives that was the right choice still could aviendha somehow the tall brush beside her moved aviendha spun without thought and wove fire she burned down a blackveiled attacker mere moments before his spear would have stabbed her in the neck the weapon sliced the side of her shoulder as the man stumbled then toppled forward her strike having burned a hole in his chest as large as a fist another channeler joined the melee frantically sending out weaves amys had arrived fortunately graendal focused on her rather than attacking aviendhas justrevealed location that was good for aviendha was staring at the man shed felled a man graendal had made to do her bidding through compulsion a man who looked familiar to aviendha horrified trembling she reached down and pulled aside the veil it was rhuarc im leaving mishraile said with a scowl looking at the backs of the charging sharan cavalry they were standing on the western side of the heights far off the left flank of the sharan army nobody told us wed be fighting the bloody heroes of the horn it is the last battle child alviarin sounded snide she had taken to calling all of them child lately mishraile was about ready to strangle her why had mhael allowed her to bond nensen why would a woman be put in command of them they stood in a small group alviarin mishraile nensen kash rianna and donalo and ayakowho had been turned as he had mishraile didnt know a lot about battlefield fighting when he killed people he liked to wait for them to stumble someplace dark where nobody was watching all of this open air battle all of this chaos made him feel as if a knife tip were pressed against his back there alviarin said to nensen pointing toward a flash of light as another explosion from those dragons sounded through gateways across the battlefield i think that came from the middle of the plateau make a gateway and go there were never going to mishraile began go alviarin said face red with anger nensen scrambled and did as she said he liked following orders feeling that someone was in charge i might have to kill her mishraile thought and nensen as well even without much experience of battle mishraile could see that this was not going to be an easy fight the return of the seanchan the fall of demandred and the trollocs rampaging without any direction yes the shadow still had the numbers but the fight wasnt nearly as onesided as hed have liked one of the first rules hed learned in life was to never fight a man when you had an equal chance of losing the six of them piled through the gateway coming out in the middle of the plateau the ground burnt by dragons and channelers emitted smoke to mix with the strange fog that had arisen it was hard to tell what was going on where holes in the ground splayed open by the dragons corpses well pieces of them scattered about an unusual scent in the air it was after sunrise now but barely any light came through the clouds cries came from above made by those strange flying creatures the seanchan had brought mishraile shivered light it was like standing in a house without a roof knowing your enemy had archers positioned above you he shot one of them down with a weave of fire satisfied with the way the wings crumpled and the beast spun about swirling as it dropped attacking like that exposed him though he really would have to kill the other dreadlords then escape he was supposed to be on the winning side to work alviarin said do as i said these are men making the gateways the devices fire through so we will have to locate where the gateway was and have donalo read the residue the men moved out inspecting the ground trying to find the place where the gateway had opened people fought nearby uncomfortably closesharans and men flying a banner with a wolf on it if they came back this way donalo fell in beside mishraile as they searched quickly both holding to the power donalo was a squarefaced tairen with his graying beard in a point when demandred went down donalo whispered i figured this was a trap all along weve been had mishraile nodded perhaps donalo would be an ally they could escape together of course then hed have to kill donalo mishraile wouldnt want any witnesses who could report back to the great lord what he had done he couldnt trust donalo anyway the man had joined them only because of that forced trick with the myrddraal if a man could change sides that quickly what was to keep him from changing again besides mishraile didnt like the feeling he got when looking at donalo or the others who had been turned it was as if there was something unnatural deep within them looking out at the world seeking prey we need to get out of here mishraile whispered fighting here now is a fools he cut off as they encountered someone moving through the smoke a tall man with redgold hair a familiar man scored with cuts his clothing burned and blackened mishraile gaped and donalo cursed as the dragon reborn himself saw them started then fled back across the plateau by the time mishraile thought to attack althor had crafted a gateway for himself and escaped through it the earth rumbled violently and some chunks of earth actually broke apart and a piece of the eastern slope went crashing down on to trollocs below this place was growing more and more unstable another reason to leave that was the bloody dragon reborn donalo said alviarin the bloody dragon reborn is on the battlefield what nonsense is this alviarin asked approaching with the others rand althor was here mishraile said still stunned blood and bloody ashes donalo you were right thats the only way demandred could have fallen he did keep saying that the dragon was on this battlefield somewhere kash noted donalo stepped forward cocking his head as if studying something in the air i saw exactly where he made the gateway to escape it was right here right here yes i can feel the resonance i know where he went he defeated demandred alviarin said folding her arms skeptically can we hope to fight him he looked exhausted mishraile said more than exhausted he panicked when he saw us i think if he did fight demandred it took a lot out of him alviarin regarded the space in the air where althor had vanished mishraile could practically see her thoughts if they killed the dragon reborn mhael might not be the only dreadlord raised to the chosen the great lord would be grateful to the one who struck down althor very grateful i have it donalo cried opening a gateway i need a circle to fight him alviarin said then hesitated but i will use rianna and nensen only i dont want to risk us being too inflexible all in the same circle mishraile snorted gathering his power and leaping through the opening what she meant was that she didnt want one of the men leading the circle potentially stealing the kill from her well mishraile would see about that he stepped from the battlefield to a clearing he did not recognize the trees here didnt look as deeply under the great lords touch as they did other places why was that well the same dark sky thundered above and the area was so dark that he had to weave a globe of light to make anything out althor rested on a stump nearby he looked up saw mishraile and cried out scrambling away mishraile wove a fireball that sprouted in the air and flew after him but althor managed to cut it down with a weave of his own ha he is weak mishraile thought dashing forward the others followed him through the gateway the women linked with nensen who trailed after alviarin like a puppy donalo came through last calling for them to wait for him a moment later they stopped running it hit mishraile like a wave of cold waterlike running facefirst into a waterfall the one power vanished it left him just like that he stumbled panicked trying to figure out what had happened hed been shielded no he sensed no shield he sensed nothing the trees moved nearby figures stepping from the shadows lumbering creatures with drooping eyebrows and thick fingers they seemed as ancient as the trees themselves with wrinkled skin and white hair he was in a stedding mishraile tried to run but firm arms grabbed him ogier ancients surrounded him and the others ahead in the forest althor stepped forward but it wasnt him not any longer it had been a trick androl had been wearing the dragon reborns face the others screamed and battered at the ogier with their fists but mishraile fell to his knees looking into that emptiness where the one power had been pevara moved next to androl as the ogier those too ancient to join the battle took the dreadlords in strong hands and dragged them further into stedding sholoon lindsareldest among them leaning on a cane as large as a mans thighapproached androl we will care for the captives master androl lindsar said execution pevara asked by the eldest trees no the ogier looked offended not in this place no no killing here we will hold them and not let them escape these are very dangerous people good ogier androl said do not underestimate how devious they can be the ogier chuckled limping toward the steddings still beautiful trees men assume that because we are calm we cannot be devious ourselves she said let them see how crafty a mind can become with centuries worth of aging upon it do not worry master androl we will be careful it will be well for these poor souls to live in the peace of the stedding perhaps a few decades of peace will change their outlook on the world she vanished into the trees androl looked at pevara feeling her satisfaction pulse through the bond though her face was calm you did well he said the plan was excellent she nodded in satisfaction and the two of them left the stedding passing the invisible barrier back to the one power though androl was so tired he could barely think he didnt have any trouble seizing saidin he snatched it like a starving man taking a hunk of bread though hed only been without for a few minutes almost he felt sorry for what he had done to donalo and the others rest well here my friend he thought looking over his shoulder perhaps we can find a way to free you someday from the prison they put upon your mind well jonneth asked running up done androl said pevara nodded as they stepped out of the trees to overlook the mora and the ruins outside the stedding she stopped as they saw the area around the ruins before them where the refugees from caemlyn had been gathering the wounded and weapons it was now filled with trollocs slaughtering aviendha knelt over rhuarcs body dead shed killed rhuarc it was no longer him she told herself graendal killed him her weave might as well have burned him away this is just a shell it was just a it was just a it was just a strength aviendha rands determination filled her radiating from the bond at the back of her mind she looked up and felt all fatigue leave her all distractions vanish graendal was dueling with amys talaan alivia and cadsuaneand graendal was winning weaves zipped back and forth lighting the dusty air but those coming from cadsuane and the others were less and less vibrant more defensive as aviendha watched a storm of lightning fell around amys throwing her to the ground beside graendal sashalle anderly shook then fell to the side the glow of the one power no longer surrounded her graendal had worn her out pulling too much power aviendha stood up graendal was powerful and wily she was exceptionally good at slicing weaves from the air as they were formed aviendha held a hand out to her side and wove fire air spirit a glowing burning spear of light and fire appeared in her hand she prepared five other weaves of spirit then dashed forward the thrumming of the trembling ground accompanied her footsteps crystalline lightning fell from the heavens then froze in place men and beasts howled as the darkhounds reached the final lines of humans defending the pathway up to rand graendal saw aviendha and began to weave balefire aviendha slashed the weave from the air with a flow of spirit graendal cursed weaving again aviendha struck cutting the weave apart cadsuane and talaan sent bursts of fire one of the captive aiel threw himself in front of graendal dying with a long cry as the flames engulfed him aviendha ran swiftly the ground a blur beneath her clutching a spear of light she remembered her first race one of the tests to join the maidens on that day she had felt the wind behind her urging her on this time she felt no wind instead she heard the cries of the warriors the aiel who fought seemed to drive her onward the sound itself carried her toward graendal the forsaken made a weave before aviendha could stop it a powerful weave of earth directed beneath aviendha so she leaped the ground exploded rocks flying upward as the blast threw her forward into the air stones flayed her legs carrying ribbons of blood up through the air around her her feet were ripped apart bones cracking legs burning she gripped the spear of fire and light in two hands amid the storm of rock skirt rippling as it shredded graendal looked up eyes widening lips parting she was going to travel with the true power aviendha knew it the woman had only avoided it so far because this method of traveling seemed to require her to touch her companions to take them with her and she didnt want to leave any aviendha met the shadowsouleds eyes during that brief moment when she hung in the air and she saw true terror therein the air began to warp aviendhas spear point first sank into graendals side in a moment both of them vanished chapter a field of glass logain stood in the middle of a field of glass hands clasped behind his back the battle raged across the heights the sharans appeared to be falling back from the onslaught of cauthons armies and his scouts had just reported that the shadow was being hit hard all across the field of merrilor i guess they probably wont need you gabrelle said to him as his scouts retreated so you were right the bond sent dissatisfaction and even disappointment i need to look to the future of the black tower logain said you arent looking to its future she said soft almost threatening youre looking to make certain you are a power in these lands logain you cannot hide your emotions from me logain shoved down his anger he would not be subject to their power again he would not first the white tower then mhael and his men days of torture weeks i will be stronger than any other he thought that was the only way out wasnt it i will be feared light hed resisted their attempts to corrupt him turn him to the shadow but he couldnt help wondering if they had broken something else inside of him something profound he leveled his gaze looking across the field of crystal another rumble came beneath and some of the crystals shattered this entire area was going to collapse soon and with it the scepter power im warning you mainlander a calm voice said nearby i have a message to deliver if i need see your arm broken to deliver it i will see it done thats a seanchan accent logain thought turning with a frown a seanchan woman accompanied by a large illianer was arguing with one of his guards the woman knew how to make her voice carry without shouting there was a selfpossession to her that logain found curious he walked over and the seanchan woman looked up at him you have the look of authority about you she called to him you are the one called logain he nodded the amyrlin sends you her last words the seanchan woman called you must deliver the seals up to the white tower to be broken the sign is the coming of light she says it will be known when it arrives logain raised an eyebrow he nodded to the woman mostly to put her off then walked back the other way you dont intend to do it gabrelle said you fool those seals belong to to me logain said logain gabrelle said softly i know you have been hurt but this is not a time for games why not has the white towers treatment of me been anything other than a great long game logain she touched him on the arm light burn that bond he wished hed never forced her to it tied to her as he was he could sense her sincerity how much easier his life would be if he could continue to regard all aes sedai with suspicion sincerity would that be his downfall lord logain desautel called from nearby the ashaman dedicated was as big as a blacksmith lord logain i think ive found it logain broke eye contact with gabrelle looking toward desautel the ashaman stood beside a large crystal its here desautel said wiping the crystal as logain approached see logain knelt weaving a globe of light yes there within the crystal it looked like a hand made from a slightly different type of crystal sparkling in his light that hand held a golden scepter the top vaguely cupshaped logain gathered the one power smiling broadly he let saidin flow from him into the crystal using a weave to shatter it as he would a stone the ground trembled the crystal whatever it was resisted the harder he pushed the more violent the shaking became logain gabrelle said stand back logain said i think ill need to try balefire panic surged through the bond fortunately gabrelle did not try to tell him what was forbidden and what was not ashaman need not obey white tower law logain another voice would they not leave him alone he prepared his weave logain androl was breathing deeply as he arrived he fell to his knees face scorched and burned he looked worse than death itself logain the refugees of caemlyn the shadow has sent trollocs to kill them at the ruins light theyre being murdered logain wove balefire but held the weave in place nearly complete as he looked at the crystal and its golden prize logain androl said pained the others with me stayed to fight but they are too tired i cant find cauthon and the soldiers i went to are too busy fighting to help i dont think any of the commanders know that the trollocs are up there light logain held his weave feeling the one power pulse within him power fear please androl whispered so soft children logain theyre slaughtering the children logain closed his eyes mat rode with the heroes of the horn apparently having once been the hornsounder gave him a special place among them they joined him called to him spoke to him as if they knew him they looked so well heroic tall in their saddles and surrounded by a mist that glowed against the breaking dawns light amid the fighting he finally asked the question that had been haunting him for a long while now im not bloody one of you am i he asked hend the striker you know since heroes are born sometimes then die and do whatever you do the big man laughed riding a bay horse that could have almost gone shouldertoshoulder with a seanchan boarhorse i knew that you would ask this thing gambler well then you should bloody well have an answer prepared mat felt his face flush as he anticipated the reply no you are not one of us hend said be at ease though you have done more than enough to earn a place you have not been chosen i do not know why maybe because i dont like the idea of having to hop whenever anyone blows on that bloody instrument maybe hend grinned and galloped toward a line of sharan spears mat no longer directed troop movements on the battlefield the light willing he had set things up well enough that direct control would not be needed he rode across the plateau fighting yelling joining the heroes elayne was back and she had rallied her troops mat saw elaynes banner glowing above them in the sky crafted of the one power and caught a glimpse of someone who looked like her riding among the soldiers hair glowing as if lit from behind her she seemed a bloody hero of the horn herself mat let out a whoop of joy as he saw the seanchan army marching north about to merge with elaynes army and he continued riding along the eastern slope of the heights soon after he slowed pips just having trampled a trolloc that rushing sound mat looked down below as the river returned in a swift crash of muddy water it broke the trolloc army into two parts washing away many of them as it surged back into its bed snowhaired rogosh watched the water flow then nodded to mat in respect well done gambler he said the rivers return had divided the shadows forces mat rejoined the battle he noticed as he galloped across the plateau that the sharanswhat remained of themwere fleeing through gateways he let them go when the trollocs atop the heights saw the sharans fleeing their resistance cracked and they panicked boxed in and being swept across the plateau by mats combined armies they had no choice but to flee toward the long slope to the southwest it had become total mayhem off the heights the seanchan army had joined with elaynes and both groups lit into the trollocs with an intense fury they formed a cordon around the beasts and advanced quickly not allowing one to escape the ground quickly turned to a deep red mud as trollocs fell by the thousands but the engagement on the shienaran side of the mora was nothing compared to the struggle taking place on the other side of the river the corridor between the bogs and polov heights was choked with trollocs trying to escape the seanchan attacking them from the far side of the corridor on the west the vanguard sent in first against the trollocs in the corridor was not composed of seanchan soldiers but squads of lopar and moratlopar on their hind legs the lopar were no taller than trollocs but they outweighed them considerably the lopar came at the trollocs raising up and slashing with their razorsharp claws once a lopar softened up its prey it grasped the trolloc behind the neck with its paws and bit the beasts head off at the neck this gave the lopar great pleasure the lopar were withdrawn as the corpses of trollocs began to stack up at the far end of the corridor next into this pit of carnage came flocks of corlm large wingless feathered creatures with long curved beaks designed to shred flesh these carnivores easily ran over the stacks of corpses toward trollocs still fighting to separate the beasts meat from bone the seanchan soldiers took little part in these proceedings only setting their pikes to ensure that no trollocs escaped through the corridor or off the western side of the heights the creatures assaulting them so unnerved the trollocs that few had any notion of running toward the seanchan troops on the slope terrorstricken trollocs fleeing from mats army charging down after them threw themselves onto the trollocs that filled the corridor the monsters tumbled on top of one another and they fought among themselves trying to be the ones to reach the top of the pile and continue breathing a while longer talmanes and aludra had set up their dragons across from the corridor and commenced firing dragons eggs into the roiling masses of terrorized trollocs it was all over quickly the numbers of living trollocs diminished from the many thousands to the hundreds those that remained seeing death snatching at them from three sides fled into the bogs where many of them were sucked down into the shallow waters their deaths were less violent but equally horrifying the remainder received a more merciful end shot with arrows spears and crossbow bolts as they slogged through the mire toward the sweet scent of freedom mat lowered his bloodied ashandarei he checked the sky the sun was hidden up there somewhere he was not certain how long he had been riding with the heroes he would have to thank tuon for returning he did not go looking for her though he had a feeling that she would expect him to perform his princely duties whatever they might be only he did feel that strange tugging inside getting stronger and stronger blood and bloody ashes rand mat thought ive done my part you do yours amaresus words returned to him each breath you take is at his forbearance gambler mat had been a good friend when rand needed had he not most of the time blood and ashes you could not expect a fellow to not worry maybe stay a little distant when a madman was involved right hawkwing mat called riding up to the man the battle mat said drawing a deep breath its done right you have sewn this one up tight gambler hawkwing said sitting his mount regally ah what i would give to go at you across the battlefield what a grand fight it would be great wonderful i didnt mean this battlefield i mean the last battle its done right you ask that under a sky of shadow atop an earth that trembles in fear what does your soul say gambler those dice still tumbled inside of mats head my soul says im a fool mat growled that and a bloody sparring dummy set up and waiting to be attacked he turned northward i need to go to rand hawkwing would you do me a favor ask it hornblower do you know the seanchan i am familiar with them i think their empress would like very much to make your acquaintance mat said galloping away if you could go to speak with her id appreciate it and if you do kindly tell her i sent you you think i will retreat the dark one asked the thing that spoke those words was something that rand could never truly comprehend even seeing the universe in its entirety did not allow him to understand evil itself i never expect you to retreat rand said i believe you incapable of it i wish you could see could know why it is you continue to lose beneath them on the battlefield the trollocs had fallen beaten by a young gambler from the two rivers the shadow shouldnt have lost it made no sense the trollocs had the greater force however trollocs fought only because the myrddraal forced themon its own a trolloc would no more fight something stronger than a fox would attempt to kill a lion it was one of the most basic rules among predators eat that which was weaker than you flee from that stronger than you the dark one seethed with a boiling anger that rand felt in this place as a physical force you should not be surprised rand said when have you ever inspired the best in men you cannot it is outside your power shaitan your minions will never fight on when hope is lost they will never stand because doing so is right it is not strength that beats you it is nobility i will destroy i will rend and burn i will bring darkness to all and death will be the trumpet i sound before my arrival and you adversary others may escape but you will die you must know this oh i do shaitan rand said softly i embrace it for death isand always has beenlighter than a feather death arrives in a heartbeat no more tangible than a flicker of light it has no weight no substance rand strode forward speaking louder death cannot keep me at bay and it cannot rule me it comes down to this father of lies when have you inspired a person to give their life for you not for the promises you give not for the riches they seek or the positions they would hold but for you has it ever happened the darkness grew still bring my death shaitan rand growled throwing himself into the blackness for i bring yours aviendha dropped to a rocky ledge far above the floor of thakandar she tried to stand but her ruined feet and legs couldnt support her weight she collapsed on the ledge the spear of light vanishing from her fingers pain climbed up her legs as if theyd been thrust into a fire graendal stumbled back from her gasping huge breaths holding her side aviendha immediately wove an attack flames of fire but graendal cut them down with her own weaves you graendal spat you vermin you detestable child the woman was still strong though wounded aviendha needed help amys cadsuane the others desperate clinging to the one power despite her agony she began weaving a gateway back to where she had been it was near enough that she did not need to know the area well graendal let this weave pass blood gushed between the womans fingers while aviendha worked graendal wove a thin trickle of air and stanched the wound with it then she pointed bloody fingers at aviendha trying to escape the woman began weaving a shield frantic her strength waning aviendha tied off her weave leaving the gateway open and in place please amys see it she thought as she countered graendals shield she barely managed to block it she was very weak graendal had been using borrowed power for their entire fight while aviendha had been using her own even with her angreal in her state she was really no match for graendal graendal pulled herself upright pain showing in her face aviendha spat at the womans feet then pulled herself away leaving a trail of blood behind her nobody came through the gateway had she made it to the wrong place she reached the rim of the ledge overlooking the battlefield of thakandar below if she went farther shed fall better that than becoming another of her pets threads of air wrapped around aviendhas legs and jerked her back she screamed through her clenched teeth then twisted about her feet seemed little more than stumps of raw flesh the pain washed over her and her vision darkened she struggled to reach the one power graendal held her off but the woman flagged and growled then slumped down gasping the weave stanching her wound was still in place but the womans face grew pale she seemed almost ready to faint the open gateway beside her invited aviendha a means of escapebut it might as well have been a mile away mind clouding legs afire with pain aviendha slipped her knife from its sheath it fell from her trembling fingers she was too weak to hold it chapter two craftsmen perrin awoke to something rustling he cracked his eyes open wary and found himself in a dark room berelairis palace he remembered the sound of the waves had grown softer outside the calls of gulls silent thunder rumbled distant what time was it it smelled like morning but it was dark outside still he had trouble picking out the dark silhouette moving through the room toward him he tensed until he picked out the scent chiad he asked sitting up the aiel did not jump though he was certain from the way she stopped that hed surprised her i should not be here she whispered i push my honor to the very edge of what should be allowed its the last battle chiad perrin said you are allowed to push some boundaries assuming we havent won yet the battle at merrilor is won but the greater battlethat at thakandarstill rages i need to return to work perrin said he was in his smallclothes only he didnt let that bother him an aiel like chiad wouldnt blush he pushed off his blanket unfortunately the boneeating weariness inside him had subsided only a little not going to tell me to stay in bed he asked tiredly searching out his shirt and trousers they were folded with his hammer at the foot of the bed he had to lean against the mattress as he walked there youre not going to tell me i have no business fighting while tired every woman i know seems to think that is one of her primary jobs i have found chiad said dryly that pointing out stupidity serves only to make men stupider besides im gaishain its not my place he looked at her and though he couldnt see her blush in the darkness he could smell her embarrassment she wasnt acting much like gaishain rand should have just released you all from your vows he does not have that power she said hotly what good is honor if the dark one wins the last battle perrin snapped pulling up his trousers it is everything chiad said softly it is worth death it is worth risking the world itself if we have no honor better that we lose well he supposed there were things hed say the same thing about not wearing silly white robes of coursebut he wouldnt do some of the things the whitecloaks had done even if the world was at stake he didnt press her further why are you here he asked putting on his shirt gaul chiad said is he oh light perrin said i should have told you earlier ive scrap iron for a brain lately chiad he was fine when i left him hes still in the dream and time passes more slowly where he is it has probably only been an hour or so in his time but i need to return to him in your condition she asked ignoring the fact that shed said she wouldnt chivvy him for that no perrin said sitting on the bed last time i nearly broke my neck i need one of the aes sedai to cure me of my fatigue this thing is dangerous chiad said more dangerous than letting rand die perrin said more dangerous than leaving gaul without an ally in the world of dreams protecting the caracarn alone that one is likely to stab himself with his own spear if left to fight alone chiad said i didnt mean hush perrin aybara i will try she left in a rustle of cloth perrin lay back on the bed rubbing his eyes with the heels of his palms hed been far more certain of himself when hed fought slayer this last time yet still hed failed he gritted his teeth hoping chiad would return soon something moved outside his room he revived hauling himself up to a sitting position again a large shape darkened the doorway then removed the shield from a lamp master luhhan was built like an anvil with a compactyet powerfultorso and arms that bulged in perrins minds eye the man didnt have so much gray in his hair master luhhan had grown older but he was not frail perrin doubted he ever would be lord goldeneyes he asked light please perrin said master luhhan you of all people should feel free to call me perrin if not that worthless apprentice of mine here now master luhhan said walking into the room i dont believe i called you that except once when i broke the new blade for master almoors scythe perrin said smiling i was sure i could get it right master luhhan chuckled he paused beside perrins hammer which still lay on the table at the foot of the bed and rested his fingers on it you have become a master of the craft master luhhan seated himself on a stool beside the bed one craftsman to another im impressed i dont think i could have ever made something so fine as that hammer you made the axe i guess i did that he said it was not a thing of beauty it was a thing of killing killing sometimes needs to be done yes but its never beautiful never perrin nodded thank you for finding me bringing me here for saving me it was selfinterest son master luhhan said if we escape this it will be because of you boys mark my words on it as true he shook his head as if he couldnt believe it one man at least remembered the three of them as youthsyouths who in mats case at least had been in trouble more often than not actually perrin thought im pretty sure mats still in trouble more often than not at least at the moment he wasnt fighting but instead talking with some seanchan according to the spinning colors that resolved into an image chiad said that the fighting at merrilor was finished perrin asked it is master luhhan said i came through carrying some of our wounded i should be getting back to tam and abell soon but i wanted to check on you perrin nodded that tugging inside of him if anything it was stronger now than it ever would be rand needed him the war wasnt finished yet not by far master luhhan perrin said with a sigh ive made a mistake mistake i ran myself ragged perrin said i pushed myself too hard he made a fist slamming it into the corner post of the bed i should know better master luhhan i always do this i work myself so hard i make myself useless the next day perrin lad master luhhan said leaning forward today im more worried that theres not going to be a next day perrin looked up at him frowning if there was ever a time to push yourself this is it master luhhan said weve won one fight but if the dragon reborn doesnt win his light i dont think youve made a mistake at all this is our last chance at the forge this is the morning that the big piece is due today you just keep working until its done but if i collapse then you gave it your all i could fail because ive run myself out of strength then at least you didnt fail because you held back i know it sounds bad and maybe im wrong but well everything youre talking about is good advice for an average day this isnt an average day no by the light its not master luhhan took perrin by the arm you may see in yourself someone who lets himself go too far but thats not the man i see if anything perrin ive seen in you someone who has learned to hold himself back ive watched you hold a teacup with extreme delicacy as if you feared breaking it with your strength ive seen you clasp hands with a man holding his hand in yours with such care never squeezing too hard ive watched you move with deliberate reserve so that you dont shove anyone or knock anything over those were good lessons for you to learn son you needed control but in you ive seen a boy grow into a man who doesnt know how to let those barriers go i see a man whos frightened of what happens when he gets a little out of control i realize you do what you do because youre afraid of hurting people but perrin its time to stop holding back im not holding back master luhhan perrin protested really i promise is that the case well maybe youre right master luhhan suddenly smelled embarrassed look at me here acting like its my business im not your father perrin im sorry no perrin said as master luhhan stood to leave i no longer have a father master luhhan gave him a pained look what those trollocs did my family wasnt killed by trollocs perrin said softly it was padan fain what are you certain one of the whitecloaks told me perrin said he wasnt lying well then luhhan said fain hes still out there isnt he yes perrin said he hates rand and theres another man lord luc you remember him hes been ordered to kill rand i think i think theyre both going to try for him before this is over then youll have to make sure they dont succeed wont you perrin smiled then turned toward the footsteps outside chiad entered a moment later and he could smell her annoyance that hed sensed her coming bain followed another figure in complete white and after them masuri not the aes sedai he would have chosen perrin felt his lips tighten you do not like me masuri said i know this i have never said that perrin replied you were a great help to me during our travels and yet you do not trust me but that is beside the point you wish to have your strength restored and i am probably the only one willing to do it for you the wise ones and the yellows would paddle you like a babe for wanting to leave i know perrin said sitting down on the bed he hesitated i need to know why you were meeting with masema behind my back i come here to fulfill a request masuri said smelling amused and you tell me you wont let me do you that favor until i respond to interrogation whyd you do it masuri perrin said out with it i planned to use him the slender aes sedai said use him having influence with one who called himself the prophet of the dragon could have been useful she smelled embarrassed it was a different time lord aybara before i knew you before any of us knew you perrin grunted i was foolish masuri said is that what you wanted to hear i was foolish and i have since learned perrin eyed her then sighed proffering his arm it was still an aes sedai answer but one of the straighter ones he had heard do it he said and thank you she took his arm he felt his fatigue evaporatefelt it get shoved back like an old quilt being stuffed into a small box perrin felt invigorated strengthened powerful again he practically leaped as he came to his feet masuri sagged sitting down on his bed perrin flexed his hand looking down at his fist he felt as if he could challenge anyone even the dark one himself that feels wonderful ive been told i excel at this particular weave masuri said but be careful it yes perrin said i know the body is still tired i just cant feel it and as he considered that last part wasnt exactly true he could sense his fatigue like a serpent deep within its hole lurking and waiting it would consume him again that meant he had to finish his job first he inhaled deeply then summoned his hammer to him it didnt move right he thought this is the real world not the wolf dream he walked over and slipped the hammer into its straps on his belt the new ones that he had fashioned to hold the larger hammer he turned toward chiad who stood by the doorway he could smell bain out there too where shed retreated i will find him perrin said if he is wounded i will bring him here do that chiad said but you will not find us here you are going to merrilor perrin asked surprised chiad said some of us are needed to bring the wounded in to be healed it is not a thing gaishain have done in the past but perhaps it is a thing we can do this time perrin nodded then closed his eyes he imagined himself close to sleep drifting his time in the wolf dream had trained his mind well he could fool himself with concentration that didnt change the world here but it did change his perceptions yes drifting close to sleep and there was the pathway he took the branch toward the wolf dream in the flesh and caught just a hint of a gasp from masuri as he felt himself shift between worlds he opened his eyes and dropped into buffeting winds he created a pocket of calm air then hit the ground beneath with strengthened legs only a few teetering walls remained of berelains palace on this side one of those broke apart the stones shattering and pulled into the sky by the winds the city beyond was mostly gone heaps of rock here and there indicating where buildings had once stood the sky groaned like bending metal perrin summoned his hammer into his hand then began the hunt one last time thom merrilin sat on a large sootblackened boulder smoking his pipe watching the world end he knew a thing or two about finding the best vantage to watch a performance he judged this to be the finest seat in the world his boulder was just next to the entrance into the pit of doom close enough that if he leaned back and squinted he could peer in and catch some of the lights and shadows playing inside he glanced in nothing had changed stay safe in there moiraine he thought please he was also close enough to the edge of the path to overlook the valley below he puffed on his pipe knuckling his mustache someone had to record this he couldnt spend the entire time worrying about her so he searched his mind for the right words to describe what he was seeing he set aside words like epic and momentous they were nearly worn out with overuse a wave of wind blew through the valley ruffling the cadinsor of aiel fighting redveiled enemies lightning surged pounding at the dragonsworn line holding the path up to the cave entrance those flashes sent men flying into the air then that lightning started striking at the trollocs instead the clouds went back and forth like that the windfinders seizing control of the weather the shadow taking it back neither side yet had managed a clear advantage for long hulking dark beasts ravaged the valley killing with ease the darkhounds did not fall despite the work of dozens in concert the right side of the valley was covered in a thick mist that for some reason the storm winds couldnt budge climactic thom thought chewing on the stem of his pipe no too expected if you used the words people expected they grew bored a great ballad needed to be unexpected never be expected when people start to expect youwhen they started to anticipate your flourishes to look for the ball you had hidden through sleight of hand or to smile before you reached the twist line of your taleit was time to pack up your cloak bow once more for good measure and stroll away after all that was what theyd least expect you to do when all was going well he leaned back again peering into the tunnel he couldnt see her of course she was too far in but he could feel her in his mind because of the bond she stared at the end of the world with grit and determination despite himself he smiled below the battle churned like a meat grinder ripping men and trollocs into chunks of dead flesh the aiel fought at the periphery of the battlefield engaging their shadowtaken cousins they seemed to be evenly matched or they had been before those darkhounds arrived they were relentless though these aiel they didnt seem tired at all though it had been thom couldnt put his thumb on how much time had passed hed slept maybe five or six times since theyd come to shayol ghul but he didnt know if that marked the days he checked the sky no sign of the sun though the channeling of the windfindersand the bowl of the windshad summoned a great line of white clouds to crash into the black ones the clouds seemed to be having a battle of their own a reverse image of the fighting below black against white perilous he thought no that wasnt the right word hed make a ballad of this for certain rand deserved it moiraine too this would be her victory as much as it was his he needed words the right words he searched for them while he heard the aiel beating spears against shields as they ran to battle while he heard the howling wind inside the tunnel and while he could feel her standing at the end below the domani crossbowmen cranked frantically once thousands of them had been shooting now only a fraction remained perhaps terrifying that was a right word but not the right word it might not be unexpected but it was very very true he felt it to his bone his wife fighting for her life the forces of light pushed almost to the brink of death light but he was frightened for her for them all but the word was pedestrian he needed something better something perfect below the tairens thrust their polearms desperately at attacking trollocs the dragonsworn fought with numerous types of weapons one last steamwagon lay broken nearby carrying arrows and bolts brought through the last gateway from baerlon they hadnt seen supplies in hours now the distortion of time here the tempest was doing things to the one power thom took special note of the wagonhe would need to use it in a way that preserved its wonder showing how its cold iron sides had deflected arrows before its fall there was heroism in every line in every pull of the bowstring and every hand that held a weapon how to convey that but how also to convey the fear the destruction the sheer strangeness of it all the day beforein an odd sort of bloody truceboth sides had paused to clear away bodies he needed a word that gave the feel for the chaos death the cacophony the sheer bravery below a tired group of aes sedai began moving up the pathway to where thom waited they passed archers keenly scanning the battlefield for fades exquisitethom thought that is the word unexpected but true majestically exquisite no not majestically let the word stand on its own if it is the right word it will work without help if its the wrong word adding other words to it will just make it seem desperate this was what the end should be like the sky ripping apart as factions fought for control of the elements themselves people from varied nations standing with their last strength if the light won it would do so by the narrowest of margins that of course horrified him a good emotion it would have to go in the ballad he drew on his pipe and knew that he did so to keep himself from trembling nearby an entire side of the valley wall exploded showering rock down upon the people fighting below he didnt know which of the channelers had done that there were forsaken on this battlefield thom tried to stay out of their way this is what you get old man he reminded himself for not knowing when to let go he was glad that hed not been able to escape that his attempts to leave rand mat and the others behind had failed would he really have wanted to sit in some quiet inn somewhere while the last battle played out while she went in there alone he shook his head he was as much a fool as any man or woman he just had enough experience to recognize it it took a few seasons before a man could put that together the approaching group of aes sedai broke apart some remaining below one limping tiredly up toward the cavern cadsuane there were fewer aes sedai here than there had been before casualties were mounting of course most who had come here had known that death waited for them this battle was the most desperate and fighters here were the least likely to survive of every ten who had come to shayol ghul to fight only one still stood thom knew for a fact that old rodel ituralde had sent a farewell letter to his wife before accepting this command just as well that he had cadsuane nodded toward thom then continued on toward the cavern where rand was fighting for the fate of the world as soon as her back was to thom he flipped a single knifehis other hand still holding the pipe in his mouththrough the air it hit the aes sedai in the back right in the middle severing the spine she dropped like a sack of potatoes thats an overused term it is thom thought puffing on his pipe a sack of potatoes ill need a different simile there besides how often do sacks of potatoes drop not often she dropped like like what barley spilling from the ripped end of a sack slumping to the ground in a heap yes that worked better as the aes sedai hit the ground her weave faded revealing another face behind the cadsuane mask shed been using he recognized this woman vaguely a domani what was her name jeaine caide that was it she was a pretty one thom shook his head the walk had been all wrong didnt any of them realize that a persons walk was as distinctive as the nose on their face each woman who tried to slip past him assumed that changing her face and dressmaybe her voicewould be enough to fool him he climbed off his perch and grabbed the corpse under the arms then stuffed it a hollow nearbythere were five bodies in there now so it was getting crowded he drew on his pipe and took his cloak off placing it here so that it covered up the dead hand of the black sister which was peeking out he checked one more time down the tunnelthough he could not see moiraine it comforted him to look then he returned to his perch and took out a sheet of paper and his pen andto the thunder the yells the explosions and the howl of the windhe began to compose chapter tendrils of mist dice tumbling in his head mat found grady with olver and noal on the heights he carried rands bloody banner wrapped up in a small bundle under his arm bodies lay scattered around fallen weapons and pieces of armor and blood stained the rocks but the fighting was done here the place empty of foes noal smiled at mat from horseback olver rode in front of him clutching the horn olver looked exhausted from gradys healingthe ashaman stood beside the horsebut also seemed proud as could be at the same time noal one of the heroes of the horn it bloody made sense jain farstrider himself well you wouldnt find mat trading places with him noal might enjoy it but mat wouldnt dance at another mans command not for immortality itself no he wouldnt grady mat said you did a nice job upriver that water came just when we needed it gradys face was ashen as if hed seen something he had not wanted to he nodded what what were ill explain another time mat said right now i need a bloody gateway where to grady asked mat took a deep breath pulling up shayol ghul and curse me for a fool grady shook his head it cant happen cauthon youre too tired i am tired grady said it isnt that somethings happening at shayol ghul gateways opened there are deflected the pattern is warped if that makes any sense the valley isnt one location any longer but many and a gateway cant pinpoint it grady mat said that made about as much sense to me as playing a harp with no fingers traveling to shayol ghul dont work cauthon grady said with annoyance pick somewhere else how close can you send me grady shrugged one of the scouting camps a days hike out probably a days hike out the tugging pulled at mat mat olver said i think i need to go with you dont i to the blight wont the heroes be needed to fight there that was a piece of it the tugging was insufferable bloody ashes rand leave me alone you mat stopped himself a thought occurring to him scout camps one of those seanchan patrol camps you mean yes grady said theyve been sending us status reports on the battle up there now that the gateways are unreliable well dont just sit there looking stupid mat said get a gateway open come on olver we have some more work to do ahhhh shaisam rolled onto the battlefield at thakandar so perfect so pleasurable his enemies were killing one another and he he had grown vast his mind was in every tendril of mist that rolled down the side of the valley the souls of trollocs were well unsatisfying still simple grain could be filling in plentitude and shaisam had consumed quite a number of them his drones stumbled down the hillside cloaked in mists trollocs with their skin pocked as if it had boiled dead white eyes he hardly needed them any longer as their souls had given him fuel to rebuild himself his madness had retreated mostly well not mostly enough he walked at the center of the bank of mist he was not reborn yet not completely he would need to find a place to infest a place where the barriers between worlds was thin there he could seep his self into the very stones and embed his awareness into that location the process would take years but once it happened he would become more difficult to kill right now shaisam was frail this mortal form that walked at the center of his mind he was bound to it fain it had been padan fain still he was vast those souls had given rise to much mist and itin turnfound others to feed upon men fought shadowspawn before him all would give him strength his drones stumbled onto the battlefield and immediately both sides took to fighting them shaisam quivered in joy they did not see they did not understand the drones werent there to fight they were there to distract as the battle proceeded he trailed his essence down in misty tendrils then began stabbing it through the bodies of fighting men and trollocs he took myrddraal converted them used them soon this entire army would be his he needed that strength in case his ancient enemy his dear friend decided to attack him those two friendsthose two enemieswere occupied with one another excellent shaisam continued his attack striking down enemies on both sides and consuming them some tried to attack him by running into his mists his embrace of course that killed them this was his true self he had tried to create this mist before as fain but he had not been mature enough they could not reach him no living thing could withstand his mist once it had been a mindless thing it had not been him but it had been trapped with him inside of a seed carried away and that deaththat wonderful deathhad been given fertile ground in the flesh of a man the three entwined within him mist man master that wonderful daggerhis physical form carried it nowhad grown something delightful and new and ancient all at once so the mist was him but the mist was also not him mindless but it was his body and it carried his mind wonderfully with those clouds in the sky he did not have to worry about the sun burning him away so nice of his old enemy to welcome him so his physical form laughed at the heart of the creeping mists while his mindthe mists themselves gloried in how perfect everything was this place would become his but only after he had feasted upon rand althor the strongest soul of them all what a wonderful celebration gaul clung to the rocks outside the pit of doom the winds ripped at him driving sand and chips of rock against his body slicing gashes in his skin he laughed at the vortex of blackness above do your worst he shouted upward i have lived in the threefold land i had heard the last battle would be grand not a stroll to my mothers roof picking simblossoms the winds blew harder as if in retribution but gaul flattened himself against the stone giving the winds no purchase on him hed lost his shoufait had blown freeso he had tied part of his shirt over his lower face he held one spear the others were gone broken or pulled away he crawled toward the opening to the cavern which lay exposed a thin veil of purple barring the way forward a figure in dark leather appeared in front of the opening near this man the winds stilled eyes squinting against the storm gaul crawled silently up behind the man and thrust his spear forward slayer spun with a curse turning aside the spear with an arm suddenly as strong as steel burn you he shouted at gaul stay still for once gaul jumped back and slayer came for him but then the wolves arrived gaul withdrew and faded into the rocks slayer was very powerful here but what he could not see he could not kill the wolves harried slayer until he vanished there were hundreds of them here in this valley roving through the winds slayer had killed dozens gaul whispered a farewell to another who had fallen in this attack he could not speak to them as perrin aybara did but they were spear brothers gaul crawled slowly carefully his clothing and skin matched the color of the rocksit felt right for them to be that way so they were the wolves and he could probably not defeat this slayer but they could try try hard how long had it been since perrin aybara had left two hours perhaps if the shadow has claimed you my friend he thought i pray you spat in sightblinders eye before you awoke slayer appeared on the rocks again but gaul did not crawl forward the man had sent decoys before made only of rock this figure did not move gaul looked aboutcarefully slowlyas several wolves appeared near the decoy they sniffed it it started killing them gaul cursed breaking out of his hiding place this apparently was what slayer had been wanting slayer launched a spearone of gauls own it hit gaul in the side gaul grunted falling to his knees slayer laughed then raised his hands a jet of air blew out from him flinging wolves away gaul could barely hear the whimpers over the rushing wind here slayer screamed into the tempest i am a king here i am more than the forsaken this place is mine and i will perhaps the pain of gauls wound was addling him he thought that the winds were starting to die down here i will the winds stopped the entire valley grew silent slayer stiffened then turned worried eyes toward the cavern beyond nothing there seemed to have changed you are not a king a soft voice said gaul twisted about a figure stood on a rocky protrusion behind him wearing the greens and browns of a two rivers woodsman his deep green cloak rippled faintly from the stilling winds perrin stood with his eyes closed chin raised at a slight angle as if toward the sun abovethough if there was one it was blocked by clouds this place belongs to the wolves perrin said not to you not to me not to any man you cannot be a king here slayer you have no subjects and you never will insolent pup slayer snarled how many times must i kill you perrin drew in a deep breath i laughed when i found that fain had killed your family slayer yelled i laughed i was supposed to kill him you know the shadow thinks him wild and rogue but hes the first one who has managed to do something meaningful to bring you pain perrin said nothing luc wanted to be part of something important slayer shouted in that were the same though i sought the ability to channel the dark one cannot grant that but he found something different for us something better something that requires a soul to be melded with something else like what happened with you aybara like you we are nothing alike slayer perrin said softly but we are thats why i laughed and you know theres a prophecy about luc that hell be important to the last battle thats why were here well kill you then well kill althor just like we killed that wolf of yours standing on the rocky protrusion perrin opened his eyes gaul pulled back those golden eyes glowed like beacons the storm started again and yet that tempest seemed mild compared to the one gaul saw in perrins eyes gaul felt a pressure from his friend like the pressure of the sun at noon after four days without having any water to drink gaul stared up at perrin for a few moments then held a hand against his wound and ran the wind whipped at mat as he clung to the saddle of a winged beast hundreds of feet in the air oh blood and bloody ashes mat yelled one hand on his hat the other clutching the saddle he was tied in with some straps two little leather straps far too thin could they not have used more maybe ten or twenty he would have been fine with a hundred morattoraken were bloody insane every one of them they did this every day what was wrong with them tied into the saddle in front of mat olver laughed with glee poor lad mat thought hes so frightened hes going mad the lack of air up here is getting to him there it is my prince the morattoraken sulaan called to him from her place at the front of the flying beast she was a pretty thing completely insane too weve reached the valley are you sure you want to set down in there no mat shouted good answer the woman made her beast swoop blood and bloody olver laughed the toraken brought them down over a long valley clogged with a frenzied battle mat tried to let his attention settle on the fighting rather than on the fact that he was in the air flying on a lizard with two bloody lunatics heaps of trolloc bodies told that story as well as any map could have the trollocs had burst through defenses at the valley mouth behind mat he flew over that toward the mountain of shayol ghul ahead valley walls to his right and left it was mayhem below roving bands of aiel and trollocs moved through the valley striking at each other here and there some soldiers not aiel defended the way up to the pit of doom but that was the only organized formation mat could see along the side of the valley a deep mist had begun to flood down onto its floor at first mat was confused thinking it had come from the heroes of the horn but no the horn was strapped to the saddle beside mats ashandarei and this mist was too silvery if that was the right word he thought hed seen that mist before then mat felt something from that mist a prickling cold sensation followed by what he swore was whispering in his mind he knew immediately what it was oh light mat look olver called pointing wolves a group of jet black animals almost as large as horses were assaulting the soldiers defending the path up to shayol ghul the wolves were making quick work of the men light as if things had not been difficult enough those arent wolves mat said grimly the wild hunt had come to thakandar maybe they and mashadar would destroy one another was that too much to hope for with the dice tumbling in his head mat was not going to bet on it rands forceswhat was left of the aiel domani dragonsworn and tairen soldiers who had come herewould be crushed by the darkhounds if they survived mashadar would take them they could not fight either one that voice in there it wasnt just mashadar the mindless mist fain was here somewhere too and the dagger shayol ghul loomed above high in the air clouds churned surprisingly some white thunderheads had rolled in from the south colliding with the black as they spun together actually those two together looked an awful lot like the the toraken turned and winged about then swooped down lower maybe only a hundred feet off the ground be careful mat hollered holding on to his hat are you bloody trying to kill us apologies my prince the woman yelled back i just need to find a safe place to put you down a safe place mat said good luck on that its going to be difficult dhana is strong but i a blackfletched arrow grazed the side of sulaans head loosed from somewhere down below along with a flight of a dozen others that zipped around mat one hitting the wing of the toraken mat cursed dropping his hat and reaching for sulaan as olver cried out in shock sulaan went limp dropping the reins below a group of redveiled aiel prepared another volley mat undid his straps he leapedwell more crawledover olver and the unconscious woman and grabbed the reins of the panicked toraken this could not be too much harder than riding a horse could it he pulled as he had seen sulaan do turning the toraken as arrows cut the air behind them several taking the beast in the wings they veered straight toward the rock wall and mat found himself on his feet standing on the saddle and gripping the reins tightly as he tried to keep the wounded beast from bloody killing them all that turn nearly tossed him free but he held himself in place with feet wedged and holding the reins even tighter the rush of air as they turned caught up olvers next words the creatures badly wounded wings beat wildly and it screeched wretchedly mat was not certain either of them were in control as the beast twisted toward the ground they hit the floor of the valley in a heap bones crackedlight mat hoped they belonged to the torakenand he found himself tumbling end over end across the broken ground he finally came to a rest flopping over he breathed in and out stunned by it all that he finally groaned is the bloody worst idea ive ever had he hesitated maybe the second worst he had decided to kidnap tuon after all he stumbled to his feet and his legs still seemed to work he did not limp too badly as he ran to the twitching toraken olver olver he found the boy still tied in the saddle blinking and shaking his head to clear it mat olver said next time i think you should let me fly it i dont think you did a very good job if there is a next time mat said ill eat a whole bag of tar valon gold he yanked free the ties holding his ashandarei and olvers horn then handed the instrument to the boy he reached for the pack with rands banner which hed carried tied at his waist but it was gone panicked mat looked about the banner i dropped the bloody banner olver smiled looking up at the sign made by the swirling clouds it will be finewere beneath his banner already he said then lifted the horn and blew a beautiful note chapter to awaken rand broke free from the darkness and entered the pattern fully again from his watching of the pattern he knew that although only minutes had passed here since hed entered in the valley outside this cavern days had passed and farther out into the world it had been much longer rand threw moridin back from the position theyd held during those tense minutes with blades locked still full of the one power so sweet rand whipped the blade of callandor at his old friend moridin got his sword up in time to block but only barely fie growled pulling a knife from his belt and stepping back into a knifeandsword stance you dont matter any longer elan rand said the torrent of saidin raging within him let us finish this i dont moridin laughed then he spun and threw the knife at alanna nynaeve watched in horror as the knife spun through the air the winds didnt touch it for some reason no after she had coaxed the woman back to life i cannot lose her now nynaeve tried to catch the knife or block it but she moved just a hair too slowly the knife buried itself in alannas breast nynaeve looked at it horrified this was not a wound that sewing and herbs could heal that blade hit the heart rand i need the one power nynaeve cried its all right alanna whispered nynaeve looked at the womans eyes she was lucid the andilay nynaeve realized remembering the herb shed used to give the woman strength it brought her out of her stupor it awakened her i can alanna said i can release him the light faded from her eyes nynaeve looked at moridin and rand rand glanced at the dead woman with pity and sorrow but nynaeve saw no rage in his eyes alanna had released the bond before rand could feel the effects of her death moridin turned back to rand another knife in his left hand rand raised callandor to strike moridin down moridin dropped his sword and stabbed his own right hand with the knife rand twitched suddenly and callandor dropped from his grip as if his hand somehow hurt from moridins attack the glow emanating from the blade winked out and the crystalline blade rang as it hit the ground perrin did not hold back in the fight with slayer he did not try to distinguish between wolf and man he finally let everything out every bit of rage at slayer every bit of pain at the deaths of his familypressures which had been growing inside him unnoticed for months he let it out light he let it out as he had on that terrible night when hed killed those whitecloaks ever since then hed clamped a firm grip on himself and his emotions just as master luhhan had said he could see it now in a frozen moment gentle perrin always afraid of hurting someone a blacksmith who had learned control he had rarely let himself strike with all of his strength this day he took the leash off the wolf it had never belonged there anyway the storm conformed to his rage perrin didnt try to keep it back why would he it matched his emotions perfectly the fall of his hammer was like claps of thunder the flashing of his eyes like lightning bolts wolves howled alongside the wind slayer tried to fight back he jumped he shifted he stabbed each time perrin was there jumping at him as a wolf swinging at him as a man buffeting him like the tempest itself slayer got a wild look in his eyes he raised a shield trying to put it between himself and perrin perrin attacked without thought now he became instinct only perrin roared smashing his hammer into that shield time and time again driving slayer before him beating the shield like a stubborn length of iron pounding away his anger his fury his last blow threw slayer back and flung the shield from the mans hands sending it spinning a hundred feet in the air slayer hit the valley floor and rolled gasping he came to rest in the middle of the battlefield shadowy figures rising all around him and dying as they fought in the real world he looked at perrin with panic then vanished perrin sent himself into the waking world to follow he appeared amid the battle aiel against trollocs in a furious fight the winds were surprisingly strong on this side and black clouds spun above shayol ghul which rose like a crooked finger into the sky the nearby aiel barely took time to notice him the bodies of trollocs and humans lay in heaps across the battlefield and the place stank of death the ground had once been dusty here but now it churned with mud made from the blood of the fallen slayer pushed through a group of aiel nearby growling slashing with his long knife he didnt look backand it didnt seem that he knew perrin had followed him into the real world a new wave of shadowspawn pushed in off the slope out of a silvery white mist their skin looked strange pocked with holes their eyes milky white perrin ignored these and barreled after slayer young bull wolves the shadowbrothers are here we fight darkhounds wolves hated all shadowspawn an entire pack would die pulling down a myrddraal but darkhounds they feared perrin looked around to spot the creatures ordinary men could not fight darkhounds whose mere saliva was death nearby the human forces broke before a tide of black wolves the size of horses the wild hunt light those darkhounds were enormous scores of the jet black corrupted wolves ripped through the defensive lines throwing tairen and domani soldiers about as if they were rag dolls wolves attacked the darkhounds but in vain they screamed and howled and died perrin raised his voice alongside their cries of death a ragged yell of rage for the moment he could not help his instincts and passions drove him slayer he had to defeat slayer if perrin did not stop slayer the man would shift to the world of dreams and kill rand perrin turned and ran through the fighting armies chasing after the distant figure ahead slayer had gained a lead by perrins distraction but the man had slowed a little he had not yet realized that perrin could leave the world of dreams ahead slayer stopped and inspected the battlefield he glanced back and saw perrinthen his eyes widened perrin couldnt hear his words over the din but could read slayers lips as he whispered no no it cant be yes perrin thought i can follow you now wherever you run this is a hunt you finally are the prey slayer vanished and perrin shifted into the wolf dream after him the people fighting around him became patterns in the dust exploding and reforming slayer yelled in fright at seeing him then shifted back into the waking world perrin did likewise he could smell slayers trail slick with sweat panicked to the dream then to the waking world again in the dream perrin ran on four legs as young bull in the waking world he was perrin hammer held aloft he shifted back and forth between the two as frequently as he blinked chasing slayer when he hit a patch of fighting bodies he would jump into the wolf dream and crash through the figures made of sand and blown dust then shift back into the waking world to keep on the trail the shifting started to happen so quickly he flickered between the two with each heartbeat thump perrin raised his hammer leaping off a small ridge after the scrambling form ahead thump young bull howled summoning the pack thump perrin was close now only a few steps behind slayers odor was pungent thump the spirits of wolves appeared around young bull howling their thirst for the hunt never had a prey deserved it more never had a prey done more damage to the packs never had a man been more feared thump slayer stumbled he twisted as he fell sending himself to the wolf dream by reflex thump perrin swung mahalleinir emblazoned with the leaping wolf he who soars thump young bull leaped for the throat of the killer of his brothers slayer fled the hammer connected something about this place this moment sent perrin and slayer into a spiraling series of flickers between worlds back and forth back and forth flashes of moments and thoughts flicker flicker flicker men died around them some of dust some of flesh their world alongside shadows of other worlds men in strange clothing and armor fighting beasts of all shapes and sizes moments where the aiel became seanchan who became something between the two with spears and light eyes but helmets shaped like monstrous insects in all of those moments in all of those places perrins hammer struck and young bulls fangs grabbed slayer by the neck he tasted the salty warmth of slayers blood in his mouth he felt the hammer vibrate as it hit and he heard bones crack the worlds flashed like bolts of lightning everything crashed shook then pulled together perrin stood on the rocks in the valley of thakandar and slayers body crumpled in front of him head crushed perrin panted the thrill of the hunt clinging to him it was over he turned surprised to find that he was surrounded by aiel he frowned at them what are you doing one of the maidens laughed you looked like you were running to a great dance perrin aybara one learns to watch for warriors like you on the battlefield and follow they often have the most fun he smiled grimly surveying the battlefield it was not going well for his side the darkhounds ripped apart the defenders in a ruthless frenzy the way up to rand was completely exposed who commands this battle perrin asked nobody now the maiden said he did not know her name rodel ituralde did first then darlin sisnera ledbut his command post fell to draghkar i have not seen any aes sedai or clan chiefs in hours her voice was grim even the stalwart aiel were flagging a quick scan of the battlefield showed perrin that the remaining aiel fought wherever they were often in small groups doing as much harm as they could before being cut down the wolves who had fought here in packs were broken their sendings those of pain and fear and perrin didnt know what those shadowspawn with the pocked faces meant the battle was finished and the side of light had lost the darkhounds broke through the line of dragonsworn nearby the last group who held falling before them a few tried to flee but one of the darkhounds leapt on them pushing several to the ground and gnawing one frothing saliva sprayed across the others and they dropped twitching perrin lowered his hammer then knelt pulling off slayers cloak and wrapping the cloth around his hands as he picked up his hammer again dont let their spittle touch your skin it is deadly the aiel nodded those with bare hands wrapping them they smelled of determination but also resignation aiel would run toward death if it was the only option and would laugh while doing so wetlanders thought them mad but perrin could smell the truth on them they were not mad they did not fear death but they did not welcome it touch me all of you perrin said the aiel did so he shifted them to the wolf dreamtaking so many was a strain like bending a bar of steelbut he managed it he immediately shifted them to the path up to the pit of doom the spirits of wolves had gathered here silent hundreds of them perrin brought the aiel back to the waking world his shift placing him and his small force between rand and the darkhounds the wild hunt looked up corrupted eyes shining like silver as they fixed on perrin we will hold here perrin said to his aiel and hope that some others aid us we will stand one of the aiel said a tall man wearing one of those headbands marked with rands symbol and if we do not another said and wake instead then we will at least water the earth with our blood and let our bodies nourish the plants that will now grow here perrin had barely noticed the plants growing incongruously green and vibrant in the valley small but strong a manifestation of the fact that rand still fought the darkhounds slunk toward them tails down ears back fangs exposed gleaming like bloodstained metal what was that he heard over the wind something very soft very distant it seemed so soft that he shouldnt have noticed it but it pierced through the clamor of war faintly familiar i know that sound perrin said sound the aiel maiden said what sound the calls of the wolves no perrin said as the darkhounds began to lope up the path the horn of valere the heroes would come but upon which battlefield would they fight perrin could expect no relief here except lead us young bull why must the heroes all be human a howl rose in the same pitch as that of the sounded horn he looked upon a field suddenly filled with a multitude of glowing wolves they were great pale beasts the size of darkhounds the spirits of those wolves who had died then gathered here waiting for the sign waiting for the chance to fight the horn had called them perrin let loose a yell of his own a howl of pleasure then charged forward to meet the darkhounds the last hunt had finally truly arrived mat left olver with the heroes again the boy looked like a prince riding in front of noal as they attacked the trollocs and prevented anyone from climbing that path to kill rand mat borrowed a horse from one of the defenders who still had one then galloped over to find perrin his friend would be among those wolves of course mat did not know how those hundreds of big glowing wolves had entered the battlefield but he was not going to complain they met the wild hunt headon snarling and savaging the darkhounds howls from both sides flooded mats ears he passed some aiel fighting a darkhound but the people did not stand a chance they tripped the beast hacking at it but it pulled back together as if it were made of darkness and not fleshthen ripped into them blood and bloody ashes those aiel weapons did not even seem to scratch it mat continued galloping avoiding the tendrils of silvery mist making their way across the whole valley light that mist was approaching the path up to rand it was picking up speed rolling over aiel trollocs and darkhounds alike there mat thought picking out a man fool enough to fight darkhounds perrin slammed his hammer down on a darkhounds head cracking it and forcing it into the ground when he raised his hammer it trailed smoke behind it the darkhound amazingly remained dead perrin turned then stared mat he called what are you doing here coming to help mat said against my bloody better judgment you cant fight darkhounds mat perrin said as mat rode up beside him i can and so can the last hunt he cocked his head then looked toward the sound of the horn no mat said i didnt sound it that bloody burden has passed to someone who actually seems to enjoy it its not that mat perrin stepped up reaching and taking him by the arm as he sat mounted my wife mat please she had the horn mat looked down feeling grim the lad said light perrin faile was at merrilor and led the trollocs away from olver so he could escape with the horn then she could still be alive perrin said yes of course she could mat said what else could he say perrin you need to know something else fain is here on this battlefield fain perrin growled where hes in that mist perrin hes brought mashadar somehow dont let it touch you i was in shadar logoth too mat perrin said i have a debt to settle with fain and i dont mat said i perrins eyes opened wide he stared at mats chest there a small white ribbon of silvery mistmashadars misthad speared mat from behind through the chest mat looked at it jerked once then tumbled off his horse chapter watching the flow writhe aviendha struggled on the slopes of the valley of thakandar trying to avoid the shield of spirit graendal was attempting to slip into place a weave like lace defying her attempts to reach for the one power her feet ruined she could not stand she lay in pain barely able to move she fought it off but barely the forsaken leaned against the rocks of the ledge as she had been doing for a short time muttering to herself her side bled bright red blood below them in the valley the battle raged a silvery white mist was rolling across the dead and some of the living aviendha tried to crawl toward her gateway that lay open still and through it she could see the valley floor something must have drawn cadsuane and the others awayeither that or aviendha had made the gateway to the wrong place the glow of saidar surrounded graendal again more weaves aviendha broke them but they delayed her progress toward the gateway graendal groaned then pulled herself upright she staggered in aviendhas direction though the woman looked dazed by her blood loss aviendha could do little to defend herself weak as she was from blood loss she was helpless except the cave for her gateway the one she had tied off it still hung there holding the portal open ribbons of lace carefully hesitant but desperate aviendha reached out mentally and pulled one of the threads loose in the gateway she could do it the flow shivered and vanished it was something the aiel did but something aes sedai thought terribly dangerous the results could be unpredictable an explosion a small shower of sparks aviendha could end up stilled or maybe nothing at all would happen when elayne had tried it it had caused a devastating explosion that would be fine with her if she brought down one of the forsaken alongside her that would be a wonderful death she had to try graendal stopped near aviendha and grumbled to herself eyes closed when the woman opened her eyes and began crafting another weave compulsion aviendha picked faster pulling two three half a dozen threads free of the gateway almost almost what are you doing graendal demanded aviendha picked faster and in her haste picked at the wrong thread she froze watching the flow writhe setting off the others near it graendal hissed and began to set the compulsion on aviendha the gateway exploded in a flash of light and heat shaisam seized the battlefield his mist shoving through those wolves and men who thought to bar his way to althor yes althor the one he would kill destroy feast upon yes althor something trembled at one edge of his senses shaisam hesitated frowning to himself what was wrong there a piece of him a piece of him had stopped sensing what was this he ran his physical form across the ground through the mist blood trailed from his fingers flayed by the dagger he carried the wonderful seed the last bit of his old self he came upon a corpse one that his mists had killed shaisam frowned bending down that body looked familiar the corpses hand reached up and grabbed shaisam by the throat he gasped thrashing as the corpse opened its eye theres an odd thing about diseases i once heard fain matrim cauthon whispered once you catch a disease and survive you cant get it again shaisam thrashed panicked no no this was not how a meeting with an old friend should go he clawed at the hand holding him then realized with horror that hed dropped the dagger cauthon pulled him down slamming him to the ground shaisam called for his drones too late too slow ive come to give you your gift back mordeth cauthon whispered i consider our debt paid in full cauthon rammed the dagger right between the ribs into shaisams heart tied to this pitiful mortal form mordeth screamed padan fain howled and felt his flesh melting from his bones the mists trembled began to swirl and shake together they died perrin shifted to the wolf dream and found gaul by tracing the scent of blood he had hated to leave mat with mashadar but was confidentfrom a look mat had given him after fallingthat his friend could survive the mist and knew what he was doing gaul had hidden himself well pushed up into a split in the rock just outside the pit of doom gaul still carried one spear and had darkened his clothing to match the rocks around him he was nodding off when perrin found him gaul was not only wounded but had been in the wolf dream far too long if perrin felt an aching exhaustion it must be worse for gaul come gaul perrin said helping him out of the rocks gaul looked dazed nobody passed me by he mumbled i watched perrin aybara the caracarn is safe you did well my friend perrin replied better than anyone could have expected you have much honor gaul smiled as he leaned on perrins shoulder i worried when the wolves vanished i worried they fight on in the waking world perrin felt a need to return here finding gaul had been part of that but there was something else a drive he couldnt explain hold on perrin said grabbing gaul about the waist he shifted them to the field of merrilor then shifted them out of the wolf dream and appeared in the center of the two rivers camp people immediately locked on perrin yells rising light perrin a man said nearby grady rushed up deep bags beneath his eyes i nearly burned you to char lord goldeneyes how did you appear like that perrin shook his head setting gaul down grady eyed the wound in the mans side then called for one of the aes sedai to handle the healing they bustled aroundsome of the two rivers men calling out that lord goldeneyes had returned faile faile had been here at merrilor with the horn i have to find her rand was alone unguarded in the wolf dream burn it that doesnt matter perrin thought if i lose faile if rand died he would lose faile and everything else there were still forsaken out there perrin wavered he had to go look for her didnt he wasnt that his duty as her husband couldnt someone else look after rand but if not him then who though it ripped him apart perrin sought the wolf dream one last time moridin scooped callandor up off the floor it burst alight with the one power rand stumbled away holding his aching hand to his chest moridin laughed raising the weapon high you are mine lews therin you are finally mine i he trailed off then looked up at the sword perhaps in awe it can amplify the true power a true power saangreal how why he laughed louder a maelstrom churned about them channeling the true power is death here elan rand yelled it will burn you to a cinder it is oblivion moridin yelled i will know that release lews therin i will take you with me the swords glow turned a violent crimson rand could feel the power emanating from moridin as he drew in the true power this was the most dangerous part of the plan min had figured it out callandor had such flaws such incredible flaws created so that a man using it needed women to control him created so that if rand used it others could take control of him why was rand to need a weapon with such flaws why did the prophecies mention it so a saangreal for the true power why would he ever need such a thing the answer was so simple now rand yelled nynaeve and moiraine channeled together exploiting the flaw in callandor as moridin tried to bring it to bear against rand wind whipped in the tunnel the ground quivered and moridin yelled eyes going wide they took control of him callandor was flawed any man using it could be forced to link with women to be placed in their control a trap and one he used on moridin link rand commanded they fed it to him power saidar from the women the true power from moridin saidin from rand moridins channeling the true power here threatened to destroy them all but they buffered it with saidin and saidar then directed all three at the dark one rand punched through the blackness there and created a conduit of light and darkness turning the dark ones own essence upon him rand felt the dark one beyond his immensity space size time rand understood how these things could be irrelevant now with a bellowthree powers coursing through him blood streaming down his sidethe dragon reborn raised a hand of power and seized the dark one through the bore like a man reaching through water to grab the prize at the rivers bottom the dark one tried to pull back but rands claw was gloved by the true power the enemy could not taint saidin again the dark one tried to withdraw the true power from moridin but the conduit flowed too freely too powerfully to shut off now even for shaitan himself so it was that rand used the dark ones own essence channeled in its full strength he held the dark one tightly like a dove in the grip of a hawk and light exploded from him chapter a brilliant lance elayne trotted her horse among heaps of dead trollocs the day was won she had everyone who could stand searching for the living among the dead so many dead hundreds of thousands of men and trollocs lying in piles all across merrilor the rivers banks were slaughterhouses the bogs mass graves floating with corpses ahead of her across the river the heights groaned and rumbled shed pulled her people away from there she could barely sit on her horse the entire plateau collapsed upon itself burying the dead elayne watched feeling numb feeling the ground shake it light she sat up straight feeling the swelling of power in rand her attention flew away from the heights instead focused on him the feeling of supreme strength the beauty of control and domination a light shot into the sky far to the north so bright that she gasped the end had come thom stumbled back from the entrance to the pit of doom shading his eyes with his arm as lightradiant as the sun itselfburst out of the cavern moiraine light thom whispered light it was breaking out of the top of the mountain of shayol ghul a radiant beam that melted the mountains tip and shot straight into the sky min raised her hand to her breast stepping away from the rows of wounded for whom shed been changing linens rand she thought feeling his agonized determination far to the north a beam of light rose into the air so bright that it lit the field of merrilor even such a great distance away the helpers and the wounded alike blinked stumbling to their feet shading their faces that light a brilliant lance in the heavens burned away the clouds and opened up the sky aviendha blinked at the light and knew it was rand it drew her back from the brink of darkness flooding her with warmth he was winning he was winning he was so strong she saw the true warrior in him now nearby graendal stumbled to her knees eyes glazed over the unraveling gateway had exploded but not with as large a blast as last time weaves and the one power had sprayed out just as graendal tried to spin compulsion the forsaken turned to aviendha and she adopted an adoring gaze she bowed down as if worshipping aviendha the explosion aviendha realized numb it had done something to the compulsion weave honestly she had expected that blast to kill her it had done something else instead please glorious one graendal said tell me what you wish of me let me serve you aviendha looked back to the light that was rand and held her breath logain stepped from the ruins holding a toddlermaybe two years of agein his arms the childs weeping mother took her son from his hands thank you bless you ashaman light bless you logain stumbled to a halt amid the people the air stank of burned flesh and dead trollocs the heights are gone he asked gone androl said reluctantly from beside him the earthquakes took them logain sighed the prize was it lost then would he ever be able to dig it out i am a fool he thought he had abandoned that power for what to save these refugees people who would spurn him and hate him for what he was people who who looked at him with awe logain frowned these were common people not like folk from the black tower who were accustomed to men who could channel in that moment he wouldnt have been able to tell the difference logain watched with wonder as the people flocked around his ashaman weeping for their salvation elderly men took ashaman by the hands overcome praising them nearby a youth looked at logain with admiration a dozen youths light a hundred not a hint of fear in their eyes thank you the young mother said again thank you the black tower protects logain heard himself say always i will send him to you to be tested when he is of age the woman promised holding her son i would have him join you if he has the talent the talent not the curse the talent light bathed them he stopped that beam of light to the north channeling like none hed ever felt before not even at the cleansing such power its happening gabrelle said stepping up to him logain reached to his belt then took three items from his pouch discs half white half black the nearby ashaman turned toward him pausing in healing and comforting the people do it gabrelle said do it sealbreaker logain snapped the once unbreakable seals one by one and dropped the pieces to the ground chapter light and shadow everything was dead in the wolf dream perrin stumbled across a rocky wasteland without plants or soil the sky had gone black the dark clouds themselves vanishing into that nothingness as he climbed atop a ridge an entire section of the ground behind him crumbled his stone footing shaking violentlyand was pulled into the air beneath that was only emptiness in the wolf dream all was being consumed perrin continued forward toward shayol ghul he could see it like a beacon glowing with light strangely behind he could make out dragonmount though it should have been far too distant to see as the land between them crumbled the world seemed to be shrinking the two peaks pulling toward one another all between shattered and broken perrin shifted to the front of the tunnel into the pit of doom then stepped in passing the violet barrier hed erected earlier lanfear lounged inside her hair was jet black as it had been when hed first met her and her face was familiar it looked as it once had i find that dreamspike annoying she said did you have to place it here it keeps the other forsaken away perrin said absently i suppose it does that she said folding her arms he is still ahead perrin asked it is the end she said nodding something amazing just happened she narrowed her eyes this might be the most important moment for humankind since we opened the bore lets make sure nothing goes wrong then perrin said walking forward down the long maw of stone lanfear at his side at the end of the tunnel they found an unexpected scene someone else was holding callandor the man that rand had been fighting earlier maybe that was demandred perrin did not know he was certainly one of the forsaken that man knelt on the floor with nynaeves hand on his shoulder she stood just behind rand and to the left moiraine was on rands right all three of them standing tall with eyes forward staring into the nothingness ahead the mountain rumbled perfect lanfear whispered i couldnt have dreamed that it could come out this well she eyed the two women we will need to strike quickly i will kill the taller woman you the shorter one perrin frowned something about that seemed very wrong kill of course lanfear said if we strike quickly there will still be time to seize control of moridin while he holds that blade with that i can force lews therin to bow she narrowed her eyes he holds the dark one between his fingers needing only one squeeze to pinch the lifeif it can be called thataway only one hand can save the great lord in this moment i earn my reward in this moment i become highest of the high you you want to save the dark one perrin said raising a hand to his head you joined us i remember she glanced at him such an inferior tool she said smelling dissatisfied i hate having to use it this makes me no better than graendal she shivered if they had given me more time i would have had you fairly she patted perrin fondly on the cheek you are troubled the taller one is from your village i remember you grew up together i presume i wont make you kill her my wolf you can kill the short one you hate her dont you i yes i do she stole me away from my family its because of her that they died really i would have been there otherwise thats right lanfear said we must be quick our moment of opportunity will not last long she turned toward the two women nynaeve and moiraine his friends and then and then rand she would kill him perrin knew she would force him to bow and then she would kill him all along her goal had been to put herself into a position where the dark one himself would be helpless and she could step in to bring him salvation perrin came up beside her we strike together lanfear said softly the barriers between worlds have been broken here they will be able to fight back unless we are quick we must kill them at the same time this is wrong perrin thought this is very very wrong he couldnt let it happen and yet his hands rose it is wrong he didnt know why his thoughts wouldnt allow him to think of why ready lanfear said eyes on nynaeve perrin turned toward lanfear i will count to three lanfear said not looking at him my duty perrin thought is to do the things rand cannot this was the wolf dream in the wolf dream what he felt became reality one lanfear said he loved faile two he loved faile three he loved faile the compulsion vanished like smoke in the wind thrown off like clothing changed in the blink of an eye before lanfear could strike perrin reached out and took her by the neck he twisted once her neck popped in his fingers lanfear crumpled and perrin caught her body she was beautiful as she died she changed back to the other form she had been wearing before her new body perrin felt a horrible stab of loss he hadnt completely wiped what shed done from his mind hed overcome it perhaps overlaid it with something new something right only the wolf dream and his ability to view himself as he should be had allowed him to accomplish that unfortunately deep within he still felt love for this woman that sickened him the love was nowhere near as strong as his love for faile but it was there he found himself crying as he lowered her body draped in sleek white and silver to the stone floor im sorry he whispered killing a woman particularly one who wasnt threatening him personally it was something hed never have thought himself capable of someone had needed to do it this was one test at least that rand would not need to face it was one burden that perrin could carry for his friend he looked up toward rand go perrin whispered do what you must do as always i will watch your back the seals crumbled the dark one burst free rand held the dark one tightly filled with the power standing in a column of light rand pulled the dark one into the pattern only here was there time only here could the shadow itself be killed the force in his hand which was at once vast and yet tiny trembled its screams were the sounds of planets grinding together a pitiful object suddenly rand felt as if he were holding not one of the primal forces of existence but a squirming thing from the mud of the sheep pens you really are nothing rand said knowing the dark ones secrets completely you would never have given me rest as you promised father of lies you would have enslaved me as you would have enslaved the others you cannot give oblivion rest is not yours only torment the dark one trembled in his grip you horrible pitiful mite rand said rand was dying his lifeblood flowed from him and beyond that the amount of the powers he held would soon burn him away he held the dark one in his hand he began to squeeze then stopped he knew all secrets he could see what the dark one had done and light rand understood much of what the dark one had shown him was lies but the vision rand himself had createdthe one without the dark onewas truth if he did as he wished he would leave men no better than the dark one himself what a fool i have been rand yelled thrusting the dark one back through the pit from where it had come rand pushed his arms to the side grabbing twin pillars of saidar and saidin with his mind coated with the true power drawn through moridin who knelt on the floor eyes open so much power coursing through him he couldnt even move rand hurled the powers forward with his mind and braided them together saidin and saidar at once the true power surrounding them and forming a shield on the bore he wove something majestic a pattern of interlaced saidar and saidin in their pure forms not fire not spirit not water not earth not air purity light itself this didnt repair it didnt patch it forged anew with this new form of the power rand pulled together the rent that had been made here long ago by foolish men he understood finally that the dark one was not the enemy it never had been moiraine grabbed nynaeve beside her moving only by touch for that light was blinding she pulled nynaeve to her feet together they ran away from the burning light behind up the corridor scrambling moiraine burst into open air without realizing it and almost ran off the edge of the path which would have sent her stumbling down the steep slope someone caught her i have you thoms voice said as she collapsed into his arms completely drained nynaeve fell to the ground nearby gasping thom turned moiraine away from the corridor but she refused to look away she opened her eyes though she knew that the light was too intense and she saw something rand and moridin standing in the light as it expanded outward to consume the entire mountain in its glow the blackness in front of rand hung like a hole sucking in everything slowly bit by bit that hole shrank away until it was just a pinprick it vanished epilogue to see the answer rand slipped on his blood he couldnt see he carried something something heavy a body he stumbled up the tunnel closing he thought its closing the ceiling lowered like a shutting jaw stone grinding against stone with a gasp rand reached open air as the rocks slammed down behind him locking together like clenched teeth rand tripped the body in his arms was so heavy he slipped to the ground he could see just faintly a figure kneeling down beside him yes a woman whispered he did not recognize the voice yes thats good that is what you need to do he blinked his vision fuzzy was that aiel clothing an old woman with gray hair her form retreated and rand reached toward her not wanting to be alone wanting to explain himself i see the answer now he whispered i asked the aelfinn the wrong question to choose is our fate if you have no choice then you arent a man at all youre a puppet shouting rand felt heavy he plunged into unconsciousness mat stood up as the mist of mashadar burned away from him and vanished the field was littered with the bodies of those eerie pockmarked trollocs he looked upward through the vanishing wisps and found the sun directly overhead well youre a sight he said to it you should come out more often you have a pretty face he smiled then looked down at the dead man by his feet padan fain looked like a bundle of sticks and moss the flesh slipping from his bones the blackness of the dagger had spread across his rotting skin it stank almost mat reached for that dagger then he spat for once he said a gamble i dont want to touch he turned his back on it and walked off three steps away he found his hat he grinned snatched it up and set it on his head then began whistling as he rested the ashandarei on his shoulder and strolled away the dice had stopped rolling in mats head behind the dagger ruby and all melted away into the mess that had been padan fain perrin walked wearily into the camp they had set up at the base of shayol ghul after the fighting had ceased he dropped his coat the air felt good on his bare chest he tucked mahalleinir away in its place at his belt a good smith never neglected his tools for all that sometimes carrying them felt as if they would bear him down to the grave itself he thought that he could sleep a hundred days straight but not yet not yet faile no deep down he knew he had to face something horrible about her but not yet for the moment he shoved that worrythat terroraway the last spirits of the wolves faded back into the wolf dream farewell young bull find what you seek young bull the hunt ends but we will hunt again young bull perrin plodded among rows of wounded men and aiel celebrating the defeat of the shadowspawn some tents were filled with moans others with yells of victory people of all stripes ran through the nowblooming valley of thakandar some hunting for the wounded others crying in joy and whooping as they met with friends who had survived the last dark moments aiel called to perrin ho blacksmith join us but he did not enter their celebrations he looked for the guards someone around here had to be levelheaded enough to worry about a rogue myrddraal or draghkar taking the opportunity to try for a little revenge sure enough he found a ring of defenders at the center of camp guarding a large tent what of rand no colors swirled in his vision no image of rand perrin felt no more tugging pulling him in any direction those seemed like very bad signs he pushed through the guards numb and entered the tent where had they found a tent this large on this battlefield everything had been trampled blown away or burned the inside smelled of herbs and was partitioned with several hanging cloths ive tried everything a voice whispered damer flinns voice nothing changes what is happening he perrin pushed in on nynaeve and flinn standing beside a pallet behind one of the partitions rand cleaned and dressed lay there eyes closed moiraine knelt beside him her hand on his face whispering so softly none but he could hear you did well rand you did well he lives perrin asked wiping the sweat from his face with his hand perrin nynaeve said oh light you look horrible sit down you lummox youre going to fall over i dont want two of you to tend her eyes were red hes dying anyway isnt he perrin asked you got him out alive but hes still going to die sit nynaeve commanded pointing to a stool dogs obey that command nynaeve perrin said not wolves he knelt down resting a hand on rands shoulder i couldnt feel your tugging or see the visions perrin thought youre no longer taveren i suspect neither am i have you sent for the three perrin asked min elayne aviendha they need to visit him a last time thats all you can say nynaeve snapped he looked up at her the way she folded her arms made her look as if she were holding herself together wrapping her arms about herself to stop from crying who else died perrin asked bracing himself it was obvious from her expression she had lost one already egwene perrin closed his eyes breathing out egwene light no masterwork comes without a price he thought that doesnt mean its not worth forging still egwene its not your fault nynaeve he said opening his eyes of course its not i know its not you numbbrained fool she turned away he stood up embracing her and patting her back with his smiths hands im sorry i left to save you nynaeve whispered i only came along to protect you you did nynaeve you protected rand so he could do what he had to do she shook and he let her weep light he shed a few tears himself nynaeve pulled away sharply after a moment then barreled out of the tent i tried flinn said desperately looking at rand nynaeve did too together we tried with moiraine sedais angreal nothing worked nobody knows how to save him you did what you could perrin said peeking around the next partition another man lay on the pallet there what is he doing here we found them together flinn said rand must have carried him out of the pit we dont know why the lord dragon would save one of the forsaken but it doesnt matter we cant heal him either theyre dying both of them send for min elayne and aviendha perrin said again he hesitated did they all survive the aiel girl took a beating flinn said she came stumbling into camp halfcarried by a horridlooking aes sedai who had made a gateway for her shell live though i dont know how well shell walk in years to come let them know all of them flinn nodded and perrin stepped out after nynaeve he found what hed hoped to see the reason why shed left so quickly just outside the tent lan held her tightly the man looked as bloodied and tired as perrin felt their eyes met and they nodded to one another several of the windfinders have opened a gateway between here and merrilor lan said to perrin the dark one is sealed away again the blasted lands are blooming and gateways can open here again thank you perrin said passing him by has anyone heard anything about faile no blacksmith the hornsounder saw her last but she left him and entered the battlefield to draw the trollocs away from him im sorry perrin nodded hed already spoken with mat and olver it seemed to him that that hed been avoiding thinking about what must have happened dont think about it he told himself dont you dare he steeled himself then went to seek the gateway lan had mentioned excuse me loial asked the maidens sitting beside the tent have you seen matrim cauthon oosquai one of them asked laughing holding up the skin no no loial said i have to find matrim cauthon and get his account of the battle you see while its fresh i need everyone to tell me what they saw and heard so that i can write it down there will never be a better time and he admitted to himself he wanted to see mat and perrin see that they were all right so much had happened he wanted to talk to his friends and make certain they were well with what was happening to rand the aiel woman smiled at him drunkenly loial sighed then continued through the camp the day was coming to an end the day of the last battle it was the fourth age now wasnt it could an age start in the middle of a day that would be inconvenient for the calendars wouldnt it but everyone agreed rand had sealed the bore at noon loial continued through the camp they hadnt moved from the base of shayol ghul nynaeve said she was too worried to move rand loial kept searching peeking into tents in the next he found the grizzled general ituralde surrounded by four aes sedai look ituralde said ive served the kings of arad doman all of my life i swore oaths alsalam is dead saerin sedai said from beside the chair someone has to take the throne there is confusion in saldaea elswell sedai added the succession is messy with the ties it has to andor now arad doman cannot afford to be leaderless you must take the throne rodel ituralde you must do it quickly the merchant council all dead or vanished another aes sedai said i swore oaths and what would your king have you do yukiri sedai asked let the kingdom disintegrate you must be strong lord ituralde this is not a time for arad doman to be without a leader loial slipped away and shook his head feeling sorry for the man four aes sedai ituralde would be crowned before the day was out loial stopped by the main healing tent again to check if anyone had seen mat he had been to this battlefield and people said he was smiling and healthy but well loial wanted to see for himself wanted to talk to him inside the tent loial had to slouch lest he brush his head on the ceiling a large tent for humans was small by ogier standards he peeked in on rand his friend looked worse than before lan stood by the wall he wore a crownit was just a simple silver bandwhere the hadori used to rest that wasnt odd but the matching one nynaeve wore did give loial a start its not fair nynaeve whispered why should he die when the other one gets better nynaeve seemed troubled she still had red eyes but before she had chivvied anyone who mentioned them so loial said nothing humans often seemed to want him to say nothing which was odd for people who lived lives so hastily she looked at loial and he bowed his head to her loial she said how goes your search not well he said with a grimace perrin ignored me and mat cannot be found your stories can wait a few days builder lan said loial did not argue lan was a king now after all but no the stories could not wait they had to be fresh so his history could be accurate its terrible flinn said still looking at rand but nynaeve sedai its so strange none of the three seem to care at all shouldnt they be more worried loial left them though he did check in on aviendha in a nearby tent she sat while several women attended to her twisted bleeding feet she had lost several of her toes she nodded her head to loial the healings done so far had apparently taken away her pain for though she seemed tired she did not seem in agony mat he asked hopefully i have not seen him loial son of arent son of halan aviendha replied at least not since you asked a short time ago loial blushed then left her he passed elayne and min outside he would get their storieshe had already asked a few questionsbut the three taveren they were most important why were humans always bustling around so quickly never sitting still never any time to think this was an important day it was odd though min and elayne shouldnt they be at rands side elayne seemed to be taking reports on casualties and refugee supplies and min sat looking up at shayol ghul a faroff expression in her eyes neither went in to hold rands hand as he slipped toward death well loial thought maybe mat sneaked by me and went back to merrilor never staying put these men always so hasty matrim cauthon sauntered into the seanchan camp on the south side of merrilor away from the piles of the dead all around seanchan men and women gasped hands to their mouths he tipped his hat to them the prince of the ravens hushed tones moved through camp ahead of him passing from mouth to mouth like the last bottle of brandy on a cold night he walked right up to tuon who stood at a large map table at the camp center talking to selucia karede mat noticed had survived the man probably felt guilty about it tuon looked at mat and frowned where have you been mat raised his arm and tuon frowned looking upward at nothing mat spun and thrust his hand farther toward the sky nightflowers began to explode high above the camp mat grinned aludra had taken a little convincing but only a little she did so like to make things explode it was not truly dusk yet but the show was still grand aludra now had half of the dragoners trained to build fireworks and handle her powders she seemed far less secretive than she once had the sounds of the display washed over them fireworks tuon said the best bloody firework show in the history of my land or yours mat said tuon frowned the explosions reflected in her dark eyes im with child she said the doomseer has confirmed it mat felt a jolt as sure as if a firework had gone off inside of his stomach an heir a son no doubt what odds that it was a boy mat forced a grin well i guess im off the hook now you have an heir i have an heir tuon said but i am the one off that hook now i can kill you if i want mat felt his grin widen well well have to see what we can work out tell me do you ever play dice perrin sat down among the dead and finally started weeping gaishain in white and city women picked through the dead there was no sign of faile none at all i cant keep going how long had it been since hed slept that one night in mayene his body complained that it hadnt been nearly enough hed pushed himself long before that spending the equivalent of weeks in the wolf dream lord and lady bashere were dead faile would have been queen if shed lived perrin shook and trembled and he could not make himself move any more there were hundreds of thousands of dead on this battlefield the other searchers ignored a body if it had no life marking it and moving on he had tried to spread the word for them to seek faile but the searchers had to look for the living fireworks exploded in the darkening sky perrin buried his head in his hands then felt himself slide sideways and collapse among the corpses moghedien winced at the display in the sky each explosion made her see that deadly fire again tearing through the sharans that flare of light that moment of panic and then and then darkness shed awakened some time later left for dead among the bodies of sharans when shed come to she had found these fools all across the battlefield claiming to have won the day claiming she thought wincing again as another round of fireworks sounded the great lord has fallen all was lost no no she continued forward keeping her step firm unsuspicious she had strangled a worker then taken her form channeling only a tiny bit and inverting the weave that should let her escape from this place she wove around bodies ignoring the stink to the air all was not lost she still lived and she was of the chosen that meant that meant that she was an empress among her lessers why the great lord was imprisoned again so he could not punish her and certainly most if not all of the other chosen were dead or imprisoned if that were true no one could rival her in knowledge this might actually work out this might be a victory she stopped beside an overturned supply cart clutching her coursouvrait was still whole thankfully she smiled with a wide grin then wove a small light to illuminate her way yes look at the open sky not the thunderclouds she could turn this to her advantage why in the matter of a few years she could be ruling the world herself something cold snapped around her neck moghedien reached up with horror then screamed no not again her disguise melted away and the one power left her a smuglooking suldam stood behind they said we could not take any who called themselves aes sedai but you you do not wear one of their rings and you skulk like one who has done something wrong i do not think you will be missed at all free me moghedien said scratching at the adam free me you pain sent her to the ground writhing i am called shanan the suldam said as another woman approached a damane in tow but you may call me mistress i think that we should return to ebou dar quickly her companion nodded and the damane made a gateway they had to drag moghedien through nynaeve emerged from the healing tent at shayol ghul the sun was almost below the horizon hes dead she whispered to the small crowd gathered outside saying the words felt like dropping a brick onto her own feet she did not cry she had shed those tears already that did not mean that she didnt hurt lan came out of the tent behind her putting an arm around her shoulders she raised her hand to his nearby min and elayne looked at one another gregorin whispered to darlinhe had been found half dead in the wreckage of his tent both of them frowned at the women nynaeve overheard part of what gregorin said expected the aiel savage to be heartless and maybe the queen of andor but the other one not a tear theyre shocked darlin replied no nynaeve thought studying min and elayne those three know something i do not ill have to beat it out of them excuse me nynaeve said walking away from lan he followed she raised an eyebrow at him you shall not be rid of me in the next few weeks nynaeve he said love pulsing through his bond even if you want it stubborn ox she grumbled as i recall you are the one who insisted on leaving me so that you could march alone toward your presumed destiny and you were right about that lan said as you so often are he said it so calmly that it was hard to be mad at him besides it was the women she was mad at she chose aviendha first and stalked up to her lan by her side with rhuarc dead aviendha was saying to sorilea and bair i think that whatever i saw must be able to change it has already i saw your vision aviendha bair said or something like it through different eyes i think it is a warning of something we must not let happen the other two nodded then glanced at nynaeve and grew as stillfaced as aes sedai aviendha was just as bad as the others completely calm as she sat in her chair her feet wrapped in bandages she might walk again someday but she would never fight nynaeve almeara aviendha said did you hear me say that rand is dead nynaeve demanded he went silently he that was wounded has woken from the dream aviendha said evenly it is as all must do his death was accomplished in greatness and he will be celebrated in greatness nynaeve leaned down all right she said menacingly embracing the source out with it i chose you because you cant run away from me aviendha displayed a moment of what might have been fear it was gone in a flash let us prepare his pyre perrin ran in the wolf dream alone other wolves howled their sorrow for his grief after he passed them they would return to their celebrations but that did not make their empathy any less real he did not howl he did not cry out he became young bull and he ran he did not want to be here he wanted slumber true slumber there he could not feel the pain here he could i shouldnt have left her a thought of men why did it creep in but what could i do i promised not to treat her like glass run run fast run until exhaustion came i had to go to rand i had to but in doing so i failed her to the two rivers in a flash back out along the river the waste then back a long run toward falme how could i be expected to hold them both then let one go to tear then to the two rivers a blur growling moving as quickly as he could here here he had wed her here he howled caemlyn cairhien dumais wells here he saved one of them cairhien ghealdan malden here he had saved another two forces in his life each had pulled at him young bull finally collapsed near some hills somewhere in andor a familiar place the place where i met elyas he became perrin again his thoughts were not wolf thoughts his troubles not wolf troubles he stared up at the sky that was now after rands sacrifice empty of clouds he had wanted to be with his friend as he died this time he would be with faile where she had died he wanted to scream but it would do no good i have to let go dont i he whispered toward that sky light i dont want to i learned i learned from malden i didnt do it again i did what i was supposed to this time somewhere nearby a bird cried in the sky wolves howled hunting i learned a birds cry it sounded like a falcon perrin threw himself to his feet spinning there he vanished in an instant appearing on an open field he did not recognize no he knew this field he knew it this was merrilor only without the blood without the grass churned to mud without the land blasted and broken here he found a tiny falconas small as his handcrying softly with a broken leg pinned beneath a rock its heartbeat was faint perrin roared as he woke clawing his way out of the wolf dream he stood up on the field of bodies shouting into the night sky searchers nearby scattered in fear where in the darkness could he find the same place he ran stumbling over corpses through pits made by channelers or dragons he stopped looking one way then another where where flowery soap a hint of perfume in the air perrin dashed toward it throwing his weight against the corpse of an enormous trolloc lying almost chesthigh atop other bodies beneath it he found the carcass of a horse unable to truly consider what he was doing or of the strength it should have required perrin pulled the horse aside beneath faile lay bloodied in a small hollow in the ground breathing shallowly perrin cried out and dropped to his knees cradling her in his arms breathing in her scent it took him only two heartbeats to shift into the wolf dream carry faile to nynaeve far to the north and shift out seconds later he felt her being healed in his arms unwilling to let go of her even for that faile his falcon trembled and stirred then she opened her eyes and smiled at him the other heroes were gone birgitte remained as evening approached nearby soldiers prepared rand althors pyre birgitte could not stay much longer but for now yes she could stay a short time the pattern would allow it elayne birgitte said do you know something about the dragon elayne shrugged in the waning light the two stood at the back of the crowd gathering to watch the dragon reborns pyre be lit i know what youre planning birgitte said to elayne with the horn and what am i planning to keep it birgitte said and the boy to have it as an andoran treasure perhaps a nations weapon perhaps birgitte smiled its a good thing i sent him away then elayne turned to her ignoring those preparing rands pyre what i sent olver away birgitte said with guards i trust i told olver to find someplace nobody would look a place he could forget and toss the horn into it preferably the ocean elayne exhaled softly then turned back toward the pyre insufferable woman she hesitated thank you for saving me from having to make that decision i thought youd feel that way actually birgitte had assumed it would take a long time before elayne understood but elayne had grown in the last few weeks anyway i must be far from insufferable since youve done an excellent job of suffering me these last months elayne turned to her again that sounds like a farewell birgitte smiled she could feel it sometimes when it was coming it is elayne looked sorrowful must it be im being reborn elayne birgitte whispered now somewhere a woman is preparing to give birth and i will go to that body its happening i dont want to lose you birgitte chuckled well perhaps we will meet again for now be happy for me elayne this means the cycle continues i get to be with him again gaidai ill be only a few years younger than he elayne took her arm eyes watering love and peace birgitte thank you birgitte smiled then closed her eyes and let herself drift away as evening settled onto the land tam looked up across what had once been the most feared place of all shayol ghul the last flickers of light showed plants growing here flowers blooming grass growing up around fallen weapons and over corpses is this your gift to us son he wondered a final one tam lit his torch from the small flickering flame that crackled in the pit nearby he went forward passing lines of those who stood in the night they had not told many of rands funeral rites all would have wanted to come perhaps all deserved to come the aes sedai were planning an elaborate memorial for egwene tam preferred a quiet affair for his son rand could finally rest he walked past people standing with heads bowed none carried light save tam the others waited in the dark a small crowd of perhaps two hundred encircling the bier tams torch flickered orange off solemn faces in the evening even with his light it was hard to tell aiel from aes sedai two rivers man from tairen king all were shapes in the night saluting the body of the dragon reborn tam went up to the bier beside thom and moiraine who were holding hands faces solemn moiraine reached over and gently squeezed tams arm tam looked at the corpse gazing down into his sons face by the fires light he did not wipe the tears from his eyes you did well my boy you did so well he lit the pyre with a reverent hand min stood at the front of the crowd she watched tam with slumped shoulders bow his head before the flames eventually the man walked back to join the two rivers folk abell cauthon embraced him whispering softly to his friend heads in the night shadows turned toward min aviendha and elayne they expected something from the three of them a show of some sort solemnly min stepped forward with the other two aviendha needed the help of two maidens to walk though she was able to stand by leaning on elayne the maidens withdrew to leave the three of them alone before the pyre elayne and min stood with her watching the fire burn consuming rands corpse ive seen this min said i knew it would come the day i first met him we three together here elayne nodded so now what now aviendha said now we make sure that everyone well and truly believes he is gone min nodded feeling the pulsing throb of the bond in the back of her mind it grew stronger each moment rand althorjust rand althorwoke in a dark tent by himself someone had left a candle burning beside his pallet he breathed deeply stretching he felt as if hed just slept long and deep shouldnt he be hurting stiff aching he felt none of that he reached to his side and felt no wounds there no wounds for the first time in a long while there was no pain he almost didnt know what to make of it then he looked down and saw that the hand prodding his side was his own left hand he laughed holding it up before him a mirror he thought i need a mirror he found one beyond the next partition of the tent apparently hed been left completely alone he held up the candle looking into the small mirror moridins face looked back at him rand touched his face feeling it in his right eye hung a single saa black shaped like the dragons fang it didnt move rand slipped back into the portion of the tent where hed awakened lamans sword was there sitting atop a neat pile of mixed clothing alivia apparently hadnt known what he would want to wear she had been the one to leave these things of course along with a bag of coins from a variety of nations she hadnt ever cared much for either clothing or coin but she had known hed need both she will help you die rand shook his head dressing and gathering the coins and the sword then slipping out of the tent someone had left a good horse a dappled gelding tied not far away that would do him well from dragon reborn to horsethief he chuckled to himself bareback would have to do he hesitated nearby in the darkness people were singing this was shayol ghul but not as he remembered it a blooming shayol ghul full of life the song they sang was a borderlander funeral song rand led the horse through the night to get a little closer he peered between the tents to where three women stood around a funeral pyre moridin he thought hes being cremated with full honors as the dragon reborn rand backed away then mounted the dapple as he did so he noticed one figure who was not standing by the fire a solitary figure who looked toward him when all other eyes were turned away cadsuane she looked him up and down eyes reflecting firelight from the glow of rands pyre rand nodded waited for a moment then turned the horse and heeled it away cadsuane watched him go curious she thought those eyes had confirmed her suspicions that would be information she could use no need to keep watching this sham of a funeral then she walked away through the camp and there strolled directly into an ambush saerin she said as the women fell in around her yukiri lyrelle rubinde what is this we would like direction rubinde said direction cadsuane snorted ask the new amyrlin once you find some poor woman to put into the position the other women continued to walk with her as it hit her cadsuane stopped in place oh blood and ashes no cadsuane said spinning on them no no no the women smiled in an almost predatory way you always talked so wisely to the dragon reborn of responsibility yukiri said you speak of how the women of this age need better training saerin added it is a new age lyrelle said we have many challenges ahead of us and we will need a strong amyrlin to lead us cadsuane closed her eyes groaning rand breathed a sigh of relief as he left cadsuane behind she did not raise an alarm though she had continued to study him as he put distance between them glancing over his shoulder he noticed her walking off with some other aes sedai she worried him she probably suspected something he wished she did not it was better than her raising an alarm though he sighed fishing in his pocket where he found a pipe thank you alivia for that he thought packing it with tabac from a pouch he found in the other pocket by instinct he reached for the one power to light it he found nothing no saidin in the void nothing he paused then smiled and felt an enormous relief he could not channel just to be certain he tentatively reached for the true power nothing there either he regarded his pipe riding up a little incline to the side of thakan dar now covered in plants no way to light the tabac he inspected it for a moment in the darkness then thought of the pipe being lit and it was rand smiled and turned south he glanced over his shoulder all three women at the pyre had turned from it to look directly at him he could make them out though not much else by the light of the burning body i wonder which of them will follow me he thought then smiled deeper rand althor youve built up quite a swelled head havent you assuming that one or more would follow maybe none of them would or maybe all of them would in their own time he found himself chuckling which would he pick min but no to leave aviendha elayne no he laughed he couldnt pick he had three women in love with him and didnt know which he would like to have follow him any of them all of them light man youre hopeless hopelessly in love with all three and theres no way out of it he heeled the horse into a canter heading farther south he had a purse full of coin a good horse and a strong sword lamans sword which was a better sword than hed have wanted it might draw attention it was a true heronmarked sword with a fine blade did alivia realize how much money shed given him she didnt know a thing about coins shed probably stolen the lot of it so he wasnt just a horsethief well hed told her to get him some gold and shed done it he could buy an entire farm in the two rivers with what he carried south east or west would do but he figured he wanted to go someplace away from it all for good south first then maybe out west along the coast maybe he could find a ship there was so much of the world he hadnt seen hed experienced a few battles hed gotten caught up in a huge game of houses many things he hadnt wanted anything to do with hed seen his fathers farm and palaces hed seen a lot of palaces he just had not had the leisure to have a real look at much of the world that will be new he thought traveling without being chased or having to rule here or there traveling where he could just sleep in a barn in exchange for splitting someones firewood he thought about that and found himself laughing riding on south and smoking his impossible pipe as he did so a wind rose up around him around the man who had been called lord dragon reborn king killer lover and friend the wind rose high and free to soar in an open sky with no clouds it passed over a broken landscape scattered with corpses not yet buried a landscape covered at the same time with celebrations it tickled the branches of trees that had finally begun to put forth buds the wind blew southward through knotted forests over shimmering plains and toward lands unexplored this wind it was not the ending there are no endings and never will be endings to the turning of the wheel of time but it was an ending and it came to pass in those days as it had come before and would come again that the dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men and the green things failed and hope died and men cried out to the creator saying o light of the heavens light of the world let the promised one be born of the mountain according to the prophecies as he was in ages past and will be in ages to come let the prince of the morning sing to the land that green things will grow and the valleys give forth lambs let the arm of the lord of the dawn shelter us from the dark and the great sword of justice defend us let the dragon ride again on the winds of time from charal
