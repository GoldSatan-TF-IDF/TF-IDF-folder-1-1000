cassandra is buried caesar and pompey engage in battle near the town of pharsalus in thessaly cassandra apollo apollo lord of the ways my ruin you have undone me once again and utterly chorus after the darkness of her speech i go bewildered in a mist of prophecies aeschylus agamemnon i the last time i saw cassandra i was about to say the last time i saw cassandra was on the day of her death but that would be untrue the last time i saw hergazed upon her face ran my fingers over her golden hair dared to touch her cold cheekwas on her funeral day it was i who made all the arrangements there was no one else to do it no one else came forward to claim her body i call her cassandra but that was not her real name of course no parents would ever give a child such an accursed name any more than they would name a baby medea or medusa or cyclops nor would any master give such an illomened name to a slave others called her cassandra because of the special gift they believed her to possess like the original cassandra the doomed princess of ancient troy it seemed that our cassandra could foretell the future little good that accursed gift did either of the women who bore that name she called herself what others called her cassandra saying she could no longer remember her real name or who her parents were or where she came from some thought the gods had given her glimpses of the future to compensate for robbing her of the past someone else robbed her of the present someone snuffed out the flame that burned inside her and lit her with an inner glow such as i have seen in no other mortal someone murdered cassandra as i said it fell to me to make the funeral arrangements no outraged friend or lover no grieving parent or sibling came forward to claim her the young man who had been her sole companion the mute she called rupabodyguard servant relative lovervanished when she was murdered for three days her body rested on a bier in the foyer of my house on the palatine hill the embalmers clothed her in white and surrounded her with pine branches to scent the air her killer had done nothing to destroy cassandras beauty it was poison that killed her drained of color cassandras smooth cheeks and tender lips took on a waxen opalescent quality as if she were carved from translucent white marble the hair that framed her face looked like hammered gold cold and hard to the touch by day illuminated by sunbeams that poured through the atrium skylight she looked no more alive than a white marble statue but each night while the rest of the household slept i stole from my wifes bed and crept to the foyer to gaze at cassandras body there were timesstrange moments such as occur only in the middle of the night when the mind is weary and flickering lamplight plays tricks on an old mans eyeswhen it seemed hardly possible that the body on the bier could be truly dead the lamplight infused cassandras face with a warm glow her hair shimmered with highlights of red and yellow it seemed that at any moment she might open her eyes and part her lips to draw a quickening breath once i even dared to touch my lips to hers but i drew back with a shudder for they were as cold and unresponsive as the lips of a statue i placed a black wreath on my door such wreaths are a warning in one sense alerting others to the presence of death in the household but in another sense they issue an invitation come pay your final respects but not a single visitor came to view cassandras body not even one of those compulsive gossips came to pester us the type who make the rounds of the city looking for wreaths and knocking on doors of people theyve never met just to have a look at the latest corpse so they can deliver an opinion on the embalmers handiwork i alone mourned cassandra perhaps i thought death and funerals had become too commonplace in rome for the passing of a single woman of unknown family commonly thought to be as mad aswell as mad as cassandrato excite any interest the whole world was swept up in a civil war that dwarfed all other conflicts in the history of the world warriors were dying by the hundreds and thousands on land and on sea despairing wives were wasting into oblivion ruined debtors were found hanging from rafters greedy speculators were stabbed in their sleep all was ruin and the future promised only more death and suffering on a scale never known before by human kind beautiful cassandra whod haunted the streets of rome uttering shrill crazy prophecies was deadand no one cared enough to come and see her body and yet someone had cared enough to murder her when the period of mourning was done i summoned the strongest of my household slaves to lift the bier onto their shoulders the members of my household formed the funeral cortege except for my wife bethesda who had been ill for quite some time and was not well enough to go out that day in her place my daughter diana walked beside me and beside her walked her husband davus behind us walked my son eco and his wife menenia and their goldenheaded twins now old enough at eleven to understand the somber nature of the occasion hieronymus the massilian who had been residing in my house since his arrival in rome the previous year also came he had suffered much in his life and had known the pain of being outcast so i think he felt a natural bond of sympathy with cassandra my household slaves few in number followed among them the brothers androcles and mopsus who were not quite as old as ecos children for once sensing the gravity of the occasion they behaved themselves so that all would be done fittingly i hired three musicians to lead the procession they played a mournful dirge one blowing a horn and another a flute while the third shook a bronze rattle my neighbors in their stately houses on the palatine heard them coming from a distance and either closed their shutters irritated at the noise or opened them curious to have a look at the funeral party after the musicians came the hired mourners i settled for four the most i could afford considering the state of my finances even though they worked cheaply i suppose there was no shortage of women in rome who could draw upon their own tragedies to produce tears for a woman they had never known these four had worked together on previous occasions and performed with admirable professionalism they shivered and wept shuffled and staggered but never collided pulled at their tangled hair and took turns chanting the refrain of the playwright naeviuss famous epitaph if the death of any mortal saddens hearts immortal the gods above must weep at this womans death next came the mime i had debated whether to hire one but in the end it seemed proper i had been told he came from alexandria and was the best man in rome for this sort of thing he wore a mask with feminine features a blond wig and a blue tunica such as cassandra wore i myself had coached him on mimicking cassandras gait and mannerisms for the most part his gestures were too broad and generic but every so often whether by accident or design he struck an attitude that epitomized cassandra to an uncanny degree and sent a shiver through me funeral mimes are usually allowed a great deal of latitude to caricature and gently lampoon their subject but i had forbidden this it is one thing to sketch a loving parody of a deceased patriarch or a public figure but too little was known about cassandras life to offer fodder for humor still the mime could not offer a portrait of her without imitating the one thing that everyone would recall about her her fits of prophecy every so often he suddenly convulsed and spun about then threw back his head and let out a strange unnerving ululation it was not an exact imitation of the real thing only a suggestionnot even remotely as frightening or uncanny as the real cassandras episodes of possession by the godbut it was close enough to cause any bystanders who had ever seen cassandra prophesy in the forum or in a public market to nod and say to themselves so thats whos lying upon that funeral bier directly after the mime came cassandra herself carried aloft and ensconced amid fresh flowers and evergreen boughs her arms crossed over her chest and her eyes closed as if she slept after cassandra came the members of my household marching in solemn procession for a woman none of them but myself had actually known we strode slowly past the great houses on the palatine and then down into the region of the subura where the narrow streets teemed with life even in these impious days when men scorn the gods and the gods scorn us in return people pay their respects when a funeral passes by they stopped squabbling or gossiping or bargaining shut their mouths and stood aside to let the dead and the mourning pass often as a funeral cortege makes its way through rome others join the retinue inspired to pay their respects by following along behind the family and adding to the train this invariably happens with the funerals of the famous and powerful and often even with those of the humble if they were wellknown and well liked in the community but on that day no one joined us whenever i looked over my shoulder i saw only a gap behind the last of our retinue and then the crowd closing ranks behind us turning their attention away from the passing spectacle and getting back to their business and yet we were observed and we were followedas i soon would discover at length we came to the esquiline gate passing through its portals we stepped from the city of the living into the city of the dead sprawling over the gently sloping hillsides as far as the eye could see was the public necropolis of rome here the unmarked graves of slaves and the modest tombs of common citizens were crowded close together ours was not the only funeral that day here and there plumes of smoke from funeral pyres rose into the air scenting the necropolis with the smells of burning wood and flesh a little way off the road atop a small hill the pyre for cassandra had already been prepared while her bier was being laid upon it and the keepers of the flame set about stoking the fire i stepped into the temple of venus libitina where the registry of deaths is kept the clerk who attended me was officious and sullen from the moment he slammed his record book on to the counter that separated us i told him i wanted to register a death he opened the hinged wooden diptych with its inlaid wax tablets and took up his stylus citizen slave or foreigner he asked curtly im not sure not sure he looked at me as if i had entered the temple with the specific intention of wasting his time i didnt really know her no one seems to have known her not part of your household no im only attending to her funeral because a foreigner then visiting the city im not sure he slammed shut his record book and brandished his stylus at me then go away and dont come back until you are sure i reached across the counter and grabbed the front of his tunic in my fist she died four days ago here in rome and you will enter her death into the registry the clerk blanched certainly he squeaked it was only as i gradually released him that i realized how hard i had been clutching his tunic his face was red and it took him a moment to catch his breath he made a show of reasserting his dignity straightening his tunic and slicking back his hair with great punctiliousness he opened his register and pressed his stylus to the wax name of the deceased he asked his voice breaking he coughed to clear his throat im not sure i said his mouth twitched he bit his tongue he kept his eyes on the register nevertheless i have to put down something for a name put down cassandra then very well he pressed the letters crisply into the hard wax her place of origin i told you i dont know he clicked his tongue but i have to put something if she was a roman citizen i have to know her family name and if she was married her husbands name if she was a foreigner i have to know where she came from if she was a slave then write origin unknown he opened his mouth to speak then thought better of it highly irregular he muttered as he wrote what i told him i dont suppose you know the date of her birth i glowered at him i see birthdate unknown then and the date of her death four days ago you said yes she died on the nones of sextilis and the cause of her death poison i said through gritted teeth she was poisoned i see he said showing no emotion and hurriedly scribbling with a name like cassandra he said under his breath you might think shed have seen it coming and what is your name i have to have it to complete the record i felt another impulse to strike him but resisted gordianus called the finder very well then there ive written the entry just as you wished name of deceased cassandra family and status unknown birthdate unknown death by poison on the nones of sextilis year of rome reported by gordianus called the finder does that satisfy you citizen i said nothing and walked away toward the pillars that flanked the entrance behind me i heard him mutter finder eh perhaps he should find out who poisoned her i walked down the temple steps and back toward the funeral pyre staring at the ground seeing nothing i felt the heat of the fire as i drew closer and when i finally lifted my eyes i beheld cassandra amid the flames her bier had been tilted upright so that the funeral party could view the final moments of her physical existence the musicians quickened their tempo from a mournful dirge to a shrill lament the hired mourners dropped to their knees pounded their fists against the earth screamed and wailed a gust of wind suddenly whipped the flames higher the roar of the fire was punctuated with loud cracking and popping and sizzling noises while i watched the flames gradually consumed her frizzling her hair withering and charring her flesh turning everything black destroying her beauty forever the wind blew smoke in my eyes stinging them filling them with tears i tried to look awayi wanted to look awaybut i couldnt even this awful spectacle constituted one more moment one final chance to look upon cassandra i reached into my toga and pulled out a short baton made of leather it had belonged to cassandra it was the only one of her possessions that still existed i clutched it in my fist for a moment then hurled it into the flames i felt dianas presence beside me then the touch of her hand on my arm papa look i finally tore my eyes from the funeral pyre i looked blankly at my daughters face her eyesso beloved so vibrantly alivemet mine then turned elsewhere i followed her gaze we were no longer alone others had come to witness cassandras end they must have arrived while i was in the temple or staring at the flames the separate groups stood well away from the fire scattered in a semicircle behind us there were seven entourages in all i looked at each in turn hardly able to believe what i was seeing seven of the wealthiest most powerful most remarkable women in rome had come to the necropolis to see cassandra burn they had not joined in the public funeral procession yet here they were each woman seated in a litter surrounded by her own retinue of relatives bodyguards and litter bearers not one of them acknowledging the presence of any of the others all keeping their distance from ourselves and from each other each gazing steadily straight ahead at the funeral pyre i took stock of them looking from left to right first there was terentia the pious always proper wife of cicero with her husband off in greece to side with pompey in the civil war terentia was said to be hardpressed to make ends meet and in fact her litter was the most modest the draperies that surrounded the box were no longer white but shabby gray with tatters here and there but her litter was also the largest and squinting i made out two other women in the litter with her one was her daughter tullia the apple of ciceros eye the other was farther back in the shadows but from her distinctive clothing and headdress i saw she was a vestal virgin no doubt it was fabia terentias sister who in younger days had very nearly met her end for breaking her sacred vow of chastity in the next litter i saw antonia the cousin and wife of marc antony caesars righthand man while caesar had been off fighting his enemies in spain antony had been left in charge of italy now both men had departed for northern greece to do battle with pompey antonia was said to be a very attractive woman i had never formally met her and might not have recognized her except for the bronze lions heads that surmounted the upright supports at each corner of her litter the lions head was antonys symbol her presence was all the more remarkable because of the woman whose litter was next in the semicircle anyone in rome would have recognized that gaudy green box decorated with pinkandgold tassels for cytheris the actress always made a show of her comings and goings she was antonys lover and he had made no secret of that fact while he ruled rome in caesars absence traveling all over italy with her people called her his understudy wife cytheris was famous for her beauty though i myself had never seen her close enough to get a good look those who had seen her perform in mime shows for her former master volumnius the banker said she was talented as well able by the subtlest gestures and expressions to evoke a whole range of responses in her audiencelust not least among them she and antonia cast not a single glance in each others direction apparently oblivious of one another i looked to the next litter which was draped in shades of deepest blue and black suitable for mourning and recognized fulvia the twicewidowed she had been married first to clodius the radical politician and rabblerouser after his murder four years ago on the appian way and the chaos that followedthe beginning of the end of the republic it seemed in retrospectfulvia had eventually remarried joining her fortunes to caesars beloved young lieutenant gaius curio only a few months ago word had arrived from africa of curios disastrous end his head had become a trophy for king juba some called fulvia the unluckiest woman in rome but having met her i knew her to possess an indomitable spirit seated with her in her litter was her mother sempronia from whom fulvia had inherited that spirit as i moved my eyes to the occupant of the next litter the incongruities multiplied there reclining amid mounds of cushions in a typically voluptuous pose was fausta the notoriously promiscuous daughter of the dictator sulla thirty years after his death the dictators brief bloodsoaked reign still haunted rome some predicted that whoever triumphed in the current struggle caesar or pompey would follow sullas merciless example and line the forum with the heads of his enemies sullas ghost haunted the forum but sullas daughter was said to haunt the more dissolute gatherings in the city fausta was still married though in name only to the banished gang leader milo the one political exile whom caesar had pointedly excluded from the generous pardons hed issued before leaving rome milos unforgivable crime had been the murder four years ago of his hated rival clodius on the appian way according to the court it was faustas husband who had made a widow for the first time of fulvia were the two women aware of one anothers presence if they were they gave no more indication of it than did antonia and cytheris at that moment milo was very much on everyones mind for he had escaped from exile and was said to be raising an insurrection in the countryside what did fausta know about that why was she here at cassandras funeral next to faustas litter surrounded by the largest retinue of bodyguards was a resplendent canopy with ivory poles and white draperies that shimmered with golden threads hemmed with a purple stripe it was the litter of great caesars wife calpurnia now that marc antony had left rome to fight alongside caesar many thought it was calpurnia who functioned as the eyes and ears of her husband in his absence caesar had married her ten years ago purely for political advantage some said because in calpurnia he had found a woman to match his own ambition she was said to be an uncommonly hardheaded woman with no time for superstition why had she come to witness the funeral of a mad seeress one litter remained a little farther off than all the others when my eyes fell on it my heart skipped a beat its occupant couldnt be seen except for a finger that parted the closed drapes just enough for her to see out but i knew that litter with its redandwhite stripes all too well eight years ago its occupant had been one of the most public women in rome notorious for her flamboyance and high spirits then she had dragged her estranged young lover into the courts and made the grave mistake of crossing cicero the result had been a disastrous public humiliation from which she had never recovered then her brother some said lover clodius met his end on the appian way and her spirit seemed to have been snuffed out altogether she had retreated into a seclusion so complete that some thought she must be dead she was the one woman in romebefore cassandrawho had threatened to break my heart what was clodiabeautiful enigmatic clodia once the most dangerous woman in rome now all but forgottendoing there that day lurking incognito amid the litters of the other women i gazed from litter to litter my head spinning to see these particular women all gathered in one place at one time was more than remarkable it was astounding and yet there they all were their various litters scattered before the burning pyre like the pavilions of contending armies arrayed on a field of battle terentia antonia cytheris fulvia fausta calpurnia and clodiathe funeral of cassandra had brought them all together why had they come to mourn cassandra to curse her to gloat the distance made it impossible to read the expressions on their faces beside me diana crossed her arms and took on the hard shrewd look so familiar to me from her mother it must have been one of them she said you know it must have been one of those women who murdered her i felt a chill despite the heat of the flames i blinked at a sudden swirl of smoke and cinders and turned to look again at the burning pyre the fire had consumed yet more of cassandra had taken another portion of her away from me and i had missed it i opened my eyes wide despite the burning smoke i stared at the blackened remains upon the upright bier reduced now to a bed of glowing coals the musicians played their shrill lament the mourners raised their cry to heaven how long i stared at the flames i dont know but when i finally turned to look behind me again all seven of the women with their litters and their entourages had vanished as if they had never been there ii the last time i saw cassandratruly saw her looked into her eyes and beheld not just her mortal shell but the spirit that dwelled withinwas on the day of her death it was shortly after noon on the nones of sextilis a market day or what passed for a market day in rome in those times of shortage and mad inflation bethesda felt well enough to go out that day i went along as well as did diana my soninlaw davus accompanied us in those uncertain days it was always wise to bring along a big hulking fellow like davus to play bodyguard we were on a quest for radishes bethesda who had been ill for some time had decided that radishes and radishes only would cure her we made our way from my house on the palatine down to the market on the far side of the capitoline not far from the tiber we walked from vendor to vendor searching in vain for a radish that would satisfy bethesdas discriminating gaze this one was pitted with black spots that one was too elongated and soft another had a face on it leaves for hair straggling roots for a beard that looked like a dishonest cobbler with whom bethesda had once had a row to be sure none of these radishes looked particularly appetizing to me either despite the best efforts of the magistrates put in place by caesar before his departure the economy was in constant turmoil with no end in sight i make no claim to understand the intricacies of the roman economyproduction of food transport to market borrowing against future crops the care and feeding of slaves and the cost of replacing runaways a particular problem these days the constant grinding tug of war between creditors and debtorsbut i do know this much a war that splits the whole world in two results in a paucity of radishes fit to eat i suggested that bethesda might look for carrots insteadi had seen one or two of those that looked ediblebut she insisted that the soup she had in mind would allow no substitutions since this was a medicinal soup meant more for her recovery than for my nourishment i kept my mouth shut a vague lingering malady had been plaguing bethesda for months while i doubted that any soup would rid her of it i had no better cure to suggest so the four of us strolled from vendor to vendor searching for radishes it was just as well that we werent looking for olives since the only ones to be had were selling for the price of pearls moldy bread was easier to find but not much cheaper behind me i heard davuss stomach growl he was a big fellow he required more food than any two normal men to fill his belly and in recent days he hadnt been getting it his face had grown lean and his waist was like a boys diana made a fuss over him and fretted that he would dry up and blow away but i suggested we neednt worry about that as long as davus still had legs like tree trunks and shoulders like the arch of an aqueduct eureka bethesda suddenly cried echoing the famous exclamation of the mathematician archimedes although i doubt she had ever heard of him i hurried to her side sure enough she held in her hands a truly admirable bunch of radishesfirm and red with crisp green leaves and long trailing roots how much she cried startling the vendor with her vehemence he quickly recovered himself and smiled broadly sensing a motivated buyer the price he named was astronomical thats robbery i snapped but look how fine they are he insisted reaching out to caress the radishes in bethesdas hands as if they were made of solid gold you can still see the good etruscan earth on them and smell them thats the smell of hot etruscan sunshine theyre just radishes i protested just radishes i challenge you citizen to find another bunch of radishes in all this market to match them go ahead go and look ill wait he snatched the radishes back from bethesda i cant afford it i said i wont pay it then someone else will said the vendor enjoying his advantage im not budging on the price these are the finest radishes youll find anywhere in rome and youll pay what i ask or do without perhaps said bethesda her dark brows drawn together perhaps i could manage with just two radishes or perhaps only one yes one would do im sure i imagine we can afford one cant we husband i looked into her brown eyes and felt a pang of guilt bethesda had been my wife for more than twenty years before that she had been my concubine she was practically a child when i acquired her in alexandria back in the days of my footloose youth her beauty and her aloofnessoh yes she had been very aloof despite the fact that she was a slavehad driven me wild with passion later she bore my daughter the only child of my loins diana that was when i manumitted and married her and bethesda settled into the role of a roman matriarch that role had not always been a comfortable fita slave born in alexandria to an egyptian mother and a jewish father did not easily take to roman waysbut she had never embarrassed me never betrayed me never given me cause for regret we had stood beside one another through many hardships and some very real dangers and through times of ease and joy as well if we had become a little estranged in recent months i told myself it was merely due to the strain of the times the whole world was coming apart at the seams in some families a son had taken up arms against his own father or a wife had left her husband to side with her brothers if in our household the silences between bethesda and me had grown longer or the occasional petty arguments sharper what of it in a world where a man could no longer afford a radish tempers grew short it didnt help of course that we were constantly confronted with the contrasting example of our daughter and her musclebound husband they too had begun life in unequal stationsdiana born free davus a slaveand the gulf between dianas sharp wits and davuss simplicity had struck me from the first as unbridgeable but the two of them were inseparable constantly touching forever cooing endearments to each other even as they approached the fourth year of their marriage nor was their attraction purely physical often when i came upon the two of them in my house i found them deep in earnest conversation what did they find to talk about probably the state of her parents marriage i thought but the guilt i felt came from more than long silences and petty squabbles it came from more than the very major row we had had after my return to rome from massilia the previous autumn bringing a new mouth to feedmy friend hieronymusand the news that i had disowned my adopted son meto that announcement very nearly tore the whole household apart but over time the shock and grief had lessened no the guilt i felt had nothing to do with household matters or family relations i felt guilty because of cassandra of course and now bethesda who complained of feeling unwell every day who seemed to be in the grip of some malady no doctor could diagnose had taken it into her head that she must have radishesand her wretched husband was trapped between a greedy vendor and his own guilty conscience i shall buy you more than one radish wife i said quietly i shall buy you the whole bunch of them davus youre carrying the moneybag hand it to diana so that she can pay the man diana took the bag from davus loosened the drawstrings and slowly reached inside frowning papa are you sure its so much of course im sure pay the scoundrel the vendor was ecstatic as diana counted the coins and dropped them into his hand he relinquished the radishes bethesda clutching them to her breast gave me a look to melt my heart the smile on her face such a rare sight in recent days made her look twenty years youngerno younger than that like a gratified and trusting child then a shadow crossed her face the smile faded and i knew that she suddenly felt unwell i touched her arm and spoke into her ear shall we go home now wife just then there was a commotion from another part of the marketthe clanging of metal on metal the rattle of objects spilled onto paving stones the crash of pottery breaking a man yelled a woman shrieked its her the madwoman i turned about to see cassandra staggering toward me her blue tunica was torn at the neck and pulled awry her golden hair was wild and unkempt there was a crazed expression on her face that was how she often looked especially during a fit of prophecybut when her eyes met mine i saw in them a look of utter panic and my blood turned cold she ran to me her arms reaching forward her gait uneven gordianus help me she cried her voice was hoarse and strained she fell into my arms beside me bethesda gave a start and dropped her radishes cassandra fell to her knees pulling me down with her cassandra i gasped i lowered my voice to a whisper if this is some pretense she clutched my arms and cried out her body convulsed diana knelt beside me papa whats wrong with her i dont know its the god in her said bethesda from above and behind me her voice tinged with awe the same god that compels her prophecies must be tearing her apart inside a crowd gathered around us pressing in from all sides draw back all of you i shouted cassandra clutched at me again but her grip was weakening her eyelids flickered and drooped she moved her lips but no sound came out cassandra whats wrong whats happened i whispered poison she said her voice was failing i could barely hear her above the hubbub of the crowd shes poisoned me who what did she give you our faces were so close that i felt her shallow breath on my lips her eyes seemed huge her blue irises eclipsed by the enormous blackness of her pupils somethingin the drink she said i could barely hear her she convulsed again then was still i felt a last long exhalation against my lips strangely cold the fingers clutching my arms relaxed her eyes remained open but the life went out of them the crowd pressed in diana was knocked against me and gave a squeal davus bellowed at the on lookers to back away brandishing his fists at those who didnt move quickly as they dispersed i heard snatches of excited conversation did you see that she died in the old mans arms cassandrathats what people called her i heard she was a war widow went crazy with grief no no no she was a briton from way up north theyre all crazy paint themselves blue she didnt look blue to me rather beautiful in fact i heard she was a vestal who broke her vows and got herself buried alive managed to claw her way out of the grave but ended up raving mad nonsense youll believe anything all i know is she could see the future could she i wonder if she saw that coming i swallowed hard i wanted to press my lips against cassandras but i felt the eyes of my wife and daughter on me i turned to diana kneeling beside me what must my face have looked like for my daughter to gaze back at me with such pity and puzzlement i peered up at bethesda for a long moment she registered no emotionthen suddenly raised her eyebrows in alarm the radishes she cried slapping her hands to her face in all the commotion someone had stolen them iii the first time i saw cassandra was in the forum it was a day in midjanuarius when i count the months on my fingers i realize that from the first day i saw her to the last not quite seven months passed so brief a period yet in some ways it seems i knew her for a lifetime i can place the date precisely because that was the day word reached rome that caesar had successfully crossed the adriatic sea from brundisium to the coast of northern greece for days all rome had been holding its breath to learn the outcome of that bold gambit the graybearded selfstyled sages who passed their days gossiping and arguing in the forum all agreed whether they favored caesar or pompey that caesar was mad to attempt a naval crossing in winter and madder still to attempt such a thing when everyone knew that pompey had the superior fleet and ruled the adriatic a sudden storm could send caesar and all his soldiers to the bottom of the sea in a matter of minutes or in clear weather caesars fleet was likely to be outmaneuvered by pompeys and destroyed before they could reach the other side yet caesar having settled affairs in rome to his liking was determined to carry the battle to pompey and to do that he had to convey his troops across the water all through the previous year from the day he crossed the rubicon and drove pompey in a panic out of italy caesar had campaigned to secure his mastery of the westmustering troops from his stronghold in gaul destroying the pompeian forces in spain laying siege to the seaport of massilia whose inhabitants had sided with pompey and arranging to have himself declared temporary dictator so as to set up magistrates of his choosing in rome meanwhile pompey driven in confusion and disarray from rome had been biding his time across the water in greece insisting that he and his fellow exiles constituted the true government of rome compelling eastern potentates to send him massive contributions of money and vast numbers of troops and building up a huge navy that he stationed in the adriatic with the express purpose of keeping caesar in italy until pompey was ready to face him at the outset of that fateful year which of these rivals found himself in the stronger position that question was argued endlessly by those of us who frequented the forum in those uncertain days we sat under the weak winter sun on the steps of the treasury plundered by caesar to pay for his troops or as on that particular day we found a spot outside the wind near the temple of vesta and discussed the issues of the day i suppose i must say us and we including myself in that group of tireless chinwagers although i opened my mouth less frequently than most mostly i listened and thought what a useless lot of know nothings we all were too old or frail or crippled to have been compelled to take up arms by either side and not rich enough to have been extorted by either side to hand over gold or gladiators to their cause over looked by the warlords we spent our days idling in the forum expounding our opinions on the latest rumors arguing and insulting one another gnashing our teeth while we helplessly waited for the world we had known all our lives to come to an end what does it matter if caesars won the west when all the wealth of asia and the grain of egypt are at pompeys disposal this came from a mildmannered fellow called manlius who seemed equally distressed at the impending destruction of either side in the conflict manlius hated violence i dont see why caesars so eager to make the crossing hell only be stepping into the trap pompeys laid for him the slaughter will be horrific why is caesar eager to cross thats plain enough once it comes to a headon confrontation sword against sword caesars got the clear advantage so declared onearmed canininus who if his tales of combat were true had more fighting experience than the rest of us combined he had lost his right arm fighting for caesar in gaul and had received a generous retirement from his grateful imperator caesars men are battlehardened from constant fighting years and years spent conquering the gauls then the march on rome then the mad chase down to brundisiumpompey barely slipped out of that nooseand most recently that little foray in spain to put an end to caesars enemies there and dont forget the siege of massilia this came from my friend hieronymus a massilian of greek descent and the only one of the group who was not a roman citizen the others suffered his presence partly because i was his patron but also because they were a little in awe of him a cruel fate had led to his selection by the priests of massilia to serve as the citys scapegoat during the siege by caesar it had been his role to take on the sins of the whole city and at some critical juncture by his death to save the city from destruction massilia had indeed been spared from destruction but a strange twist of fortune had spared hieronymus from his fate and he had ended up in rome living in my house hieronymus was tall and physically striking with a curious demeanor having begun life as the heir of one of massilias more powerful families but having spent most of his life as a beggar he combined the haughtiness of a fallen aristocrat with the crafty pragmatism of a streetwise survivor he often played referee in our little group since he favored neither caesar nor pompey canininus snorted the siege of massilia id already forgotten about it massilia was nothing more than a pimple on gauls butt caesar simply dispatched trebonius to pop it open before it could fester hieronymus raised an eyebrow how he had despised his native city while he lived and very nearly died there since he had left massilia i never once heard him express a sentimental longing for the place still it rankled him to hear a roman express contempt for the city of his greek fore fathers if squeezing the pimple of massilia as you put it was such a smallish thing he said dryly in slightly stilted latin then why did caesar reward trebonius by making him city praetor for the year and charge him with enforcing caesars own plan to shore up the roman economy such an important task is handed by a man like caesar only to one who has shown his true mettle i think that caesar must have rated the taking of massilia a far more important achievement than you do my friend in the first place snapped canininus caesar didnt make trebonius city praetor the voters did this met with catcalls from the pompeians in the group nonsense said the most vocal of them volcatius who had a surprisingly strong voice for such an old man the only voters left in rome are the common rabble wholl cast their lots however caesar tells them to pompey and all the best people ran for their lives when caesar crossed the rubiconexcept for those who couldnt bear the journey like myself how can any socalled election held under such circumstances constitute a true vote of the people the last elections were a farce and a scandal a mime show put on for the sole purpose of putting caesars handpicked men in office the whole process was an illegal and illegitimate oh please volcatius not all this again groaned canininus youll still be whining about the last elections when it comes time to hold the next if the next round is as corrupt and meaningless as the last i wont keep silent corrupt maybecanininus shrugged and smirkedbut hardly meaningless the fact of the matter is that rome has a government in place and that government is running the city whether you like it or not get used to it and move on canininus laughed spitefully along with some of the more vehement of the caesarian faction but back to the point i was trying to make before we became distracted by politics caesar holds the military advantage because his men are primed and ready to fight mildmannered manlius who had started the whole exchange objected you say caesars men are battlehardened but arent they battleweary as well some of them staged a revolt while caesar was on the way back from spain yes and caesar promptly put the ringleaders to death and rallied the rest to his side said canininus he knows how to handle a mutiny hes a born leader of men you manlius never having been a soldier wouldnt understand such things but pompeys had almost a year to catch his breath and gather his forces observed manlius ignoring canininuss insults theyll be fresh and unscathed there must be some advantage in that theyll be soft from all that idle waiting if you ask me said canininus but what about pompeys superior numbers said manlius above and beyond his roman legions they say pompeys gathered hundreds of archers from crete and syria slingers from thessaly thousands of cavalrymen from alexandria we know about pompeys forces only from rumors people always inflate the actual numbers said canininus but pompeys fleet isnt a rumor observed hieronymus surely thats real people have seen galleys sailing into the adriatic sea for months hundreds of them arriving from all over the eastern mediterranean battlehardened or battleweary makes no difference if caesar cant get his men across to the other side his timing could hardly be worse observed volcatius the pompeian smiling grimly winters arrived boreas can blow a storm from the north and whip the adriatic into a seething caldron before a ships captain has time to utter a prayer to neptune they say caesar consulted the auguries before he left rome and all signs boded against him birds were seen flying north instead of south and a sparrow attacked a vulturebad omens but caesar hushed up the augurs before his troops could hear about them and raise another mutiny thats a lie said canininus a blasphemous lie he lurched toward volcatius but some of the others held him back hieronymus raised an eyebrow at the spectacle of a truculent onearmed roman attempting to physically attack the oldest graybeard in the group all this time i said nothing in the contest between pompey and caesar i had so far managed to keep myself neutralmore or less like virtually every other roman citizen especially those who played any part whatsoever in the citys public life i had strong ties to both sides if anything my loyalties and animosities were more conflicted and tortuously intertwined than most because of the sort of work i had done all my lifeplaying the hound for advocates like cicero digging up the truth about powerful and notsopowerful men accused of everything from deflowering a vestal virgin to murdering their own fathers i had met and had dealings with both pompey and caesar as well as many of their confederates i had seen them at their best and their worst the idea that romes fate must inevitably fall into the hands of one or the otherthat either caesar or pompey would ultimately become a king or something very close to itfilled me with dread i attached no sentimentality to the old way of doing things to the doddering meanspirited greedy frequently stupid maneuverings of the roman senate and the unruly republic over which they presided but of one thing i was certain roman citizens were not born to serve a kingat least not roman citizens of my generation the men of the younger generation seemed to have other ideas my thoughts had led me as they often did in those days to meto it was for meto that i had gone to massilia the previous year seeking news of my adopted sons fate an anonymous message had informed me of his death in that city while spying for caesar how meto loved caesar whom he had served for many years in gaul having been born a slave meto could never become an officer like caesars other lieutenants but he had become indispensable to his imperator nonetheless serving him as a private secretary transcribing his memoirs sharing his quarterssharing his bed some said in massilia i had found meto alive after all but the play of events had so disgusted me that i turned my back on meto and on caesar i had spoken words that could never be taken back i had publicly disowned meto and declared that he was no longer my son where was meto now since that fateful parting in massilia i had heard no news of him i assumed that he remained by caesars side that he had returned with him to rome then followed him to brundisium for the attempted crossing of the adriatic where was meto at that very moment for all i knew he might be at the bottom of the sea along with caesar himself as a boy when i first met him in the coastal town of baiae meto couldnt swim at some point he must have learnedto please caesarbecause swimming had saved his life in massilia but not even the strongest swimmer could hope to survive if his ship foundered in the middle of the adriatic i imagined meto in the water wounded frightened bravely attempting to stay afloat even while the waves closed over his head and cold salty water filled his lungs hieronymus gave me a nudge i looked past the skirmish between canininus and volcatius and saw two of my slaves on the far side of the forum heading our way little androcles was in the lead but his older brother mopsus was running to catch up with him from the heated competition between them i knew they must be on a mission of some importance i felt a tremor of intuition a god must have whispered in my ear as the poet says for i knew they must be bringing news of that which was uppermost in my thoughts canininus and volcatius abruptly separated each went about reasserting his dignity like mirror images they straightened their tunics and threw back their chins the gap between them afforded a space for mopsus now in the lead to enter the group followed by androcles everyone knew the boys for they frequently tagged along with me when i visited the forum everyone liked them volcatius patted androcles on the head canininus made a mock salute to mopsus slightly out of breath from running mopsus struck his chest and saluted back what brings you here boys i said trying to ignore the sudden fluttering in my chest news of caesar said mopsus his eyes lit up when he spoke the imperators name recently mopsus had decided that caesar was his hero his little brother to be contrary had become a confirmed pompeian canininus and volcatius aligned with them accordingly playfully treating each boys as either an ally or a foe what news i said hes made the crossing he reached the other side safely along with almost all his men said mopsus but not all of them there was trouble said androcles darkly i drew a breath mopsus where did you hear this news a messenger arrived at the capena gate an hour ago i spotted him right away and i remembered he was one of calpurnias slaves and calpurnia is caesars wife added androcles needlessly and i decided to follow him we decided insisted androcles and sure enough he headed straight to caesars house we stayed out of sight and watched him knock on the door the slave who answered made a great show of patting her bosom and almost fainting and she said tell me straight out before we bother the mistress have you come with good news or bad and the messenger said good news caesar made the crossing and hes safe on the other side i let out a sigh of relief and blinked away sudden tears the surge of emotion caught me by surprise i coughed and managed to speak despite the catch in my throat but androcles you said something about trouble and there was he addressed himself as much to volcatius as to me drawn by the glimmer of hope in his fellow pompeians rheumy eyes when caesar reached the other side it was the middle of the night and right away he unloaded his troops and sent the ships back to brundisium to pick up the rest of his men including the cavalry but some of those ships were waylaid and separated from the rest by some of pompeys ships and pompeys men set fire to them and burned them right there on the water with the captains and the crews still on board they were burned alive or if they managed to jump off pompeys men killed them in the water spearing them like fish burned alive at sea gasped manlius a horrible fate how many asked volcatius eagerly the news of caesars successful crossing had visibly shaken him but now he rallied at the prospect of a setback to caesar thirty thirty ships were captured by the pompeians and burned said androcles proudly only thirty scoffed his older brother hardly any considering the size of caesars fleet his cavalry still managed to make it across they just had to crowd more men and horses onto each ship and some of the men had to sit on horseback the whole way a good thing they had clear weatherthats what the messenger said thirty ships lost i muttered imagining the agony of those thirty captains and thirty crews could meto possibly have been among them surely not he was a soldier not a sailor he would have been by caesars side safe on the farther shore in any case of what concern was metos fate to me suddenly all around us in the forum there was a sense of movement and occasion i caught glimpses of messengers running across nearby squares in the distance i saw a group of men gather before the steps leading up to the temple of castor and pollux to listen to an elderly senator in a toga who had something to tell themfrom such a distance i could hear only a vague echo of his voice from a house somewhere up on the palatineprobably not far from my own house from the soundi heard a loud cheer and the banging of cymbals a moment later a citizen came running by shouting have you heard caesars landed he made the crossing pompeys done for now the news was spreading across the city as rapidly as voices could carry it then i heard another sound jarringly out of place amid the swelling hubbub of excited male voices in the forum it came from nearby from the little open square in front of the temple of vesta it was a woman wailing and shrieking from the sounds she made i thought she was being attacked i stepped away from the group and circled around the temple until i saw her kneeling on the paving stones at the foot of the temple steps the others followed me when he saw her canininus sneered oh its only her i stared at the woman in wonder there was something unnatural about the way she rolled her shoulders and swung her head in a circle she held her arms aloft her palms raised to heaven her eyes were rolled upward the wailing i had heard was actually a sort of incantation as i listened i began to hear words amid the grunts and shrieks caesarpompeyit comes to this she cried and then after a long keening moan like vultures they circle over the carcass of romeeager to pick the bones cleanwheeling and wheeling until they collide who is she canininus i said how in hades should i know he snapped i only know shes been haunting the forum for the last few days begging for alms she seems normal enough but every now and then this happensshe goes into a sort of trance and shouts nonsense but who is she where did she come from i looked at the others manlius shrugged volcatius raised a bristling white eyebrow i havent a cluebut shes certainly a tastylooking morsel i looked back at the woman she had risen to her feet but her blue tunica had become tangled at her knees pulling down the neckline to reveal the cleavage of her breasts no woman in her right mind would display herself so immodestly in the forum and certainly not before the temple of vesta she shook her head back and forth whipping the air with her unpinned blond tresses shes called cassandra said mopsus why had i even bothered to ask the other graybeards when mopsus was present is there anything that goes on in rome that you dont know young man he crossed his arms and grinned not much cassandrathats what they call her on account of the way she can see the future i heard some slaves at the butchers market talking about her just this morning and what else do you know about her well he was momentarily stumped then brightened shes very pretty and if shes roman she must not be married or else shed be wearing a stola instead of a tunica observed androcles his older brother looked chagrined at having missed this deduction as we watched the woman suddenly went limp and collapsed i was on the verge of going to help her when i saw a figure descending the steps of the temple it was one of the vestals dressed in the traditional costume of the sisterhood that tends the sacred hearth fire of the roman state she wore a plain white stola and a white linen mantle about her shoulders her hair was cut short and around her forehead she wore a white band decorated with ribbons i caught a glimpse of her face and recognized fabia the sisterinlaw of cicero she was quickly followed by two younger vestals the three of them gathered around the prostrate form of the woman called cassandra they put their heads together and conferred in low voices cassandra stirred and rose to her knees using her arms to steady herself she looked dazed she seemed hardly to notice the vestals as the three of them helped her to her feet i could see that fabia was speaking to her apparently asking her questions but cassandra made no reply she blinked like a woman waking from a deep slumber and seemed finally to register the presence of the three women surrounding her she straightened her tunica and her disarrayed hair with awkward halting movements taking her by the elbows and gently guiding her talking to her in low voices the three vestals led her up the steps and into the temple of vesta well said canininus what do you make of that perhaps the old virgin wants to ask the young madwoman what its like to take a man said volcatius leering ill bet that ones had more than her share of men between her legs who knows what women talk about when there arent any men around said manlius who cares said canininus now that caesars about to give pompey a good thrashing and with that the conversation turned away from the madwoman for now at last there was the fresh news of caesars crossing to give us men something to talk about later that day at the evening meal i happened to mention the incident of the madwoman the family was gathered in the dining room shutters were drawn to keep out the cold air from the garden at the center of the house and a brazier had been lit to heat the room bethesda and i shared a couch davus and diana shared the one to our left hieronymus reclined alone on the couch to our right yes yes the woman called cassandra said bethesda putting down her bowl of chick pea soup and nodding this was before her malady set in when her appetite was still strong the soup smelled strongly of black pepper ive seen her down in the marketplace have you how long has she been about bethesda shrugged not long perhaps a month have you seen her experience one of these fits oh yes a bit unnerving the first time you see it after it passes she doesnt seem to know whats happened she gradually comes to her senses and carries on with whatever she was doing before begging for alms usually no one helps her whats to be done some people are frightened by her and move away others want to hear what she says and move closer they say she utters prophecies when shes like that but i cant make sense of the noises she makes why didnt you ever mention her to me what possible interest could you have in such a wretched woman husband asked bethesda lifting her bowl of soup to take another sip but where does she come from has she no family how long has she been experiencing these spells if you were to ask after every odd character who wanders about the markets nowadays begging for scraps you should find yourself very busy indeed husband these are hard times maimed soldiers widows farmers and shopkeepers whove lost everything to greedy creditorstheres no end to the beggars and vagrants cassandras just one more mothers right said diana sometimes you see whole families wandering about with no place to go especially down by the river you feel sorry for them of course but what can anyone do and some of them are dangerous they look dangerous anyway thats why i always take davus along when we go to the markets victims of the war i said shaking my head it was the same when i was your age diana during the first civil war refugees from the countryside runaway slaves orphans running wild in the streets of course things got even worse after the war i was remembering sullas bloody dictatorship and the heads of his enemies mounted on spikes all over the forum who named this woman cassandra anyway i asked wanting to change the subject some wag in the market i imagine said bethesda people give nick names to the more colorful characters noted davus theres one they call cerberus because he barks like a dog a fellow they call cyclops because hes got only one eye and a woman they called the gorgon because shes so ugly shes not that ugly objected diana oh yes she is insisted davus shes as ugly as cassandra is beautiful and there are even those said diana raising an eyebrow but snuggling closer to him who call a certain fellow mighty hercules behind his back no said davus oh yes husband ive heard them admiring women envious men she smiled and reached up to squeeze one of his bulging biceps davus blushed and assumed a particularly stupid expression i cleared my throat the original cassandra was a trojan princess as i recall indeed she was said hieronymus ready to assert his authority on the subject as a boy he had received a fine greek education at one of the renowned academies for which massilia was famous he could recite long passages from the iliad and knew many of the greek tragedies by heart cassandra was the fairest daughter of king priam and queen he cuba he said and she was the sister of paris the prince who started all the trouble by stealing helen and carrying her back to troy cassandra could foretell the future that was her terrible curse but why call it a curse asked diana i should think that knowing the future would be rather useful i could tell whether or not id be able to find anything decent to buy at the markets instead of trekking down there only to come back emptyhanded ah but you see theres the rub said hieronymus knowing the future doesnt mean that you can alter it suppose in the morning you had a vision of yourself down at the markets later that afternoon finding not a thing to buy youd still be destined to make that trip down to the market only now youd know ahead of time that you were doomed to accomplish nothing and that would be doubly frustrating acknowledged diana hieronymus nodded foreknowledge is a curse imagine knowing the circumstances of your own death as cassandra did and being able to do nothing about it davus frowned imagine knowing ahead of time your greatest joys as well wouldnt that spoil them everyone loves a good surprise even small surprises when someone tells you a story you dont want to guess the ending beforehand you want to be surprised every now and then davus said something to make me seriously doubt that he was as simple as he looked but how did the trojan cassandra come to have this gift or curse he said was she born with it no but she had it from a very early age said hieronymus when she was only a small child her parents left her alone in the sanctuary of apollo at a place called thymbra near troy when priam and he cuba returned they found cassandra entwined by two serpents flicking their tongues in the childs ears afterward cassandra was able to understand the divine sounds of nature especially the voices of birds which told her of the future but the child kept this gift to herself not trusting it and uncertain of how to use it when she grew older she returned on her own to thymbra and spent a night alone in the sanctuary hoping for guidance from apollo the god appeared to her in human form cassandra was beautiful apollo wanted her he made a deal with her in return for his instruction cassandra would allow him to make love to her and she would bear him a child cassandra agreed apollo was as good as his word that night he initiated her into the arts of prophecy but afterward when he moved to touch her she resisted when he embraced her she struggled and fought against him who knows why perhaps he overawed her perhaps she feared the agony of giving birth to a demigod apollo was insulted he grew furious cassandra was afraid he would strip her of the gift of prophecy but he did something far worse he ordained that no one should ever believe her prophecies poor cassandra as one calamity after another befell troy she saw them all coming and tried to warn her loved ones but no one would listen to her king priam thought she was mad and locked her away perhaps in the end she truly was mad tormented to distraction by the curse apollo had put upon her of course everyone knows about the end of troyby the stratagem of hiding in a giant horse the greeks gained access to the city and then torched it killing the men and taking the women into slavery during the sack of the city cassandra fled to the sanctuary of athena and embraced the statue of the goddess as a suppliant little good that did her athena had no sympathy for any trojan ajax broke into the temple and dragged cassandra from the statue tearing her fingers from the cold marble he raped her there in the sanctuary but it was agamemnon asserting his privilege as leader of the greeks who claimed cassandra as his booty mad or not she was the most beautiful of priams daughters and agamemnon wanted her he had the audacity to bring her home with him and flaunt her in the face of his wife clytaemnestra who was outraged while agamemnon and cassandra slept clytaemnestra stabbed them both cassandra foresaw her own death of course but she was powerless to do anything about it or perhaps by that point in her miserable life she welcomed her end and did nothing to stop clytaemnestra ultimately it was the god she blamed for her woes in his play about agamemnon aeschylus gives us cassandras lament apollo apollo lord of the ways my ruin poor cassandra i thought first punished for preserving her chastity from a god then made the concubine of the man who killed her family was the cassandra i had seen that day yet another woman victimized by mens war and gods cruelty what misfortune had driven her mad or was she not mad at all but cursed like the original cassandra and truly able to perceive the future if i were to ask her what could she tell me about my fate and the fates of those i loved and if i were to hear her answers would i regret having asked iv the day after cassandras funeral i spent the morning alone in the garden the day was hot and the sky cloudless i sat on a folding chair wearing a broadbrimmed hat and watching my shadow recede until the sun was directly overhead bethesda felt unwell and was spending the morning in bed every now and again i heard the sound of her gentle snoring from the unshuttered bedroom window that opened onto the garden diana and davus had gone out to do the days marketing they had given up on finding radishes and were in search of fennel which bethesda was now certain would cure her hieronymus had gone down to the tiber to fish taking mopsus and androcles with him no one had asked if i wanted to go along with them they all sensed that i wished to be left alone at length i heard dianas voice she and davus were back i saw her hurry along the portico to the back of the house and step into the bedroom to look in on her mother a little later she came to the garden and sat beside me mothers asleep we should keep our voices low i couldnt find any fennel but can you believe itthere were radishes everywhere so many they were practically giving them away by juno its hot out here papa you shouldnt be sitting in the sunlight why not im wearing a hat has it kept that brain of yours from overheating what do you mean by that she paused and assumed an expression she had inherited from her mother a look at once pitying and presumptuous she might as well have said aloud i know exactly how your sluggish tortuous thought processes play out dear papa im well ahead of you but im resolved to be patient i shall wait for you to catch up to your own inevitable decision instead she said youve been thinking about her all morning havent you i sighed and readjusted my bottom on the folding chair which was suddenly uncomfortable your mother isnt well of course shes in my thoughts dont be coy papa my daughters voice assumed a stern edge you know what i meant youve been thinking about her about that woman cassandra i took a deep breath i stared at a sunflower across the way perhaps youre brooding yes you must stop it we need you papa its getting harder every day just to get by and mothers ill and davus does all he can to help but still sometimes i dont know what were going to do her voice became grave but there was no selfpity in it always hardheaded always practical and forward thinking and resourceful never despairing that was diana she was truly our child the inheritor of what was best in both bethesda and myself what are you saying to me daughter im saying that you must leave her behind shes dead now you must stop thinking about her its your family who need you now her tone was not reproachful merely matteroffact how much exactly did she know about cassandra and me what did she know for a fact and how much had she guessed rightly or wrongly leave her behind you say supposing that youre right that im sitting here brooding about that woman how do you suggest i stop brooding daughter you know the answer to that papa theres only one way you must find out who killed her i gazed long and hard at the sunflower what good will that do oh papa you sound so hopeless i hate to see you like this its bad enough that mothers ill but for you to be sick as wellsick at heart i meanand youve been this way ever since you came back from massilia we all know why its because of what happened between you and i raised my hand to silence her as a roman paterfamilias with the legal power of life and death over every member of my household i was usually quite lax allowing them all to speak their minds and do as they wished but on this one subject my break with meto i would allow no discourse very well papa i wont speak of that still i hate to see you this way youre like a man who thinks the gods have turned against him and havent they i wanted to say but such an expression of selfpity would have contrasted too glaringly with my daughters stoicism and not to my credit besides i had no reason to believe the gods had singled me out to vent their displeasure it seemed to me lately that the gods had turned against all man kind or perhaps they had simply turned their backs on us allowing the most ruthless among us like caesar and pompey to wreak unchecked havoc on the rest hundreds thousands tens of thousands of menand womenwill die before this war is over diana not one of those restless lemures of the dead is likely to find anything resembling justice in this world or the next if cassandra was murdered you know she was papa she was poisoned she told you so if she was murdered what good will it do to find out who killed her no roman courtpresuming the courts ever return to normalwould be interested in prosecuting such a crime perpetrated on a woman nobody knew or cared about you cared enough to give her a decent funeral thats beside the point and some of the most powerful women in rome cared enough to come to her funeral you saw them skulking on the periphery staying well away from the pyre as if the flames might scorch themor show the guilt on their faces it was one of them who killed her wasnt it it might have been before her death cassandra had been courted by the highest circles of roman society summoned to the houses of the rich and powerful who had learned about her gift had she known the danger she might face by consorting with such women what uncovered secrets from the pastor from the futuremight have led one of those women to silence cassandra forever shall i do it for you papa do what shall i do it in your steaduncover the truth about her death what a ridiculous idea its not so ridiculous i know how you work ive watched you since i was a child ive listened to all your stories about snooping for cicero and uncovering chariot races that were fixed and going off to spain or syracuse to look for a murderer at some rich mans behest do you think id be incapable of doing the same thing myself you make it sound like baking a batch of flat bread diana mix this list of ingredients bake for a certain length of time baking is harder than you make it sound papa it takes skill and experience exactly and you have neither when it comes towell to the sort of work youre talking about its because im a woman isnt it you dont think i could do it because im a woman do you really think im not as clever as a man cleverness has nothing to do with it there are places a woman cant go there are questions a woman cant ask and dont forget the danger diana but id have davus for all that hes big and strong he can go anywhere he could twist arms or break down doors diana dont be absurd i took off my hat and fanned myself with it squinting at the bright sunlight youve done some thinking about this havent you perhaps well stop any such thoughts at once and abandon any ambitions you may have in such a directiondiana the finder indeed nodiana and davus the finders plural double absurdity i absolutely forbid it youll follow the example of your mother she began with every disadvantage yet look at her nowshes made herself into the very model of a roman matron modest respectable responsible running a household raising a family is that how youd describe those model roman matrons who showed up at cassandras funeral i thought of some of those women and the scandals that attended them and i had to cede the point to diana in such times did any real standard of roman womanhood exist any longer it was the same for men and women alikevirtues had turned to vices and vices to virtues i put on my hat and stood listening to my knees crack as they straightened if your intention was to incite me to action diana then youve succeeded fetch davus for me would you i shall take him along with mein case i have to break down some doors or twist some arms and you meanwhile will stay home and tend to your ailing mother i expect to smell radish soup bubbling on the hearth when i come home the easiest place to begin was also the closestat the house of cicero just down the street from my own with the assistance of mopsus and androcles davus and i put on our best togas the two of us left the house and walked along the rim road that skirted the crest of the palatine hill with a view of the forum below and the capitoline hill surmounted by the temple of jupiter in the distance it was a beautiful summer day at ciceros house davus knocked politely on the door with his foot an eye peered at us through a peephole in the door i stated my name and asked to see the mistress of the house the peephole slid shut a few moments later the door opened i had visited the house of cicero many times over the years at the zenith of his fortunes in the year he served as consul and quashed the socalled conspiracy of catilina this house had arguably been the very center of the roman world the site of the most important political meetings as well as the most dazzling cultural gatherings men of letters and men of affairs had passed through its portals they had sipped wine and listened to one anothers poems and monographs in its gardens they had shaped the future course of the republic in ciceros study at the nadir of ciceros fortunes the house had been burned to the ground by clodius and his gang and its master had been sent into exile but cicero had eventually returned to rome regained his rights of citizenship and his place in the senate and rebuilt his house on the palatine now the master of this house was again in a kind of exile far away in greece with pompey for months after caesar crossed the rubicon cicero had procrastinated and vacillated agonizing over his choices both sides had wooed him not for his military skills but for the political weight he carried ciceros endorsement of either side would do much to sway the sentiments of those who considered themselves steadfast upholders of the republic on principle cicero sided with pompey from the start seeing him as the only possible protector of the status quo but for as long as he could cicero hedged his bets sending letters back and forth to both pompey and caesar desperately trying to hew a middle course but there was no middle course and finally when exaggerated news of a temporary setback to caesars fortunes in spain reached rome in the month of junius of the previous year cicero took the great leap and with his son marcus who was barely old enough to wear a manly toga left italy to join pompey a year had passed since then i had to wonder if cicero was now regretting his decision i had known cicero for over thirty years my assistance in the murder trial that made his early reputation had done much to further my own fortunes it was not long after i first met him that he married his wife terentia ten years his junior had come from a family of considerable social standing and brought with her a substantial dowry she was said to be an excellent household manager and devoutly religious unlike the wives of many powerful men she took no interest in legal matters or affairs of state while the fortunes of the republic ebbed and flowed within the walls of ciceros house and the fates of the accused men he represented hung in the balance she went about her duties of honoring family ancestors making sacrifices to household gods and furthering the social advancement of their two children in all the times i had visited cicero i had exchanged only a few words with terentia on the rare occasions when circumstances obliged her to speak to me she had been polite but haughty projecting the unmistakable message that my social standing was too insignificant to warrant more than the bare minimum of conversation i think she found it unfortunate that her husband had to deal with a character as unsavory as myself the last time i had been in the house caesar had just crossed the rubicon and cicero and terentia had been frantically preparing to leave rome ordering secretaries to pack up scrolls in the library and issuing lastminute instructions to the slaves who would look after the house in their absence on this day the house was almost ominously quiet and still davus and i waited in the foyer only a short time before terentia herself appeared she wore a simple yellow stola and no jewelry her gray hair was pulled back in a tight bun a severe style that suited her austerely handsome face gordianus she said giving me a curt nod of recognition isnt this your soninlaw yes this is davus i said terentia appraised him coolly she herself had so far been notoriously unlucky with sonsinlaw her daughter tullia still in her twenties had already been once widowed and once divorced and was now on her third marriage to a dissolute but dashing young aristocrat named dolabella the betrothal had taken place while cicero was off governing a province and without his approval dolabella had apparently swept both mother and daughter off their feet as i watched terentias eyes linger on my brawny soninlaw a little longer than necessary i gathered that she was not immune to male charms cicero himself was said to have been heartbroken by the marriage having once defended dolabella on a murder charge and knowing what a vicious character the fellow was to compound ciceros embarrassment dolabella had since taken up arms for caesar he had been put in charge of caesars fleet in the adriatic where he had consistently been outmaneuvered and outnumbered by pompeys navy like so many families of the ruling class ciceros had been split down the middle by the civil war and if that were not enough rumor had it that dolabella had been utterly faithless as a husband carrying on a dalliance with marc antonys wife antonia you havent come to talk about this business with milo and caelius i hope she referred to the insurrection rumored to be developing in the countryside south of rome led by two of ciceros old associates marcus caelius and titus annius milo as a matter of fact no good because everyone thinks i should have an opinion about it and i refuse to give one both of those fellows have brought my husband nothing but grief over the years but at the same time who can blame them for reaching the end of their patience of course they shall both get themselves killed poor fools she shook her head then i suppose youve come about cassandra she said forestalling any apprehensions i might have had about coming directly to the point unlike her husband who could speak for hours and say nothing terentia was not a woman to mince words when i nodded she indicated with a gesture that we should follow she took us to the same room to which cicero had shown me on my last visit a secluded little chamber off the central garden but the room seemed different and strangely empty what was it cicero had told me this was one of the first rooms terentia decorated when we came back and rebuilt after clodius and his gang burned down the house and sent me into exile cicero had been quite proud of this room and its exquisite furnishings but where were those objects now i vaguely recalled a sumptuous carpet with a geometrical greek design now there was only cold stone underfoot there had been several fine chairs carved from terebinth with inlays of ivory now there were only a couple of folding chairs of the simplest sort there had been a finely wrought bronze brazier with griffin heads that too was gone the only decorations that remained were the ones that couldnt be removed the pastoral landscapes painted on the walls that depicted herdsmen dozing amid sheep and satyrs peeking from behind little roadside shrines terentia sighed ah how marcus loved this room this was where he entertained his most important visitorssenators and magistrates and suitors for tullias hand my husband brought you to this room the last time you called on him did he not his study was too crowded as i recallall those secretaries running about in a panic packing up his confidential papers there was a note of disapproval in her voice that implied the room was really too good for the likes of me and at the same time a note of resignation now that the room had been stripped of its exquisite furnishings and reduced to a shadow of its former luxury why not meet with me here the portable furnishings were gone and terentia wore no jewelry was she really in such dire straits that she was having to sell her personal possessions i myself had fallen into debt thanks to the hardships of recent months but it was a shock to think of a woman like terentia facing the same hard choices was she a kinswoman she said i beg your pardon the woman called cassandra was she kin to you no yet you conducted her funeral there must have been some relationship between you i made no reply terentia shrugged knowingly the presumptuous gesture reminded me of her husband and i felt a pang of resentment that she should assume she understood my connection to cassandra even if she was correct you must have known her as well i said why else did you come to see her funeral pyre yes i did have a slight acquaintance with her i asked about your connection to her only because i wanted to thank you for conducting her funeral its good that someone took the time and went to the expense of giving her a fitting ceremony and you showed good taste not too many musicians and mourners its unseemly when they outnumber the real friends and family i could hardly afford the few i did hire ah money she nodded understandingly and no longwinded speech before the funeral pyre i always think thats rather pretentious when its a woman dont you its fitting to list the accomplishments of a man of the world but if a womans lived a proper life what is there to say about her really at the end and if shes led an improper life the less said the better i cleared my throat if you came to her funeral cassandra must have been more than a passing acquaintance how did you meet her terentia pulled back her shoulders and lifted her chin she was not used to being questioned in the courts her husband had become famous for his penetrating interrogation of witnesses even the strongest men quailed before the fierce onslaught of ciceros questioning but in the daily course of married life when cicero had cause to question his wife and she had cause to remain silentwhen the battering ram met the iron wallwhich of them usually won that test of wills looking at that immovable jaw i suspected it was terentia her demeanor gradually shifted her shoulders relaxed she lowered her head she had decided to answer me if you know anything at all about cassandra you know that in the last few months she became something of a celebrity in society i used the word society loosely since no such thing exists at the momentwe are all adrift waiting for tomorrow it was my sister fabia whofor lack of a better worddiscovered her cassandra appeared one day in front of the temple of vesta fabia was the senior vestal on duty that day tending to the divine flame she heard a woman wailing outside she went to see what was happening these days who knows a woman might be raped or murdered in broad daylight on the temple steps that was how fabia came upon cassandra who was in the throes of one of her prophetic spells yes i know terentia gave me a curious look purely by cioncidence i said i happened to be in the vicinity of the temple of vesta that day i too heard cassandra i had never seen her before i wasnt sure how to react while i hesitated i saw fabia emerge from the temple with two other vestals i saw them take cassandra inside what happened next terentia gave me a long hard look my husband calls you an honest man gordianus the last honest man in rome in fact cicero honors me and dont think just because i never had occasion to formally thank you that ive ever forgotten the great favor you did for my sister all those years ago when you sniffed out the truth when some of the vestals were accused of breaking their vows fabia would have been buried alive if her accusers had succeeded in convincing the court that she conducted an improper liaison with catilina buried alive it still pains my heart just to think of it my darling halfsister was so young back then so beautiful there were those who actually believed she might have committed such a foul crime but you saved her life cicero called on you to investigate the matter and you proved that fabia was innocent this was not quite how i remembered the affair at the time it had seemed to me that catilinaa dissolute and charming upstart not unlike terentias soninlaw dolabellamight or might not have managed to seduce the tremulous young virgin fabia within the very confines of the house of the vestals but that was twentyfive years ago and a great deal had happened since and if terentia remembered one reality while i remembered another only the godsor fabia herselfcould have said which of us remembered the truth terentia gave me a long appraising look then seemed to come to some decision she clapped her hands a slave came running terentia gave the girl a whispered instruction and the slave ran off a few moments later i heard the rustling sound made by the folds of a voluminous stola and a moment later fabia herself appeared in the doorway she was magnificently attired in the full costume of a vestal her hair shot through with gray now was cut quite short around her forehead she wore a broad white band like a diadem decorated with ribbons her stola was white and plain but cut to hang from her body with many folds about her shoulders she wore the white linen mantle of a vestal sister i think you may recall gordianus said terentia fabia had grown older but she was a striking woman what had changed most was her manner i had met her at a time of crisis when she was young and confused and in terrible dangerand quite possibly guilty of the unspeakable crime of which she had been accused she had survived that episode and the travail had made her stronger presumably she had maintained her vow of chastity whether she had briefly interrupted it with catilina or not and that sort of discipline year in and year out and the state of childlessness it ensured was said to give a woman a special kind of strength fabia certainly looked imposing enough standing there in the doorway taking stock of her sisters two visitors her eyes swept over davus with hardly a pause and settled on me in her steady gaze i saw little to remind me of the frail girl i had once assisted at ciceros behest i remember you gordianus she said without emotion gordianus is here to ask questions about cassandra said terentia why said fabia i believe she was murdered i said fabia drew in a breath we thoughtbecause her mind was frailthat perhaps her body was frail as well we thought perhaps she died of some natural cause she was poisoned i said trying to make my face as rigid as fabias to hide the pain the words caused me poisoned whispered fabia i see but why have you come here what do you want from me you were one of the first women in rome to befriend her i said befriend not exactly i saw a woman in distress when i approached her when i heard the nature of her ranting i sensed the truththat she was a woman possessed of the gift of prophecy i took her into the temple of vesta where the goddess could keep her safe while the gift possessed her i acted as a priestess not a friend i acted out of piety not pity who was she where did she come from of her earthly origins i know nothing she herself had forgotten but how could you tell that she possessed this gift you speak of how could you tell that she wasnt simply mad fabia smiled faintly you may be wise in the ways of the world gordianus especially in the ways of men but this was a divine matterand a matter for women are you saying that men have no access to divine knowledge the augurs yes the college of augurs is made up of men and for centuries theyve passed down their own methods for reading omensstudying the flights of birds listening to thunder watching the play of lightning across the heavens the sky is jupiters realm and such signs come directly from the king of gods himself and the men elected to the college of fifteen likewise look for signs of the future by consulting the oracles in the ancient sibylline books but there are other more subtle ways in which the gods make their will known to us and by which they show us the paths to the future many of those methods fall outside the ken of men only women know only women understand and it was your understanding that cassandra possessed a true gift of prophecy when she was possessed she saw beyond this world the trojan cassandra heard messages from the other world our cassandras gift came to her mostly in the form of visions what she saw she didnt always understand and couldnt always put into words she herself made no interpretation of her visions she only related them as they occurred often she had no recollection of them afterward i should think such a gift would be rather unreliable producing more riddles than answers her visions required interpretation if thats what you mean not a suitable job for your college of augurs but if a person listened to her closely and if that person already possessed a genuine sympathy for the divine world a person like yourself i said yes i was able to make sense of cassandras visions that was why i arranged for her to come here to terentias house on more than one occasion and did she always prophesy almost always there was a method that helped to induce her visions what was that if she sat in a still darkroom and gazed at a flame almost always the visions would come to her and before or after you would give her food and drink of course we would said terentia she was treated as kindly in my house as any other guest even though you had no idea of who she really was or where she came from it was her gift that interested us said fabia not her family history or the name she was born with and when cassandra delivered these prophecies what did you make of them the two sisters exchanged a searching look silently debating how much they should tell me fabia finally spoke cassandra had many visions but there was one in particulara recurring vision of two lions battling one another over the carcass of a shewolf how did you interpret this vision the shewolf was rome of course the lions were pompey and caesar and which of them killed the other and ate the carcass neither i dont understand did they split the shewolf between them i imagined the roman world split permanently between two factions caesar ruling the west pompey ruling the east one world split between two roman empirescould such an arrangement ever last no no no said terentia you misunderstand tell him fabia the vision ended with a miracle said fabia the shewolf sprang back to life and grew until she towered over the lions who gave up fighting and meekly lay down together licking at each others wounds what did the vision mean fabia began to speak but terentia was too excited to remain silent dont you see its the best possible outcome everyone assumes that caesar and pompey must come to blows that one of them must destroy the other with rome as the prize but theres another possibilitythat both sides will come to their senses before its too late its one thing for romans to shed the blood of gauls or parthians but for romans to kill romansits unthinkable such madness offends the gods themselves cicero knows that its what hes been trying to tell both sides all along they must find a way to settle their differences and make peace thats what cassandras vision foretold for the moment rome appears paralyzed and helpless but the shewolf only sleeps and when she wakes shell show herself greater than either caesar or pompey they shall be awed by her shadow and there shall be a reconciliation between the two factions terentia smiled its my belief that cicero himself will broker the reconciliation its the real reason the gods guided his footsteps to pompeys camp not to fightwe all know my husband is no warriorbut to be on hand when the two sides finally do meet and to make them see the madness of their ways there shall be peace not war every day i look for a messenger to arrive with a letter from my husband bringing the glorious news fabia walked to her side and laid her hand on terentias shoulder the look on both their faces was transcendent i took a deep breath how did you learn of cassandras death she died in the marketplace didnt she said fabia people saw people recognized her news travels fast in the city yet neither of you came to my house to pay your respects they both averted their eyes well said terentia she was hardly of our i mean as you yourself pointed out we didnt even know her true name much less her family yet you came to see her burn an act of piety said fabia the burning of the body is a holy rite we came to witness that i lowered my eyes then looked up at the sound of another voice from the doorway aunt fabia i was wondering where youd gone ohi didnt realize you had company mother ciceros daughter tullia had suffered the misfortune of inheriting her fathers looks rather than her mothers and had grown from a spindly girl into a rather plain young woman the last time i had seen her had been at her parents house down in formiae the previous year while cicero was still trying to decide which way to jump she had been pregnant then and just beginning to show the child had been born prematurely and had lived only a short while a year later tullia appeared to be in good health despite her slender arms and wan complexion unlike her mother tullia wore several pieces of costlylooking jewelry including gold bracelets and a silver filigree necklace decorated with lapis baubles despite the drastic economies the war had imposed on the household i suspected that young tullia would be the last member of the family called upon to make personal sacrifices cicero and terentia had spoiled both their children but tullia especially actually said terentia my visitors were just leaving why dont you escort your aunt back to the sewing room tullia while i show them out certainly mother tullia took her aunts hand and led her from the room over her shoulder fabia gave me a long parting glance in lieu of a farewell tullias parting glance was at davus who reacted by shuffling his feet and clearing his throat i began to move toward the door but terentia restrained me with a hand on my forearm send your soninlaw on to the foyer she said in a low voice but stay here a moment longer gordianus theres something i want to show you in private i did as she asked and waited alone in the room gazing at the pastoral landscapes on the wall a moment later she returned carrying a scrap of parchment she pressed it into my hand read that she said tell me what you make of it it was a letter from cicero dated from the month of junius and headed from pompeys camp in epirus if you are well i am glad i am well do your best to recover as far as time and circumstances permit provide for and conduct all necessary business and as often as possible write to me on all points goodbye i turned the scrap of parchment over but that was all there was to it i shrugged not knowing what she wanted from me he advises you to recover i take it you were unwell a trifiea fever that came and went she said youll notice he doesnt even wish me a speedy recovery or the favor of the gods or any such thing merely do your best to recover as if reminding me of a duty and he charges you with conducting necessary business ha he expects me to run a householdtwo households my own and tulliason a budget of thin air just to make ends meet im selling off the best furniture and the finest pieces of jewelry handed down from my mother i dont understand why you showed me this letter terentia because you know my husband gordianus youve known him from the bottom up you have no illusions about him im not sure you like himim not even sure if you respect himbut you know him do you detect in that letter one shred of love or affection or even goodwill perhaps its written in code i wanted to say knowing from experience that cicero was prone to such tricks in his correspondence but terentia was in no mood for jokes if she had mustered the courage to bare her soul to me of all people i knew she must be in genuine distress i hardly think its for me to say what cicero felt when he wrote this letter she took the letter from me and turned away hiding her face the tensions in this householdyou cant imagine for months on end for years really fighting over whats to be done with young marcushis father insists hes to be a scholar in spite of the fact that all his tutors say hes hopeless and now the boys off to fight though hes barely old enough to wear a toga and dolabella choosing to side with caesar and carrying on with antonia behind our backsmy husband could hardly stand the mention of his name even before this trouble began how he hated the marriage and when tullia lost the baby the pain we all felt was unbearable but i could tolerate anything stand any trial if only i knew that marcus still her voice caught in her throat and she shook her head the hard fact of the matter is marcus no longer loves me he didnt love me when we marriedno woman expects that at the outset of an arranged marriagebut he came to love me and that love grew and lasted for years but now now i dont know whats become of it i dont know where it went or how to get it back too much squabbling over money too many fights about the children the bitterness of the times we live in terentia why are you telling me this because you knew her as well didnt you better than you let on you must have if you made the arrangements for her funeral yes i knew cassandra the prophecy fabia mentionedthere was more to it of a personal nature cassandra saw her vision of the shewolf and the lions doubled reflected in miniature she said as if in a distant mirror it was my household she saw in that mirrora reflection of the world at large the shewolf was our family the thing thats nurtured and sustained us through even the hardest times and the beasts were marcus and myself drawing blood from each other and fighting over the carcass of our own marriage but just as rome is greater than those who squabble over her this family is greater than its parts we shall make a reconciliation marcus will love me again cassandra said as much did she that was fabias interpretation fabia knows far more about such things than i yes but you knew cassandra was she genuine gordianus was she what she seemed to be can i trust the visions she saw in the throes of her gift the interview had been reversed now it was terentia seeking knowledge of cassandra from me i dont know i said and spoke the truth v as i can place the first time i saw cassandra because on that day word reached rome of caesars successful sea crossing so i can place the second time i saw her and the first time i actually spoke to her because of something significant that occurred on the same day it was on the morning in late februarius that marcus caelius set up a tribunal next to that of the city praetor trebonius and commenced his campaign to flout caesars will and become the radical champion of romes downtrodden before he left rome caesar by proclaiming edicts and bending the will of the senate had set in place a program to shore up the faltering roman economy the problems were many and daunting with the commencement of the war money had grown increasingly scarce even while prices soared the treasury of rome had been emptied to pay for caesars military campaigns no taxes were flowing in pompey had cut off all revenues from the east as well as vital grain shipments from egypt commerce was at a standstill ships horses and even handcarts had been commandeered for the war effort tradesmen were in distress because no money was in circulation free laborers were unable to find employment hungry slaves were growing restive shopkeepers and tenants were unable to pay their rents families whose heads of household had fled italy or joined caesars legions were being cheated by the bailiffs left to mind their masters property bankers were demanding payment of old loans and refusing to make new ones unscrupulous profiteers were squeezing all they could from the anxious people of rome i myself had gone increasingly into debt for the first time in my life it seemed that only a handful of people had money and that they had a great deal of it and that the rest of us had to go to them begging for loans at whatever terms they demanded simply to pay for the daily expenses of life i found myself indebted to the wealthy banker volumnius to such an extent that i despaired of ever being able to repay him to address these problems caesar had ordered that all property values and rents should be rolled back to prewar prices debtors were allowed to deduct all interest paid from the principal they owed arbitrators were appointed to settle disputes over valuations and bankruptcies an antihoarding law decreed that no one could keep more than sixty thousand sesterces of gold or silver out of circulation caesars efforts had been moderate and were moderately successful money began to circulate shops reopened and vendors reappeared in the markets the growing sense of panic among the general population began to subside and gave way to a grinding daytoday scrabble for sustenance there were thosesome because they truly despised the status quo and wanted to see it overturned and some because they themselves were hopelessly in debt and were desperate for a way outwho had hoped caesar would enact a far more radical program they wanted him to abolish all debts refund rents perhaps even confiscate the property of the wealthy and redistribute it to the poor these people were bitterly disappointed the man whom caesar had appointed to administer his economic program was gaius trebonius i had met trebonius the previous year in the roman encampment outside massilia where he was the commanding officer in charge of the siege he was a thoroughly competent and resourceful military man with a good head for figures and an intuitive sense of how the world works trebonius could look at a catapult and tell you why it wasnt working properly calculate the load and trajectory then watch the men loading it and pick the one best suited to give orders to the others he had conducted an efficient and successful siege and massilia had been subdued at very little cost to caesars legions in recognition of his competence trebonius was the man caesar put in place to run the city of rome in his absence some called treboniuss magistracy a reward for services rendered but it was not a job i would have wanted no doubt trebonius was able to profit immensely by accepting bribes from the disputants who came before him but i found it mindnumbing to imagine the endless caseload of property valuations and bankruptcy negotiations over which trebonius had to preside trebonius conducted this tedious business from a tribunal a raised platform in the forum he sat on his official chair of state a particularly ornate specimen in the traditional shape of a folding camp stool but heavily decorated with ivory and gold with four elephant tusks for legs secretaries and clerks hovered about him fetching documents consulting ledgers and taking notes on most days a long line of litigants awaiting their interview with trebonius wound snakelike through the forum among the contesting parties tempers were short and stakes were high not infrequently fights broke out up and down the line armed guards would rush to quell these disturbances before they could expand into a fullscale riot it was on a morning in late februarius that another magistrate marcus caelius strode into the forum carrying his own chair of state and attended by his own retinue of secretaries and clerks who quickly erected a raised platform only a short distance away from that of trebonius caelius mounted the tribunal and with a flourish unfolded his chair of state which was a notably simpler affair than that of treboniusthe ivory decorations were less ornate and without gold accents and the legs were not of ivory but merely of wood carved in the shape of elephant tusks by the example of his chair of state caelius was already proclaiming himself the standardbearer of austere roman virtue and the champion of the downtrodden still in his thirties slender as a youth and as handsome and charming as ever marcus caelius already had a long and checkered career in public life i remembered him best as ciceros unruly young protege learning the arts of rhetoric at the feet of his prim and proper master by day carousing and carrying on a debauched social life by nightmuch to the chagrin of all concerned especially when caelius found himself dragged into the courts by his exlover clodia who accused him of the murderforhire of a visiting alexandrian philosopher cicero rushed to his proteges defense the trial degenerated into a squalid exchange of namecalling and ultimately cicero managed to turn the tables on clodia by picturing her as a wanton incestuous whore out to ruin an innocent young man acquitted caelius had turned his back on the alluring clodia her rabblerousing brother clodius and the rest of their radical clique and had committed himself wholeheartedly to the cause of the socalled best people like cicero and pompey untiltugged back and forth like all the other bright ambitious young men of romehe finally cast his lot with caesar on the eve of caesars decision to cross the rubicon and commit himself to civil war caelius had ridden out of rome to join himleaving cicero once again much chagrined caelius became one of caesars lieutenants and served him well in the spanish campaign returning to rome saddled with debts he had hoped to be installed in the lucrative post of city praetor and made no secret of his bitter disappointment when that magistracy had gone instead to gaius trebonius caelius had been stuck with a lesser praetorship which put him in charge of adjudicating the affairs of foreign residents in the city perhaps caesar thought it wise to tuck an ambitious fellow of shifting loyalties like caelius in a safe niche giving him a job of minimal importance with not much to dobut caesar should have known that caelius with time on his hands was a dangerous man i happened to be in the forum along with hieronymus and the usual chinwaggers when caelius set up his mock tribunal next to that of trebonius i also happened to see the look of consternation on treboniuss face what was caelius up to i stepped closer to his tribunal the chinwaggers followed along caelius sat in his chair of state slowly turning his head to take in the long line of litigants waiting to see trebonius and the curious crowd that had begun to gather before his own tribunal for a moment his eyes fell on me our paths had crossed many times in the past he gave me a nod of recognition and flashed his dazzling smilethe smile that had once melted clodias heart and gotten him into endless other mischief over the years our eyes met for only a moment but i had a premonition of all the trouble he was about to hatch for himself and so many others caelius stood up from his chair of state a hush fell over the line of litigants waiting to see trebonius and the crowd that had gathered citizens of rome cried caelius he had one of the best orators voices in rome able to reach great distances with trumpetlike clarity why do you stand there lined up like obedient sheep in a fold awaiting your turn to be sheared the magistrate from whom you are seeking redress can do absolutely nothing to help you his hands are tied the law as it stands gives him no power to do anything but inflict more damage all the city praetor can do is look at the numbers you put in front of him shift them around a bitlike one of those confidence tricksters who haunt the markets shifting the cup that hides the nutand then send you home with less than you had when you arrived here the government of rome should be able to do better than that for its hardworking longsuffering citizens do you not agree at this there were scattered cries from those in the linesome mocking and jeering at caelius but others raising voices in agreement a few men at the back of the line unable to hear gave up their places to come see what was going on word quickly spread that caelius was staging some sort of political demonstration and the crowd rapidly grew as men arrived from all over the forum trebonius meanwhile went on about his business pretending to ignore caelius citizens of rome caelius continued think back and remember the situation just a little over a year ago when caesar crossed the rubicon and drove out the smug selfsatisfied scoundrels who were running the state for their own advancement did you not feel as i did a rush of excitement a thrill of anticipation when we were suddenly confronted by all the glorious possibilities of a bright futurepossibilities that had been unthinkable only a day even an hour before caesar took that first step across the rubicon all at once in the blink of an eye anything could happen how often in the course of a mans lifetime does such a prospect of boundless hope open before him the world would be remade rome would be reborn honest men would finally triumph and the scoundrels among us would be sent scampering off their tails between their legs insteadwell you know the bitter truth as well as i do or else you wouldnt be here today begging for crumbs from the magistrate in charge of the city nothing has changedexcept for the worse the scoundrels have triumphed once again is this what men fought and died forthe rights of rich landlords and moneylenders to grind the rest of us beneath their heels why has caesar not put a stop to this shameless situation citizens think of your own circumstances exactly a year ago and tell me are you better off today if your answer is yes then you must be a landlord or a banker because everyone else is worse off far worse our wrists have been slashed and the blood drinkers are sucking us dryand though i hate to say it it was caesar himself who put the knives in their hands a few men in the crowd most of them conspicuously wealthy booed and jeered along with their entourages of secretaries and bodyguards but these catcalls were drowned out by angry shouts of agreement that rose up from others some of those supporting caelius may have been hirelingsseeding a crowd with vocal supporters was one of the first lessons hed learned from cicerobut the discontent he was tapping into ran deep and the majority of the listeners were with him trebonius was still ignoring the situation trying to carry on his business but even the litigants with whom he was dealing were giving him only one ear as they bent the other to hear what caelius was saying citizens of rome caesar did us all a great service when he crossed the rubicon by that bold action he set in motion a revolution that will remake the state i myself proudly joined the cause i did my part on the battlefield fighting with caesar in spain now the military struggle continues in a new arena where we have every expectation of success but while we wait for news of the final victory we cannot remain idle we must continue to move ahead here in rome we must accomplish in his absence what caesar for whatever reasons failed to accomplish while he was here we must enact new legislation that will give genuine relief to those who truly need it there was a fresh outburst from the crowd its already been done shut up and go home shouted one of caeliuss critics hooray hooray for caelius shouted a rough fellow who had the look of an agitatorforhire the crowd grew so noisy that even caelius had a hard time speaking above the hubbub trebonius gave up on trying to counsel the two litigants before him and sat back in his ornate chair of state his arms tightly crossed a scowl on his face toward that end caelius shouted raising his voice to clarion pitch to make himself heard toward that end i shall begin by proposing a new law to stop all debt payments for a period of no less than six years i repeat i will ask the senate to impose a six year moratorium on all existing debts with no interest to be accrued in the meantime those who have been crushed to their knees by debt will finally be given a chance to get back on their feet and if the wealthy moneylenders complain that theyll starve then let them eat the wax tablets on which those loans were recorded there was a huge response from the crowd caelius his face flushed with excitementfor i think the crowd had grown even larger and more enthusiastic than hed expectedmanaged to make himself heard above the roar in anticipation of the passage of this law i have set up my tribunal here today i shall take up my post in my chair of state and my clerks shall record the names and circumstances of all citizens who are currently in debt so that their relief can be expedited immediately when the law goes into effect please form a line beginning on my right and with that he sat down on his chair of state looking quite pleased with himself the line of litigants waiting to see trebonius evaporated in the rush to join the line to see caelius why should any debtor waste his time haggling with the city praetor when caeliuss legislation if enacted would supersede whatever settlement trebonius decreed what a pack of fools grumbled onearmed canininus in my ear theres not a chance in hades the senate will pass caeliuss legislation if caesar had wanted such a thing hed have enacted it himself and if caesar doesnt want it the senate wont even consider it caelius is just stirring up trouble but why i said whats the point of setting off a riot for in fact a near riot had ensued angry cries and insults filled the air shoving matches and fistfights broke out snarling bodyguards formed cordons around their wealthy patrons who rushed to escape the rabble at a sign from trebonius glowering down at the chaotic scene from his chair of state armed guards set about trying to restore order though it was hard to know where to begin the crowd was like a boiling caldron bubbling over everywhere at once what was caelius up to canininus was right as long as the senate was in the palm of caesars hand caelius had no hopes of enacting his own radical programs nor as the praetor overseeing foreign residents did he have any legitimate business to involve himself with debt settlements was he simply trying to make treboniuss job harder out of spite or did caelius have a definite agenda in mind and a goal toward which he was moving hieronymus and i fearing the madness of the mob made our way to the edge of the crowd i acquired a couple of bruises from flying elbows but otherwise emerged unscathed at last we found a quiet place to catch our breaths beside the temple of castor and pollux that was when i saw cassandra for the second time the narrow platform that projected perpendicularly from the porch of the temple flanking the steps was just above our heads i happened to look up and saw her standing alone on the platform she was watching the seething crowd beyond us and took no notice of the two of us below her hieronymus saw the expression on my face and followed my gaze beautiful he whispered the word escaped from his lips as involuntarily as a breath and she was beautiful especially when seen from that low anglethe vantage point of a suppliant looking up at a goddess on a high pedestal to be sure there was nothing remotely divine or regal about her threadbare blue tunica or her unkempt hair but in her bearing there was a certain rare dignity that would command the immediate attention and respect of any man in me it commanded more than that i gazed up at her and felt my heart skip a beat a vaguely remembered sensation from my youth at once thrilling and painful shot through me and i suddenly felt like a man a third my age i rebuked myself for such foolishness i was an old married man she was a beggar and a madwoman to boot she happened to look down and saw us staring up at her that was the first time i looked into her eyes and saw that they were blue her face was blank without expressionthe face of athena as molded by the greek sculptors i thoughtand that in itself seemed odd considering that she was watching a riot i thought of a bird watching the activities of humans below her apathetic to their violence against one another she gave a jerk i thought that we had frightened her somehow and that she was about to bolt instead her eyes rolled back and her knees buckled under her she swayed lost her footing and tumbled forward to say that cassandra quite literally fell into my arms would be true but misleading lending the moment a romantic flair in no way evident at the time in fact when i saw that she was about to fall i felt a quiver of panicnot for her but for myself when a man of my years sees a woman falling toward him from a considerable height he thinks not of heroism but of his own frail bones still i suspect that the instinct to catch a falling woman is strong in any man no matter what his years hieronymus reacted just as i did and it was into both our arms that she tumbled the moment was painfully awkward hieronymus and i essentially collided and an instant later cassandra fell onto us and all three of us very nearly collapsed to the ground in a heap if we had been actors in a comedy by plautus the staging could not have been more hilarious by some miracle of balance and counterbalance hieronymus and i both stayed on our feet together we managed to lower our dazed cargo to her own unsteady feet supporting her arms to keep her upright the breath was knocked out of me a sharp pain shot up my spine spots swam before my eyes none of this mattered when cassandra fell swooning against me one hand across her face and the other across her bosom to observe the form of a beautiful woman at a distance is one thing to abruptly feel a warm solid breathing body enclosed within your arms is another thing altogether it was precisely for this to experience such moments of human contact that the gods made us that was what i felt in that instant even if i did not consciously realize it cassandra gradually came to her senses and drew back from me but only slightly still remaining in my embrace over her shoulder i saw hieronymus looking rather envious of me i looked in cassandras eyes and saw again that they were blue but not quite the shade i had thought there was a bit of green in them or was that only a momentary trick of the light her eyes fascinated me was i did i fall she asked it seemed to me that her latin carried a slight accent but i couldnt place it you did from up there i nodded toward the platform and you caught me we caught you said hieronymus crossing his arms petulantly cassandra glanced at him over her shoulder she gently pulled herself from my embrace are you all right i said can you stand of course what happened did you faint im perfectly all right now i should go she turned away go where i reached for her arm then stopped myself where she went was none of my business perhaps she thought so too for she made no answer yet it seemed to me that there must be more to say whats your name they call me cassandra she looked back at me her expression briefly animated after she recovered from her daze had become remote againgoddess like birdlike or simply the affectless face of a madwoman but that cant be your real name i said you must have another must i she looked confused for a moment then turned and walked away with a slow imperturbable stride her head and shoulders erect seemingly oblivious of the men who occasionally ran across her path in flight from the continuing melee before the tribunals of the rival magistrates what an extraordinary woman said hieronymus i merely nodded vi my interview with terentia and the vestal fabia had yielded some new information about cassandra if not much i decided next to consult fulvia the twicewidowed i had rendered her a service in the past by investigating the murder of her husband clodiusas partial payment she had given me mopsus and androclesand i could expect at least a cordial welcome at her door and so after leaving ciceros house and returning to my own for a frugal midday meal and a fitful nap during the hottest part of the day i set out as the sun was lowering to the house of romes most famous widow as before i took davus with me for protection as we walked down the familiar streets of the palatine i was reminded of the days when davus first entered my household as a slave only shortly after i first met fulvia as a stunned and grieving widow it seemed a memory from another age could it actually have been only four years ago that clodius was murdered on the appian way rome had been wracked with riots clodiuss radical supporters had burned the senate house pompey had been called upon to restore order and given almost dictatorial powers he had exploited the situation to engineer a series of trials that banished many of his enemies from rome upsetting once and for all the precarious constitutional balance between his interests and those of caesar in retrospect the murder of clodius had been the temporal fulcrum between the moment when civil war seemed unthinkable and the moment when it became inevitable the murder of fulvias first husband had been the beginning of the end of our tattered republic her grief for clodius had been deep and genuine they had been true lovers i think as well as partners in a broader sense for fulvia as a politicians wife had always been the exact opposite of ciceros terentia she was a woman with opinions plans projects allies and enemies she plotted and schemed alongside her husband and served as his closest advisor his death had robbed her not only of a husband and a father to their two children it had robbed her of her role in the political sphere women can play no part in the senate or the magistracies women cannot vote by law they cannot even own property in their own names although clever women find ways around such technicalities just as women who care about the course of worldly events find ways to wield their influence usually through their husbands while clodius lived fulvia had been one of the most powerful people in rome male or female when he died she was like a strong man suddenly paralyzed and stricken mute but a woman as intelligent wealthy and ambitious as fulviawho was also a striking woman if not beautifuldid not have to endure the helplessness of widowhood for long to a certain kind of man her combination of qualities must have been almost maddeningly attractive when she consented to marry gaius curio many people thought that she had found the perfect match he had been a part of her circle for many years one of that coterie of ambitious bright young men with voracious appetites and endless schemes to remake the world in their own image men like dolabella clodius caelius and marc antony some said that fulvia actually would have preferred antony had he been available and not already married to his cousin antonia and that fulvia had settled on antonys boyhood friend some said lover curio as the next best thing but most agreed that curio was in fact the better choice because he was more malleable and less inclined to debauchery than antony like antony curio early on allied himself with caesar and never wavered in his devotion or relented in proselytizing on caesars behalf indeed it was largely curios influence that had brought marcus caelius into the fold on the eve of the war caelius and curio had ridden out together to be by caesars side when he crossed the rubicon but while caelius had ultimately been relegated to a minor praetorship in rome curio had been given command of four legions when caesar headed for spain he dispatched curio to take on the pompeian forces led by cato in sicily cato disorganized and unready like the rest of the pompeians abandoned the island without a fight curio flush from an easy conquest left two of his legions in sicily and with his other two pressed on to africaand that was where curios troubles began some said his conquest of sicily had been too easy that it led to overconfidence and rash judgment some said it was curios youth and lack of military experience that led him into king jubas trap others said it was simply bad luck curios african campaign began well enough first he set about taking the rich seaport of utica which was held by the pompeian commander varus a small band of numidian soldiers dispatched by king juba attempted to come to the citys aid but curio drove them off he baited varus to meet in battle outside the city there curio made his first mistake which only by a stroke of good luck proved not to be fatal he sent his foot soldiers into a steep ravine where they might easily have been ambushed but in the meantime his cavalry managed to sweep away the enemys left wing and varuss mensent fleeing back to the citymissed an easy opportunity to destroy their enemy such a near miss might have given curio pause but instead it emboldened him he prepared to lay siege to utica in the meantime king juba had mustered his army and was marching to relieve utica juba had close ties to pompey having been a patron of pompeys father and he had cause to hate curio who in recent years had proposed that rome should annex numidia by force curio received news of jubas approach alarmed he sent to sicily for his other two legions but deserters from jubas army told him that only a small body of numidians were advancing curio sent out his cavalry who skirmished with jubas vanguard from the intelligence he received curio thought that this vanguard was the whole numidian force thinking to destroy it so that he could get on with the siege he hurried out with his legions to do battle the season was blisteringly hot the march over burning sands the romans blundered into the entire numidian army they were surrounded and slaughtered a handful of curios men managed to escape curio too might have fled and saved himself but he refused to desert his men a survivor bringing news of the disaster to caesar shortly after caesars return from spain reported curios last words ive lost the army caesar entrusted to me how could i face him curio fought until the numidians killed him they cut off his head and sent the trophy to king juba fulvia was once again a widow pondering her situation imagining her mood i felt some hesitation as i approached her house the structure itself presented a daunting aspectthe giant fortress like monstrosity that clodius had erected on the palatine the opulent headquarters from which he had directed the street gangs under his command steep terraces overgrown with roses and glimmering with manycolored marble veneers flanked the huge forecourt that had served as a rallying place for clodius to address his supporters the iron gate stood open and as davus and i strode across the forecourt gravel crunching under our feet i gazed ahead at the flight of steps leading up to the broad porch and saw a black wreath upon the massive bronze door nine months into her widowhood fulvia was still in mourning for curio we mounted the steps a huge bronze ring on the door served as a knocker davus lifted it and let it fall delivering a dull reverberating clang we waited so far as i could see no peephole opened in the door but i had the uncanny sensation of being observed clodiuss passion for installing secret passages concealed doors and hidden spy holes had been notorious eventually i heard the sound of a bar being thrown back on the other side of the door and then it slowly opened creaking slightly on its hinges an athleticlooking slave ushered us inside then quickly closed the door and let the heavy wooden beam fall back into place barring it securely i had been in this foyer before in the hours and days that followed the murder of clodius it appeared that curio in becoming the new master of the house had made no changes the floors and walls were of highly polished marble red draperies shot with gold threads framed the passageway that led to the atrium where the ceiling supported on soaring black marble columns rose to the height of three stories in the center of the atrium a shallow pool was decorated with shimmering mosaic tiles of blueblack and silver picturing the night sky and the constellations the actual sky visible through an opening far above was just beginning to deepen to the rich blue of twilight i turned to the slave who had admitted us tell your mistress that gordianus the mistress knows who you are and why youve come he said with a sardonic smile follow me he led us through halls and galleries decorated with wall paintings and statues slaves moved quietly about lighting braziers and lamps set in sconces on the walls i was fairly certain that i had traversed the same passageways before but the house was so sprawling that i couldnt be sure eventually we mounted a flight of steps and were shown into a room with large windows their shutters thrown open to admit the last of the days light the walls were stained green and decorated with blueandwhite borders in a geometrical greek design through the windows i saw the golden light of the lowering sun glinting across palatine rooftops and lending a warm glow to the westfacing temples atop the distant capitoline hill the reflected glow flooded the room giving it a cozy feeling despite its lofty ceiling and spectacular view fulvia and her mother sempronia sat before one of the long windows dressed in stolas of darkest blue a tiny childcurios sonwas attempting to walkon a blanket at the womens feet fulvias other children her son and daughter by clodius were not in the room your visitors mistress said the slave thank you thraso you may go as fulvia turned her gaze to me she lifted a stylus from the wax tablet upon which she had been writing and laid the stylus and tablet aside there was a popular catchphrase regarding fulvia and her ambition she was not born to spin indeed it was hard to imagine walking into her presence and finding her in the midst of some common female occupation instead like a man of affairs with numerous ideas and projects to keep track of she kept a wax tablet and stylus about her her mother sempronia despite her hard features seemed the more maternal of the two she ignored davus and me while she clucked and cooed and reached out to the little boy on the blanket encouraging him to rise to his feet and attempt another faltering step thank you for seeing me fulvia but im curioushow did you know it was me when i never announced myself she glanced at her son who managed to stand upright for a moment before tumbling forward onto his hands and knees then she turned her gaze back to me theres a hidden peephole at one end of the porch thraso took a good look at you then ran to give me your description it could only have been you gordianus nose like a boxers a full head of iron gray hair shot with silver but eyes that sparkle like those of a man half his age a beard trimmed by a wife to suit herself actually my daughter diana trims my beard these days but i feared you might have forgotten me fulvia i never forget a man who might be useful to me she turned her gaze to davus but i dont think ive met this other fellow shoulders like a titans said thraso but a face like narcissus this is davus my soninlaw thraso also told me that you know why ive come surprising since im not sure of that myself she smiled arent you i saw you at the funeral you must have seen me ive been halfexpecting you to call on me this is about cassandra i presume sempronia abruptly clapped her hands a slave girl came running sempronia planted a kiss on her grandchilds forehead then told the girl to take him from the room as he was carried out the boy began to cry his wails echoed and receded down the hallway sempronia bit her forefinger and fidgeted but fulvia showed no reaction i hope you didnt send the boy away on my account i said of course not said sempronia finally looking at me and raising an eyebrow at the notion that i could consider myself important enough to merit any action regarding her grandson since i had last seen her one of her eyes had become cloudy white if anything it seemed to fix on me more penetratingly than the other under her gaze i quailed a bit strange that a woman who could be so tender to a child could be so intimidating to a grown man if were going to talk about the witch it isnt fitting for a manchild to be present she said is that what cassandra was a witch of course said sempronia did you think she was a mere mortal woman she was most certainly mortal i said quietly she was murdered wasnt she said fulvia with both of them now looking at me i realized that the daughters gaze was no less piercing than her mothers yet somehow it gave me no displeasure to be looked at so openly by fulvia sempronias gaze was caustic it stripped a man naked fulvias gaze seemed cleansing as if its purpose was to strip away whatever veils of confusion or misunderstanding might intervene between us her eyes were intelligent lively inviting no wonder she had secured two of romes best and brightest if unluckiest to become her husbands why do you think cassandra was murdered i asked because i know the curious circumstances of her death how she died suddenly in the marketplace in your arms was it poison gordianus they say she was wracked with convulsions they my eyes and ears your spies fulvia shrugged theres very little that happens in rome that doesnt reach me what else do you know about her murder if youre asking me who might have done such a thing or how or why i cant tell you i dont know but a woman like cassandra might have been dangerous to any number of people she couldnt just see the future you know she had visions of faraway events could she see the future she was a witch said sempronia interrupting her tone implied that i had already received my answer and should pay closer attention a witch you say did she cast spells place curses heal the sick she did none of those things in this household said sempronia but who can say what powers she possessed she most certainly was able to see beyond the present moment and the four walls surrounding her how do you know that sempronia opened her mouth to answer but fulvia raised a hand to silence her let me tell him mother sempronia huffed why should we tell this fellow anything have you forgotten mother when clodius was murdered gordianus was among the first to come to this house to pay his respects he cared enough to seek out the truth but hes an old lackey of ciceros sempronia spat the name fulvias eyes narrowed she and cicero were old and very bitter enemies its true that you made your reputation working for cicero isnt it gordianus i wouldnt say that i would say rather that cicero made his reputation while i was working for him i was never his lackey over the course of many years weve had our ups and downs of late ive lost touch with him completely i havent heard from him in months yet you visited his house only today noted fulvia i raised an eyebrow i told you gordianus theres little that happens in rome that i dont know about yesyour eyes and ears yet you dont know who killed cassandra fulvia smiled ruefully im not omniscient i do have blind spots i nodded yes i went to ciceros house this morning to see terentia for the same reason ive come to see you you made an appearance at cassandras funeral which suggests that you must have known her in more than a casual way who was she where did she come from i addressed fulvia but her mother answered she was an egyptian witch it stands to reason all the most powerful witches come from egypt these days they carry greek blood in their veinswhich explains cassandras blond hair and blue eyesbut unlike the modernday greeks they havent forgotten the old magic the traditions are still kept alive in egyptthe making of amulets the memorizing of curses the arts of fortunetelling cassandra was an egyptian witch we dont know that for a fact mother objected fulvia its only a supposition your eyes and ears never told you where cassandra came from i asked where she was concerned i was strangely deaf and blind admitted fulvia it was as if cassandra dropped to earth on a cometand for all i know she did when did you first encounter her many months ago how many it was in november of last year if that were so fulvia had encountered cassandra even before the day in januarius when i saw the vestal fabia take her into the temple are you sure of course i am how could i forget that bitter day her face darkened just how much shall i tell you gordianus everything yes why not she raised a hand to silence her mother who seemed poised to object caesar was still here in rome flush from his triumphs in spain and massilia word from the adriatic sea was not so good dolabella was powerless against pompeys fleet but from sicily she sighed and closed her eyes for a moment from sicily there had come the excellent news of my husbands conquest of the island followed by the even more promising news that gaius had pressed on to africa she lowered her eyes and cleared her throat every day here in this house we waited for word of his progress a messenger arrived with the news that he had taken utica we rejoiced then a second report arrived that contradicted the first saying that utica was still under siege but would fall into gaiuss hands at any moment the mood in this house was one of joyful restraint we lived in anticipation of great and glorious news my mother made a joke that soon her voice broke soon gaius would have a new honorific to append to his name and we would thereafter be the family of gaius scribonius curio africanusconqueror of africa fulvia shook her head its bitter to be left behind a woman should be allowed to follow her husband onto the field of battle i raised an eyebrow pompeys wife went with him when he fled from rome i understand shes with him even now i dont mean thatto follow along like baggage in a better world i should have been allowed to go along with gaius not merely as his wife but as his cocommander yes i know the notion is absurd no centurion would ever take commands from a woman but i should have been thereto counsel gaius to help him weigh the advice of his subordinates to evaluate intelligence from the field to plot strategy if i had been there sempronia touched her arm to comfort her fulvia gripped her mothers hand and went on instead of going with him i waited here in rome is there any torture worse than waiting and not knowing some days i felt as if i were riding a stormtossed ship pitched between hope and despair until i thought id go mad other days were so still and quiet it was like being trapped on a ship in flat waterhours passing without a word without a sign only endless waiting and watching and wondering until she drew a deep breath as i said it was on a day last november i had been to the house of one of gaiuss relatives to see if they had had any news of him but they knew no more than i did i was on my way home passing through the forum in my litter the curtains were drawn no one could see in but because it was a bright day and the curtains are not entirely opaque i could see out at least well enough to tell that we were passing by the temple of castor and pollux i was thinking about gaius of course then i heard a voice it was a womans voice it came from outside the litter but the quality of that voice was so strange and because of the words it spoke it seemed almost to come from inside my head the voice said hes dead now he died fighting it was a brave death those words sent such a chill through me that i thought i might faint it suddenly seemed dark inside the litter as if a cloud had swallowed the sun i called on the litter bearers to halt my voice must have been very nearly a scream the litter stopped so abruptly that i was pitched forward thraso stuck his head through the curtains looking alarmed he asked me what was wrong did you not hear it i asked he looked at me blankly a womans voice i said she spoke to me as we passed the temple thraso looked back toward the way we had come theres no one there he said except a crazy woman muttering to herself and pacing the temple steps bring her i told him he went to fetch her a few moments later he pulled back the curtains of the litter and i first saw cassandra she was dressed in a filthy tunica she looked frightened and confused thraso had to hold onto her tightly or else she would have fled you spoke to me just now i said as my litter passed the steps she shook her head and looked at me as if i were the mad one you spoke i insisted say it again say the words you said before the voice that emerged from her was so otherworldly that even thraso quailed a bit it didnt match her body you see the voice was too old for such a young woman it didnt quite seem to come from her open lips yet there was nowhere else for it to have come from it was uncanny unnerving hes dead now she said he died fighting it was a brave death the words were even more disturbing the second time i heard them they shattered me i began to shiver and weep i ordered thraso to take me home as quickly as possible what shall i do with this one he asked i could see he wanted nothing to do with the woman but i told him to bring her along with us he made a face but he tightened his grip on the womans arm he let the curtains drop and ordered the bearers to hurry homeward when we arrived i told thraso to bring the woman here to this room she was even dirtier than i had realized her clothes were ragged and worn she had a distinct odor as if she hadnt been to the public baths in days in a voice as normal as anyone elses she told me she was hungry there was nothing menacing or uncanny or even odd about her she seemed intimidated at being in such a grand house and rather pathetic i told thraso to fetch some food and drink for her then i asked her what she had meant by what she said and what did she tell you she said she couldnt remember saying anything at all i was already shaken i became angry confused i pressed her she cowered and wept suddenly she began to quiver and twitch her eyes rolled back she spoke again in that strange hollow voice that seemed to come from the ether she described to me a desert plain blinding sunlight a hot wind she heard men shouting saw flashing swords heard the sizzle of blood spattered on hot sand she saw gaiusit could only have been gaius for she described him to me perfectly his curling black hair his glittering blue eyes his defiant jaw the half smile that would light his face when prospects were grim she saw him clothed in shimmering armor though his head was bare for he had lost his helmet he was alone cut off from his men surrounded slashing his sword through the air until finally he fell they swarmed over him and then fulvia no her mother gripped her arm with white knuckles but fulvia pressed on and then she saw gaiuss face rise up again as if by some miracle he had gotten to his feet even amid all that murderous swarm not only that but he was smiling grinning like a boy she said but then then she saw the vision more clearly and realized there was no body below his neck which was severed and dripping with blood his head was being held aloft by the numidian who had beheaded him he only seemed to smile because because the fist clenching his black curls pulled taut the muscles of his face opening his mouth baring his teeth throughout this long recitation fulvia kept her eyes on mine as if daring me to look away at last i did unable to bear the pain i saw there it was not the glimmer of eyes brimming with hot tears but a hard dry grief tearless and cold fulvia drew a deep breath as abruptly as it began the spell ended she was simply a meek beggar again dazed hungry with no recollection of what she had just said i was stunned shocked speechless food was brought i watched her eat she was like a beast with no manners at all her odor offended me so i sent her to be bathed i ordered that her old rags should be burned and told one of my slaves to find a proper tunica for her the slave found an old blue one that suited her when i saw her cleaned and properly dressed i realized how beautiful she was i told thraso that she should be given a place to sleep and that he should keep watch on her at dawn thraso came to me and told me that the woman had slept the night through quite soundly i myself had slept not at all i told thraso to keep the woman in the house to offer her whatever food and drink she wanted to lock her in her room if he had to but i was the one who behaved like a prisoner i shut myself in this room i saw no one spoke to no one not even my mother i simply waited sick with dread from these windows i watched the sun rise and fall over the city i passed another night without sleep it was on the next daytwo days after the woman related her vision to methat caesar summoned his inner circle and told them that he had just received word from africa marc antony came at once to give me the bad news i received him in this room my heart beating so hard that i could barely hear him he knew i would demand to know every detail he carefully recited everything the messenger had told caesar the battle in the desert the stifling heat gaiuss last stand even the fact that he had lost his helmet before the enemy swarmed over himevery detail matched what the woman had told me strangest of all the messenger reported a rumor that king juba had laughed when he received gaiuss head not out of spite but because gaius appeared to be grinning at him do you understand gordianus the woman had seen everythingeverythingas clearly as if she had been there i contained my emotions as best i couldafter all i was prepared for the worst even before he arrivedbut still i wept antony did his best to comfort me in the end i think it was i who comforted him he and gaius had been close ever since they were boys as close as two men can be even closer in some ways perhaps than gaius and myself eventually i told antony about the woman in my house and the fact that she had already delivered the news to me two days before antony said that was impossibleword had only just reached caesar and caesar would tell antony before anyone else i tried to tell him how precisely the woman had seen the details of gaiuss death but antony wouldnt listen we had drunk quite a bit of wine by then and his senses were muddled he wasnt in a listening mood i put him to bed in the guest quarters then went to find the woman but she was gone she had vanished somehow even with thraso watching her i realized that i knew nothing about her not even her name or where she lived if indeed she had a fixed abode i thought of sending thraso to search for her but at that moment i saw no point she had told me what i wanted to know and the knowledge had only served to make me wretched for two sleepless nights before the news arrived from a more trustworthy source and also also i was a little frightened of her she was a witch of some sort if she could see events in africa who knew what other powers she might possess she herself seemed not to understand her gifts and how to use them she might be dangerous i didnt want her in my house i nodded taking in all that fulvia had told me that was the last you saw of her then something in her eyes changed as if a door that had been open was abruptly shut she seemed evasive thraso reported to me later that she had become something of a fixture in the forum and the markets and that people had given her a name cassandra i asked him to find out more about her but there was very little he could discover except that others in the city besides myself were availing themselves of cassandras gifts others you saw themthe women who appeared at her funeral if you want to find out what they knew about cassandra ask them yourself if you do discover something of interest about herif you do find out who killed hercome tell me gordianus ill pay you well for the information id like to know simply out of curiosity ive been entirely open with you after all as if to contradict her words the faint smile that had been absent from her face since she began the tale of how she met cassandra returned and i had the feeling that she was holding something back from me you never saw her again facetoface she shrugged perhaps briefly but that meeting was of no particular consequence theres nothing more of any significance i can tell you she sighed im tired now i think i shall rest a bit before taking dinner im afraid i must say farewell gordianus to you and to your taciturn but very ornamental young soninlaw thraso will show the two of you out she turned her gaze from me to the window after a moment her mother did likewise together they stared at the framed image of a distant cloud lit by the twilights last blush of lurid pink against a back drop of lapis lazuli a scattering of faint early stars twinkled in the darkening firmament the slave showed us down the stairs and through the long hallways we had reached the soaring atrium when another slave running at a trot caught up with us and told us to wait thraso raised an eyebrow then saw the reason we were being detained at the far end of the hallway we had just traversed coming toward us at a surprisingly fast clip for a woman her age was sempronia as she drew closer her gaze fixed on me as if i were a rabbit and she a descending hawk with a curt wave she dismissed the slaves we stood at the base of one of the immense black marble columns that supported the skylight far above our heads sempronia drew close to me speaking in a hoarse whisper the vast space swallowed up her voice without giving back an echo my daughter was not entirely forthcoming with you gordianus i raised an eyebrow afraid that any comment might put her off for some reason despite her earlier suspicion she had decided to trust me what did she want to tell me sempronia frowned my daughter has endured a great deal of suffering in her life its because shes so ambitious of course even more ambitious than i was at her age she flashed a thin smile that contained no warmth i sometimes think if only shed been born a boy but of course if that were the case shed probably have gotten herself killed alreadylike clodius like curioor perhaps not fulvia is smarter than either of those fellows were thats a curse for a woman to be smarter than her husband fulvias carried that curse twice in a row clodius and curioat least their ambitions and their dreams matched hers if not their wits she shook her head now shes a widow again with children from both her marriages children who must be given the best possible chance in the world thats about to be created on some battlefield far from rome what if pompey wins that battle i said she drew a sharp breath through her nostrils such a disaster doesnt bear considering no caesar will win im sure of it because cassandra said so sempronia gave me another chilly smile perhaps and if caesar does triumph what then my daughter will need another husband of course and this time she must choose the right one a man as shrewd and ruthless as she is a man who knows how to seize an opportunity a survivor a man who can give my grandchildren their rightful place in the new world about to be born i nodded fulvia saw cassandra a second time didnt she yes because cassandra could give her a glimpse of the future exactly the witch could see across time as well as space but it wasnt fulvia who brought cassandra here the second time i sought her out fulvia didnt want her here she was afraid to know her future afraid it would match the misery of her past but i told her that a woman must use whatever tools she can to make her way in the world if the witch could give us even a faint glimpse of what lay in store then we must seize that knowledge and use it when did you bring her here a little less than a month ago and what did cassandra foresee for fulvia glory power riches my daughter shall rise to the first place among all the women of rome even ahead of calpurnia caesar will triumph but he cant live forever he must have a successor i frowned you mean to say that caesar will be a king and pass his crown to another that was what cassandra foresaw nothing that specific when her visions came she didnt always see them clearly or understand what she saw she couldnt even recall them afterward she could only describe them as they came to her and when you brought her here the second time what did she see a look close to rapture crossed sempronias face rather than softening her features it made them even more severe and intimidating she saw fulvia in a stola of purest purple striped with gold with a golden diadem on her head beside fulvia but in her shadow stood a mana great brawny beast of a man dressed in battle armor spattered with blood and holding a bloody sword he too wore a diadem on his head the witch was unable to see his face clearly but she saw the image on his breastplate and on his shieldthe head of a lion marc antony i whispered who else its their destiny to marry i could have told fulvia that myself without the witchs help the fact that antony was already married seemed to be of no consequence to her what else did cassandra see the look in sempronias eyes made my blood run cold like antony fulvia was holding a bloody sword in one hand and in the other sempronia bared her teeth a head severed at the neck as curios head was severed i whispered yes but this was the head of another the head of the man my daughter hates most in all the world was she speaking of milo who had been exiled for the murder of clodius and who at that moment was said to be raising a revolt in the south with marcus caelius or king juba who had laughed when he received curios head i whispered their names but sempronia shook her head and looked at me scornfully the witch described him clearly enough not as a portrait painter or a sculptor might but in symbols lips dripping with honey she said a tongue like a snakes eyes like a ferrets a nose with a cleft like a chick pea cicero i whispered his name was taken from the word for chick pea yes it was ciceros head that fulvia held aloft caesar triumphant but dead marc antony a king and fulvia his queen and cicero beheadedwas that to be the future of rome my heart sank i suddenly realized why sempronia had confided in me it was not that i had somehow won her trust she still suspected me of being ciceros lackey perhaps his spy in the next moment she made her desire explicit go then gordianus go back to that bitch terentias house and tell her what ive just told you soon enough my daughter will put away her mourning garb to put on a bridal stola then it shall be terentia wholl be dressed in mourning long ago cicero made himself the enemy of this household he never missed a chance to slander clodius while clodius lived and he slandered him even more viciously after he was dead he defamed curio as well even as he pretended to be his friendcasting aspersions on curios love for marc antony telling pompey that curio had sided with caesar because he was a craven opportunistwhen the truth is that curio died a heros death loyal to his cause until the very end but soon enough cicero shall regret the suffering his words have caused in this house my daughter shall see to that her object achieved sempronia called for thraso and ordered him to show us out as we were walked down the steps the great bronze door clanged shut behind us davus turned to me wideeyed and asked fatherinlaw was cassandra really a witch i dont know davus but if witches truly exist i think you may have just met one vii the third time i saw cassandra was again in the forum it was the day the consul isauricus broke marcus caeliuss chair of state only a few days before word had reached rome that marc antony departing almost three months after caesar had successfully made the same sea crossing and was on his way to join his forces with those of caesar it could only be a matter of time until caesar and pompey met in a grand confrontation all rome was abuzz with speculation meanwhile marcus caelius had been setting up his rival tribunal close to that of trebonius for over a month the riot that had ensued on the first such occasion had not been repeated since caelius instead of orating and inciting the crowd was quietly going about the business of taking down the names and recording the situations of the citizens who lined up to see him each day these citizens were mostly debtors who hoped to take advantage of the legislation caelius had promised to put before the senate imposing a sixyear moratorium on debt collection the fact that such a proposal had no chance of being made into law as long as caesar controlled the senateand the fact that caelius had no legal authority to set up a tribunal much less record a registry of debtorsdid nothing to deter the long line of desperate men who came to see him each day times were hard those who came to caelius were clutching at any hope for relief meanwhile not far away trebonius went about his legitimate business of litigating between the debtors and creditors who lined up to see him each day some of the debtors once they finished their business with trebonius went directly to join the queue to see caelius in such uncertain times who could say whether the agreements struck by trebonius would hold and what debtor would dare to miss out on the relief that caelius was promising however slim the possibility that it might come to pass since that initial riot things had been mostly quiet in the forum and the other magistrates including trebonius had seen fit to let caelius go about his fictitious business i imagine that the official attitude worked out in private among themselves by caesars minions went something like this caelius was essentially putting on a mime show a bit of political street theater and so long as there was no further violence the best thing to do was simply to ignore him on this particular day caelius arrived later than usual so that by the time he appeared escorted by a larger than usual retinue and proudly carrying his own chair of state there was already a large crowd awaiting him as well as a long queue at the nearby tribunal of trebonius i was there in the forum as well idly passing the time with davus and hieronymus and the usual gang of chinwaggers caelius happened to pass very close to me and caught my eye as he did so he recognized me and nodded then he raised an eyebrow and smiled faintly and i knew that he was about to hatch a new bit of mischief the portable tribunal was erected the milling crowd began to form a queue caelius mounted the tribunal and with a flourish unfolded his chair of state but instead of sitting he remained standing and turned to face the crowd a thrill shot through the assembly felt by everyone there in the same instant just as a flash of lightning is perceived by all eyes at once farther away in the queue of men awaiting conference with trebonius heads turned to look toward caelius trebonius himself hearing the sudden murmur of anticipation looked up from the ledger before him and peered toward caelius an expression of mingled exasperation and dread crossed his face he summoned one of his clerks and whispered in the mans ear the clerk nodded and disappeared caelius proceeded to pace this way and that across the small space of the tribunal his hands on his hips his eyes scanning the crowd but he remained silent the effect was to unsettle the crowd even more those at the back pushed forward above the general murmur a few men scattered through the crowdplanted hirelings most likelybegan to shout speak marcus caelius they cried and what have you come to tell us marcus caelius and silence silence everyone shut up marcus caelius is about to speak caelius continued to pace the tribunal in silence he lifted a fist to his mouth and furrowed his brow as if debating whether to speak or not the crowd pressed in closer more and more men began to shout until their cries joined in unison and became a chant speak caelius speak speak caelius speak speak caelius speak at last caelius stopped pacing looked out over the crowd and raised his hands for silence some of the rowdier members of the crowd continued to chant for the sheer pleasure of making noise but they were quickly silenced by elbows in their ribs and swats to their ears citizens said caelius not long ago you heard me speak from this platform about the legislation i have introduced before the senate demanding a sixyear moratorium on the repayment of loans i regret to tell you that as of today the senate has yet to act upon my proposal this was greeted by a chorus of catcalls and boos caelius raised his hands to quiet the crowd in the meantime my esteemed colleague the magistrate in charge of the cityhe indicated trebonius with a sweep of his handhas continued to make settlements on behalf of the moneylenders and landlords whose interests he so doggedly represents this prompted a considerable uproar previously caelius had avoided making such a direct attack against trebonius now his rhetorical claws were bared and the crowd was ready to see blood drawn he recommenced pacing back and forth not as before as if brooding and indecisive but with his chin up and a swagger in his step he looked sidelong in the direction of trebonius a smirk on his face and a glimmer in his eyes indeed the magistrate in charge of the city has taken every possible action to ensure that my proposed legislation is never even considered by the senate much less ratified by that obsequious body of sycophants not a man among them appears to have a will of his own they are all to a man the tools of a single intelligenceincluding the magistrate in charge of the city he is after all a soldier first and a public servant second i presume he was given his orders before the giver of orders left rome and now he mindlessly carries them out with no regard to the suffering and distress that surrounds him is he blind is he deaf caelius looked toward trebonius shaded his brow and peered across the way as if trebonius were miles distant rather than a mere stones throw away well im fairly certain he isnt blind because hes looking this way to be sure he squints a bit scribbling those enormous sums on behalf of the moneylenders has strained his eyes i suspect this garnered a huge laugh from a crowd that was eager for any excuse to laugh at trebonius across the way trebonius narrowed his eyes even more the crowd before caeliuss tribunal roared with laughter hes not entirely blind thenbut perhaps hes deaf suggested caelius shall we find out help me citizens call out his name with me like this trebonius open your eyes trebonius open your eyes the crowd enthusiastically took up the chant raising their voices until the words rang through the forum creating a noise like thunder as they echoed off the stone walls of temples and shrines such a noise would carry all the way to my house atop the palatine hill i imagined bethesda and diana going about their business in the kitchen or the garden and wondered what they would make of it trebonius open your eyes trebonius open your eyes trebonius open your eyes i looked at the object of this refrain and saw him shift nervously in his chair of state as if the ivory inlays beneath his buttocks had grown hot to the touch even though the words themselves were not directly threatening it must have been unnerving for trebonius to hear his name cried aloud by so many hostile voices in unison as caelius had said he was more experienced as a military man than a politician more accustomed to orderly chains of command than to the volatile dynamics of the roman mob at last caelius raised his arms the chanting gradually dwindled to silence citizensi think he heard you cried caelius the response was a tremendous roar of shouting and applause i looked about and realized that the crowd had grown considerably larger the chant had served not just to send a message to trebonius but as a clarion call to summon others from all over the forum and the surrounding hills caelius raised his hands for silence the crowd quieted at once trebonius trebonius trebonius he said rolling his eyes and feigning utter exasperation in you we find that three goods make a single bad the crowd always appreciative of a terrible pun especially at the expense of a mans name roared with laughter caelius was now pitching his voice to carry as far as possible and the object of the joke hearing it clearly rose redfaced to his feet clenching his fists at his sides but citizens caelius continued i did not come here today to speak ill of my fellow magistrate he is merely an obedient soldier following orders nor did i come today to rail against the sycophants in the senate who are too concerned with pleasing their absent masterand enriching themselvesto give a thought to your suffering no i came here today for the purpose of delivering good news yes good news if you can believe it because in the midst of the gloom that hangs over us there is a ray of hope i have been thinking about the sixyear moratorium on debt collection that i have proposed to the senateand that the senate so far has willfully ignoredand i have decided it does not go far enough no not nearly far enough the good people of rome must have even more relief from the crushing burdens imposed upon them not just by the moneylenders but by the landlords those wealthy tenement owners to whom a man must hand over his lifeblood just to keep a roof over his head today citizens i am putting forward a new proposal beginning retroactively from the month of januarius all landlords will remit a full years rent to every tenant what does this mean it means that all rents paid since januarius will be refunded to you and all rent due for the rest of the year will be forgiven it means that the renters of rome shall finally have some money in their pocketsreturned to them by rich landlords who wont miss it it means that you shall have the security of knowing that you cannot be evicted that you shall have a roof over your head in the uncertain months ahead the moneylenders and the landlords and their minionshe shot a look at treboniuswill tell you that such a measure will utterly destroy the economy of rome dont believe them theyre only looking out for their own narrow interests a sound economy is based on confidence and mutual trust and this proposal as radical as it may sound is the only possible way to restore the roman peoples confidence in the future and their bond of trust with the propertyowning classes you the common citizens of rome have endured a great deal due to the upheavals of the last year you have borne the brunt of the suffering you have suffered enough we must all make sacrificesnot just the common people of rome but also the wealthy who look down from their lofty perches and think only of how to make themselves more wealthy let them feel the pinch for a change this prompted a roar of approval from the crowd some resumed the chant of trebonius open your eyes the mood seemed more boisterous than angry merely by voicing such a radical proposal no matter how unlikely the chance that it would become a reality caelius had given them hope and raised their spirits suddenly the mood changed the roar died down the chanting stopped there were cries of outrage hisses and catcalls from the outskirts of the crowd i rose on tiptoes trying to see over the heads that blocked my view suddenly i was lifted aloft davus had clutched me from behind and raised me up as if i weighed no more than a child such are the advantages of having a soninlaw with the strength of an ox i saw a cordon of bodyguards flanking some important personageone of the chief magistrates apparently because the retinue was headed by lictors the ceremonial escorts of the superior magistrates each lictor bore over his shoulder a bundle of birch rods called fasces which served as a sheath for an ornately decorated ax the use of lictors and their ceremonial weapons supposedly dated back to the time when rome was ruled by kings normally within the city bounds the lictors would have borne their fasces without axesbut these were not normal times and i clearly saw the flash of highly polished iron ax heads above the bundled rods i also caught a glimpse of the man whom the lictors surrounded and saw that his toga had a broad purple stripe i counted twelve lictors and knew that the newcomer could only be caesars fellow consul publius servilius isauricus in caesars absence isauricus was the sole head of the state thus had caesar observed the ancient tradition of electing two consuls one to govern rome while the other conducted military operations in the field even though everyone knew that it was caesar alone who determined the policies of the state isauricus was nothing more than a figurehead a caretaker charged with enacting caesars will while caesar was absent he and caesar were very old friends and it was a sign of caesars complete faith in isauricus that he had contrived to have him elected to serve alongside him as consul for the year i remembered seeing trebonius before caelius began his harangue dispatch one of his clerks with a message evidently isauricus had come in response to treboniuss alarm once again caelius was threatening to spur the mob to a riot and something would have to be done the lictors pushed and shoved their way toward caeliuss tribunal the churning raucous crowd might have overwhelmed them by sheer numbers but in the face of the disciplined lictors the crowd became confused and disorganized the lictors had another advantage for the first impulse of a roman citizen no matter how riled is to show respect to anyone bearing fasces and to defer to any magistrate accompanied by lictors even in that disaffected crowd a patriotic respect for roman authority ran deep the lictors reached the tribunal where caelius awaited them with hands on his hips isauricus emerged from the cordon of armed men and mounted the tribunal to stand before caelius his face was very nearly the same color as the purple stripe on his toga next to caeliusa handsome man in his thirties worked up by his speech to his highest pitch of charismatic radianceisauricus looked like a sputtering hopelessly outoftouch old grandfather in a comedy by plautus the weird theatricality of the moment was reinforced by the fact that the two of them stood on a platform not unlike a portable stage all they needed were grotesque masks and a bit of back ground music to turn them into comic actors isauricus shook his finger at caelius and spoke in an angry voice keeping his pitch too low for the crowd to hear apparently i was not alone in imagining the two as actors because a wiseacre in the crowd began to shout speak up we cant hear you youre swallowing your lines laughter rippled through the crowd and someone started a new chant isauricus speak up isauricus speak up the consul abruptly looked out at the crowd furious to hear his name shouted at him so rudely caelius who had so far kept a sardonic smirk on his face appeared to lose his temper in the same instant the two commenced shouting at each other whatever they said was drowned out by the swelling roar of mingled yells and laughter from the crowd but it was easy enough to imagine isauricus was telling caelius that he had no legal authority to set up a tribunal in the first place and that by interfering with a fellow magistrate in the commission of his duties he was coming very close to treason caelius was probably resorting to more personal insults i could easily imagine him calling isauricus a finger puppet with the hand of caesar up his back side whatever caelius said to isauricus it must have cut to the quick the consul overcome by a burst of fury abruptly picked up caeliuss chair of state and lifted it over his head it looked as if he intended to strike caelius with it and even headstrong caelius quailed a bit stepping back and raising his arms to protect himself instead isauricus slammed the chair down in front of him and seized the fasces from the nearest lictor he extracted the ax from the bundled rods and raised it above his head the crowd let out a collective gasp davus unable to see because he still held me aloft cried what is it fatherinlaw whats going on by hercules i said i think were about to see a murder sunlight glinted on the upraised ax the crowd fell silent except for a few scattered screams my blood ran cold the mob had rioted for days and had burned down the senate house after clodius was killed on the appian way now caelius had taken up clodiuss mantle as champion of the downtrodden what would they do if they saw him murdered in cold blood by the consul of rome right before their eyes caelius staggered back his mouth open in shock his face as white as a vestals stola isauricus brought down the axnot on caelius but on caeliuss chair of state with a great crash the seat was shattered isauricus raised the ax and brought it down again there was another crash and bits of wood went flying in all directions for a brief instant a look of relief crossed caeliuss face only a moment before he had been staring into the mouth of hades just as quickly relief was replaced by utter outrage in a heartbeat his face turned from bloodless white to deepest red he cried out and rushed toward isauricus oblivious of the ax the consul wielded at once lictors swarmed onto the tribunal unsheathing their axes and interposing themselves between the two magistrates a moment later to defend caelius men from the crowd jumped onto the tribunal isauricus and caelius were separated and caelius was pulled from the tribunal into the crowd his supporters wanted to protect him but it seemed to me they were subjecting him to the risk of being trampled to death enough davus i said ive seen enough set me down we almost got caught in the last riot and i dont want to make that mistake again but it was too late a vortex of humanity swirled all around us men screamed shouted laughed faces flashed before me some jubilant some angry some terrified the crowd spun me about until i grew dizzy i looked for davus but saw him nowhere hieronymus too had vanished along with all the familiar chinwaggers i gazed about disoriented and confused unable to spot a familiar landmark i saw only a blur of strange faces and beyond them a confusion of walls and buildings the crush of bodies squeezed the breath out of me lifted me off my feet carried me along against my will i saw spots before my eyes and then out of nowhere incongruous amid so much ugly chaos i saw the face of the woman called cassandra in her eyes i saw no panic but quite the oppositea deep serenity oblivious of the madness around us was that a sign of madness to appear so calm amid such insanity i lost consciousness when i came to my senses another face confronted me for a moment i was confused because he looked so much like cassandrathe same golden hair the same blue eyes the same incongruity of a young handsome face burned by the sun smudged with dirt and surrounded by unkempt hair i gave a start and uttered a cry the young man looming over me gave a start in response and grunted a figure standing behind him stepped into view it was cassandra dont frighten him rupa hes had a shock i rose on my elbows i was lying on a threadbare pallet in a tiny room with a dirt floor the only light came from a narrow window set high in one wall and from the doorway where a ragged cloth that served as a curtain was pulled back to show a shadowy hallway beyond from the hallway came a smell compounded of boiled cabbage urine and unwashed humanity from the window came the sounds of a couple arguing a baby crying and a dog barking there was also a peculiar persistent not entirely unpleasant sound of metal clinking and clanging against metal somewhere in the distance i had been inside enough such buildings over the years to know exactly the sort of place in which i found myself it was one of the ruder tenements in the city probably located somewhere in the subura where the most wretched of romes citizens live tightly packed into close quarters at the mercy of unscrupulous landlords and each other the young man called rupa looked at me not unkindly then rose from the pallet and stood he was a big fellowas big as davus which meant he was big enough to have carried me from the forum to the subura over his back that must have been what happened for there was no injury to my tunic or my flesh to indicate i had been dragged cassandra stepped forward i suppose youll want to know where you are she said in the subura i imagine not far from the street of copper pots she raised an eyebrow i thought you were unconscious while rupa carried you here i was i dont remember a thing since i fainted in the forum but i know the smell of an apartment in a subura tenement and i suspect that persistent clanking from outside is the sound of copper pots hung up for sale striking against one another the sound they make is slightly different from the sound made by vessels of iron or brass or bronze given the angle of the light from that window and the distance of the sound id say that were about two blocks to the north of the street of copper pots since were on the ground floor of the tenement how do you know that because the floor is of made of packed dirt yet theres a tiny bit of blue sky visible through that window above the roof of the yellow building next door therefore the yellow building cant be more than two stories tall rather short for a tenement in the subura i think i know the one are we in the red building next to it the one where theres always a barking dog chained next to the entry exactly she smiled and i was thinking youd wake up and be completely disoriented like a like an old man who lost consciousness merely from being spun about a bit no my wits are back or at least such wits as i have left she smiled i like you she said without showing the least awareness of how such a smile and such words coming from such a beautiful young woman could suddenly light up the whole world for a man rupa wrinkled his brow and made a signal to her with one hand rupa says he likes you too her smile wavered you see rupa is mute yes i gathered that for many years my elder son eco was unable to speak i caught myself since i had disowned meto at massilia i no longer had an elder and a younger son eco was my only son and metofor me meto no longer existed cassandra saw the expression on my face she frowned youve lost a child she said i raised an eyebrow surprised she shrugged im sorry i shouldnt have said that but its true isnt it i cleared my throat yes in a way ive lost a son or misplaced him she saw that i cared to say no more and changed the subject are you hungry i was in fact but i had no intention of taking food from anyone who clearly had as little to spare as cassandra and her companion i shook my head i should go my family will be wondering whats become of me i stood up feeling unsteady are you sure youre well enough when a man reaches my years he learns to accommodate small complaints rather as a rich man learns to accommodate unwanted relatives its only a bit of lightheadedness nothing i should think compared to the spells from which you suffer she lowered her eyes youre talking about that day i fell into your arms i wasnt sure youd remember its not every day a beautiful young woman falls into my arms nor am i likely to forget the previous time i saw you a previous time you were in front of the temple of vesta you did more than faint on that occasion did i she wrinkled her brow i suppose i must have they told me about it later i dont really remember have you always suffered such episodes she looked elsewhere id rather not talk about it forgive me i had no right to ask its only because what i shrugged you fell into my arms now ive fallen into your arms more or less its enough to make a fellow think the gods must want the two of us to meet she raised an eyebrow im only joking you mustnt blame an old fellow for flirting a bit i glanced at rupa who seemed amused in that moment i suspected he was not her lover what then a servant relative friend she smiled you were kind enough to catch me that day today in the forum when i saw you in distress i wanted to return the favor good that makes us even then but i havent introduced myself have i my name is gordianus she nodded they call me cassandra yes i know dont look surprised youre not entirely unknown in the forum people tend to notice a person such as you i dont suppose cassandra is your real name as real as any other im being presumptuous forgive me i should go she turned away from me had i offended her embarrassed her i hoped for one more exchange of glances before i left the room one more look from her troubled blue eyes but she kept her face averted rupa led me into the hallway and i passed from the world lit by cassandras presence into the world of boiled cabbage and barking dogs at the front door where a molossian mastiff was tethered to a post rupa abruptly turned back giving me no sign at all not even a nod i felt a prickle of envy he was returning to cassandra i walked home alone feeling a touch of lightheadedness but of a different sort than i had felt before a similar sensation but curiously pleasant as i passed down the street of copper pots the clanking of so much metal seemed to echo the muddle in my own head an unexpected brush with beauty makes a man feel happy and carefree and foolish you will no longer spend your idle hours loitering in the forum too dangerous so declared bethesda that night in the dining room off the garden on my safe return she had met me with an icy stare and spoken hardly a word but her display of anger was only a show hieronymus drew me aside and informed me in a whisper that she had been frantic and close to tears when he and davus returned to the house without me confronted with bethesdas decree i sighed and unable to think of a rebuttal picked up my wine cup instead if i argued that i would always take davus along to protect me she would only point out that davus had failed to do so that very afternoon already outmaneuvered i soon found myself outnumbered mothers right said diana davus does his best to look after you papa she gave her husband a melting look and patted his hand he stopped chewing for a moment and actually blushed then she turned her stern gaze back to mebut even davus cant be responsible if youre going to start fainting and wandering off in a daze i didnt wander off i was carried off by a pair of friendly strangers to a safe place but papa you might as easily have been carried off by strangers who werent so friendly those two might have robbed and murdered you and thrown your body in the tiber and wed never have known what became of you daughter you tempt the fates bethesda tore off a bit of flat bread and threw it over her shoulder to distract any malicious and presumably hungry spirits who might be listening hieronymus cleared his throat and came to my rescue by changing the subject i was quite shocked by that harangue from marcus caelius today not only what he saidthat was radical enoughbut how he said it baiting trebonius and the senate in such an open fashion yes now that marc antonys left italy to join caesar caelius has grown considerably bolder i stole a glance at bethesda who seemed more interested in the flat bread in her hand politics bored her he very nearly spoke ill of caesar himself said hieronymus he never spoke caesars name i pointed out to be sure admitted hieronymus but his insinuation was clear caesar was once the champion of the common people but now hes their enemy once he stood against pompey and the socalled best people but now hes shown himself to be just another politician in the service of the rich which means that the people need a new champion i said and marcus caelius is offering himself for that role i nodded for a newcomer to the city hieronymus youre a shrewd judge of roman politics politics here are different from politics in massilia all this rabblerousing and rioting would never have been tolerated there but politicians are the same everywhere they have a nose for power they can smell it the way a hungry man can smell bread when they see an unclaimed loaf they rush to seize it for their own thats what caelius is doing he looks around and sees that a great many people are greatly unhappy and he moves to make himself their champion its been done before i pointed out by catilina by clodius by caesar himself but i dont see how caelius can accomplish anything except to get himself killedas catilina and clodius did his problem is simple he doesnt have an army perhaps he means to get himself one i had been about to take a sip of wine but stopped short what an idea hieronymus a third army vying for control of the world i shook my head ridiculous of course caelius has a little military experience but not nearly enough to challenge either caesar or pompey unless those two finish each other off said diana whos to say that one or the other must return alive from greece word could reach rome tomorrow that caesar and pompey are both dead who would take control of rome then i put down my cup by hercules sometimes daughter you see what i cant see even though its right before me youre right a gambler like caelius doesnt go through life thinking of all the ways he might fail he narrows his thoughts until he can perceive the one path by which he might succeed then bends all his will toward that path heedless of the odds against him if he loses he loses everything but if he wins he wins the world said hieronymus viii on the day after i called on terentia and fulvia i rose early taking care not to disturb bethesda ate a light break fast then called mopsus and androcles to come and help me put on my best toga again the wool was a bit dusty from my outing the previous day after it was properly draped about me i stood very still while mopsus gave it a good brushing androcles stood to one side you missed a spot he said i did not said mopsus yes you did right there along the bottom i dont see anything thats because youre blind i am not did i say blind i meant to say stupid i clapped my hands boys stop your squabbling mopsus get back to work mopsus began brushing again you missed another spot said androcles are you deaf the master told you to shut up didnt you hear him he said no such thing he told you to get back to work i took the ivory brush from mopsus and gave androcles a sound smack on the head he gave a cry and reached up to rub the spot mopsus clutched his sides and brayed like a donkey i gave him a smack as well satisfied that i was presentable i told the boys to wake davus if he was not yet up and to dress him meanwhile i looked in on bethesda she was still sleeping but fitfully tossing and muttering as if in the grip of a fever i felt her brow but it was cool was she suffering physical discomfort or simply in the throes of a nightmare i decided not to wake her sleep was her only respite from the malady that had been plaguing her davus was waiting for me in the garden looking rather cramped in his toga we left the house and set out on the rim road along the crest of the palatine hill it was a fine morning already warm but not yet hot golden sunlight slanted through a towering yew tree near my house birds sang and flitted amid the branches a little farther on i paused to take in a view of the forum below and the hills beyond to the right i could see the shallow valley of the subura crowded with ugly tenements more to the center and farther away atop the pincian hill i saw flashes of sunlight on the tile roof of pompeys grand house now deserted and awaiting its masters return to the left above the capitoline hill a lone eagle was circling the temple of jupiter beyond the capitoline i caught a glimpse of the tiber a gold ribbon lit by the sun with wharves and markets along its banks in a single sweeping view i saw a microcosm of the whole worldpalaces and slums the dwellings of prostitutes and vestal virgins temples where the gods were worshipped and markets where slaves were sold what a remarkable city i said aloud davus responded with a nod for good or ill rome was the center of the world in spite of all the worlds troubles and my ownmy crushing debts my rupture with meto bethesdas mysterious ailment the murder of cassandrasuch a view on such a morning could still inspire me with that curious sense of hope that young men feel when they rise and greet the world on a sunny summer morning and anything seems possible where are we going fatherinlaw today davus i intend to pay a visit to marc antonys wifeand perhaps to his mistress as well i had never met antonia and knew her only by reputation she was antonys first cousin and his second wife his first had been fadia the daughter of a wealthy freedman that marriagefor love people saidhad scandalized antonys family even though fadia brought him a handsome dowry she had been his social inferior but fadia died young and antonys second marriage had done much to repair his reputation among the roman aristocracy antonia was handsome welltodo and antonys exact social equal but she also shared his weakness for adultery while antony had scandalized all italy in the last year by traveling about with his mistress the actress cytheris antonia had been carrying on with ciceros dissolute soninlaw dolabella according to the chinwaggers in the forum the only bond still holding antony and antonia together in marriage was their sixyearold daughter it was her shrieking i heard from within when a hulking slave opened the door at antonias house a moment later beyond the slave a tiny naked figure streaked by followed by a stooped hobbling nurse unable keep up with her charge i will not i will not the little girl cried then screamed again is there anything so earpiercing as the scream of a sixyearold girl i covered my ears the girl dashed off before the door slave could ask our names or business antonia herself appeared following after the child and the nurse it was early in the day so i was not surprised to see her wearing only a simple yellow stola without jewelry and with her hair undressed hanging down almost to her waist with or without adornment she was a beautiful woman i thought of poor plain tullia and wondered if the rumors about dolabella and antonia were true she looked past the door slave at davus and me put her hands on her hips and raised an eyebrow are you from my husband no my name she narrowed her eyes from dolabella no then what business have you got knocking on my door at such an early hour no waiti know you from somewhere dont i ah yes youre the one who buried cassandra i am gordianus isnt it the socalled finder ive heard of you from my husband youve got the son who goes about with caesar taking his dictation dictation from the dictator she uttered a crude laugh i winced at this reference to meto before i could answer the naked child came racing by in the opposite direction antonia stooped down captured her and held her wriggling until the nurse arrived as the screaming child was led off antonia shook her head shes as willful as her father the little monster inherited his temperament and my looks dont you think juno help the man who marries her she saw the nonplused expression on my face and laughed then her smile faded i suppose youre here to talk about cassandra come along then theres a nice spot of sun in the garden and peacocks to amuse us there were indeed peacocks in the garden three of them all strutting about with their fans in full display chairs were brought along with pitchers of water and wine antonia had not yet taken her break fast she told the serving slave to bring enough for all three of us when i saw the plate of delicacies he delivered i let out a gasp i had not seen a date stuffed with almond paste in months the plate was heaped with them it seemed that the shortages that plagued ordinary citizens did not affect the household of caesars righthand man davus gobbled up a date he licked his fingertips and was about to reach for another when i stopped him with a look antonia laughed let the big fellow eat his fill i have more dates and figs and olives than i know what to do with before he left to join caesar my husband spent months traveling all over italywith that strum pet of his for all the world to gawk atand he did a very good job of gathering provisions rather like a squirrel gathering acorns for the winter ostensibly his mission was to cow the locals and impose great caesars will but he was really just extorting everyone hes a pirate at heart you know a lying drinking whoring pirate she snapped her fingers and pointed to her empty cup the slave poured a measure of wine antonia put it to her lips before he could add an equal measure of water my husband wont last you know his days are numbered i dont think caesar much liked the way antony ran italy in his absence parading about with his whore bleeding the countryside getting stinking drunk and generally making a spectacle of himself once caesars disposed of pompey hell come back to run the show himself if they havent been disposed of already hell deal in short order with this insurrection that milo and marcus caelius are hatching he wont need a drunken bully to do it for him antony shall simply be an embarrassment to him she narrowed her eyes i should have divorced him before he left italy that would have been the smart thing to do but perhaps if im lucky the gods will make me a widow soon enough and spare me the bother anything can happen on a battlefield they say she paused in her tirade to drain her cup then continued i only married him because my mother wanted me to what a stroke of fortune she said fadia that awful creature he married is dead and nows our chance to rehabilitate your dear cousin and youre just the one to do it the whole family is counting on you you always got along so well as children ha i remember him pulling my hair and i remember kicking him in the shins if only id kicked him a bit higher up hard enough to crack his eggs id have done everyone a favor whats the matter big fellow dont you care for the pickled figs davus caught with his mouth full finished chewing and swallowed i prefer the dates he said as you wish more dates she called to the slave and a bit more wine for me to the brim thats better where was i she looked at me crossly youre all alike you men worthless id divorce my cousin and marry dolabella but hes no better id only be spoiling my own amusement good lovers make bad husbands as the saying goes poor tullia that stupid girl worships him she has no idea she must be blind and deaf dolabella treats her with utter contempt id say she deserves it the little fool but didnt the gods curse her enough already by giving her that lout cicero for a father and dolabellas no more promising than antony in the long run hes made a complete mess of the naval command caesar gave him hes likely to end up like wretched curio with his head on a stickof no use to me whatsoever if that happens ah well but you didnt come here to talk about me did you she gave me a sidelong heavylidded look i began to suspect she had taken her first cup of wine even before we arrived i had found her rather goodlooking earlier and her candor refreshing but with every word she spoke and with each sip of wine she became more and more unattractive until her vivacity seemed merely vulgar a weakness for wine was her cousins vice perhaps it ran in the family i came here to talk about cassandra i said quietly ah yes cassandra well she never fooled me not for an instant i felt a prickling across the back of my neck a premonition of something unpleasant but i had come to seek the truth after all or at least antonias version of it what do you mean all that folderol swooning and sputtering and rolling her eyes back in her head oh she was very convincing ill grant her that youre talking about her fits of prophecy antonia made a rude exhalation prophecy thats what she wanted everyone to believe well i didnt fall for it oh perhaps a little at first ill admit i was curious who wasnt everyone was talking about her and how shed been invited into some of the best homes in rome because of her gift my dear husband himself was convinced of it after caesar he was the first man in rome to know about curios death yet when he went to fulvia to give her the bad news fulvia already knew because cassandra had told her now that was a bit uncanny i confess she suddenly looked thoughtful as if reconsidering her earlier judgment then she shook her head but no the woman was mostly a fake perhaps not entirely perhaps there was a tiny bit of truth to this notion that she had a gift for prophecy ill say that she was nine parts a fake and one part genuine what do you say to that im not sure didnt you know the truth about her finder you buried her if i knew everything about cassandra already believe me i wouldnt be sitting here now antonia perceived an insult and bristled then smiled its all coming back to me now the things my husband told me about you and your dictationloving son youre awfully impertinent arent you my husband admires that in common people she sighed its a holdover from his younger days when he was married to that daughter of a freedman fadia he comes from one of the best families in rome yet hes always had a taste for mucking in the dirt i suppose it gives him a certain advantage when it comes to endearing himself to the soldiers under his command they appreciate the common touch and no one is more common than my husband when hes in his cups belching and farting and fondling that actress cytheris do you know where he first saw her performing some lewd mime after dinner one night at the house of volumnius the banker from that moment on the two of them commenced to make fools of themselves from one end of italy to the other he even wanted to take her along with him when he left italy to join caesar can you imagine i told him not to be an idiot caesars locked in a lifeordeath struggle to make himself master of the world and youre going to show up at his headquarters with your plaything in tow both of you reeking of wine and perfume do you know what caesars going to tell you for jupiters sake antony put away your sword for once in your life and get rid of that whore she had strayed a long way from the subject of cassandra i cleared my throat ah but you came here to talk about that other actress didnt you actress cassandra i mean id sooner call her that than a seeress come to think of it perhaps she was an actress like cytheris i mean a trained professional that would explain explain what she looked at me glumly all right ill tell you ill tell you everything hades where is that slave ah there you are i see you skulking behind that pillar get over here and pour me more wine mind the peacocks dont bite you and bring more stuffed dates for the big fellow it amuses me to watch him eat she poured another cupful of wine down her throat there now thats better back to cassandra cassandra the fake cassandra the actress maybe i kept hearing so much about her that finally i went looking for her one day when was this she shrugged late in the month of martius not long after antony left italy i still hadnt received word about the crossing whether hed made it safely or not that was my excuse to seek her out with that particular question in mind anyway i found her near the marketplace by the river sitting on a wharf with her feet dangling over the edge mumbling to herself pretty i suppose in a common sort of way but awfully scruffy antonia wrinkled her nose ordinarily i cant stand being near such people but i forced myself to make an exception in her case i sent a slave to ask her to join me in my litter but the slave came back and said that cassandra wouldnt respond shes in some sort of trance the stupid slave told me so i actually climbed out of the litter and went to her myself on your feet i said youre coming with me ill have you washed and fed and then well see what youre good for cassandra looked up at me and didnt say a word i was about to speak more sternly to her but then she slowly got to her feet and followed me back to the litter she didnt say a word all the way back to my house she just sat there and stared at me and let me chatter on and on like a fool imagine that i muttered under my breath as i said i sought her out especially to ask about antony and whether hed made the sea crossing successfully i thought id test her you see when a messenger did arrive with the news id see whether shed been right or wrong but she was more slippery than i expected how so antonias face darkened when we arrived here at the house i offered her food she took nothing that surprised me id heard she was a beggar arent beggars always hungry was my food not good enough for her i offered her clean clothes she ignored me i offered her money she wouldnt take it i began to think she truly was mad i asked her what she wanted she looked at me and said nothing youre the one who brought me here youre the one who wants something i very nearly struck her the impertinent bitch but i decided to test her they say you have second sight i said so why should i need to speak to you at all cant you tell what i want from you simply by using your gift she said it doesnt work like that then how does it work i asked she explained that over time shed discovered a way to induce her fits by staring into a flame so i had a lamp brought she sat on one side i sat on the other and that was when she put on her little performance a performance what else shall i call it she suddenly pitched forward knocking the lamp aside and gripped my forearm with both hands how dare you touch me i said but she wouldnt let go she only squeezed me harder until i gave a cry some of the slaves came running but when they arrived they kept their distance they were afraid of her you seemore afraid of her than of me i could hardly blame them her back was arched and her head was thrown back her eyes were wide open but showed only white she trembled and shuddered and pitched her head about as if her neck had snapped but she never loosened her grip on my arm did she speak oh yes she babbled nonsense for a while what sort of nonsense antonia raised an eyebrow why are you so keen to know finder and how is it that you dont know already you buried her werent you in league with her in league with her how do you mean surely you know more about her than i do why do you think ive allowed you into my house because i thought you could tell me what cassandra was really up to did she put on those performances merely to ingratiate herself to obtain a bit of food when she was hungry perhaps a few coins or some castoff clothing did she think she might find a permanent patron someone who would keep her indefinitely so long as she kept uttering that mindless drivel or was it more sinister than that was she deliberately worming her way into this household and that looking for things to steal you always have to watch that sort i knew better than to leave her alone even for a moment or perhaps she was looking for information she could use to her advantage i can imagine her more credulous victimsciceros wife comes immediately to mindopening up to her and spilling all sorts of embarrassing secrets secrets that could be used against others later was that it was cassandra a black mailer i thought about this i dont know did she try to black mail you no but i wasnt so foolish as to tell her anything i didnt want her to know how are you so certain that she was merely putting on a performance antonia sighed you really dont know then i suppose ill tell you after she finished her prophesyingafter i threw her outi decided to have her followed i have a fellow whos very good at that i didnt expect him to discover anything useful i thought shed simply go back to the wharf where id found her or to some hovel in the subura or wherever such creatures come from but instead she headed for the neighborhood past the circus maximus you know the sort of riffraff who live around thereactors mimes chariot racers acrobats when cassandra arrived at her destination my man recognized the place at once how many times had he followed my husband to the very same house cassandra went directly from your house to the house of cytheris exactly im told its quite a nice little place her former master volumnius bought it for her when he made her a freedwomana sort of parting gift for many services rendered i have no doubt you know why he freed her it was at antonys requesta sort of goodwill gesture by which volumnius hoped to ingratiate himself with caesars chief lieutenant to save face volumnius put it about that hed had his fill of the little whore and didnt mind passing her on to antony but i know he was peeved well if he wasnt yet ready to let go of her he was a fool to show her off at that party where antony met her they say cytheris learned all sorts of ways to please a manthings no respectable woman would consider doingback in alexandria where she comes from thats where her first master the one before volumnius taught her to be an actress oh i call her an actress but of course women arent allowed to perform in legitimate plays only in mime shows and thats hardly acting is it just a lot of buffoonery and halfnaked dancing and declaiming lewd poems the sort of vulgar nonsense antony adores you were saying that cassandra went to the house of cytheris exactly now what sort of coincidence could that be immediately after seeing antonys wife cassandra pays a visit to antonys mistress or should i say reports to antonys mistress perhaps she was calling on someone else in cytheriss household no my man managed to climb onto the roof of the neighboring house where he could see down into cytheriss garden hed done that before as well keeping an eye on antony for me he saw cytheris greet cassandra as if they were old friends then they sat and shared wine together and talked for a long time about what my man wasnt able to hear they were too far away and kept their voices low but he heard them laugh occasionallyat me i have no doubt well id sent the bitch away without paying her a sesterce and id told her nothing she could use to embarrass me so im afraid i spoiled whatever scheme those two were hatching against me you think cassandra was somehow in league with cytheris of course dont you see theyre both actresses that must be how they know each other they probably met while performing together in some wretched mime show somewhere between here and alexandria ambitious little ferrets cytheris managed to get herself nicely set up thanks to volumnius and my husband meanwhile cassandra got herself invited into the best homes in rome by putting on a mime show of her own pretending to utter prophecies while falling under some gods spell all the while working who knows what sort of mischief whoever killed her did the decent people of rome a great favor thats why i went to her funeralto see her burn if only someone would do the same to that accursed cytheris so that i could have the pleasure of watching the flames devour her carcass in a burst of fury she threw her cup across the garden a hapless peacock shrieked and skittered away i understand why you despise cytheris i said but what did cassandra do to make you hate her so what was the prophecy she spoke to you antonia glared at me for the last time it wasnt a prophecy it was a performance but if you must knowvery well ill tell you for quite a while she rolled her eyes and jerked and muttered a lot of unintelligible noises then gradually i could make out words oh cassandra was very good she made you listen hard to hear her all the better to convince you that it must be something very special she was uttering she said antonia stared into space and hesitated so long that i thought she had decided not to tell me finally she cleared her throat and went on she said she saw a lion and a lioness and their young cub dwelling in a cave there was a terrible storm raging but inside the cave all was warm and dry and safe eventually despite the storm the lion went off to forage he found a gazelle such a beautiful graceful creature that instead of attacking the gazelle he mated with it to get back at him the lioness invited another lion into her cave and mated with him but that lion already had a mate and he soon left her and her original mate was so happy gamboling about the countryside with his gazelle that he never returned so in the end the lioness was left alone forever except for her cub of course at that moment the screaming young girl reappeared dressed in a tunica now but in the same bad humor she ran across the garden to her mother let out an earpiercing scream and threw her hands around antonias waist antonia tensed every muscle such a look of mingled fury and despair crossed her face that for a moment i feared she might strike the child instead she took a deep breath and put her arms around the little girl squeezing so tightly that the child struggled to pull free and finally did so running back the way she had come scattering peacocks in her wake and streaking past the overwhelmed nurse in the doorway antonia stared after the child her face hardened as long as she was making it all up why tell me things to confirm my own worst fears why not make up lies to please me for a happy vision of the future i might have given her a few coins and sent her on her way and forgotten all about her no she put on that little performance deliberately to torment me and afterward she went running to her friend cytheris and the two of them had a good laugh at my expense im glad shes dead if someone else hadnt done it i might have murdered her myself ix the fourth time i saw cassandra was on the day marcus caelius made his boldestand lastappearance in the forum obedient to bethesdas wishesand leery myself of the violence that had been eruptingi avoided going to the forum for almost a month following the riot that broke out after the consul isauricus broke caeliuss chair of state i whiled away the month of aprilis in my garden worrying over the everincreasing debts i owed to volumnius the banker unable to see a way to continue feeding my family without going even further into debt all my life i had avoided becoming a debtor i had even managed to accumulate a modest amount of savings which i had deposited for security with volumnius he was a banker with an excellent reputation trusted by everyone from cicero to caesar but with the war had come shortages and with shortages had come outlandish prices even for the most basic staples of life i had seen the savings of a lifetime devoured by butchers and bakers in a matter of months volumniusor rather his agents for i never dealt with the man directlysaw my deposits dwindle to nothing then offered to extend credit what could i do but accept i fell into the trap and learned what every debtor knows a debt is like a baby for it begins small but rapidly grows and the bigger it gets the louder it cries out to be fed brooding in my garden i reluctantly admitted to myself that i missed the jabbering of the chinwaggers down in the forum opinionated old fools they might be but at least their complaints took my mind off my own problems and every now and then one of them actually said something intelligent i missed reading the daily acts posted in the forum with the latest news of caesars movements even if i knew that nothing in such notices was to be entirely trusted since they were dictated by the consul isauricus to be sure davus and hieronymus still made forays down to the forum and always bought back the latest gossip but there was something stale and unnourishing about such thirdhand information i was a roman citizen and the public life of the forum was part of the very fabric of my existence one afternoon i could no longer stand my idleness and isolation bethesda diana and davus had gone to the markets to spend my latest loan from volumnius hieronymus was in my study perusing a very old volume of the punic war by naevius that cicero had given me as a gift many years ago it was the most valuable scroll i owned and so far i had resisted selling it since i couldnt hope to get anything approaching its true value bored and restless on a whim i did something i had not done in a very long time i left my house unaccompanied taking not even mopsus or androcles with me later i would question my motive for leaving the house alone that day did i not know in some corner of my mind exactly where my feet were taking me when i set out i decided to avoid the forum so i crossed the palatine hill and descended on the east side wandering past the senian baths wending my way through increasingly narrower streets as i entered the neighborhood of the subura if someone had asked me where i was headed i couldnt have said i was simply out for a walk enjoying the weather trying for a while to forget my troubles yet every step brought me closer it was the barking of the molossian mastiff chained beside the front door that startled me to my senses i stopped and stared dumbly at the beast then confronted the redwashed facade of the shabby tenement where cassandra lived i stepped toward the doorway the dog stopped barking did the beast recognize me did he remember that i had visited the building a month before when i was carried in unconscious by rupa and then a little later was escorted out by him the dog made no objection when i stepped through the doorway he looked up at me and wagged his tail i was at once surrounded by a familiar mix of odorsboiled cabbage urine unwashed humanity my memory was poorer than the mastiffs i wasnt sure which doorway opened into cassandras room each doorway was covered by a ragged curtain to afford a degree of privacy one of the curtains a faded blue looked vaguely familiar i stood before it for a long moment listening but heard nothing from within i might have called her name but somehow i knew the room was empty i lifted the curtain and stepped inside it was just as i recalled the floor was packed earth a high narrow window afforded a view of the yellow building next door and a bit of sky from nearby came the sound of clanging metal from the street of copper pots the only furnishings were a crudely made folding chair and a threadbare pallet strewn with equally threadbare pillows a few thin coverlets were neatly folded on the pallet next to the coverlets was a curious object a short baton made of leather i picked it up imbedded in the surface i saw the impression of human teeth if i were to give it a name i would have called the thing a biting stick i put it back where i had found it the walls were bare there was no box or pouch for keeping coins or trinkets there was not even a lamp to light the room at night cassandra had no need to fear leaving the room unattended there was nothing here to steal i heard a noise and turned to see her standing in the doorway she stared at me and let the curtain drop behind her her hair was slightly damp her cheeks were red from scrubbing i realized she must have just returned from a visit to the public baths in rome even beggars can enjoy the luxury of a hot bath for the price of a few coins there was no surprise on her face she looked almost as if she had been expecting me perhaps i thought she does possess some sort of second sight snooping she said theres not much to see if youd like i can tie back the curtain to let in a bit more light no that wont be necessary i stepped away from the pallet to the center of the room forgive me i didnt mean to snoop force of habit i suppose did someone send you here she didnt sound angry merely curious no then why did you come i dont know i was about to say but that would have been a lie i came to see you she nodded slowly in that case ill leave the curtain over the doorway that will give us a little privacy most of the tenants are out of the building at this hour anyway scavenging for something to eat she crossed her arms are you sure you werent spying on me isnt that what people pay you to do isnt that why they call you the finder i dont recall telling you that no someone else must have told me who she shrugged what was it you said to me last time youre not entirely unknown in the forum neither are you gordianus people know you by sight they know your reputation perhaps i was a little curious about you after having you here in my room perhaps i asked a few questions here and there i know quite a few things about you gordianus the finder i think that you and i are very much alike i laughed are we staring into her blue eyes acutely aware of her youth and her beauty i could hardly imagine anyone with whom i had less in common we are you seek the truth the truth seeks me out in the end we both find it only in different ways we each have a special gift that gift wasnt something we chose it chose us the gift is ours whether we want it or not and we must do with it what we can a gift can also be a curse im not sure i understand people say that you have the gift of prophecy but whats my gift she smiled something far more valuable i should think im told that people feel compelled to confide in you to tell you secrets even when they shouldnt something in you draws the truth out of them i should think that must be a very powerful gift indeed has it not provided all that youve gained in life your fortune your family the respect of powerful men my fortune such as it was has been swallowed up by a certain greedy banker my family has been torn apart as for the respect of powerful men im not sure what thats worth if you can show me a way to eat it ill prepare it for dinner and invite you to take the first portion you sound bitter gordianus no just weary perhaps you need to rest she drew closer her freshly washed body smelled slightly of the jasmine perfume used to scent the cold plunge at the womens baths bethesda sometimes returned home from the baths carrying the same scent cassandras hand brushed against mine where is rupa i lowered my voice for she had drawn very close she answered in a whisper out scavenging like everyone else i dont expect him back anytime soon many thoughts crossed my mind at once i thought of the foolishness of men especially men of my age when they confront a beautiful young woman i considered the implications of taking advantage of a woman subject to fits of insanity i stared into cassandras eyes searching for some sign of madness there but saw only a flame that drew me like a moth i put my hands on her shoulders i bent my face to hers i touched my lips to hers and slid my arms around her i pressed the slender warmth of her body firmly against mine i felt an exhilaration a thrilling sensation of being alive that i had not felt in many years suddenly she broke from the kiss and slipped out of my arms i cringed and felt my face turn hot i had miscalculated the moment after all i had made a fool of myselfor had she made a fool of me then with a start i realized that rupa had entered the room he hadnt seen the kiss cassandra her ears accustomed to the sound of his footsteps in the hall had heard him coming and had pulled away from me an instant before he stepped through the curtain nevertheless he was agitated about something and signaling frantically with his hands just as i had been able to interpret the signs eco had used in the years when he was mute so cassandra could understand what rupa was trying to tell her somethings happening in the forum she said isnt there always i said no this is different something important something big i think it has to do with that magistrate whos been stirring up trouble marcus caelius i looked at rupa who answered with an exaggerated nod then he made the universal sign of a hand drawn like a blade across his throat caelius is dead i said alarmed rupa waved his hand not yet cassandra interpreted but perhaps very soon rupa seized her hand and led her out even then confused as i was by the sudden turn of events i wondered why a humble beggar like cassandra should be so interested in the fortunes of a politician like caelius on both of the two previous occasions when caelius had caused chaos in the forum she had been there was that due to simple coincidence i had no time to wonder for i was caught up in the rush to the forum following after rupa and cassandra the closer we drew to the forum the more crowded the street became as rupa had promised something very big was taking place stirring excitement and attracting people from all over the city news spreads quicker than fire in rome from rooftop to rooftop and window to window people came rushing out of buildings and side streets to join the crush like rivulets flowing into a river where it emptied into the forum the street became completely jammed people continued to rush up behind us making it impossible to either advance or retreat i felt a prickle of fear if violence were to break out anywhere in the crowd there could be a panic and perhaps a stampede i cursed my bad fortune for a month i had stayed away from the forum fearing just such a predicament on the one day i chose to go out i found myself quite literally in the thick of it but along with fear i felt another kind of thrill far more pleasant partly it came from the simple excitement of being in a crowd but mostly it came from my proximity to cassandra i found myself pressed very close to her feeling the heat of her body smelling the scent of jasmine on her skin she turned to look at me and in her eyes i saw a mirror of the same fear and excitement i was feeling i looked around and saw a narrow alley leading off to one side a few people were emerging from the alley trying to join the crowd but no one was entering it the north side of the forum is a warren of winding little streets that take unpredictable turns or lead to dead ends i wrinkled my brow and tried to remember where that particular alley led come i said follow me rupa hung back frowning but cassandra took his hand and pulled him along i plowed a course through the crush of people jostling elbows and stepping on toes until at last we came to the alley and stepped free of the crowd are you feeling unwell gordianus said cassandra i laughed is that why you think i wanted to escape that crush i dont faint every time im in a crowd though it would be worth it i thought if every time i could wake to see your face above me i led them down the alley which twisted and turned like a serpent so that it was impossible to see very far ahead especially when the walls on either side narrowed until i could reach out and touch both at once the alley branched and i had to pause to remember which way to take rupa grew increasingly dubious shaking his head and making signs to cassandra that they should turn back i could see that she was wavering no longer sure whether to trust me or not the alley came to a dead end the walls on either side were solid brick in the wall facing us a narrow door was recessed in the stonework rupa gave a snort and tugged at cassandras arm wait i said i knocked on the door there was no response i knocked again harder finally a peephole opened and a rheumy eye stared out gordianus i heard my name through the thick wood of the door a moment later it slowly opened on creaking hinges to reveal the stooped figure of an elderly man leaning on a crutch we had arrived at the back door of the shop owned by my old acquaintance didius the shop fronted on the forums north side didius sold various goods required by the army of clerks who worked in nearby temples and state officeshandles and twine for assembling scrolls egyptian parchment and inks styluses and wax tablets and other book making and recordkeeping paraphernalia he also specialized in copying documents the work was performed by a small staff of scribes who labored day and night some of the documents that passed through his shop contained sensitive information and didiuss profession often made him privy to more secrets than many of his customers realized i had found him a useful man to know over the years gordianus he cried i havent see you in months not since you last came in with that copy of pindar that had some water damage and needed a bit of repair has it been that long didius these are i hesitated what should i call them two friends i finally said cassandra and rupa were looking to pass through your shop into the forum oh no said didius too crowded out there too crazy ive shut the doors and barred them but if you want to watch youre welcome to come up to the roof along with everyone else everyone else all my staff they cant possibly work with this madness going on and from the roof theres an excellent view of caelius and trebonius and their tribunals or so im told my eyes are too weak to see that far come ill show you hurry along who knows what may happen in the next few moments he led us through a storage room and into his shop the doors and windows were barred casting the room into darkness a ladder in the corner led to an upper story didius put aside his crutch and led the way he hobbled a bit but was surprisingly spry we emerged in the room where the scribes worked after the dimness below the bright light from the tall windows hurt my eyes i breathed in the smell of fresh parchment and ink didius ascended another ladder i followed with cassandra and rupa behind me through the opening above i could see a patch of sky one of the slaves on the rooftop saw didius hobbling up the ladder and reached down to help him as we emerged onto the roof the scribes crowded along the low parapet made way for their master and his guests as didius had promised we had an excellent view of the rival tribunals in the forum below i see caelius i said but wheres trebonius his tribunals completely emptyno lictors no clerks no trebonius must have run off quipped didius im not surprised caeliuss rhetoric against him was scalding hot he was practically daring the crowd to pull trebonius off his tribunal and tear him limb from limb probably trebonius had the good sense to beat a hasty retreat while he still could i looked down at the massive seething crowd that surrounded caelius who was orating and gesticulating wildly above the noise of the mob i couldnt make out what he was saying whats he going on about i asked didius hes gone the distance what do you mean caelius has made his ultimate gambit or so i should think its hard to imagine how he could go any further to pander to the mob its because hes about to be arrested why hold back arrested how do you know that i know because yesterday the consul isauricus came here and asked me to draw up several copies of the ultimate decree that would normally be done by scribes attached to the senate house but i suppose isauricus wanted so many copies drawn up in so short a time that he brought part of the job to me a sensitive commission so isauricus warned me i named a steep price and told him id keep my mouth shut the ultimate decree had been invoked by the senate on only a handful of occasions in my lifetime it declared a state of emergency and empowered the consuls to use any means necessary to protect the state from immediate danger cicero had convinced the senate to invoke it against catilina and his socalled conspirators and had used it to justify the execution of unarmed prisoners one of them being marc antonys stepfatheryet another reason for antonys longstanding hatred of cicero more recently pompey and his faction had invoked the ultimate decree against caesar goading him to cross the rubicon why would isauricus want copies of the ultimate decree drawn up unless he planned to invoke it and against whom might he wish to declare it except marcus caelius i looked at didius and did you did i what did you keep your mouth shut didius cast a glance at cassandra and rupa they were both staring raptly at the spectacle below but he lowered his voice nonetheless he shrugged and pointed toward caelius what can i say ive always liked caelius hes commissioned a lot of books from me over the years likes to give them to friends as gifts slim scrolls of erotic poetry that sort of thing impeccable taste i dont always like his politics but i like him this latest campaign of his carrying on against the bankers and landlordsits all so much wind if you ask me nothing will come of it but i still admire his spirit so i decided to do him a favor whispered a discreet word in the right ear caelius got the message i thought wed all wake today to the news that he had fled the city but there you see him i suppose he thinks he can somehow use the moment to his advantage maybe hes being clever but if you ask me hes cutting it awfully close you cant say he lacks nerve but we shall see if hes still alive come nightfall a moment ago you said caelius had gone the distance what did you mean hes talking about new legislation again no more half measures he says the time has come for immediate and complete abolition of all debts wipe the ledgers clean start over fresh can you imagine the chaos that would cause but theres no shortage of people who like the idea look at them out there swirling around caelius and chanting his name so loudly you cant even hear him speak the mob loves himthe way they used to love clodius and before him catilina and caesar not so long ago i said didius shook his head people fear caesar but does anyone really love him except his soldiers mind you i dont fault caesar for refusing to pander to the rabble a demagogue like caelius can promise everyone the moon but if he suddenly found himself really in charge of things with a treasury to fill and a war to wage and a grain dole to hand out hed change his tune overnight i nodded toward the crowd below what are we seeing down there didius has isauricus announced the ultimate decree against caelius not yet the senates debating it now there may be an announcement at any moment i think isauricus hoped it would be a surprise so they could take caelius with no trouble but now the words out and its too late for that why today what prompted isauricus to take action did he know that caelius was about to announce this plan to abolish debts who knows which player blinked first and made the other jump something like this was bound to happen the struggle between caelius and the other magistrates has been building for months if you ask me i think isauricus is acting now because he happens to have some troops available to him they arrived outside rome a few days ago on their way to join caesar isauricus persuaded them to stay for a while with those troops on hand he has the muscle to use against caelius if he needs it so nows the time for isauricus to bite a stick and pull out the thorn in his side if the senate passes the ultimate decreeand who can doubt they willcaelius has only a few more hours of freedom maybe only a few more minutes so hes cast his final throw of the dice hes counting on this wild promise of debt abolition to be his venus throw the one play that could turn the game in his favor listening to didius i felt the little thrill a man gets when he lets himself imagine that the impossible might actually take place what if caelius did succeed in sparking a revolution against isauricus and trebonius and the other magistrates left in place by caesar what if he upset everyones expectations by making himselfnot pompey not caesarthe new master of rome what if a single man channeling the fury of the roman mob could abruptly turn the world upside down sweeping the rich out of their houses and lifting the poor up in their stead to do that eventually caelius would have to win some legions to his side it could happen if caesar were to be killed and his troops left leaderless they might be drawn to a charismatic leader with bold ideas a man like caelius it was all a fantasy of course frightening and fascinating to imagine but ultimately unthinkable then i reminded myself that hardly more than a year ago it had been unthinkable that caesar would dare to cross the rubicon and march on rome like an invading barbarian look there said didius my eyes are weak gordianus but dont i see men coming from the direction of the senate house you do indeed didius armed men a whole troop of them scattering the mob before them and farther back i believe i see a cordon of lictors with isauricus in their midst i couldnt tell whether there had been any bloodshed but the men scattering before the armed troops were screaming and yelling making such a noise that it carried above the raucous chanting and cheering of the mob around marcus caelius caelius himself appeared to hear the noise for i saw him raise his hands for silence a moment later all heads turned in the direction of the senate house the cries of the fleeing mob echoed about the forum along with another noise for not all those who fled did so passively some were casting stones at the soldiers who responded by drawing into tortoise formation with shields locked around them and above their heads the flying stones pelting the shields made a racket like heavy hail against a roof the noise heartened the mob around caelius they began to chant abolish all debts bankrupt the bankers abolish all debts bankrupt the bankers i looked on aghast in massilia during the worst of the siege i had witnessed something similarcitizens casting stones at their own soldiers for any city to reach such a level of disorder was a terrifying thing to see it happen in rome was appalling suddenly i heard a roar of laughter from the crowd around caelius he was strutting across the raised platform holding up his chair of state i squinted trying to see what they were laughing at it was the same deliberately plain modestly ornamented chair caelius had used before the one that isauricus had broken in a rage the seat had been mended not with wood but with leather straps in a flash i caught caeliuss little joke which was typically convoluted cruel and vulgar the one anecdote everybody knew about isauricus had to do with his fathers temper and the fact that isauricus had received regular beatings with a leather strap when he was a boy when others needled him about it isauricus tried to make a virtue of his fathers abuse saying such discipline had toughened him up gave him a tough bottom people would say behind isauricuss back for breaking his chair caelius had taken revenge on isauricus by mending the chair with leather strapsa reminder to everyone of the legendary abuse of isauricuss father and of the consuls own uncontrolled fit of temper with isauricus and a company of armed troops quickly approaching caelius defiant to the last possible moment was holding up the chair for the crowds amusementhis way of tweaking his nose at the ultimate decree above the roaring laughter and the hail of stones on shieldsstill distant but drawing closer by the momenti heard caeliuss stentorian parting words shame on caesars lackeys who dare to call themselves elected magistrates i give up my office i give up my chair of state but i shall return with that he hurled his chair of state high in the air it landed in the midst of the crowd men swarmed to claim pieces as a souvenir they tore the chair apart and snapped leather straps over their heads when i looked back at the tribunal caelius had vanished but where i whispered into thin air said didius like a sorcerer a few moments later the armed troops pushed their way into the crowd around the tribunal isauricus arrived surrounded by his lictors looking furious abolish all debts bankrupt the bankers cried the mob caelius was nowhere to be seen i glanced at cassandra who was watching the spectacle below as raptly as the rest of us it seemed to me that i saw a faint elusive smile on her lips a few more stones were thrown but with caelius gone the adoring mob had no reason to stay and neither did the soldiers who had come to arrest him the crowd dispersed when i looked again for cassandra she and rupa had vanished leaving as little trace as marcus caelius i talked for a while longer with didius then took my leave i felt an urge to return to cassandras apartment but for what purpose by now my family must have noticed my absence and would know about the disruption in the forum bethesda would be worried i hurried home bracing myself for her reception but when i arrived a little out of breath from hurrying up the palatine hill it was diana who greeted me her brow was furrowed with worry as i had so often seen her mothers i suppose im in a bit of trouble i said sheepishly your mother mothers gone to bed said diana quietly in the middle of the day she became dizzy while we were in the market she felt so poorly she had to come home at once diana frowned i hope its nothing serious that was the first appearance of bethesdas lingering illness which was to cast such a deep shadow over my household in the months to come x i suppose you ate your fill of those stuffed dates at antonias house and we neednt go looking for anything more to eat before our next stop i said to davus they were very good he said ill have to take your word for it im afraid our hostess spoiled my appetite she seemed like a very unhappy woman typically davus you understate i suppose we should try to be sympathetic it cant be easy being married to a fellow like marc antony unhappy he repeated thoughtfully and bitter she spoke very harshly of cassandra she said shed have killed cassandra herself if someone else hadnt already done so yes davus i heard what she said so where are we off to now fatherinlaw im thinking its time i paid a call on a certain famous actress who keeps a house near the circus maximus davus nodded then reached inside his toga he produced a stuffed date and popped it into his mouth he saw me staring im sorry fatherinlaw would you like one i have plenty more davus what did you do slip a handful into your toga while i wasnt watching antonia said to take as many i wanted he said defensively so she did you should have been an advocate davus cicero himself couldnt split a hair more finely it wasnt hard to find the house we were seeking everyone in rome knew who cytheris was and everyone in the neighborhood of the circus maximus knew where she lived an old woman selling plums from a basketthey should have been made of gold for what she was askingpointed us in the general direction down the wide avenue that runs along the south wall of the circus we passed a troupe of acrobats practicing in the street much to the delight of a crowd of children a team of chariot racers all dressed in green came walking by they were covered with dust with whips wrapped tightly around their forearms and snug leather caps on their heads i asked their leader for morespecific directions he was straightforward enough when he gave them but as we were walking off he yelled after us mind you dont let antony catch you or the fat old banker for that matter added one of his companions cracking his whip in the air to a chorus of raucous laughter as antonia had said it was a very respectablelooking house tucked away on a narrow quiet side street i noted the fig tree her slave must have used to climb onto the roof of the neighboring house so as to look down into cytheriss garden spying on the actress and cassandra davus knocked we waited i told him to knock again the sun was well up apparently cytheris and her household kept late hours i was not surprised finally a puffyeyed young woman opened the door she was strikingly beautiful and strikingly unkempt with her auburn hair hanging unpinned and tangled and her sleeping tunica pulled off one shoulder her informality revealed much about the household women like cytheris were rare a slave from a foreign land who had managed by cunning and beauty to become an independent successful freedwoman finding herself in rome without blood relations it was natural that she should surround herself with slaves who were almost as much friends as servants companions whom she could trust and confide in and to whom she gave a far greater latitude than a haughty mistress like antonia or fulvia or terentia would ever allow such slaves would share to some degree in their mistresss notorious debauchery they would stay up late with her and likewise sleep late and think nothing of answering the door in dishabille the woman who answered the door looked davus up and down eyeing him rather as he had eyed the stuffed dates at antonias house though her hazel eyes eventually settled on me acknowledging that the senior of the callers was more likely the one in charge she seemed not really to see me and certainly not with the riveting attention she had devoted to davus as if i were not a man but the shadow of one thus do we become more and more invisible as we grow older until people fail to see us even when they look straight at us and yet cassandra had seen me to her i had not been invisible to her i was still a vivid presence a man of flesh and blood vital robust existing in the moment teeming with life and sensation no wonder i had been so vulnerable to her no wonder i had fallen so completely under her spell my thoughts wandering were drawn back to the moment by the young womans laughter which was sharp but not cruel you look like you could use a drink she said evidence that i was visible to her after alla gray glumlooking man in a toga ill leave it to your mistress to decide whether shell offer me one i snapped my mistress she raised an eyebrow suddenly i knew that i was talking to cytheris herself she saw the moment of realization on my face and laughed again then her expression became more serious youre gordianus arent you i saw you at the funeral i saw this one too this is davus my soninlaw married then she said the word as if it were a challenge not a disappointment youd both better come inside my neighbors are endlessly fascinated by everyone who comes to this door theyve probably already seen you and run off to spread more gossip about me their own lives must be frightfully boring dont you think for them to be so fascinated by a simple girl from alexandria she swept us inside slammed the door shut behind her then led us through a small atrium and down a short hallway the rooms we passed were small but exquisitely furnished dominating the little garden at the center of the house was a statue of venus on a pedestal only slightly smaller than lifesize at each of the gardens four corners were statues of satyrs in states of rampant excitement partially concealed amid shrubbery as if they were lurking and stalking the goddess of love was this how cytheris viewed herself and her suitors youre wondering why i answered the door myself she said breezily you romans always so strict about that sort of thing so insistent on decorum but really if you knew what ive put the poor slaves through over the last two nights its only fair to let them sleep a bit late this morning or is it still morning she stopped beside the venus and squinted up at the sun i looked around the garden and saw the aftermath of a drunken party chairs and little tripod tables were scattered about some lying on their sides wine cups were abandoned here and there flies buzzed above the crimson dregs various musical instrumentstambourines rattles flutes and lyreswere piled helterskelter against a wall on the ground beneath one of the lurking satyrs halfhidden amid the shrubbery lay a handsome young slave snoring softly its this ones job to answer the door said cytheris walking up to him i thought she was going to give him a kick but instead she looked down at him with a doting smile such a sweet little faun even his snore is sweet dont you think then she did give him a kick but gently prodding him with her foot until he finally stirred and rose groggily to his feet brushing leaves from his curly black hair he saw that his mistress had company and without being told gathered three chairs and set them in the shade then disappeared into the house blinking and rubbing his eyes bring the best falernian chrysippus cytheris called after him not the cheap swill i served to that rowdy gang of actors and mimes who were here last night she smiled and indicated that we should sit then finally took a good look at me i felt a bit uncomfortable under her scrutiny yes she said now i see what it was that cassandra saw in you its his eyes cytheris she said to me once he has the most extraordinary eyeslike a wise old king in a legend did i stiffen did my face turn red cytheris looked from me to davus and back and pursed her lips oh dear was that indiscreet of me she said you must tell me right away whether i can speak to you candidly or not im not the sort to hold my tongue unless im asked to perhaps you should send your frowning soninlaw out of earshot for a whilethough that would be a pity no davus can stay theres no point in concealing anything about cassandra now that shes dead thats why ive come to you you must have known her quite well if she told you about herself and me she looked at me sidelong as you say now that shes dead theres no point in hiding anything is there to whom else have you spoken about her ive been calling on the women who came to her funeral terentia fulvia antonia ha youre not likely to discover anything important about cassandra from any of those hens unless it was one of them who murdered her a frown pulled at her lips but she brightened when chrysippus reappeared bearing a pitcher and three cups i had no craving for wine but only a fool would pass up an offer of good falernian especially in such hard times the dark flavor played upon my tongue and filled my head like a warm comforting mist terentia and fulvia think cassandra was a true seeress they were both quite in awe of her i said but not antonia antonia has a very different opinion she thinks cassandra was an impostor and cassandras spells of prophecy merely part of an act cytheris smiled antonia is no fool no matter what her dear husband says antonia was right about cassandra cytheris considered her answer before she spoke up to a point i frowned cytheris smiled she seemed to enjoy my puzzlement her smile widened into a yawn and she stretched her arms above her head the movement caused her torso to shift in a most intriguing way beneath the loose tunica even her most casual movements were marked by a dancers gracefulness i would have cursed her condescending smile except that it made her even more remarkably beautiful i looked at the stone satyrs lurking in the corners gazing with lust upon the goddess they would never touch and felt a stab of sympathy for them shall i explain she said id be grateful if you would where to begin back in alexandria i suppose thats where i met her when we were both hardly more than children i was born to a slave mother but early on someone saw in me a talent for dancing and i was sold to the master of a mime troupenot just any troupe but the oldest and most famous in alexandria the master liked to say that his ancestors had entertained alexander the great people in alexandria are always making claims like that still the troupe could trace its history back for generations i was taught to dance and mime and recite by some of the finest performers in alexandria and that means the finest in the world and cassandra the master acquired her and brought her into the troupe shortly after me i was terribly jealous of her do you know i think this is the first time ive ever admitted that to anyone jealous why because she was so much more talented that i wasat everything her gifts were extraordinary she could recite homer and make men weep or make them weep with laughter by enacting a fable by aesop she could dance like a veil floating on the breeze she could sing like a bird and do so in whatever language you pleasedbecause she picked up languages the way the rest of us picked up bits of jewelry from admirers in the audience and she did all this without apparent effort beside her i felt like a clumsy sweating squawking fool i find that hard to believe cytheris only because you never saw the two of us perform side by side you must have hated her hated her cytheris sighed quite the opposite we were very very close back in those days cassandra and i those lovely days in alexandria you call her cassandra yet that cant have been her real name she smiled the curious thing is that was what we called her even then but youre right when she first arrived she had another name but do you know ive completely forgotten it some totally unpronounceable sarmatian name shed come from somewhere on the far side of the euxine sea but very early on she played cassandra in a new mime show the master had written just a vulgar little skit really can you imagine a comic cassandra but she was hilarious staggering around harassing the other characters making rude prophecies and double entendres about the city officials and king ptolemy people loved it so much they demanded that mime every time we performed she made such an impression with the role that the name stuck and cassandra was what we called her from then on cytheris gazed thoughtfully into her cup swirling the falernian into a vortex we begin as we continue in this life thats especially true of us performers if were lucky we find a role that fits and we play it to the hilt i always specialized in playing the wanton woman the seductress look where that roles taken me cassandra played cassandra i imagine it must be the same for you gordianus to some extent isnt the finder a role you fell into early on that you gradually perfected that youll keep playing until the end perhaps but if im playing a role wheres the playwright and if there is a playwright id like to complain to him about the nasty surprises he keeps throwing at me complain you should be thankful for a life that keeps giving you surprises surprises keep you on your toes you wouldnt want to grow stale in your part would you she laughed then sighed but we were talking about cassandra its such a pity that women arent allowed to be real actors performing in the greek tragedies or even in silly roman comedies instead only men can go on the legitimate stage it doesnt matter if the role is a swaggering general or a virgin goddess its a man who performs it behind a mask women are allowed only to be dancers or to perform mime comedies in the street its criminal really when i think of what our cassandra could have achieved performing the great female partsthe antigone of sophocles or euripides medea or the clytaemnestra of aeschylusimagine that shed have made your blood run cold shed have made strong men run whimpering from the theater perhaps thats why women arent allowed to play women on the stagethe result might be too disturbing for you men in the audience and too inspiring for the women even so we actresses sometimes manage to find the role that takes us where we want to go we simply have to create it ourselves and live it day by day instead of performing it on a stage thats what i did and thats what our cassandra did until the role killed her i said you say you met her in alexandria what then dear old volumnius came along fat sweet incredibly rich volumnius this was five years agoyes almost exactly five years to the day volumnius was in alexandria on some sort of business trip he just happened to be passing through the rhakotis district with his entourage one day when we were performing near the temple of serapis i spotted him in the audience right away fiddling with his gold rings and his gold necklaces and biting his lips and watching me dance the way a cat watches a sparrow flit through the trees i put on the performance of my life that day i was doing the dance of seven veils taking them off one by onea bit of naughtiness to spice up the show in between all the clowning youre supposed to take off only six veils of course thats the point to tease the crowd and make them hang around for more hoping youll come back for an encore but that day i didnt stop at six i took off the seventh as well cytheris laughed volumniuss eyes almost popped out of his head as for the poor master i thought he was going to have a heart attack even in alexandria women cant dance naked in the street and the city authorities were always looking for some excuse to shut us down but i took off that final veil as a gambit and the gambit worked the next day i had a new master when volumnius headed back to rome on his private ship i was with him and ive never looked back now youre a freedwoman yes antony helped with that i still have certain contractual obligations to volumnius but this house and everything and everyone in it are mine she snorted no wonder a woman like antonia hates me so much what has she ever accomplished on her own merit everything comes to her because of her family and her name she couldnt even find a husband outside her family i should feel desperately trapped living such a cramped little life ive made my own way in the world using what the gods gave me what about cassandra that was the hardest thing about leaving alexandriasaying goodbye to cassandra i wept so did she i was sure id never see her again when youre young the world seems such a big place so easy to get lost in but its not so big after all is it all roads lead to rome i came by one road cassandra came by another earlier this year i began to hear the rumors about a madwoman down in the forum who had the gift of prophecy people said she was called cassandra i thought could it possibly be my cassandra i piled into that gaudy litter antony gave me and went to have a look and of course it was her standing in front of the temple of vesta wearing a ragged tunica muttering to herself and begging for alms what in hades is she up to i asked myself then i began to worry what if she really had gone mad what if she had taken it into her head that she really was her namesake perhaps the gods had punished herhad looked down and seen her making a mockery of the trojan princess whom apollo tormented and for her hubris they had driven her mad half the lunatics and religious fanatics in the world make their way to rome why not cassandra if she had gone crazy you see cytheris hesitated i gave her a questioning look even now all these years later this isnt easy to talk about she said when we were young i promised her i would tell no one she was always so frightened that it would happen while she was performing that her secret affliction would be exposed she has no need of secrets now i said cytheris nodded youre right ill tell you cassandra was subject to spells of falling sickness in the time i knew her in alexandria it happened only twice that i knew of but it was frightening to watch ill never forget the first time we were alone in the room we shared at the masters house we were talking laughingthen suddenly she was thrown to the floor it was uncanny bizarre as if a giant invisible hand had cast her down and was holding her there while she thrashed and writhed her eyes rolled up in her head she foamed at the mouth she muttered something incomprehensible i had the presence of mind to put something in her mouth to keep her from swallowing her tongue and i did my best to hold her down so that she wouldnt hurt herself when it was over she gradually came to her senses she remembered nothing i told her what had happened she said it had happened to her before and she begged me to tell no one i told her the master would have to know that hed find out sooner or later but she made me promise not to tell him she said perhaps it would never happen again but it did at least once more before i left alexandria that time too it was in our room and no one but me saw it cytheris studied my face this is familiar to you isnt it finder did something similar happen to cassandra on one of your visits to her she told me about your visits i know that you called on her more than once i took a deep breath and evaded the question i was thinking of something my son i stopped myself from speaking metos name i was thinking of something i once was told about caesar for a period of time during his youth he suffered from such seizures he too tried to keep them secret gradually they stopped and theyve never recurred a priest once told him his seizures were a sign of the gods favor caesar himself believes they were the result of a blow to his head when he was kidnapped by pirates as a young man cytheris considered this i dont know how cassandra accounted for her spells but when i saw her again here in rome i remembered them and i began to wonder what if everything id heard about this madwoman in the forum was truethat she didnt merely pretend to see the future or imagine such a thing but that she really was subject to divine visions why not perhaps her seizures in alexandria had merely been precursors to the fullblown gift of prophecy she had since acquired so which was it was cassandra putting on a deliberate performance had she gone mad imagining herself to be the trojan princess shed played in the mime shows or in the years since i had last seen her had she truly become a seeress and somehow ended up here in rome a beggar in the streets i remembered the cassandra i had known and loved in alexandria and i had to know the truth i told the litter bearers to draw alongside her i could see her through the gauze curtains close enough to touch but i didnt think she could see meyou know how such curtains work and yet even as i was reaching to draw back the curtains she turned straight toward me and spoke my name that gave me a start such an uncanny sensation shot through me for a moment i hesitated to draw back the curtain when i finally did my hand was trembling but when i saw her all my trepidation melted away she was smiling trying not to laugh even with her unkempt hair and the smudges of dirt on her cheeks she was the same cassandra i had known in alexandria i burst out laughing and drew her into the litter i closed the curtains and told the bearers to take me home that night we drank falernian and talked until dawn and what did she tell you i said which of your hopes or worries for cassandra turned out to be true was she mad deluded pretending or something else cytheris smiled and at the same time wrinkled her brow she shook her head i wish i knew but if she was the same cassandra you had known and if the two of you talked for hours we talked about old times in egypt we talked about my fortunes since i came to rome we talked about antony and antonia about caesar and pompey about the state of the world but when it came to talking about cassandrahow she had come to rome and whyshe drew a veil of secrecy you allowed that i respected it clearly she wasnt mad not in the sense of having lost the spark of her old self i could see that at once but had she been touched by a god given the gift of prophecy or was she acting a part had she come to rome on her own initiative or had she been brought here by someone for some purpose i cant tell you the answers because i never knew not for certain anyway i asked cassandracajoled her teased her even begged her a bitbut she wouldnt tell me she would only say that in the fullness of time i might know everything and until then it was best if i knew nothing about her comings and goings and told no one what i knew about her past i finally agreed to stop badgering her a woman must be allowed to keep secrets i have a few myself so why shouldnt cassandra secrecy is sometimes the only power a woman has in this world i nodded slowly and after that night after your long visit when you reminisced about the past did you see her again cytheris hesitated perhaps i did i know that you saw her at least one more time late in the month of martius she came here immediately after leaving antonias house and how do you know that finder no dont tell me antonia had cassandra followed didnt she suspicious harpy i cleared my throat you might ask your neighbor to trim the branches of that fig tree in front of his house an agile man could climb onto the roof next door and look down into this very garden i gazed up at the line of the roof and saw that a tiny bit of the neighbors higher roof could indeed be seen above the scalloped row of red tiles cytheris nodded i see and might such a watcher be able to hear every word that was spoken apparently not thank venus for that at least what did the two of you talk about during that visit cytheris clicked a long fingernail against her cup a signal to chrysippus who stood at the far corner of the garden to come and pour her more falernian wine she took a sip and for a long moment made no answer at last she smiled very well heres the story but you must swear to me by venus that youll never divulge this to antonia gaze at her statue and swear it both of you davus looked at me and raised an eyebrow i swear by venus i said quietly and davus did likewise cytheris laughed actually ive been dying to tell someone it might as well be you finder you see even though cassandra wouldnt tell me exactly what she was up to i had my suspicions that it might be somethingwell a bit devious so i made a deal with her a deal i agreed to press her with no more questions and to tell no one of her origins on the condition that she would do a small favor for me perform a favor i suppose i should say and what was that antonia is the type who can never be left out of any activity she presumes to be fashionable among her sort whether its wearing ones hair in a bun or worshipping some new goddess from the east i knew that sooner or later she would seek out cassandra looking to have her fortune told im afraid i couldnt resist the opportunity to stir up a bit of mischief i nodded you suborned cassandra to deliver a false prophecy to antonia im afraid so was that terribly wicked of me i told cassandra make it grim tell her that not only will antony abandon her in the end but so will dolabella and shell grow old and toothless with no companion but that harpy brat of hers thats why cassandra came here at once after she left antonias house to tell me that antonia had finally consulted her and that shed done as id asked we shared a good laugh about that i see unfortunately antonia had cassandra followed and she made the connection to you and to your mime training antonias not stupid cytheris im afraid she saw through your little scheme to upset her too bad even so i think we managed to give her a nasty shock while it lasted perhaps but once antonia made the assumption that cassandra was an actress and a fraud she made another assumption that cassandra was a professional black mailer cytheris pursed her lips perhaps i considered that possibility myself but i dont think so the cassandra i knew in alexandria didnt have the temperament to be a black mailer she didnt possess that kind of cruelty people change no gordianus people never change only their roles change and cassandra would have been miscast as a black mailer still i cant entirely rule it out and if antonia thought she was a black mailer then so might someone else true or not that might have provided the motive for someone to kill her what do you know about her death cytheris only what everyone seems to know that she collapsed in the market and died in your arms when i learned the news i wept poor cassandra the gossips say that she was poisoned was she knowing what i did about her past i had to wonder if one of her seizures had finally proved too much for her was it the falling sickness that killed her i shook my head no she was poisoned someone murdered cassandra do you have any idea who might have done that cytheris other than antonia no i nodded what about rupa what can you tell me about him antonia smiled dear sweet rupa i expected to see him at cassandras funeral but he wasnt there was he no nor did he ever come to my house to see her body he seems to have disappeared entirely since cassandra died i certainly havent seen him said cytheris he must be in hiding fearful of sharing cassandras fate poor thing its hard to imagine how he could get along without her they loved each other so very much i frowned what was he to cassandra she never told you i shook my head rupa was her younger brother of course couldnt you see the resemblance between them he was with her when cassandra joined the mime troupe in alexandria the master saw fit to purchase them together rather than separate them a wise move on his part as cassandra would have been devastated to lose her little brother rupa earned his keep he even did a bit of acting himself nothing that required much talent or any spoken lines of course he was always big even from an early age so he played silent guards and hulking gladiators and grunting monsters he made a very convincing cyclops in a skit we did about ulysses i played circe cassandra played calypso i sighed i always thought of rupa as her bodyguard which he was but mostly she protected him it was always so rupa may be big and strong but the ways of the world overwhelm him and his muteness is a great handicap from childhood cassandra was always looking out for him taking care of him i wasnt at all surprised when she told me she had brought rupa with her to rome its hard to imagine how he could have survived alone in alexandria its hard to imagine how hes surviving now without her or do you think what perhaps rupa is dead too she said quietly from the foyer there came the sound of a knock on the door chrysippus went to answer it then returned volumnius mistress he said cytheris gave a sigh of mingled indulgence and exasperation tell him to leave his army of bodyguards outside and show him in a few moments later a corpulent figure came shuffling into the garden famous for wearing showy jewelry on this occasion the banker volumnius was notably bereft of ornamentno bracelets no necklaces no ring except a plain iron ring of citizenship in such turbulent times even a man as notoriously ostentatious as volumnius knew better than to flaunt his wealth in the streets cytheris my rosebud he cried she stood to greet him and submitted to a kiss on her cheek from his fleshy lips but i see you have guests volumnius looked askance at davus and me i stood and gestured to davus to do likewise gordianus and his soninlaw were just about to leave said cytheris gordianus i know the name have we met no i said but ive dealt with your agents ah yes youre another of the fine citizens to whom ive extended a helping hand in recent months im only too happy in such trying times to find that i can be of assistance to so many of my fellow romans my loans from volumnius as crushing as they were to me were surely so insignificant in his account books that i was surprised he knew of them did he stay apprised of every loan authorized by his agents no matter how small perhaps people said there was an invisible thread attached to every sesterce that left his greedy fist im grateful for your assistance volumnius i said and even more grateful for your patience times are such that even men of goodwill may not be able to meet all their obligations at least for a while indeed citizen patience is a virtueto a point and mine will extend exactly as long as this damnable business with caelius and milo remains unresolved after that once things are back to normal he shrugged which made his shoulders jiggle eventually obligations must be met order must be maintained property rights must be respected and loans repaid wise caesar says so he smiled and took cytheriss much smaller hand in his and kissed it in that instant i understood why he had agreed to make cytheris a freedwoman at the request of the lovestruck antony to please caesars lieutenant was to please caesar her manumission was nothing more or less than a business decision as cytheris says davus and i were just leaving goodbye cytheris good day volumnius and good day to you citizen be wise and prosperso that you may meet your obligations when the day of reckoning arrives xi the fifth time i saw cassandra was late in the month of maius almost a month had passed since the attempted arrest of marcus caelius and his hairbreadth escape but all rome was still in an uproar rumors abounded some said caelius had gone off to join caesar but it was hard to imagine how he could do so after the insinuations he had made against caesar in his speeches was he so rash as to think he could win caesars forgiveness by charm alone some said that caelius had not escaped after all but had been arrested and was being held at a secret location while isauricus decided what to do with him others said that caelius had indeed escaped but was still in the city hiding with a band of conspirators who were plotting to assassinate all the magistrates and most of the senate some said caelius had gone south to set free a school of gladiators in the vicinity of mount vesuvius with the intention of returning to rome and staging a massacre others said caelius had gone north to try to rally various cities to his cause hoping to win them over one by one until he felt confident of marching on rome with an army of volunteers from the forum hieronymus reported this remark by volcatius leader of the pompeian chinwaggers if caelius has his way the rabble of rome will soon be kicking the heads of their landlords and moneylenders through the streets yet another rumor said that caelius was planning to rendezvous with his old friend milo and that the two of them were going to sweep across italy together to my ears this was the wildest speculation of all in his days as ciceros protege caelius had indeed been friends with milo but in recent years their politics had drifted so far apart that it seemed impossible that the two could ever reunite in a common cause before his forced departure from rome titus annius milo had been the man upon whom the selfstyled best people relied to do their dirty business as clodius had ruled the street gangs on the left so milo had ruled the street gangs on the right when a conservative magistrate wanted to break up a demonstration by the opposition or needed demonstrators of his own to agitate in the forum milo was the man who could produce angry crowds bloody fists and a few cracked skulls pompey who liked to hold himself aloof from the gritty political reality of street brawls had looked to milo to act as his henchman cicero had doted upon milo and saw him as his brutish alter ego cicero had the brains while milo wielded the brawn for his efforts milo was well rewarded by the best people he was admitted into their inner circle he was a man headed for great things with his marriage to fausta the daughter of the late dictator sulla his ascent into the highest ranks of romes ruling class seemed assured and then it all came crashing down after a skirmish with milos entourage on the appian way a few miles outside rome clodius was murdered milo and fausta were at the scene and whether milo literally bloodied his hands or not he was blamed for the murder of his enemy angry rioters burned down the senate house and demanded milos head pompey called upon to keep order put milo on trial and did nothing to help him the best people washed their hands of him loyal to the end cicero took on milos defense but his efforts were to no avail attempting to give his oration he was shouted down by the mob accompanied by a large band of hardened gladiators milo fled from rome before the guilty verdict was announced and headed for the greek citystate of massilia the destination of so many roman political exiles he left behind a fortune in property that was confiscated by the state a bitterly disappointed wife who by all accounts was glad to see the last of him and a hopelessly divided city looking back it seemed to me that the murder of clodius and the trial of milo marked the last gasp of the dying republic and the beginning of the end of the roman constitution certainly it had marked the end of milo even amid the turmoil of civil war no one could doubt that milos career was over for good when caesar conquered massilia he had declared amnesty for all the roman political exiles in the city with the conspicuous exclusion of only one milo abandoned by pompey rebuffed by caesar beyond the help of cicero milo had become the forgotten man of roman politics now rumors were reaching the city that milo had managed to escape from massilia despite the garrison of caesars soldiers who had instructions to keep him there not only had he escaped but he had managed to do so with the large band of gladiators who had accompanied him into exile even more bizarre than these rumors was the further assertion that milo was somehow involved in a conspiracy with marcus caelius milos entire career had been based on pandering to the interests of the most rigidly conservative clique among the roman elite the idea that he would join forces with caelius who had made himself the champion of wholesale revolution was ludicrous or was it in such times old friendships and bonds of trust might count for more than differing political philosophies and men as desperate as milo and caelius might take whatever allies they could get what after all did milo owe to the best people or to pompey in the crisis that followed clodiuss murder they had cast him aside like a hot coal in my own household all else was overshadowed by bethesdas illness its prognosis and cure were as elusive as the whereabouts and future plans of marcus caelius to pay for physicians i borrowed more money from volumnius they examined bethesdas tongue they studied her stools they poked and prodded her various parts they prescribed this treatment and that all of which cost money i went further into debt nothing seemed to help bethesda had good days and bad days but more and more often she kept to her bed her symptoms were obscure there were no sharp pains no visible rashes no vomiting or foul excreta she felt weak and out of sortsuncomfortable in my skin she said she was sometimes dizzy sometimes short of breath she had no faith in the physicians or their treatments when she bit one of them for pinching her tongue too hard i told the quack he was lucky to leave my house with all his fingers and i decided to send for no more physicians a household is not unlike a human body with a head and a heart and a sense of wellbeing that depends on the harmony of its various parts the disposition of my household changed from day to day depending on bethesda her bad days were bad days for everyone full of gloom and foreboding on her good days the household stirred with a cautious sense of hope as time passed and bad days outnumbered good hope receded so that even the best days were tempered by a deep anxiety to please bethesda i kept to the house as much as possible for long hours i did little more than sit beside her in the garden holding her hand while we reminisced it was in alexandria that i had found her i had been a young man footloose in the world she had been a slave hardly more than a child at the first sight of her i was hopelessly smitten as only a young man can be i was determined to purchase her and make her my own and i did when i returned to rome i brought bethesda with me it was not until she became pregnant with diana that i made her a free woman and married her so that my child would be born free why had i waited so long partly because i feared that such a drastic change in bethesdas status would also throw our relationship out of balance she already wielded quite enough power over me as my slave but our marriage and the birth of our daughter had only strengthened the bond between us and freedom had strengthened bethesdas character in every way where before she had seemed willful she became strong willed where before she had seemed petulant i came to see her as fiercely determined did these changes take place in bethesda or merely in my perceptions of her i couldnt say and bethesda was the last person to ask paradox and irony held no fascination for her when we reminisced it was not to remark about subtle states of mind or the way things changed but stayed the same our conversations served to remind one another of a vast shared catalogue of people places and things the mere summoning up of these memories brought us a shared pleasure do you remember the beacon atop the pharos lighthouse she would ask and how we sat on the deck of the ship the night we sailed from alexandria and watched it dwindle to nothing of course i remember it was a warm night even so you shivered so i held you next to me i shivered because i was afraid to leave alexandria i thought that rome would swallow me up i laughed do you remember how awful the food was on that ship bread like bricks salty dried figs nothing like our last meal in alexandria do you remember the little shop on the corner that sold sesame cakes soaked with honey and wine the memory makes my mouth water even now and the funny little woman who ran the shop all those cats every cat in alexandria came to her shop because she encouraged them i said she put out bowls of milk the day before we left she showed us some kittens and you insisted on smuggling one of those kittens on board the ship with you even though i expressly forbade it i had to bring something of alexandria with me the romans should have thanked me for bringing them a new deity imagine my surprise when we arrived and i saw not a single statue of a proper god anywhere in the whole city no falconheaded horus or dogheaded anubisonly images of ordinary men and women i knew then that you had brought me to a very strange place indeed at some point we would both realize that we had had this exact conversation before not once but many times over the years it was like a ritual that once begun had to be pursued to its conclusion and like most rituals its mere observance brought us a curious comfort one memory would lead to another and another like links in a chain that wound around and around us both cinching us together at the very center of the time and space that encompassed our two lives and then the shadow of her illness would pass over bethesda the corners of her mouth would constrict her brow would furrow her hand would tighten then loosen in mine and she would say that she was suddenly weary and lightheaded and needed to lie down i would draw a deep breath and it would seem to me that the very air was thick with worry and repining i began to feel like a prisoner in my own house small irritations grew into unbearable torments androcles and mopsus drove me to distraction with their constant bickering one day i yelled at them so sharply that little androcles began to cry whereupon mopsus began to tease him which drove me into such a fury that i barely restrained myself from striking him afterward i felt so ill that i had to lie down and found myself wondering if i had fallen victim to bethesdas complaint hieronymus whose mordant wit had always amused me began to strike me as a pretentious buffoon always prattling on about roman politics a subject about which he knew next to nothing one night losing my temper over some particularly sarcastic observation of his i remarked on the prodigious quantities he was able to consume at every meal at my expense he turned pale put down his bowl and said that from that point onward he would take all his meals alone after the family ate dining upon our scraps he left the room and nothing i could say would persuade him to return this was the man who had taken me into his home in massilia sharing everything he had with me davus who had saved my life in massilia earned my wrath one day by knocking over a tripod lamp trying to pick it up he tripped and stepped on it and damaged it even more when he was done all three of the bronze griffin heads were dented and the pole was bent it wasor rather had beenone of the most valuable objects remaining in the house something i had counted on being able to sell if the direst need arose i told him that his clumsiness had robbed the household of a months worth of food even with diana i became shorttempered i found myself arguing with her about her mothers illness and what to do about it our disagreements were over small thingswhether bethesda should drink hot beverages or cold ones whether or not she should be kept awake during the day so that she might sleep more soundly at night i argued whether to heed the advice of a physician who had told us that the blood of a sparrow would be beneficial to herbut the words we exchanged were sharp and bitter i accused diana of having inherited her mothers worst traits of stubbornness and wrongheadedness in a cruel moment she accused me of caring less about her mother than she did i was cut to the quick and for several days would hardly speak to her i looked to my son eco for relief like meto he was my child by adoption unlike meto we had never had a fallingout of any sort yet over the years we had grown apart this was only natural eco had his own household he also had his own livelihood following in my footsteps and although we had occasionally consulted one another professionally over the years eco had grown increasingly independent and kept his business and financial affairs to himself increasingly he also kept his family to himself eco had married up into an old but faded family desperate for fresh blood the menenii his wife and bethesda had never really gotten along the afternoon i invited eco and his brood to my house turned into a disaster menenia said something to offend bethesdasome nonsense about the women of her family staring down illness rather then submitting to itand bethesda promptly retired to her bed ecos goldenhaired elevenyearold twins who took after their mother took shameless advantage of mopsus and androcles ordering them to fetch this and that when androcles muttered a remark about losing their heads somedaya bit of inflammatory rhetoric he had picked up in the forum no doubteco was appalled and insisted that i punish the boy like the slave he was and when i refused he took his family home goaded by his brother androcles gloated about his escape whereupon i finally did deliver a few sound thwacks to his back side everyone in the household went to bed miserable that night in the past there had always been someone to whom i could turn in troubled times even though he was seldom present confused unhappy seeking solace i would have locked myself away in my study taken up my stylus unlatched the cover of a spare wax tablet and rubbed it blank and set about writing a letter to meto knowing he might not read my words for many dayssecretly fearing he might never read them for he was a soldier and often in dangeri would nonetheless have set down my thoughts and feelings to share with my beloved son and having done so i would have felt a great relief and a lightening of my spirit but now by my own decree that avenue was closed to me in those dismal days how bitterly i missed that source of solace oppressed by the uncertain state of the world anxious about my debts worried by bethesdas illness and the discord in my household aching from the loss of the son i had disownedsuch was the state of my mind when i decided to escape the safe confines of my house and go off wandering one day i had done much the same thing almost a month before on the day i found myself at cassandras apartment and later witnessed caeliuss disappearing act in the forum but whereas on the previous occasion my feet had taken me straight to cassandras door unwittingly or not on this day i found myself taking a much longer walk as i trod a meandering course through the city having lived so long in rome knowing it so intimately it was probably impossible for me literally to lose myself in the city nonetheless i fell into a certain musing state of mind forgetful of my bearings and direction and alert only to my immediate surroundings and the sensations they produced it was a fine day for such a walk typical of late maius sunny but not too hot the charm of rome was everywhere at a quaint neighborhood fountain water poured from the mouth of a gorgon into a deep trough from which women scooped brimming buckets water if nothing else was still plentiful and free in rome just around the corner a huge bronze phallus projecting from the lintel of a doorway proclaimed the presence of a neighborhood brothel the sun happened to catch the phallus at such an angle that it cast a shadow onto the street so absurdly enormous that i laughed out loud on the doorstep an uncommonly plump prostitute sat sunning herself like a cat as i walked by she opened her eyes to slits and i believe i heard her literally purring a little farther on i came to a long alley fronted by continuous walls on either side both walls were overgrown with blooming jasmine and the smell was so heady that once i reached the end of the alley i turned around and retraced my steps just to see if the scent was as sweet going in the opposite direction every time i turned a corner i was confronted by memories sweet and bitter i had lived so long in rome that sometimes it seemed to me the city was a map of my own mind its streets and buildings manifestations of my deepest memories in this austere little house now painted yellow but bright blue when i last entered the door i had once comforted a grieving widow who summoned me to solve the murder of her husbandand it turned out that she herself was the murderer down that street a band of thieves intent on cutting our throats had once chased me and my slave belbohow i missed that faithful bodyguard the two of us had escaped by ducking into a fountain and holding our breaths i crested a hill and saw in the distance the terraces and wings of pompeys vast mansion atop the pincian hill outside the city walls an intervening haze of heat and dust imbued the place with a slightly unreal floating quality like a palace seen afar in a dream when pompey slept at night so far from home was this how he saw the house he had left behind the last time i had seen pompeymaking his escape by ship from italyhe had tried to strangle me with his bare hands the memory made my throat constrict at that very moment was the socalled great one alive or dead was he standing over the slain body of caesar listening to his soldiers declare him master of the worldor was he just another mortal turned to ashes like so many before him whose ferocious ambitions counted for nothing when the jaws of hades opened to claim them at the craggy base of the capitoline hill i passed the gate of the private family cemetery where years ago i had met in secret with clodia on the eve of marcus caeliuss trial for murder how i had been smitten by that mysterious aloof treacherous beauty in all my life clodia had been the only woman who had ever tempted me to stray from bethesda until now no matter how circuitous the route no matter how distracting or amusing or arousing or appalling the memories summoned up by each turning of a corner my feet knew where they were leading me when i arrived at the doorstep of her tenement guarded by the dog who did not bark at my approach was i surprised a little the part of me that desired hertotally without question beyond reasonhad outfoxed the part of me that knew such a thing was impossible improper absurd absurdity more than anything else might have stayed me a much older man hankering after a beautiful young woman inevitably presents a preposterous scene i thought of every lecherous old fool i had ever seen on the stage and cringed at the idea of making a comic spectacle of myself even assuming that my advances were welcomed and mutually desired there were complicationsnot least the fact that the object of my desire might be as mad as everyone said in which case was i not equally mad to be pursuing her as to the greatest complication of allmy companion and wife of many years ailing and alone in her bed at homei could not even bear to think of that in the end i was hardly thinking at all as i found myself propelled forward by some mechanism of the body far removed from conscious thought if she had not been in her room or if rupa had been there perhaps things might have turned out very differently but she was there and she was alone i pulled back the curtain unannounced and without warning expecting to give her a start instead she slowly turned her face in my direction sat up on the pallet and rose to her feet as she slowly walked toward me her eyes never left mine she parted her lips and opened her arms i let the curtain drop behind me i think i let out a little cry like a child overwhelmed by an unfamiliar emotion as her lips met mine and covered them xii the morning after my visits to antonia and cytheris i again rose early bethesda stirred and spoke a little but remained in bed she had almost entirely stopped eating and this even more than her lethargy was beginning to worry me her face had become gaunt her eyes vacant the powerful will that had ruled my household for so many years seemed to be seeping out of her little by little leaving only a shell behind the day was already warm but a chill passed through me for the very first timealways before i had managed to avoid the thoughti had an inkling of what the world would be like without her i had experienced life before bethesda but so long ago i could hardly remember such a thing to imagine a life after bethesda was almost impossible i reminded myself that in such matters we mortals seldom have a choice physicians and radish soup and prayers to the gods notwithstanding i ate a little i summoned androcles and mopsus to help put on my toga then sent them to do the same for davus thus my day began as had the previous two and i realized with a twinge of mingled pleasure and guilt that i had begun to enjoy this routine it gave me something to take my mind off bethesda and my debts and the discord in my household in a curious way even though it was all about her it even took my mind off cassandra or at least gave me something to think about besides the obsessive longing she had stirred in meand the consequent guiltand the grief i had felt when she died in my arms i realized as i made plans and preparations for the day that i was working againnot for another and not for money alas but working nonetheless at the curious trade that had sustained me throughout my life in recent years i had gradually retired from that trade leaving it to eco i had become gordianus the husband gordianus the father gordianus the chinwagger in the forum and even against all expectations gordianus the illicit loverbut no longer gordianus the finder now i once again found myself doing what i had always done best looking for the truth of a matter that no one else cared or dared to pursue i had found my bearings and settled like a wagon wheel into a familiar groove in spite of all my reasons to feel miserable at least i could say with certainty who and what i was i was gordianus the finder again pursuing the course the gods had laid down for me davus stepped into the garden from the satisfied slightly stupid look on his face i suspected that he and my daughter had found their own release from the strains of life at some point during the night and why not i tried to suppress a twinge of envy how is davuss question was cut off with a yawn as he stretched his arms above his head disarranging the folds of his toga bethesda is no better but no worse i said hoping i spoke the truth and where are we off to this morning fatherinlaw at the height of milos power when he ruled a veritable army of street gangs in competition with clodius he and his wife fausta had lived in one of the citys more imposing houses a worthy habitation for the daughter of the dictator sulla and the husband from whom she expected great things that house and its contents had been confiscated by the state and sold at auction not long after milos exile from rome fausta though she remained married to milo refused to accompany him to massilia without a house where was she to live and by what means as it turned out the law included a provision for an abandoned wife to reclaim her dowry from the first proceeds of confiscated property faustas dowry had been considerable and after the auction she managed to get much of it back with that money she had moved into a smaller more humble dwelling on the far side of the palatine hill from my own she was not exactly poor but she had fallen a great distance in the world what will this one be like asked davus as we headed out what do you mean so far i havent known quite what to make of all these women i laughed what can i tell you about fausta on the one occasion when i met her which was shortly before milo went into exile she was taking a bath with two of his gladiatorsand she invited me to join them that sort of behavior was what ended her first marriage before milo she was seeing two lovers on the sideso goes the storyand being rather blatant about it one was a fuller who owned a woolwashing operation the other was a fellow called macula on account of a birthmark on his cheek that looked like a stain her twin brother faustus made a crack about it seeing that she has the personal services of a fuller i dont see why she doesnt get rid of that stain my sisters behavior is less than immaculate immaculate davus repeated slowly grasping the pun exactly but faustas husband didnt find the situation quite so amusing he divorced her for adultery then she married milo several steps up socially for him for her he must have seemed a good prospect perhaps milos ruthlessness appealed to her maybe it reminded her of her father who knew his career would end in murder and exile just a few years later the scandals started the very day after their wedding when milo came home and caught her in the act with a fellow named sallust milo gave sallust a sound thrashing which was of course his legal rightindeed milo could have killed him and it wouldnt have been murderand confiscated his moneybag for a fine but fausta was incorrigible not long after the incident with sallust she invited not one but two lovers to come over one afternoon then milo showed up one of the fellows managed to hide in a wardrobe but milo caught the other dragged him out of the bedroom and proceeded to beat him to a pulp meanwhile the first fellow slipped back into faustas bed and the two of them made mad passionate love to the sound of the other fellow screaming and begging milo for mercy before you point out the obvious davus i will fausta enjoys being caught he frowned and perhaps milo enjoyed catching her otherwise why didnt he divorce her because faustas connections were too valuable to him politically and socially her dowry was valuable too not all marriages are like yours with my daughter davus based oni almost said blind lust but that would have been unfairbased on mutual love desire and respect some marriages are based on other considerationspower money prestige especially marriages among the best people or those aspiring to join their ranks which isnt to say that milo and fausta didnt find one another attractive i think there was a definite spark between themher all ginger hair and voluptuous curves him all hot tempered and hairy chested eventually things settled down between the two of them maybe milo finally scared off all her lovers he tended to his political career she appeared beside him as his dutiful wife who could doubt that one day he would be elected consul and she would be a consuls wife then came the murder of clodius and milos career went up in smoke why didnt fausta divorce him especially if she didnt want to go into exile with him and he was never coming back i dont know davus shall we ask her the slave who opened the door had the overfed oversexed look of a grizzled gladiator gone to seed that made him a walking contradiction how many gladiators live long enough to go to seed two smoldering eyes peered at us from beneath a single bristling eyebrow but he was probably cleverer than he looked how else had he survived long enough to acquire a few gray hairs not to mention the plum job of waiting on a highborn lady with a special appreciation for gladiators i wondered how many men he had killed in his life to arrive at this particular perch he crossed his arms while i gave him my name and requested a few moments of his mistresss time his forearms were the size of my thighs and covered with ugly scars with a jolt i suddenly recognized him birria one of milos most prized gladiators he had been directly involved in the skirmish with clodius that day on the appian way he was also one of the gladiators who had been lounging with fausta in her bath on the occasion when i met her i was surprised milo had not taken birria with him knowing the slaves reputation as a trained killer perhaps birria had been part of faustas dowry settlement and so had remained with her he had gained a great deal of weight since i last saw him and not much of it was muscle birria left us in the foyer while he went to announce us the house was even gloomier and more bereft of ornaments than i had expected one feature did catch my eye however it gave me quite a start it is the custom of roman nobles to display busts of their illustrious ancestors in niches in the foyers of their homes in faustas foyer there were only one niche and one bust pacing the little room turning on my heel i abruptly found myself facetoface with the image of lucius cornelius sulla the dictator i had met him once like so many others i had been charmedand a little terrified an appetite for pleasure and for cruelty had radiated from him like the heat of the sun at midsummer men averted their faces in sullas presence fearful of being scorched his examplewinning a bloody civil war attaining absolute power and using it to behead his enemies reforming the state in his image and then turning his back on ithad haunted rome for two generations depending on ones political point of view his legacy had either broken the constitution or else failed to shore it up enoughand in either case had generated a series of disasters that led directly across the decades to the present moment with the republic paralyzed and rome holding its breath for the arrival of a second sulla he had been dead now for over thirty years but the eyes that peered from the marble image in faustas foyer still had the power to chill my blood from somewhere deeper in the house i heard the sound of a man shouting the words were indistinct but the tone was angry and demeaning who was shouting who was being shouted at a little later birria returned was he more sullen than when hed left with such an ugly face it was hard to tell the mistress cant see you today he said no perhaps i gave her your name she knows who you are she doesnt have time to see you perhaps you could go back and mention another name he scowled what would that be cassandra tell her that i want to talk about cassandra wont make a difference youd better go now he walked up to me squaring his massive shoulders to block my way he didnt stop but strode right into me forcing me to take tripping back ward steps behind me davus emitted a threatening grunt i looked over my shoulder and saw a scowl on his face to match the gladiators i felt like a man caught between two snorting bulls from behind birria i heard a womans shrill voice no birria stop this no fighting before papas image ive decided to see the finder after all i i want to see him her voice had an oddly plaintive tone as if she were asking for permission birria stopped and stared down at me then over my head at davus i smelled garlic on his breathgladiators eat it for strengthand wrinkled my nose at last he stepped back and out of the way as you wish mistress he said glaring at me davus and i stepped past him toward fausta instead of waiting she turned away while we were still several paces distant and began to lead us down a dim hallway this way follow me where shall we not the garden i think no definitely not the garden well talk in the baiae room yes that will do she kept several paces ahead of me i found myself staring at the mass of ginger hair pinned atop her head and the jiggling of her ample back side beneath her orange stola i noticed with a startfor until then she had managed to hide itthat one of her arms was in a sling and that she was walking with a slight limp had she suffered an accident the chamber she called the baiae room was a narrow alcove off a hall the only light came from the doorway lamps were hung from the ceiling but none were lit and so the room was dim and shadowy even so i could see how the room came to have its name the floor was a mosaic in many shades of green and blue touched with flashes of gold depicting various creatures of the deepoctopi whales dolphins fishand bordered with images of seashells the walls of the room were painted with scenes of villas perched above the sea cliffs of baiae i stepped closer losing myself in the picture until the voice of fausta called me back why dont the two of you sit over there in those chairs at the far end of the room she said ill sit here close by the doorway this must be a very beautiful room when its well lit i said taking a seat and gesturing to davus to do the same oh yes my brother faustus used to own this house he didnt actually live here he only kept it as a sort of guest house a place to lend out to visitors and friends faustus was awfully flush with money at the time he spent a great deal on fixtures and stonework and such he doted on this little room more than any other the mosaics and the wall paintings are meant to be viewed by lamplight at night its quite a magical place when you see it that way by day its rather dim in here isnt it and it could use a bit of restoration i dont think the painters quite knew what they were doing in places theres an awful lot of peeling and flaking of course i cant afford to have it properly redone and neither could faustus these days but once the war is over his fortunes will change for the better caesars rich supporters will lose their heads along with their estates and men like faustus will get whats due to them thats how my father rewarded his partisans giving them the best of the booty seized from his enemies pompey will do the same if he has any sense what do you think gordianus is pompey half the man my father was twice the man but half the monster i wanted to say but bit my tongue i had the feeling she was teasing me but it was hard to read her expression she sat with her back to the door so the light came from behind her and cast her face in shadow you think it will be pompey who triumphs then i said i might have thought in light of recent events you mean this business with my husband and caelius i couldnt see her face but i could hear the disgust in her voice as soon as word reached rome that milo had slipped out of massilia isauricus himself came here to question me he assumed since im still married to milo that i would be able to tell him exactly what my husband was up to even though i hadnt seen milo in years or exchanged a letter in months do you think i can read milos mind at a distance of several hundred miles i asked him do you think that i can predict what the fool will do next i ran isauricus out of the house and he hasnt come back i nodded considering the state of faustas household the consul had probably decided that she posed no threat and wasnt worth keeping an eye on i shifted uneasily in my chair frustrated at being unable to see her face clearly fausta sighed fortune was cruel to milo cruel to us both to be perfectly candidand ill be more candid with you than i was with isauricusi wasnt the least bit surprised when i heard about milo escaping from massilia and coming back to italy nor was i surprised to learn that he had taken up with marcus caelius each chose to follow a different leader both of those leaders cruelly let them down pompey abandoned milo and caesar shunted caelius aside milo and caelius are like two orphans taking up with each other so they wont be alone there must be many more like them big men and little men all feeling abandoned by whichever leader they chose all feeling angry and cheated at the prospect of either of those leaders winning why not turn away from caesar and pompey both and find a third way to the future it makes perfect senseif they can pull it off can they how should i know do i look like cassandra i drew a breath how well did you know her did anyone really know cassandra thats why youve come of course not to ask after milo or me but because i came to cassandras funeral and you want to talk about her am i right yes she nodded i sought her out one day in the market i invited her here she stared at a flame and had a fit i listened to what she had to say gave her a few coins and sent her on her way why not every woman in rome was desperate to hear what cassandra had to tell them and what did she tell you fausta laughed a bunch of garbled nonsense truthfully i couldnt make sense of it i suppose im too literal minded for that sort of thing why do oracles and portents always have to be so obscure call a truffle a truffle thats what i say i never much liked plays or poetry for the same reason ive no patience for metaphors and similes cassandra didnt foretell milos return and his alliance with caelius fausta shrugged and winced a biti heard her hissas she rearranged her arm in the sling oh there was something about a bear and a snake i think and two eagles was the bear milo was the snake caelius were the eagles pompey and caesar or was it all the other way around your guess is as good as mine she sighed milo was always so much more interested in that sort of thing than i was really oh yes he always took omens very seriously more now than ever i should think why do you say that becauseshe sighed heavilyon that fateful day when clodius died milo saw all sorts of bad omens before we ever set out on the appian way he saw a vulture flying upside down and then a duck with three feet crossed our path or so he claimed later when everything started going wrong that day milo kept muttering i should have paid attention to the signs i should have known there would be trouble we should never have set out we should have stayed home you probably never saw that side of him he didnt talk much about premonitions and such except to me because cicero would make such fun of him for being so superstitious but milo was always on the look out for portents a lot of good it ever did him whats the use of seeing a falling star if its careening straight toward you i nodded you say that i came only to ask after cassandra not you and milo but thats not entirely true would you take it amiss if i asked you a personal question ask and find out why are you still married to milo you didnt go with him to massilia you stayed here with no prospect of his ever returning to you why not divorce him so that you might remarry she snorted and for a moment i thought i had offended her but her exasperation was with her fate not with me like many people burdened with regrets she was not averse to voicing her bitterness to a relative stranger one divorce has pretty much become the standard these days hasnt it among the fashionable set i mean but two divorceswell that begins to look a bit careless dont you think my first husband divorced me as a sort of punishment for cuckolding him that wasnt a problem with milo milo rather liked being cuckolded i think it gave him an excuse to vent his rage it stimulated him he was never such a tiger in bed as he was right after catching me with another man so strong so violent im afraid i rather developed a taste for that sort of thing she readjusted her sling and hissed but i digress i stayed married to milo because it was the respectable thing to do believe it or not that still matters to me i am sullas daughter i wont have people saying i abandoned my husband simply because he ran into a bit of trouble a murder conviction and lifelong exile hardly seemed to me to be a bit of trouble but my standards differed from those of fausta in many matters or could it be i said that in the long run you had faith in milo that you could foresee a time when he might return to rome in triumph beheading his enemies as your father beheaded his making himself the first man in rome and yourself the first among women such a thing might actually come to pass i realized with a chill whether caesar or pompey eventually returned in the meantime milo and caelius might pull off their mad scheme and make themselves masters of rome such a thing would never happen without the spilling of much blood she made a derisive sound deep in her throat dont compare milo to my father he knew how to make this town come to heel instead of letting the shewolf bite him in the ass we shall never see his like againnot in caesar not in pompey certainly not in milo the best i can hope forshe hesitated but a sudden burst of emotion was too much for her to containthe best i can hope for is to become milos widow people shall pity me then and respect me they shall say poor fausta she suffered greatly from her second marriage but she stood by that fool to the very end didnt she she proved her mettle she was truly sullas daughter i considered this for a long moment wishing i could see her face more clearly but the light from outside was growing stronger as the morning drew on casting her features even deeper into shadow i dont quite understand i confessed i wouldnt expect you to youre not one of those who countnot one of us not a noble you mean she shook her head not a woman she stood indicating that the interview was at an end in the hallway she drew back into a shadowy corner again i noticed her slight limp birria appeared to show us out he curled his lip and from under his bristling brow gave her a look that seemed to border on madness until i realized it was lasciviousness i saw in his eyes i looked at fausta despite the shadows i saw what she had been deliberately concealing by sitting against the lighta bruised black crescent beneath one of her eyes i looked back at birria and matched his glare with my own fausta i said do you need our help what do you mean you limp your arm is in a sling she shrugged its nothing really certainly nothing to concern you a small accident im a bit clumsy sometimes i find that hard to believe of sullas daughter what you believe is of no consequence finder go now and birria after youve shown these two out come straight back to me he gave her a snarling grin but it was the crooked smile she flashed back at him that made my blood run cold i turned and walked quickly to the front door not waiting for birria to lead the way in the foyer i paused for a moment to gaze at the marble bust of sulla and to wonder at the curious events it must have witnessed in that house xiii the sixth time i saw cassandraand the seventh and eighth and ninth and all the other times before her deathare jumbled in my mind even the exact number of times eludes me my memories of those meetings blur together as the heated flesh of two lovers becomes blurred in the act of love so that the lover cannot tell where his own body ends and that of the beloved begins after the first time we made love we arranged to meet again in her room in the subura at a specific time on a specific day thus our pattern was set these arrangements were determined by cassandra partly i think to coincide with her mornings at the public baths for i always found her fresh and clean but also i assumed to make sure that rupa would not be there when i came was he her lover her slave a relative i didnt know she never told me i never asked what did we talk about in the spells between lovemaking nothing remotely to do with our complicated circumstances nothing that might impinge upon the special world the two of us created in that room i think i did speak sometimes of diana and davus and hieronymus and androcles and mopsus especially if one of them had just done something to frustrate me or to make me laugh and i told her about meto and the heartbreak i felt at losing him but i never spoke of bethesda or bethesdas illness and cassandra never spoke of rupa or about her visits to the houses of the highborn and welltodo women of rome nor did she tell me where she came from i didnt care i didnt want her history and i had no thought of the future i wanted from her the thing that she gave me in that room the joining of two bodies that filled the present moment to miraculous perfection i expected nothing else from her she seemed to expect nothing else from me she stirred in me sensations of youth almost forgotten in flashes i imagined myself a young wanderer in alexandria again i was the young man i once had been in love with the power of his own body in love for the first time with the body of another in awe of the extraordinary pleasures those two bodies could share and naive enough to think that no one else on earth had ever experienced sensations so exquisite in cassandras room time and space lost all meaning together we conjured a kind of sorcery what did cassandra see in me long ago i had accepted that the attractions of women would always be a puzzle to me best to accept the inexplicable without question when it worked in my favor still looking at my face one day in a mirror of polished silverthe last time i looked in that mirror for soon after i sold it to get a few sesterces to feed the householdi saw a gray bearded man whose face was lined with worries and i wondered what cassandra could find attractive in that weathered countenance i gazed for a long time in that mirror i squinted i blurred my eyes i looked sidelong but i couldnt catch even a fleeting glimpse of the man i became when i was with her there was some advantage in appearing so unlikely a lover no one in my household suspected when i reappeared after being gone for hours at a time diana if she noticed might chide me for going out without davus to protect me hieronymus might ask what news i brought from the chinwaggers in the forum bethesda calling from her bed might ask why i had failed to bring her the latest impossibletofind item she had decided might cure her they were scolding or curious or complaining but not suspicious nonetheless they all noticed a change in me i was more patient less truculent i no longer snapped at hieronymus once again his wit delighted me and eventually i convinced him to again take dinner with the family the antics of mopsus and androcles amused rather than rankled when davus seemed most slowwitted i found him most charming and thought to myself no wonder my daughter fell in love with such a fine fellow diana was more beautiful and intelligent than ever and bethesda bethesda remained unwell her malady had settled into her body like a spiteful vagrant lurking in a house careful never to be seen but leaving unnerving signs of his presence everywhere at first her illness had made her snappish and demanding then she became increasingly withdrawn and quiet which was much worse because it was so out of character for her her spirits darkened even as mine became lighter in her presence i was torn with guilt not so much because i had been with another womanthe physical act of sex conjured no shame in mebut because i had stumbled into something singular wonderful and wholly unexpected even while bethesda fell prey to something awful uncertain and lingering all our lives bethesda and i had shared everything as much as any two people could now we each had ventured to a place where the other could not followand in opposite directions my experience was magical hers miserable i felt the guilt of the wellfed man watching his loved one choke on sawdust and bones in the meantime news of the war continued to arrive from greece one heard all sorts of contradictory reportsthat caesar had outmaneuvered pompey that pompey had outmaneuvered caesar for a while from aprilis to midquinctilis the two made their camps and built fortifications in the region of dyrrachium the principal seaport on the eastern side of the adriatic sea both sides seemed set to make the rugged mazelike hills and gorges around dyrrachium the arena for a decisive battle but after an engagement in which pompey very nearly overran his forces caesar saw himself at a disadvantage and moved inland toward the region of thessaly the decisive battle was yet to come my visits to cassandra blur together in my memory but two incidents stand out just as she never spoke of her visits to highborn women so she never spoke of the reason for those visits her spells of prophecy i did begin once to ask her about them but she replied by placing her forefinger perpendicular to my lips and then distracting me in other ways why did i not press her for details i can see reasons but only in retrospect if she were a fraud i didnt want to know it if she were genuine and gazing into a flame could induce her to utter prophecies i didnt want to hear them why seek a glimpse of the future when the future could hold only darkness in cassandra i had found a way to live in the present nevertheless on one occasion i saw the god pass through her we were lying naked side by side on her pallet sweat lubricating our flesh where our bodies were pressed close together i was watching the progress of a fly on the wall its wings made iridescent by sunlight from the high window cassandra was humming softly her eyes closed for a moment i thought i recognized the tunean alexandrian lullaby bethesda had sung to dianathen decided i must be mistaken the melody was close but not quite the same the humming stopped i heard only the buzzing of the fly across the room cassandra gave a lurch so violent that i almost fell from the narrow bed she struck my nose with her elbow i rolled away covering my face i jumped to my feet and looked back cassandra remained on the bed her head rolling her trunk twisting her limbs flailing the effect was uncanny as if every part of her had become a separate animal with a will of its own her eyes rolled upward showing only white suddenly she sat bolt upright i thought the spell was over then she fell back on the bed arching her spine and convulsing i had never seen anything like it the fit she had suffered outside the temple of vesta had been nothing like this something meto had once said came back to me he was always afraid he might swallow his tongue hes told me i must be prepared to put something in his mouth if his fits should ever recur meto had been talking about caesar i seemed to hear his voice in my ear put something in her mouth i jumped and looked over my shoulder thinking for a moment that meto was actually in the room anything seemed possible a god was passing through cassandra the very air around me seemed to shudder and spark with intimations of the supernatural i remembered the leather baton i had noticed once before the first time i came to see her i reached under the mattress and found it almost at once as if an invisible hand guided me to it i clambered atop cassandra holding her down with my weight i tried to pin her wrists with one hand so that i could force the biting stick between her teeth but she was too strong as soon as i managed to contain one part of her another part broke free the bed itself seemed to come alive pitching up and down and banging against the wall from down the hall i heard someone shout for venuss sake you two keep it down in there as suddenly as it had begun the seizure ended beneath me her body went limp the change was so abrupt that for a moment i thought she might be dead i pushed myself up and looked down at her my heart in my throat then i saw her chest rise as she drew a deep breath her eyelids flickered it seemed to me that the passage of the god had forced her spirit out of her and for a moment after the god passed through there was no animation in her at all gradually reentering her body her spirit seemed confused uncertain it had returned to the right place she blinked and opened her eyes she seemed not to recognize me cassandra i whispered reaching out to wipe flecks of foam from her lips i brushed my fingers against her cheek she reached up to cover my hand with hers her grip was as weak as a childs gordianus she said im here cassandra are you all right do you need anything she closed her eyes i felt a stab of fear but she was only resting she reached up and pulled me against her embracing me humming the lullaby she had been humming before rocking me gently as if i were the one who needed comforting where had she been what had she seen after that day i understood the fascination she inspired in the rich and powerful women who thought they could harness for their own ends the power that coursed through cassandra later that day when i returned to my house everyone noticed my split lip including bethesda who at dinner was in better spirits than she had been in for quite a while and in a mood to gently scold me run afoul of some ruffians in the forum husband she asked no wife a brawl in some shady tavern then of course not she raised an eyebrow perhaps a beautiful woman gave you a slap for getting fresh with her my face grew hot something like that bethesda smiled and told mopsus to bring her more stewed leeks the latest cure in which she had vested her hopes she seemed satisfied to allow the cause of my swollen lip to remain a mystery but i noticed that diana reclining on one elbow beside davus on their dining couch had fixed me with a darkly questioning gaze among those meetings with cassandra that blur together in my memory another incident stands out not least because it occurred on the last day we met in her room in the subura it was the last day we would be alone together the last time we would make love i had no way of knowing that at the time had i known would i have held her more tightly made love to her more passionately that hardly seems possible i fear i might have done the opposite become remote and drawn away from herdoing as many men do when they realize they must lose the thing they love looking for a shortcut around their suffering they push away the thing they love before it can be snatched from them i never had to confront that dilemma i never saw what was coming it was a warm early afternoon the day before the nones of sextilis not a breeze stirred in all of rome a stifling haze had settled over the city cassandras room in the subura was like a heated cubicle at the baths warmth radiated from the walls a shaft of sunlight entered through the high window and struck the opposite wall so thick with motes of dust that it seemed a solid thing a strangely glowing beam lodged above our heads i had thought the heat would stifle our lovemaking but it had the opposite effect acting on us like a drug the normal limitations on my body melted away i transcended myself i entered a state of rapture so complete i no longer knew where or who i was afterward i felt as light and insubstantial as one of those motes of dust riding the sunbeam above our heads a delicious lethargy overcame me i felt heavy solid inert my limbs turned to lead even a finger was too heavy to lift i seemed to dream yet the images conjured by somnus slipped away before i could apprehend them like shadows glimpsed from the corner of ones eye i neither slept nor woke slowly gradually i heard voices they seemed to come from somewhere above me muffled by distance two men were speaking their words were indistinct but i could tell that their discussion was heated keep your voice down one of them said loud enough for me to hear i knew that voice i stirred i seemed to be waking from a dream for a long moment i thought the voices had been part of that dream then i heard them again they came from the room above partly i heard them through the floor but mostly from the high window which must have been directly below a window of the room above i sensed that cassandra was gone even before i reached for her and found the place beside me empty the spot was still warm from her body the speakers in the room above lowered their voices i heard them now only as a murmur surely i had only imagined that i recognized one of those voices i got out of bed reached for my loincloth and stepped into it then put on my tunic i stepped past the curtain that covered cassandras doorway into the hallway beyond around a bend past other curtained doorways i came to a flight of wooden steps i took them slowly trying to make no noise even so the very last step before i arrived at the next floor made a loud creak the murmur of voices that came from the room at the end of the hall abruptly ceased i took another step the floorboard creaked from the room at the end of the hall there came only silence i stood motionless for a long time then i heard a voice the one i had recognized before say quite distinctly do you think thats him it must be said the other man with a start i recognized his voice as well i had to be mistaken my imagination was running away with me to prove it i walked steadily down the hallway heedless of creaking floorboards i confronted a curtain much like the curtain that covered cassandras doorway i stared at the curtain from beyond came only silenceor rather not quite silence but the sound of men breathing did i only imagine that or could they hear me breathing as well i raised my hand to grip the curtains edge and imagined someone on the other side doing the same would he be holding a dagger in his other hand i yanked the curtain aside hardening my nerves to confront a face staring back at me nosetonose but i was alone at the threshold the occupantsjust the two of them without a bodyguard in sightwere seated in the middle of the small room at the sight of me they rose from their chairs after the dim hallway the light from the window dazzled me for a moment i saw them only as two very different silhouettes one broad and stocky the other tall and elegantly slender gradually their faces came into focus you see said marcus caelius to his companion its gordianus just as i said so it is said milo crossing his brawny arms well dont just stand there finder drop the curtain and come inside and keep your voice down xiv my interview with fausta left me in a foul mood i almost decided to leave off for the day and return home but what would i do there except brood there was plenty to brood aboutcassandra dead and my investigations leading me no nearer to the reason bethesda ill and growing weaker with no cure in sight rome tottering on a narrow precipice with a chasm on either side one called pompey and the other caesar and two mastiffs called milo and caelius biting at her heels the day was in direct counterpoint to my mood the sun shone bright and warm its intensity relieved by a succession of magnificent clouds that advanced slowly across the azure sky spaced apart as evenly as if some parade master had arrayed them like elephants in an imperators triumphal procession that one looks like a tragedy mask you can even see the holes for the eyes and mouth said davus what that cloud up there isnt that what youre staring at we sat on a stone bench in a little square not far from faustas house i had told davus that i needed to rest for a moment in fact it was my mind that was weary and needed to come to a complete stop i had been staring at the parade of clouds and emptying my head of every thought yes davus a tragedy mask only now its changing see how the mouth is bending you might almost say it was a comedy mask i see what you mean but the whole shape is changing isnt it its not really like a mask anymore more likenothing really just a cloud rather like my pursuit of the truth about cassandra i thought my interviews had yielded a continual series of impressions that flowed one into another all slightly different all somehow askew none of them quite recognizable as the cassandra i had known the truth about her was as elusive as a cloud holding its shape only until the next interview changed it into something else only two more to go i said clouds said davus no only two more women to talk to of those who came to watch cassandras funeral pyre calpurnia and clodia shall we go see one of them now fatherinlaw why not on such a beautiful day i think i know where clodia will be we crossed the bridge to the far side of the tiber and turned to the right keeping as close to the river as we could here away from the bustle of the citys center the wealthiest families of rome kept little garden estates called horti along the waterfront clodias horti had been in her family for generations it was there i had first met her eight years ago when she summoned me to investigate the murder of the egyptian philosopher dio marcus caelius had been her lover but they had fallen out and clodia had been determined to exact her revenge by prosecuting him for dios murder clodias horti were also the last place i had seen her when i came to her after her beloved brothers murder on the appian way fulvia had been clodiuss wife but there were those who said clodia was the true widow no matter that she was the dead mans sister as davus and i walked along the road i caught only occasional glimpses of the river to our right more often high walls blocked our view once access to the horti along the tiber had been relatively open but in recent years many owners had built high fences and walls to keep out strangers when we did pass by an unwalled estate i saw patches of woodland and tall grass interspersed with meticulously cultivated gardens through the foliage i caught glimpses of rustic sheds and charming little guest houses shadedappled fishponds and splashing fountains stonepaved walkways adorned with statuary and boat ramps projecting into the glimmering tiber clodias horti were far enough from the citys center to feel secluded yet close enough to reach by footan enviable location for a piece of riverfront property in the capital of the world cicero who had done a thorough job of destroying clodias reputation in the process of defending caelius had had the gall to try to buy her horti from clodia only only a few years later clodia had refused even to speak to his agent unlike many of her neighbors clodia had resisted the trend of encircling her horti with high walls coming upon the narrow lane that led off the main road into her grounds i had the feeling of being somewhere far away from the city with all its crimes and riots the lane was bordered by sprawling berry bushes that met overhead shading the way this tunnellike path opened onto a broad swath of high grass once i remembered that grass had been kept closely mown by a pair of goats the goats were gone what had once been a lawn had become a wild meadow facing the meadow and perpendicular to the river which was almost entirely obscured by an intervening stand of dense trees was a long narrow house with a portico running along the front the house was not as i remembered tiles were missing from the roof some of the shutters were askew hanging from broken hinges the shrubbery along the portico perfectly trimmed in my memory was overgrown and choked with weeds i remembered clodias horti echoing with music and the laughter of naked bathers on the riverbank all i heard on this day was the buzzing of cicadas in the high grass the place seemed utterly deserted with not even a groundskeeper to look after it doesnt look like anyones here said davus perhaps not on such a beautiful day its hard to imagine she wouldnt be here she used to love this place so much but times change people change the world grows older i sighed still lets take a look down by the river avoiding the high grass we walked along the portico that fronted the house where the shutters hung off their hinges i peeked inside the windows the rooms were dark but i could see that some had been stripped entirely of their furnishings the place smelled of dust and mildew we came to the end of the portico here a little path wound among magnificent yew trees and cypresses leading down to the waters edge i had given up on finding clodia but for nostalgias sake i wanted to stand for a moment at the place where i had first met her she had been lounging on a high couch in her redandwhitestriped pavilion wearing a gown of sheerest gossamer while she watched a band of young men including her brother clodius frolic naked in the water for her amusement we made our way through the trees to my surprise a lone figure sat in a folding chair on the riverbank facing the water it was a woman wearing a stola better suited for winter days the wool was dark gray and the sleeves covered her arms her dark hair was streaked with gray and pulled back in a bun what was she doing here she hardly looked like the sort of woman to be a friend of clodias she must have heard us for she turned about in the chair and peered up at us shading her brow against the sun so that her face was obscured does clodia know youre here i asked the woman laughed it was her laugh i recognizedsly indulgent intimating unspoken secrets have i really changed that much gordianus you havent changed a bit clodia i whispered she lowered her hand i saw her face her eyes were the sameemerald green as bright as sunlight on the green tiberbut time had caught up with the rest of her it had been only four years since i had last seen her how could she have aged so much in that time to be sure she had taken no pains to look her best that in itself marked a change clodia had always been vain about her appearance but on this day she wore no makeup to accentuate her eyes and lips no jewelry to adorn her ears and throat and a drab stola that did nothing to flatter her her hair usually elaborately dressed and colored with henna was pulled back in a simple bun and showed an abundance of gray the most subtle difference and yet the most telling was the fact that she seemed to be wearing no scent clodias perfume a heady blend of spikenard and crocus oil had haunted me for years it was impossible to think of her without recalling that scent yet on this day standing near her i smelled only the rank green smell of the riverbank on a summer day she smiled whom did you expect to find here no one the house appears deserted so it is theres no one else here i said no one at all clodia had always surrounded herself with admiring sycophants who spouted poetry beautiful slaves of both genders and a veritable army of loverscastoff lovers current lovers wouldbe lovers awaiting their turn no one but me she said i came by litter early this morning then sent the bearers back to my house on the palatine i come here very seldom nowadays but when i do i prefer to be alone slaves can be so tiresome standing about waiting for instructions and theres no one left in rome worth inviting to a bathing party all the beautiful young men are off getting themselves killed somewhere or theyre dead already she looked past me at davus except for this one who is he gordianus i smiled despite a twinge of jealously davus is my soninlaw can your little girl really be old enough to be married and to such a mountain of muscles lucky little diana maybe hed like to take a swim in the river she stared at davus like a hungry tigress perhaps she had not changed so very much after all i raised an eyebrow i think not davus gazed at the sparkling water actually fatherinlaw its such a hot day by all means go jump in the water said clodia i insist slip out of that silly toga and whatever youre wearing underneath you can hang your things on that tree branch there just as all the young men used to do i remember that branch piled high with castoff garments davus looked at me his brow glistened with sweat oh very well i said clodia laughed softly stop glowering gordianus unless youd like to take a swim as well youll find another folding chair in that little leanto over there theres also a box with a bit of food and some wine when i returned with the chair and the box davus was striding toward the rivers edge barefoot and wearing only his loincloth young man called clodia davus looked over his shoulder come back here young man davus headed back a questioning look on his face as soon as he was within range clodia reached out gripped his loincloth and deftly pulled it off she sat back in her chair and spun the loincloth on her forefinger for a moment before tossing it with perfect aim atop the toga draped over the tree branch there thats better a fellow as handsome as you should go into the river just as the gods made you i expected davus to blush and stammer but instead he grinned stupidly let out a whoop and ran splashing into the water i sighed you still have the power to make grown men into little boys i see every man except you gordianus by hercules look at the thighs on that fellowand whats between them hes a veritable stallion are you sure hes not too much for little diana to handle i cleared my throat perhaps we could speak of something else must we on such a day how pleasant it would be to speak only of youth and beauty and love but knowing you gordianus i suppose youve come to talk about misery and murder and death one death in particular the seeress she was called cassandra yes i know you were there to see her burn clodia was silent for a moment watching davus splash in the water i thought perhaps you had come to bring me other news about what that monster milo and marcus caelius this silly doomed revolt of theirs what do you care about that they shall both get themselves killed probably caelius she stared at the water lost in thought long ago when we were lovers caelius used to swim out there while i watched just the two of us alone on this stretch of the riverbank we needed no one else i remember him standing just where your soninlaw is standing now naked with his back to mecaelius had a delicious back sidethen slowly turning around to show me his grin and the fact that he was rampant and ready for love you must have seen many men since then bathing naked out there none like caelius yet you came to hate him he deserted me you tried to destroy him but i didnt succeed did i i only did harm to myself and now without any assistance from me caelius seems determined to destroy himself she closed her eyes gone she whispered all gone my dear sweet brother fulvias beloved curio so many of the beautiful young men who used to come here cavorting in the water without a care even that pest catullus with his wretched poems whom shall the fates take next marcus caelius i suppose after so many years of laughing in their faces the fates shall snatch him up and send him straight to hades youll be revenged on him at last she nodded thats one way of looking at it i came to talk about cassandra not caelius ah yes the seeress you say that with irony in your voice did she prophesy for you why do you ask gordianus she was murdered i want to find out why she died and who killed her why it wont bring her back she tilted her head and looked at me keenly then made a face oh dear is that it now i see well well cassandra succeeded where clodia failed if you mean you were in love with her werent you i had never said that word aloud not even to cassandra herself perhaps at any rate you made love to her yes she released a sigh of mingled exasperation and amusement fortunes wheel spins round and round now clodia finds herself celibateand the everfaithful gordianus is an adulterer who would ever have thought it the gods must be laughing at us so i have long suspected she stared abstractedly at the glinting sunlight on the water and bit her thumbnail that was rude of me to speak so glibly you must be quite devastated cassandras death was a blow to me yes among many other blows of late gordianus the stoic you should learn to vent your emotions drink yourself into a stupor destroy some irreplaceable object in a rage spend an hour or two torturing one of your slaves youll feel better id rather find out who killed cassandra and why and then what i saw the other women who came to watch cassandras funeral pyre if it was one of them what action could you possibly take the courts are a shambles no magistrate will show any interest in the murder of a nobody like cassandra and every one of those women is too powerful for you to take on by yourself youll never find justice then ill settle for finding the truth how strange you are gordianus they say each mortal has a guiding passion seeking pleasure seems endlessly more sensible to me but if finding truth is yours so be it clodia shrugged even though the gesture was almost swallowed by her voluminous stola even though age and suffering had changed her outwardly in that eloquent rise and fall of her shoulders i caught a glimpse of the essential clodia that shrug summed up everything about her in an instant she had lived a life larger than most men dreamed of had devoured every sensation flesh could offer had followed every emotion to its utmost extremityand in the end clodia shrugged i knew in that moment why i had succumbed to my desire for cassandra yet had never quite succumbed to clodia it was impossible to imagine cassandra shrugging like that the intensity with which she lived in the moment made such a gesture unthinkable once clodia had seemed to me the most vital woman alive but only because i mistook a raging appetite for a love of life and i had no one to show me the difference until i met cassandra you cant tell me anything that might be of use to me i said about cassandra tell me what you know about her already it seemed to me that clodia was intentionally avoiding my question i know that she was invited into the houses of some of the most powerful women in rome i said some of those women think she was a genuine seeress others think she was a fraud i know she came from alexandria where she acted in the mimes but her seizuresat least some of themwere entirely real what else do you know i took a breath i think she may have been involved in some wayhow im not surein this business with milo and caelius clodia raised an eyebrow i see and why is that i have my reasons clodia turned her gaze to davus who had swum a considerable distance up the river and was now swimming back what a pair of shoulders she murmured i hope your daughter appreciates them i think she does hes going to be hungry when he climbs out a good thing my pantry slave always packs more food into that box than i could possibly eat by myself what else do you know about cassandra i think gordianus that youre leaving something out i dont know what you mean dont you the most important thing of all you were in love with her hopelessly in love from the look on your face but did she love you ah really you should go take a look at yourself in the water gordianus youd see the face of a man whos just been poked where he can least stand to be touched thats what this is really about not who killed cassandra but who was cassandra what was she really up to and most important of all what did she really wantnot just from those lofty roman matrons but from a humble fellow called the finder but if you dont already know the answer to that question youll never find it now davus emerged from the water glistening wet and shaking the water from his hair magnificent arms whispered clodia growling like a tigress the war has turned rome into a city of old men and boys i thought pompey and caesar had snatched up all the worthy specimens to feed to mars but they somehow overlooked this one davus fetched his loincloth and covered himself moving with a natural unselfconscious grace that did him credit given that he must have felt clodias eyes following his every move clodia sent him to fetch a third folding chair then offered him the contents of her box she gazed at him enthralled as if no better amusement could exist than watching a hungry young man devour a roasted chicken and suck the juice from his fingers i sensed that i would learn no more about cassandra from her at least not on this occasion i decided not to press her only later would i realize how deftly she had avoided telling me anything of importance and how completely she had disarmed me with the charms she still exerted over me so i said you think that milo and clodius are doomed to fail a shadow crossed her face it seems impossible that they could succeed your brothers old nemesis and the man you hate most in the world both destroyed once and for all i should think that prospect would make you very happy clodia made no reply she continued to watch davus eat but the enjoyment i had seen on her face drained away replaced by another emotion i could not decipher xv they met under a rose i looked from face to face hardly believing what i saw the two most dangerous men in italy their whereabouts and intentions the subject of every conversation in a bare room in a shabby tenement in the heart of rome bare that is except for the two chairs in which they had been sitting a cupboard against one wall and the rooms single ornament a pocket vase made of terracotta hung on the wall above their heads and in that vase a single bloodred rose they were meeting sub rosa invoking the ancient custom that all who meet under the rose are bound to silence following my gaze marcus caelius glanced up at the rose milos idea he said he takes that sort of thing very seriously you knowsigns portents vows omens thus a rose to ensure discretionas if either one of us could possibly benefit by betraying the other of course it obliges you to keep silent as well gordianus whats the matter you look as if youd seen medusa come in im afraid we have only the two chairs so i suppose we should all remain standing i let the curtain fall behind me and stepped into the room overwhelmed by the strangeness of the moment what were they doing here in the subura more to the point what were they doing in the room directly above cassandras and on a day when cassandra knew i would be coming they were dressed to suit the room and the neighborhood in shabby tunics and worn shoes milos hair was longer than i had ever seen it pushed back from his face in a shaggy mane and his beard was untrimmed caelius had a smudge of dirt on his cheek like some common laborer it was not the first time i had seen them in disguise during one of the bloody riots following the murder of clodius milo and caelius had escaped together from an angry mob by taking off their togas and their citizenship rings and passing as slaves on this occasion caelius was wearing his ring but milos finger was bare he had been stripped of his citizenship and the right to wear a citizens ring when he was exiled from rome are these the disguises you use to go about rome incognito i asked you pose as the poor master caelius and you pose as his slave milo caelius smiled i told you he was clever milo theres not much the finder misses milo grunted and peered at me with barely concealed hostility he was no longer fat and dissipated as when i had last seen him in massilia enduring his exile in a drunken stupor the danger and difficulty of his escape and his return to rome were written on his weathered features his stocky wrestlers physique was back in fighting trim there was a hard desperate glint in his eyes you said the finder would be glad to see us caelius said milo he doesnt look glad to me he looks rather distressed only because weve taken him by surprise said caelius but how else could we approach you gordianus we could hardly have come calling at your house could we that would have put your dear family in danger as it is youve taken us a bit by surprise we were thinking we would send someone down to fetch you in a bit after your nap but here you are of your own accord i heard the two of you talking i said i recognized milos voice ha and he was the one telling me to keep quiet said caelius but thats our milo hes never known his own strength whether cracking two heads together or shouting at me to keep my voice down i shook my head i dont understand what are you doing here caelius raised an eyebrow plotting a revolution of course no i meanhere in rome everyone thinks youre long gone so i was so i shall be again i come and go like a puff of smoke but just now i happen to be back in rome plotting a revolution is complicated business gordianus tedious as welland you know ive never liked hard work you wouldnt believe the logistics it entails i have to be everywhere at once encouraging my partisans whispering comfort in the ears of the doubtful holding the hands of the fearful pressing coins in the palms of the greedy and not least approaching old friends and acquaintances to ask for their support he fixed me with a penetrating gaze and you milo i said i cant believe youve dared to set foot in rome caesar showed mercy when he let you keep your head and stay in massilia hell never forgive this does your wife know youre here leave fausta out of this snapped milo i shook my head youre both mad meeting like this in the subura youre bound to be recognized or overheard if isauricus and trebonius find you they wont said caelius they havent so far i come and go as i please in the city i have many many supporters gordianus more than you realize i imagine enough to stage a successful uprising here and now his smile wavered not quite the tender shoots still require cultivation milo and i have determined that our best course is to raise an armed force in the countryside in order to take the city by force raise an army how from where every available fighting man is already enlisted to serve either caesar or pompey but not all those men are happy there are soldiers garrisoned all over italy who were forced into caesars service theyre bored and discontented and ripe for sedition theyre jealous of their comrades who crossed the water with caesar and antony because those are the soldiers wholl share in the spoils of victory not the ones left behind all they get to do is bully a few cowering townspeople and plant babies in the local girls but youll promise them something better an attack on rome itselfcomplete with plunder for the victors will you let them sack the city caelius is this your revenge on rome milo caelius shook his head therell be plenty of plunder to reward the soldiers but it wont be taken from ordinary citizens like you gordianus it will come from the greedy landlords and moneylenders whove made themselves rich as croesus in the last year the wealth theyve stolen and hoarded will be reclaimed and redistributed beginning with the soldiers loyal to the revolution loyal to you you mean caelius shrugged someone has to lead the fight youre deluding yourself caelius if you take rome by force you wont be able to control what happens next you say youll only plunder the landlords and moneylenders but you cant guarantee that even caesars men have slipped out of his control from time to time over the years looting and burning when he gave them express orders not toand youre not caesar caelius rome is sick gordianus she requires a drastic cure even if it kills her perhaps to be reborn rome first must die a better city will rise from the ashes like the phoenix i shook my head this whole argument proceeds from a fallacy youre presuming you can subvert enough of caesars garrisons to storm the city i simply dont believe it a few soldiers are that unhappy perhapsbut the rest will remain loyal to caesar theyll band together and destroy you before you ever reach rome you underestimate the discontent throughout italy gordianus ive seen it antony did caesar no favors when he crisscrossed italy before leaving for greece he alienated one city after another with his arrogant blusteringtraveling like an eastern potentate with a retinue of sycophants lounging in his gilded litter with that whore of his cytheris the soldiers liked what they saw no better than the city fathers to caesar they might have remained loyal but not if he intends to leave the likes of antony in charge when hes absent milo spoke up and we neednt rely just on the garrisons there are plenty of other trained fighters to call on caelius raised his hand and gave him a withering look but milo blustered on im talking about the gladiator training camps down south the biggest strongest most vicious slaves in all of italy end up in those camps and theyre trained to kill without mercy when it comes to killing one gladiator is worth a century of common soldiers the slaves in those camps are desperatetheyre all headed for an early painful death and neither pompey nor caesar offers them any hope for the future after we set them free theyll be loyal to us alone for years milo had been attended by his own private army of gladiators he had left rome with them they had protected him in massilia and had helped to defend the city against caesars siege and now they had returned with milo to italy he had grown so used to the company of his gladiators that he didnt realize how shocking it was to suggest that such men be recruited to overthrow the senate and the magistrates of rome to be sure caesar himself had set the precedent of freeing gladiators whom he owned and turning them into soldiers but he had been careful to disperse them among different legions and to use them outside italy but milo was hinting at something very differentsetting free whole bands of gladiators and letting them lay siege to rome itself such men were the lowest of the lowdesperate mistreated slaves trained only to kill lacking any soldierly discipline without families or any vested interest in romes future or her institutions if soldiers could not be trusted to refrain from looting and burning what would happen if rome were overrun with gladiators do you see yourself as a second spartacus milo is that the legacy you intend to leave behind milo who made his reputation as watchdog for the best people then ended by setting bloodthirsty slaves loose on rome the fates have led you on a strange path milo milo speaks prematurely said caelius wincing well use gladiators only as a last resort a cure certain to kill the patient gladiators are trained to kill not to take orders youre playing pandora if you set them loose neither caelius nor milo answered they stared at me for a long moment then exchanged a glancemilo looking vindicated caelius disappointed i had reacted just as milo expected but caelius had hoped for a different reaction what do you want from me i asked caelius sighed merely for you to act in your own best interests gordianus youve poisoned your relationship with pompey i dont know exactly what happened between you but i do know he tried to strangle you with his bare hands when he was fleeing by ship from brundisium you barely escaped alive what will you do if pompey returns to rome in triumph and your relationship with caesar seems hardly better your adopted son meto is still close to caesarbut youve disowned meto and offended caesar in the process where will you stand if caesar wins and makes himself king of rome i was as loyal to caesar as any mani fled rome with curio to join him at the rubicon i fought beside him in spainand you see how he rewarded me with crumbs what reward can you expect from caesar but forget pompey forget caesar and the darkness that will fall over this city if either of them triumphs i should think gordianus that my recent speeches in the forum would have touched a nerve with you i happen to know a bit about your finances youre up to your ears in debt to that cannibal volumnius he never forgives a debt hes insatiable he shall suck the life from you as a man sucks marrow from a bone your family will be reduced to beggars perhaps even slaves pompey will do nothing to stop him neither will caesar its caesars fault that men like volumnius are having their day growing fat off of other mens misery only i can save you from volumnius gordianus only i can promise you justice cast your lot with me its your only choice why me caelius i have no power i have no money i have no family connections why do you care whether i join your cause or not ah but you have something far more important to us than any of those things gordianus caelius tapped his skull youre clever you see the world as it is you know the ways of men great men and small men youve moved among them all most importantly you care about truth and you long for justice the last honest man in rome as cicero once called you youre exactly the sort of man who will matter after everything has been turned upside down your day shall finally come theres no limit to the heights to which you might aspire you need us gordianus but we need you as well he spoke so earnestlylooking me in the eye pitching his voice just sothat i felt compelled to listen i recognized an orators trick he had learned from cicerofirst incite fear of pompey of caesar of volumnius then promise hope freedom from debt justice for all my own virtues finally recognized and rewarded he stared at me waiting for an answer i took a deep breath we cant possibly be safe meeting like this at any moment isauricus might send men to storm this building the two of you wouldnt stand a chance milo emitted a harsh barking noise that passed for a laugh ha do you suppose we havent taken precautions this building is thoroughly guarded you didnt notice the armed men outside and on the rooftop good that means theyre doing their job and staying out of sight but i need merely to snap my fingers and in the blink of an eye youd be twitching on the floor with your throat cut a gleam lit his eyes what about the tenants if i overheard you then others a friend of caeliuss owns this building hes gradually cleared out every tenant who cant be trusted and replaced them with diehard partisans every occupant of the building is a partisan of caeliuss i thought of cassandra trying to imagine how she fit into their scheme including the occupant standing in front of me i hope caelius smiled what do you say gordianus are you with us the way is hard but the rewards will be great beyond imagining what do you want from me nothing yet but the time will come when i shall call on your craftiness your cunning your honesty and wisdomand when i do i want to be able to rely on your loyalty without question youd trust me to simply give you my word no he went to the cupboard against the wall and returned with a piece of parchment i want you to sign this i held it at arms length for the letters were small and read on this date one day before the nones of sextilis in the year of rome dccvi i pledge my life and my fortune to the cause of marcus caelius rufus and titus annius milo i accept their authority and i will obey their orders i reject the legitimacy of the senate and the magistrates of rome elected under orders of gaius julius caesar likewise i reject the legitimacy of those senators and magistrates who fled from rome and fight under the banner of gnaeus pompey magnus all are impostors who by their actions have ceded any claim to constitute the legitimate government of rome under guidance of marcus caelius rufus and titus annius milo the roman state shall be reconstituted in accordance with the will of the roman people only the government established by them and no other shall have legitimacy to conduct the affairs of state by my name below signed beside those of marcus caelius rufus and titus annius milo and by the impression of the device on my citizens ring in the wax seal on this document i freely pledge myself to this cause and forsake all others i looked up you must be joking a contract to conspire against the state im not cicero but even i know this isnt legally binding not under the present regime perhaps said caelius the only possible use for such an incriminating document is black mail i said you call it black mail we call it insurance said milo dryly if you want to leave this room youll sign and if i refuse caelius sighed id hoped youd sign it readily even eagerly pompey wants you dead caesar has corrupted your son volumnius will make a beggar of you why should you not sign i stared at the parchment would they kill me if i refused to sign looking at milo who was glaring at me balefully i had no doubt of it to sign meant escaping with my life but what would happen when caelius and milo were destroyed and caesar or pompey returned to rome my name on such a pledge could mean the destruction not only of myself but of everyone close to me of course in the vagaries of war the parchment might be destroyed or lost and never seen again andwhat if for a brief moment i allowed myself to think the unthinkable what if caelius and milo ultimately won in such an unlikely circumstance by signing such a pledge i might stand to achieve a status i had never dreamed possible from standing always on the sidelines watching the great game at a distance the gordiani might find themselves at the very center of a new republic senator gordianus if that meant nothing to me then what about my family and their future why should diana not be elevated by a stroke of fortune to the rank of a fausta or a clodia or a fulvia why should ecos children not have the opportunity to shape the world to their liking rather than submit to the schemes of others how else are great fortunes and great families established except by a single act of wild daring a mad gamble caelius and milo promised wholesale revolution revolution inspired men without hope to think the unthinkable but what would it matter that volumnius were forced to forgive my debts if all rome my house included were burned down in a wholesale conflagration what would it matter that the senate was emptied and its seats promised to new men like myself if rampaging gladiators were set loose to do what they wanted with our daughters caelius promised a world reborn in justice but in the end he cared only about power his alliance with milo and his willingness to attack rome with gladiators proved that i crumpled the parchment in my fist and threw it across the room i told you snapped milo i told you hed never sign caelius sighed he clapped his hands i heard a noise behind me and turned to see two burly men step through the doorway they must have been waiting just outside the room they had the look of hired assassins a couple of my fellow future senators i said caelius stepped to the cupboard a few moments later he returned with a cup and held it out to me take it he said i looked in the cup wine cheap stuff sorry its not a better vintage but the likes of volumnius have sucked up all the good stuff drink gordianus swallow every drop i stared in the cup wine and what else drink it said milo behind me the two henchmen stepped so close i could hear them breathing one in each ear i heard the slither of daggers drawn from scabbards do what he says one of them whispered drink either that said the other or else i felt the prick of a dagger against my ribs then the prick of its twin from the other direction why poison me because a man of my years found dead without a mark on him would raise no suspicions prompt no questions they could leave my body in the street and anyone would think i had died of natural causes or would they carry me down the stairs and leave me in cassandras bed did she play some role in their schemeor was she too a victim what if they killed her as well and left our bodies to be discovered together with the poison beside us i imagined my familys shame and consternation the cup trembled in my hand cassandra i said shut up and drink yelled caelius in a flash as if hed dropped a mask his face changed completely one moment he was the charming unflappable orator and the next a vicious desperate fugitive easily capable of murder or of crimes much worse i had been afraid of milo it was caelius i should have feared more the daggers pressed harder against my flesh caelius and milo stepped closer you dont want to die by daggers growled milo think of it the metal slicing into your flesh pulling out cutting into you again the blood spurting out of you the cold seeping into your limbs the long agonizing wait to die drink you fool he gripped my wrist and forced me to raise the cup wine sloshed against my lips but i kept my mouth shut never mind the daggers grab his arms shouted milo taking the cup from me the men behind me twisted my arms behind my back caelius pinched my jaw and forced it open wine poured into my mouth and down my throat the taste was bitter i swallowed to keep from sucking it into my lungs all of it whispered milo every drop i coughed and sputtered wine trickled over my chin and cheeks but most of it went into my belly he poured until the cup was empty caelius and milo stepped back their henchmen released me i staggered forward feeling dizzy i dropped to my knees caelius and milo spun above me going in and out of focus each time i blinked the room became dark as if night fell their voices echoed strangely and seemed to come from a great distance we should have put hemlock in the wine instead of that other stuff said milo we should lop his head off here and now no said caelius i gave her my word i promised and you agreed a promise made to a witch call her that if you want since youre not worthy to utter her name i gave her my word and my word still means something milo does yours dont bait me caelius then dont speak of killing him it was your crazy idea to try to win him over for a moment i thought i had the fool no matter by the time he wakes caeliuss voice faded away the floor rushed up to my face the room turned black as if in a dream i saw cassandra standing on a distant horizon her lips formed words i could not hear she stretched out her arms beckoning to me even as she receded farther and farther beyond my grasp until she vanished altogether i opened my eyes my head pounded my body was stiff the least movement caused me to groan my mouth had a strange unpleasant taste my bladder was uncomfortably full my stomach growled i lay on the hard bare floor i stirred and managed to sit upright judging from the angle of the sunlight that entered the window no time at all had passed since i fell to the floor indeed the light seemed to indicate that time had regressed by an hour or two i blinked in befuddlement one of the chairs had been pushed against the wall the other lay on its side on the floor the cupboard doors stood open from where i sat i could see that its shelves had been emptied i stared at the pocket vase on the wall the rose drooped half its petals had fallen to the floor below i had been unconscious for almost twentyfour hours i managed to stand for a moment i thought i was all right then i felt lightheaded i staggered and clutched the cupboard to stay upright oily spots swam before my eyes the dizziness slowly passed i turned toward the doorway and gave a start i was not alone in the room a man was lying face down on the floor just inside the doorway before the curtain that was closed for privacy he was a large fellow with massive limbs and a neck like a tree trunk from the way he was lying with his neck unnaturally bent i was almost certain he was dead even so i approached him cautiously taking unsteady steps i reached down and lifted his head by a handful of hair i heard a sickening crack his neck was broken i looked at his face he wasnt one of the men who had held me while caelius and milo forced the drugged wine down my throat who was he who had killed him and left me alive i stepped over the body and pushed aside the curtain the hallway was empty i made my way to the head of the stairs and carefully descended taking unsteady steps i reached the bottom negotiated the hallway and came to the curtain that hung over cassandras doorway i whispered her name my voice was hoarse and feeble i spoke her name again louder there was no answer i pushed aside the curtain the room was completely bare not even the pallet remained i stood for a long time feeling nothing waiting for my head to clear suddenly i was desperately thirsty i moved to the doorway as i was stepping through my foot struck something concealed amid the folds of the curtain i stopped to pick it up it was cassandras leather biting stick had she left in great haste or had someone else cleared out the room cassandra had so few possessions it seemed hardly possible she could have forgotten such a personal object if she had over looked it somehow surely she would have missed it and come back for it where was cassandra i left the building and walked down the street shielding my eyes against the sunshine i felt that sense of unreality that comes from having slept a very long time and waking at an odd hour of the day i walked down the street of copper pots wincing at the clanging of metal against metal i found a public toilet and emptied my bladder i found a public fountain and splashed my face then drank until my thirst was quenched i was famished but that could wait i took the shortest route toward my house cutting across the forum amid the formal squares and ornate temples my sense of unreality only deepened i seemed to be walking in a dream gordianus i turned around and confronted onearmed canininus the rest of the chinwaggers stood in a group nearby one by one they looked up from some heated discussion to stare at me so you are alive said canininus even if you look halfdead mildmannered manlius stepped closer followed by the others gordianus your family is worried sick about you your soninlaw and that crazy massilian have been scouring the city for you they say you went off somewhere on your own yesterday and never showed up for dinner they were here not an hour ago along with those two little mischief makers asking if anyones seen you where have you been volcatius the old pompeian flashed a lecherous grin ill bet i can guess you know the old etruscan proverb when a mans gone missing its because of a miss am i right gordianus was she worth the trouble youll face when you get back home he tittered meanwhile youve missed the best gossip in ages said canininus milo and caelius were both spotted right here in the city together only this morning its a fact said manlius someone saw them heading from the subura toward the capena gate with an entourage of very roughlooking fellowssome of milos notorious gladiators most likely they were posing as master and slave caelius playing the master of course since hes the one with the brains said canininus as soon as they were outside the gate they mounted horses that were waiting for them and sped like lightning toward the south what do you make of that i shrugged another wild rumor i managed to say despite the water i had drunk my mouth was as dry as chalk never mind caelius and milo said volcatius gordianus never answered my question who was she gordianus some cheap whore in the subura or one of those great ladies you occasionally call upon in your line of work she must have put you through quite a marathon if youre just now staggering home i pushed past him and hurried on i tripped on an uneven paving stone and heard laughter behind me shes crippled him cried volcatius i want to meet this amazon you neednt be rude manlius called after me gordianus thinks hes too good for the likes of us said canininus he never comes around anymore when we do see him he goes stalking off in a huff like a his voice receded behind me i walked as fast as i could heading for the steep pathway at the far side of the forum that would take me home inside the folds of my tunic i clutched cassandras biting stick where in hades have you been the tonefrantic furious and relieved all at once implicitly warning me never to do such a thing againreminded me of bethesda how many times over the years had i heard that precise tone when i returned home from some scrape i had gotten myself into but it wasnt bethesda who rushed up to me in the foyer looking fit to be tied it was diana i told my daughter the truthor part of it that i had met unexpectedly for me if not for them with milo and caelius in the subura on the previous day that they had put forward a proposition that i refused that they had forced me to swallow a soporific of some sort that i had only just awakened and had made my way straight home what were you doing in the subura in the first place asked diana frowning how is it that milo and caelius were able to find you did they have you followed or did they just happen to come upon you what sort of drug did they give you diana had inherited my own inquisitive nature but she had yet to master the rules of a successful interrogation ask too many questions at once and you invite the overwhelmed subject to shrug helplessly and give no answer that was exactly what i did everyone in the household is out looking for you she said davus is down at the fish market hieronymus is at the senian baths i sent mopsus and androcles over to ecos house to find out if hed turned up anything weve all been mad with worry what about your mother this must have been especially hard on her diana sighed i managed to keep it from her she didnt come out of her room even once yesterday so she didnt see the rest of us all flustered and in a panic when you didnt show up for dinner but she did ask for you later and i had to make up something on the spota lie about you spending the night away from the city because an old client needed to tap your memory about a trial from years ago i dont think i could have fooled her if she wasnt so unwell as it was she just nodded and turned her face away and pulled the coverlet around her neck how can she be cold when the weathers so hot but at least she didnt realize you were missing so she didnt have that worry to add to her illness how is she today better i suppose because shes determined to go out a little while ago she sent for one of the slave girls to come help her dress she says she wants to go to the market she says shes thought of something that might make her betterradishes she says she must have radishes a few moments later davus arrived home he was so glad to see me he let out a roar and lifted me high in the air squeezing the breath out of me diana shushed him and told him to put me down at once because bethesda was coming and mustnt see him making such a fuss davus obediently put me down but couldnt stop grinning at me bethesda stepped into the room dressed in a freshly laundered stola with her hair combed and pinned she looked slightly pale but better than i had seen her in quite some time she gave davus a sidelong look but said nothing and shook her head ruefully no doubt wondering once again how her daughter had come to marry such a grinning simpleton radishes she announced her voice was hoarse but surprisingly strong and so we made our wayslowly to accommodate bethesdadown to the market in search of the latest commodity bethesda imagined might provide a cure for her malaise we walked from vendor to vendor searching in vain for a radish that would satisfy bethesdas discriminating gaze i suggested that bethesda might look for carrots instead she insisted that the soup she had in mind would allow no substitutions at last bethesda cried eureka sure enough she held in her hands a truly admirable bunch of radishesfirm and red with crisp green leaves and long trailing roots the price the vendor named was exorbitant perhaps i could manage with just two radishes said bethesda or perhaps only one yes one would do im sure i imagine we can afford one cant we husband i looked into her brown eyes and felt a pang of guilt thinking of bethesdas suffering thinking of cassandra i shall buy you more than one radish wife i shall buy you the whole bunch of them davus youre carrying the money bag hand it to diana so that she can pay the man papa are you sure said diana its so much of course im sure pay the scoundrel the vendor was ecstatic bethesda clutching the radishes to her breast gave me a look to melt my heart then a shadow crossed her face and i knew that she suddenly felt unwell i touched her arm shall we go home now wife just then there was a commotion from another part of the market a man yelled a woman shrieked its her the madwoman i turned about to see cassandra staggering toward me her blue tunica was torn at the neck and pulled awry her golden hair wild and unkempt there was a crazed expression on her face and in her eyes a look of utter panic she ran to me reaching forward her gait uneven gordianus help me she fell into my arms and dropped to her knees pulling me down with her cassandra i gasped i lowered my voice to a whisper if this is some pretense she clutched my arms and cried out her body convulsed diana knelt beside me papa whats wrong with her i dont know its the god in her said bethesda the same god that compels her prophecies must be tearing her apart inside a crowd gathered draw back all of you i shouted cassandra clutched at me again but her grip was weakening her eyelids flickered and drooped cassandra whats wrong whats happened i whispered poison she said shes poisoned me who what did she give you our faces were so close that i felt her shallow breath on my lips her eyes seemed huge her blue irises eclipsed by the enormous blackness of her pupils somethingin the drink cassandra said a moment later she was dead xvi davus and i left clodia on the banks of the tiber gazing at the sunlight on the water alone with her memories we retraced our steps past the riverside gardens of the rich and back into the city davus was refreshed from his swim but the heat of the day oppressed me i was weary in mind and body by the time we made our way up the slope of the palatine to my house i wanted nothing more than a few quiet hours of rest in a shady corner of my garden i had spoken to them all nowall the women whod come to see cassandra end in flamesexcept one would caesars wife deign to see me the more i thought about it the less likely it seemed calpurnia would be surrounded by an army of advisors and attendants and bodyguards to protect her both from those who sought her husbands favors and those who sought his destruction there was the complication that she might consider me an enemy since i had turned my back on caesar along with meto in massilia from what i knew of calpurnia she was not the sort to act on a sudden whim or a sentimental impulse or out of prurient interest she was sensible discreet and utterly respectableprecisely the qualities that had convinced caesar to marry her everyone knew his famous quip about his previous wife whom he had summarily divorced after she became the subject of gossip caesars wife must be above suspicion calpurnia was said to be so devoid of even petty vices that no scandal could ever be attached to her not the sort of woman i thought to admit the likes of myself into her presence even for a formal audience people might talk and yet she had come to see cassandra burn i sat on my folding chair in the shade and leaned back against a pillar i narrowed my eyes and watched a hummingbird flit from flower to flower i shut my eyes and listened to the buzzing of his wings as he circled the garden and flew over my head i must have dozed for the next thing i knew androcles had hold of my arm and was shaking me awake master theres a man at the door asking for you and a great litter out in the street and bodyguards lots and lots of bodyguards and what what are you talking about a visitor for you master i blinked cleared my throat and brushed my fingers through my hair very well send him in no he says that you must come to the door i felt a sudden chill a great litter an army of bodyguards a highhanded summons to come to my own front doorwho could it be only one person would be so presumptuous i thought the man who would own this house himself soon enough once all my debts came due and i was found to be penniless why had volumnius come to harass me now on this particular day wheres davus i asked with diana in their room said androcles napping i dont think so the doors shut but im pretty sure theyre not asleep how can you tell all that noise they make im surprised you cant hear them out here he grunts and squeals like a boar with a spear in his side and then she enough mopsus never mind fetching davus surely even volumnius wont dare to have a roman citizen beaten on his own doorstep i declared but as i rose unbending my stiff knees i had my doubts i made my way across the garden and through the atrium with androcles scurrying after me the man in the foyer didnt have the look of a debt collector he was too old and too small he had the selfassured sophisticated air one associates with slaves who act as personal secretaries to citizens of wealth and taste with relief i knew that it was not volumnius who had come calling on me who then something in the slaves manner suggested that he waited upon a mistress not a master a woman in a sumptuous litter attended by many bodyguards in my experience the gods in their whimsy so fashion the world that sometimes the thing that seems most unlikely is precisely the thing that occurs i knew at once and with absolute certainty whom the slave represented will your mistress do me the honor of stepping inside i said the slave raised an eyebrow alas much as it would please her to grace your household with her presence her schedule today will not permit it but she very much wants to speak to you if youll follow me theres a litter waiting we think it best if you come alone of course androcles when davus and diana reappear let them know that ive left in the company of caesars wife and i shall be returning i looked at the slave you should be gone for no more than an hour or so he assured me thats all the mistress can spare may i he extended his open hands almost touching me and i realized he intended to search my person i nodded and allowed him to run his hands over my tunic satisfied that i carried no weapons he stepped back and allowed me to walk out the door ahead of him two identical litters were waiting in the street each fitted with a resplendent canopy made of ivory poles and white draperies that shimmered with golden threads hemmed with a purple stripe the drapes of the first litter were closed concealing its occupant i was ushered into the litter behind it the slave joined me closed the drapes and settled back into the pile of cushions opposite me with a steady gracefulness that did credit to the bearers the litter rose and began to move forward where are we going i said the slave smiled well be there very shortly i felt the motion of the litter each time we took a sharp turn but we never seemed to go downhill that meant we were still somewhere on the palatine hill when the litter came to a stop i heard the sound of a heavy bar being lifted on a hinge and gates swinging open we moved forward into a graveled courtyard i could hear the stones crunching under the bearers feet the litter stopped the gates swung shut and the bar dropped back into place the slave parted the drapes with his forefinger and peered out awaiting a signal at last he pushed back the drape and gestured for me to exit the litter as soon as my feet touched the gravel i was flanked by two bodyguards who escorted me across the narrow courtyard up a short flight of steps and into a small but elegantly appointed foyer the white walls were trimmed with blue and gold a small bronze statue of venus occupied a scalloped niche the floor was decorated with a mosaic of venus emerging naked from the sea i was reminded that caesar claimed venus as his ancestress it was venus his soldiers called upon for victory the guards escorted me through an atrium where goldfish darted across the sunken pool ahead i caught a glimpse of sunlit greenery a garden surrounded by a portico but the guards led me to one side down a short hallway and into a small library the far wall was lined with a tall book case its pigeonholes filled with scrolls paintings depicting a battle covered the walls on either side arrayed across the wall to the right was the army of the ancient greeks led by alexander the great instantly recognizable by his chiseled features and his golden mane of hair on the opposite wall was the army of the persian king darius whom alexander had defeated to become master of the world seated before the book case dominating the room despite the massive dramatic pictures was calpurnia she was handsome enough though not a great beauty she seemed oblivious of the latest fashions with their eastern and egyptian influences from her clothing jewelry and hairstyle she might have been an austere roman matron of a century ago her countenance was as severe as her costume she looked like a mistress about to rebuke a wayward slave and i reflexively braced myself but before she spoke she smiled just enough to put me at easeor to put me off my guardand i saw that she possessed a certain charm not unlike her husbands had she possessed it before caesar met her or had she learned it from him sit she said i turned my head to see that a chair had been placed behind me the guards had discreetly withdrawn to a post just outside the door she waited until i was seated then paused for several heartbeats before she spoke again that too was a technique of caesars never to seem rushed weve never met gordianus but i know of your reputation and of my husbands high regard for you youve had a long and interesting career in this city i had thought that you were retired but i understand that for the last few days youve been rather busy crisscrossing rome with that burly soninlaw of yours youve had someone following us the brusqueness of the question left her unfazed let us say that you have been observed one by one youve been visiting each of the women who came to cassandras funeral i was there too you must have seen my litter yet you havent yet called on me i intended to do so why didnt you come to me first i cleared my throat out of deference i suppose great caesars wife must be a very busy woman with little time to answer the queries of a humble citizen like myself or so i thought may i ask where we are in a house tucked away on a little culdesac on the palatine hill you neednt know the exact location my husband has owned this place for years but only a very select few have ever stepped inside it even some of his closest advisors are unaware of its existence it seemed an appropriate place for you and i to meet since this was where cassandra resided i frowned here but i thought that shabby room in the subura her residence there was a pretense part of the role she played this was the house where she kept her possessions it was to this house that she retreated whenever she felt she might be in danger or whenever she grew too sick of her role as a pauper and needed a taste of luxury i imagine she would have liked to bring you to this house gordianus but that wasnt possible her room was just across the garden it was in this room that i came to meet with her i would sit here and she would sit where youre sitting in that very chair you met with cassandra on a regular basis so that i could give her instructions and so that she could deliver any valuable information she had uncovered since our last meeting i took this in cassandra was your spy my husbands spy to be more precise it was caesar who recruited her caesar who briefed her on what he expected from her and caesar who trained heras a spy i mean cassandra was already an accomplished actress of course but the arts of the spy are somewhat more specialized she peered at me intently are you grinding your teeth finder always caesar i said staring up at the image of alexander then across to the image of darius which would caesar resemble more when the story of his life came to an end the conqueror beloved by gods and storytellers or the arrogant emperor who owned the world but lost it on his journey to his destiny caesar had swept the whole world along in his wake he loomed over everything casting his shadow not just over armies and kings but over every thing and every person i loved now i found his shadow had covered cassandra as well calpurnia looked at me coolly i understand that you harbor some sort of grudge against my husband for having claimed the loyalty and affection of your son meto is no longer my son she nodded even so caesar harbors no resentment against you gordianus in time he hopes that he may once again be able to count you among his friends that was always caesars way to mend breaches to convert enemies to draw everyone into his circle even if later the need arose to destroy them but we were talking of cassandra she said i know that her death has caused you great distress i think caesar would want me to reveal to you who cassandra was and how and why she came to rome what do you already know about her that she was beautiful and tragic and doomed i thought that i fell in love with her or thought i did knowing nothing about her that she came from alexandria i said that she performed in the mime shows there and knew cytheris that she suffered from seizures and falling sicknessunless that was a pretense that she may or may not have possessed the gift of prophecy that she used her reputation as a seeress to play a cruel joke on antonia at cytheriss behest that she may have done the same thing to a number of other powerful women in rome who sought her outunless she was black mailing them or spying on them calpurnia nodded if i tell you that my husband has a number of agents who gather intelligence for him i presume that will come as no surprise to you agents of all sorts high and lowfrom street urchins and tavern keepers to centurions and senators you never know who might overhear something of importance it takes skill patience and experience to make sense of all the information that comes in to scrutinize the sources to disregard lies planted by the enemy to decide between conflicting accounts all those bits of information are like tiles in a mosaic separately they signify nothing but together from the right perspective they form a sort of picture its an intricate business all the more complicated because it takes place in the shadows thats what my husband calls itthe shadow war between himself and his enemies the battles that everyone knows about take place in broad daylight between soldiers who fight with swords and spears there are other battles that take place in the shadows which no one sees or even knows aboutbut people die in those battles nonetheless i suppose one could think of cassandra as a kind of amazon a woman warrior its the only way a woman can be a warrior i suppose fighting in the shadow war why did she fight for caesar why does any soldier fight for him because he paid her of course as part of the arrangement she became a free woman and she was very handsomely paid in regular installments that i held in trust for her the work cassandra did was dangerous but she was well rewarded she would have returned to alexandria a wealthy woman had she survived how did caesar recruit her as soon as pompey was driven from italy caesar set about reorganizing the senate here in rome and deciding whom to place in charge in his absencemarc antony as it turned out everyone became a caesarian overnight once pompey was gonebut whom could caesar really trust and what sort of plots were being hatched against him it was imperative that he should organize a network of agents to gather information some of those agents were already in place others had to be recruited it was i who pointed out to him that his greatest weakness would be in obtaining information from the women of romethe wives and mothers and daughters and sisters who had been left behind by both allies and enemies such women always know more than theyre given credit for often more than they themselves realize they know the most secret longings and most fervent loyalties of their men a casual remark in a letter from a husband could lead to a secret hiding place or a cache of arms or a buried store of gold but what sort of person could obtain access to so many diverse women and extract whatever valuable information they might possess it was caesar who hit upon the idea of recruiting an actress to play the part of a mad seeress i told him that no roman matron was that gullible and no actress that skillful he proved me wrong on both counts he dispatched an agent to alexandria to find the right actress why alexandria because the mime masters there are famous for training their players to perfection and because its far enough from rome that the agent might find a suitable performer who would be unknown here it was several months before the agent returned from alexandria bringing cassandra with him they entered the city in a covered litter and the agent installed her secretly in this house only a few days later caesar returned to rome after securing spain and massilia as soon as he was able to take time from overseeing elections he met with cassandra it was in this very room i was with him he said he wanted my opinion of her but im sure he made up his mind before i could say a word she auditioned for caesar like an actress auditioning for a mime show if you wish to put it that way she was certainly beautiful i could see that caesar was duly impressed but beauty was not the quality we were looking for she spoke excellent latin with only the faintest accent she was quite a polyglot you know but she seemed rather nervous that was understandable perhaps for a young woman meeting caesar for the first time but it worried me this was the person we were counting on to keep a cool head even as she deceived some of the shrewdest women in rome caesar commenced to explain what he wanted from her she seemed distracted and increasingly agitated suddenly she collapsed to the floor writhing and foaming at the mouth the agent had warned us that she suffered from the falling sickness caesar at once went to her assistance he found a leather biting stick on her person and put it between her teeth then held her until the spell subsided i could see that he was moved by her sufferingcaesar himself has experienced such fits in the pastbut i wondered if such a condition might rob her of her wits and cause her to fail in her mission i was about to say as much when cassandra suddenly sprang to her feet laughing out loud she had been acting you see it was all a performancethe nervousness the fidgeting the fit i was furious at first caesar was delighted she won him over on the spot if she could fool both of us then surely she could fool anyone i dont understand did she truly suffer from the falling sickness or not oh yes she was subject to fits she suffered more than one staying in this house but she had also learned to mimic those fits so convincingly that no one could tell the difference that skill among her othersnot least her intelligence for i dont think ive ever met a woman more intelligent than cassandramade her ideal for the role caesar had in mind before he left for greece caesar briefed her very closely taking more time with her than with any of his other agents she learned the name and family history of every important woman in rome more than that she learned everything we could glean about those womens personal habits their eccentricities and superstitions their dreams and fears she took copious notes on wax tablets but kept them only long enough to memorize every detail then she would rub the tablets clean she kept everything in her head when caesar was satisfied she left this house and made her first appearances in the city it wasnt long before people were talking about the madwoman in the forum i remember being at a dinner party and trying not to smile the first time i heard her mentioned overnight everyone seemed to know about the mysterious woman who could see the future even though no one had any idea who she was or where she came from it was said that if she stared into a flame she could induce such visions at will her method was simple she would wait until a woman invited her home or in some cases practically kidnapped her inducements would be offeredmoney food shelter soon the lamp would be produced cassandra would oblige by staring at the flame suffering a fit and going into a trance then uttering cryptic but transparent prophecies based on what she knew about her hostess cassandra would tell each woman what that woman wanted to hear theres no surer way to gain a persons confidence with cassandra they let down their guard they became naked before hervulnerable frightened ambitious boastful they said things they would never have said to anyone else many more women consulted her than the handful who came to see her burn half the senators wives in rome have had cassandra in their houses i thought of the women i had spoken to terentia tullia and the vestal fabia had all accepted cassandras prophetic powers without question what bits of information about cicero and dolabella not to mention the inner workings of the vestal virgins had they inadvertently let slip while cassandra was in their presence what about fulvia i said cassandra gave fulvia specific details about curios deaththe battle in the desert the fact that he was beheaded this was before anyone in rome even knew that curio was dead anyone but caesar what do you mean when the messenger from africa arrived in rome he went directly to caesar and to no one else caesar was distraught of course curio was like a son to him caesar had had such great hopes for curio that was why he gave him the african command but as caesar says information is like gold one must spend it wisely secretly he met with cassandra in this room and told her the details the next morning from informants in fulvias household we learned that fulvia intended to call on friends that day and we determined the route she would take cassandra waited along that route when fulvia passed by in her litter cassandra pitched her voice to sound like a whisper just loud enough to reach fulvias ears she said i remembered the words that fulvia had quoted to me and spoke them back to calpurnia hes dead now he died fighting it was a brave death calpurnia nodded exactly those were the very words caesar told her to say fulvia stopped of course she took cassandra home with her and when cassandra revealed the specific details of curios end which were later confirmed it seemed like a true vision from the gods thus cassandra won fulvias unquestioning trust along with that of her mother sempronia and meanwhile caesar kept the news of curios death to himself he swore the messenger to secrecy and told no one not even marc antonynot even mefor two days information is gold by spending that particular nugget of information with the utmost discipline caesar bought fulvias faith in cassandra but curio died fighting for caesar why send a spy into his widows house why not we wanted to know the temper of that household and anything those two women might be secretly planning dont let her grieving fool you gordianus fulvia is still madly ambitious so is sempronia many a time ive told caesar we have to watch those two especially the daughter no matter that shes married to curio no matter that marc antonys married to his cousinmark my words fulvia has her eye on our antony and if those two should ever join forces beware i shook my head but for now antony remains married to antonia she saw through cassandras pretense yes with antonia cassandra made a grave miscalculation she acted on her own initiative outside her mission for caesar not entirely her own initiative it was cytheris who put her up to making a distressing prophecy to antonia i know cassandra confessed as much to me when i pressed her she said that cytheris had known her in alexandria and threatened to expose her if she didnt do a favor for her cassandra argued that her prophecy to antonia was only a small matter i disagreed and i chastised her quite severely for destroying any chance to build a bond of trust with antonia that was stupid of cassandra and certainly not a part of caesars plan it was also my first indication that cassandra seemed to be slipping out of my control only the first indication her affair with you was another that should never have happened she knew from the beginning that she was not to form any such bond with any man while she was in caesars employ her time with me was not a part of caesars plan calpurnia looked at me shrewdly youre worried that it might have been otherwise that perhaps cassandra sought you out and seduced you merely to gain your confidence no not in her role as caesars agent she was acting on her own initiative when she formed whatever bond grew between you how is it that you know about it then she smiled purely by surmise why else would you have shown such an interest in cassandra after her death unless you were her lover i made no reply she shrugged who can explain the mysteries of venus cassandra managed to keep your affair a secret even from me thats why she could never bring you here where the two of you would have been much more comfortable than in that hovel in the subura you were her little secret just as she was yours calpurnia looked at me thoughtfully to be sure even before cassandra met you she knew who you were from the very thorough briefings caesar gave her and of course she was acquainted with your sonwith meto i mean meto was present at some of those briefings that young man has a flair for this sort of thingplayacting secret codes hatching plots under the rose cassandra knew meto she never told me how could she without giving away the fact that she was caesars agent to have told you would have exposed you to the same dangers she faced you might have shared her fate her fate i tasted the word like wormwood on my tongue do you know who killed her i asked half suspecting now that it must have been calpurnia herself she read the look on my face i had nothing to do with her death i dont know who killed her or why it might have been any of those women who came to see her burn it might have been someone else but yes she rose from her chair strode to the painting of alexander and peered at it intently though she must have seen it many times before when he was briefing cassandra about various women in rome caesar himself suggested specific prophecies or visions that she might use in order to gain a particular womans confidence or frighten her or otherwise get her to speak what was on her mind he did so in the case of fulvia as ive told you but caesar couldnt foresee every eventuality after he left rome when a woman sought out cassandra for her gift in most cases cassandra had to improvise using her own skills and whatever she already knew about that woman but circumstances change cassandra needed to be kept abreast of developments that job fell to me whenever i met with her in this house one such development was this business with marcus caelius and milo even caesar didnt foresee that caelius would turn against him or that milo would dare to return to italyand no one imagined that the two of them might join forces trebonius and isauricuswhat a pair of bunglers they should have put a stop to caelius the moment he set up his chair of state in the forum and began to agitate the mob now the situation is out of control she looked at me sharply did you know that caelius and milo were both in the city as recently as the day cassandra died i answered carefully i heard a rumor in the forum that the two of them were seen riding out together that morning heading south that rumor was true that day was our last chance to stop caelius and milo from trying to raise a revolution in the south i had hoped to do so using cassandra how could cassandra have stopped them by using her gift of course why would either of them have listened to cassandra caelius might not have taken her seriously but according to my sources milo might very well have heeded her im told that hes grown increasingly superstitious in recent years he looks for omens and portents everywhere if milo could have been convinced by cassandra to abandon this mad enterprise caelius might well have abandoned it as well but even if caelius and milo were secretly in the city for a while how could cassandra possibly have gained access to either of them the building in the subura where she stayed was one of caeliuss strongholds in the city thats why i placed her there thinking it might eventually lead to some way for her to spy on caelius certainly it made her accessible to him should he ever wish to call on her and cassandra might also have reached either milo or caelius through the two women closest to themfausta and clodia i shook my head fausta may still be milos wife but she despises him she wishes him dead she told me so would milo even bother to contact fausta while he was in the city as for clodia surely theres no one she hates more than caeliusunless its milo clodia and caelius may once have been lovers but i cant imagine that shes even spoken to him since the prosecution she mounted against him you might think these things gordianus but you would be wrong according to my sources milo almost certainly contacted fausta while he was in rome as for clodia shes been receiving caelius at her house on the palatine and at her horti on the tiber for months ever since he returned from spain with caesar i dont believe it do believe it gordianus my sources for that fact are quite reliable are you suggesting that clodia and caelius renewed their love affair after all these years despite the bitterness between them impossible is it it seems to me exactly what one might expect from a woman as weak as clodia who allows herself to be dominated by whims and emotions we romans believe that a man must be the master of his appetites or hes no man at all but we forgive such a defect in a woman it wasnt so in the days of our ancestors a woman like clodia enslaved by her neediness would have been despised by everyone nowadays people call such a creature fascinating and men as weak as she is make poems about her she made an expression of disgust it occurred to me that no one would ever make a poem about calpurnia as for caelius she said perhaps he never stopped loving clodia despite their falling out and her attempt to destroy him or perhaps always the pragmatist he simply saw some use for her in this scheme of his to win over the rabble and seize power who knows what drives such a man the fellows like quick silver i shook my head trying to make sense of this if cassandra at your bidding was supposed to dissuade caelius and milo from staging an armed insurrection then she obviously failed i said im not sure what happened the last time i spoke to cassandra which was several days before her death she told me that she had made the acquaintance of both clodia and fausta fausta had told her that milo was aware of her existenceit wasnt clear whether he was in rome at the time or notand that he wanted to seek her out for a prophecy as i said cassandra was living in a building that i knew to be one of caeliuss strongholds in the city i told her to stay there where caelius and milo could find her if they wished if that should happen she was to stall the two of them as best she could put them off keep them in the city and send rupa to me at once i told her if you must give them a prophecy then tell them that their plans for a revolution are doomed and their only hope is to give themselves up and throw themselves upon the bountiful mercy of caesar that was the last time i saw cassandra several days later i learned that caelius and milo had come and gone and cassandra was dead so far as i can reconstruct the sequence of events she died only a few hours after they rode out of rome together and rupa he was here with cassandra when i last spoke to her after that i never saw him again i dont know whether hes alive or dead but you believe there was some connection between caelius and milo and cassandras death it seems very likely exactly what that connection may have been i dont know right now all my efforts are bent toward containing this insurrection milo and caelius are trying to raise in the south and making sure that the next time they arrive in rome its with their heads on sticks cassandras dead shes of no further use to me i dont have time to be concerned with who killed her or why i leave that to you i understand you have a nose for that sort of thing if you do manage to sniff out the truth come tell me if she died in caesars service then whoever killed her shall answer to caesars justice xvii that night bethesda was delirious with fever she shivered beneath her woolen coverlet and murmured incoherently diana prepared a concoction of brewed willow bark and a mild soporific that seemed to help the fever lessened and bethesda fell into a fitful sleep i stayed by her side holding her hand mopping her brow and hardly slept at all fever had not been a symptom of her malady before i feared that it marked a new stage in her illness i felt stupid and helpless diana fell ill that day as well i came upon her bent over in the garden throwing up her break fast afterwards she insisted that she felt perfectly well but with a chill i wondered if her sickness was somehow connected to her mothers what if both were to fall victim to the same lingering illness i had no more money for physicians physicians had proved to be useless anyway what would become of the household if both bethesda and diana were bedridden what would happen when the banker volumnius began pressing me for repayment of my loans the first installment would fall due in a matter of days i fell into a black mood and did not stir from the house days passed after that first miserable night bethesdas fever lessened and receded diana seemed well but there was something furtive in her manner i sensed she was hiding something from me i might have kept pursuing my quest for the truth about cassandra but a kind of stasis of the will settled over me rome itself seemed gripped by a trancelike paralysis awaiting news from greece about caesar and pompey awaiting news from the south about caelius and milos insurrection a sense of impending catastrophe loomed over the city over my house over my spirit it clouded every moment poisoned every breath another thing stopped me from taking any further steps to find cassandras killer by telling me what she knew by charging me with the task of finding the truth and by promising caesars justice calpurnia had effectively enlisted me to become yet another of her informants in the city i had deliberately severed every tie to caesar even disowning meto yet if i wished to see the search for cassandras killer through to the end how could i do so without becoming a spy for caesar it was hieronymus who brought me the news one morning while i brooded in the garden he came striding in eyes flashing slightly out of breath i knew at once that something terrible had happenedterrible for someone if not for hieronymus mayhem and the suffering of others excited him its all over he announced whats over theyre dead both dead and all their followers with them for a brief moment i thought he meant caesar and pompey and i tried to imagine the immensity of the debacle that could wipe them both from the face of the earth along with their armies had jupiter himself sent down lightning bolts had neptune flooded the mountains and hades opened chasms beneath them i felt a cold spot in my heart in the place where my love of meto had once resided then i knew what he meant where i said how one hears conflicting details but according to the best sources down in the forum davus rushed in milo and caelius are dead he cried both of them dead a huge crowd is gathering in the forum some are celebrating some are weeping and tearing their hair they say its all over the insurrection is over before it even began hieronymus gave davus a sour look as i was saying it seems to have happened like this milo and caelius headed south from rome but they split up to carry out separate actions milo started by going from town to town claiming he was acting on orders from pompey making wild promises and trying to get the town leaders to join him but that got him nowhere so he used his gladiators to set free a great number of field slaves the type made to work under a whip and kept in pens along with animals or in barracks no better than cagesthe most desperate of the desperate milos ragtag army went on a rampage plundering temples and shrines and farmhouses all around raising a war chest milo called it he must have gathered a great number of slaveshundreds maybe thousandsbecause he dared to lay siege to a town called compsa garrisoned by a whole legion but it all went wrong when milo was struck down by a stone hurled from the ramparts the rock hit him square in the forehead shattered his skull and killed him instantly with no one to lead them the slaves panicked and fled and caelius caelius started by trying to raise a revolt among the gladiators in neapolis but the city magistrates got wind of the plot and put the ringleaders among the gladiators in chains before they could rally the rest the magistrates tried to arrest caelius as well but he managed to slip through their trap word that he was an outlaw traveled ahead of him no city would open its gates to him he headed toward compsa to join up with milo and learned of milos death from slaves who were fleeing the battle caelius tried to rally the slaves but they wouldnt listen and ran off in all directions how did onearmed canininus put it all those years bending to the lash and buggering sheep rendered them immune to caeliuss rhetoric caelius headed farther south practically alonethey say he had only a handful of supporters still with him no more than five or six men he pressed on until he came to the coast apparently theres a town called thurii situated in the instep of italy that was where caelius made his last stand poor caelius i thought vain ambitious restless quick silver caelius with milo dead every city closed to him and no armynot even an army of field slaveshe must have known there was no hope that he was doomed thurii was the end of the line the end of the world the final terminus in the comet like career of the young orator who had been ciceros scintillating protege milos staunch defender caesars brash lieutenant clodias faithless lover and the last desperate hope of the disgruntled dispossessed masses of rome what happened to him i asked well as i heard it hieronymus lowered his voice his eyes glittered with excitement at being able to deliver the details to a virgin ear but davus too agitated to hold his tongue interrupted him they cut him down said davus when caelius arrived at thurii he strode right through the open gates of the cityword hadnt yet reached them to be on their guard against him he walked through the market into the forum and up the steps to the porch of the town senate building he clapped his hands and called to a group of soldiers to go and fetch their companions because he wanted to address them a crowd gathered caelius started speaking they say his voice was too big for the little forum at thurii people could hear him all over the city and even outside the walls and in fishing boats out on the water more townspeople and soldiers gathered until the little forum was packed apparently most of the soldiers stationed at thurii are spaniards and gauls from caesars cavalry caelius tried to get them excited by reminding them of all the slaughter and destruction caesar had brought to their native lands but the soldiers would have none of it they refused to hear a word against caesar they started booing and hissing and stamping their feet but caelius only raised his voice he told them that caesar had betrayed the people of rome and it was only a matter of time before he would betray them as well the soldiers pelted caelius with stones but he kept talking even with blood running down his face finally they rushed up the steps they tore caelius limb from limb he screamed at the soldiers calling them fools and lackeys he never stopped talking until they threw him to the ground and crushed his windpipe by stamping on his throat milos skull had been crushed caelius had been torn apart what had become of their heads which calpurnia had so fervently desired to have brought to her only their heads could provide her with incontrovertible proof that the menace was over only then could she write to caesar with the good news without fear that her informants might be wrong would she gloat over those heads just a little indulging her emotions in a manner unbecoming to a roman matron were crucified i heard davus say jarring me back to the moment what the gladiators at neapolis and the field slaves who fought with milo they were crucified the gladiators were already in custody as for the field slaves the soldiers from the garrison at compsa hunted them down some died fighting but most of them were rounded up and crucified alongside the roadways they say so many slaves havent been crucified at one time since the days of spartacus when crassus put down the great slave revolt and lined the whole length of the appian way with crucified slaves a silence fell over the garden hieronymus sensing an opening flashed a sardonic expression and began to say something but i held up my hand ive heard enough i said i want to be alone for a while davus go to diana shes with her mother i think hieronymus i heard a commotion in the kitchen a moment ago androcles and mopsus are probably behind it would you go and have a look they departed the garden in separate directions and left me alone with my thoughts i was surprised at how powerfully the news affected me milo had been a hotheaded brute and no friend of mine caelius had been either a mad visionary or a crass opportunist did it matter which in the end together they had tried to bully me into joining their cause when i refused they had allowed me to escape with my lifebut only so far as i could make out because cassandra somehow compelled them to do so what had been her connection to the two of them now that milo and caelius were both dead in retrospect it seemed more impossible than ever that their mad scheme could have possibly succeeded cassandra had been murdered why by whom an idea came to me how could it not have occurred to me already it was so obvious yet i had somehow tricked myself into over looking it the instant of revelation was so acute as to be palpable almost painful as if a spring inside my head suddenly uncoiled i must have actually cried out for davus reappeared in the garden quickly followed by hieronymus and the boys fatherinlaw said davus youre weeping i had no idea he would take the news so hard whispered hieronymus androcles and mopsus looked at me aghast they had never seen me so shaken even at cassandras funeral fetch my toga i told them i must pay a formal visit where are you going fatherinlaw ill put on my toga too no davus i shall go alone surely not on such a day insisted davus you dont know what its like down in the forum the young man is right said hieronymus the streets arent safe if caeliuss supporters riot and isauricus calls on his own ruffians to keep order i shall go alone i insisted i wont be going far she would not be at her horti not on a day such as this with so much uncertainty and the potential for violence in the city she would be safely locked up in her house on the palatine only a short walk from my own i kept to the smaller streets and saw hardly anyone afoot every now and then i heard echoes from the forumshouts of jubilation as far as i could tell isauricus must have called up every partisan he could muster to make a show of celebrating the news from the south her house was situated at the end of a quiet lane in recent years the trend among the wealthy and powerful had been to erect massive ostentatious houses that brazenly proclaimed their owners status but hers was a very old house and had been in her family for generations it followed the oldfashioned custom of houses of the great patrician families by presenting an unassuming face to the street the front was windowless and stained with a muted yellow wash the doorstep was paved with glazed red and black tiles the wash needed redoing i noticed and some of the tiles were cracked or missing framing the rustic oak door were two towering cypress trees they too had an unkempt look they were shot through with pockets of dead brown foliage and masses of spider webs those trees were visible from the balcony at the back of my house i never noticed them without thinking of clodia i expected a handsome young man or a beautiful girl to answer the doorclodia had always surrounded herself with beautiful thingsbut it was an old retainer who greeted me he disappeared for a few moments to announce me then returned and escorted me deeper into the house once it had been among the most sumptuously appointed homes in rome but now i saw pedestals without statues places on the walls where paintings should have been cold floors that lacked rugs like so many others in rome whose place in the world had once seemed unshakable clodia had fallen on hard times she was in her garden reclining on a couch beside a little fishpond dropping bits of meal into the water and watching the fish dart about their scales flashing in the watery sunlight this was the garden where years ago i had attended one of her infamous parties catullus had declaimed a poem of passion and grief while couples made love in the shadows now it was silent and empty except for clodia and her fish she looked up from the pond the sunlight reflected from the surface of the water had a flattering effect i caught a glimpse of clodia as she had appeared when i had first met her years ago when her beauty had been at the very end of its bloom another visit so soon she said for years you forget me then you come calling at my horti and now at my house so much attention is likely to spoil me gordianus she seemed to produce this banter by rote her voice had the proper lilt but there was no spark in her eyes youve heard the news i said of course rome has been saved once again and all good romans must assemble in the forum to shout hurrah the senate will pass a resolution to congratulate the consul the consul will issue a proclamation to congratulate the senate the commander of the garrison at compsa will receive a promotion the soldiers at thurii abruptly she stopped she gazed down at the hungry fish who crowded together and gazed back at her for months youve been seeing marcus caelius i said ever since he came back from spain with caesar all spring and summer while he was stirring up trouble in the forum he was also coming here to your house how do you know that gordianus calpurnia told me she has spies all over the city does she think i was in league with caelius were you clodias face drew taut the flattering moment passed she looked her age for people like calpurnia the world must seem such a simple place others are in league or not in league allies or enemies to be trusted or not she has the mind of a man she might as well not be a woman curious i said what calpurnia has an equally low opinion of you but for opposite reasons she says youre driven by whims and emotions she says youre weak and have no control clodia laughed without mirth well see how long a woman like calpurnia can hold caesars interest if and when he makes himself master of the world can you imagine making love to such a block of wood youve changed the subject were you in league with caelius in league with him no in love with him her voice broke she shut her eyes yes i shook my head i dont believe you you were lovers once but that was years ago you prosecuted him for a murder you did your best to destroy him to have him driven out of rome instead he humiliated you in the court he stood up for milo after your brother was murdered after all that you cant possibly how would you know what im capable of gordianus i felt a sudden cold fury in my chest im afraid i may know exactly what youre capable of what do you mean by that i dont think you fell in love with caelius all over again that would make you as flighty and foolish as calpurnia paints you and youre not a fool youre hard and shrewd and endlessly calculating i think you hated marcus caelius more than ever when he came back to rome with caesar there he was the man you despised most in the world standing proudly at caesars side rewarded with a magistracy still a player in the great game despite all your efforts to destroy himwhile you languished in obscurity your fortune squandered your reputation a joke your beloved brother dead and gone vengeance must never be far from your thoughts what else is there for you to think about now that everything that once brought you pleasure is gone including your beauty she stared at me blankly you neednt speak so cruelly gordianus you dare to call me cruel when it was you who deliberately snared marcus caelius a second time in your net all the while plotting how finally to destroy him i said your beauty was gone and its true but caelius knew you when you still possessed it he was under its spell once and he never forgot he remembered you as you wereas i remember you you sought him out you seduced him a second time you managed to make him fall in love with you all over again you made him trust you and then what how did you plant the seeds of discontent in his heart very subtly i imagine with a wellplaced word here and there you cast aspersions on caesarmild at first then more and more caustic you reminded him of the power of the roman mob and the fact that no one since your brother had successfully harnessed their power i can hear you caesar doesnt know your value marcus hes wasting your talents why does he reward mediocrities like trebonius above you because hes jealous of you thats why because he secretly fears you if only my dear brother were still alive what an opportunity he could make of this situation the people are miserable theyve lost their faith in caesar they despise himall they need is a man who can harness their anger a man with the gift of speech and the nerve to pit himself against the lapdogs caesar has left in charge of the city such a man could make himself ruler of rome clodia stared at me her eyes flashing but she said nothing shall i go on very well you encouraged him to make wilder and wilder promises to the mob to bait his fellow magistrates to insult the senate to speak words of sedition against caesar himself when he finally went too far and isauricus tried to arrest him how that must have delighted you but caelius slipped the net he went into hiding then he made common cause with milothe convicted killer of your brotherand how that must have galled you meanwhile you never ceased plotting caeliuss destruction i think you were still in touch with him still guiding him toward his ruin perhaps he balked seeing the hopelessness of the prospect before him did you goad him on telling him the gods were on his side did you cast aspersions on his manhood did you tell him only a coward would stop in midcourse and when milosuperstitious omenfearing milosought out a seeress to show him the future what did you do about that clodia i waited for her to answer wanting to hear the truth from her own lips but she only continued to stare at me with a wild look in her eyes cassandra was calpurnias spy i said did you know that she wrinkled her brow and spoke at last no but im not surprised milo wanted to seek her out for a prophecy did you know that yes so you were still in touch with caelius even after he went into hiding yes after his escape from isauricus he came to this house a few times always in disguise false beards false bosoms a smile crept over her lips though she seemed to fight it he loved that sort of thing going about in disguises he was mad completely mad from the first day i knew him to the last you might have thought he was taking part in some adolescent prank not trying to bring down the state he told me that hed been in contact with milo and milo was almost ready to join forces with him i know how much you hate him he said to me but its the only way together we can pull it off there was only one catch milo had heard of what he called this halfmad seeress this woman called cassandrait was fausta who told him about herand he was determined first to hear what cassandra had to say milo had latched onto the idea that cassandra and only cassandra could tell him the future he was utterly convinced of it he refused to take another step until he heard from cassandras own lips that the enterprise would succeed i shook my head but cassandra had explicit instructions from calpurnia to tell milo no such thing she was to predict only doom for the insurrection she was to send milo and caelius scrambling to throw themselves on caesars mercy from what youve just told me if cassandra had succeeded in carrying out calpurnias instructions then milo would never had ridden south with caelius that day someone must have prevented her from delivering that prophecy someone who wanted the insurrection to go ahead knowing that it could end only in the destruction of both milo and caelius and that was what you wanted above all else wasnt it clodia i shook my head i understand your hatred for both of those men i dont doubt that you wanted to see them humiliated and dead their memories disgraced their heads delivered to calpurnia as trophies but why did cassandra have to die was there no other way clodias eyes brimmed with tears is that what you think that i wanted caelius to die that i murdered cassandra you think you know everything gordianus yet you know nothing xviii i had never seen her so completely unguarded so wracked with emotion i could never have imagined her so vulnerable the tears that ran down her cheeks gave her a curious kind of beauty that transcended any she had previously possessed i gazed at clodia in wonder tell me then tell me what i dont know i said she caught her breath she covered her face for a moment when she withdrew her hand the tears had ceased her features were composed she stared at the fish in the pond as she spoke for years i hated marcus caelius a part of me lived for that hatred the way that one can live for love i turned to it whenever i saw no other reason to go on existing in a world where everything gold had turned to lead in a strange way that hatred nurtured me what a poem catullus could have made of that catullus knew that passion is passion whether its love or hate it drives the spirit hating caelius gave me a reason to draw my next breath as it turned out caelius had never forgotten me either men have more ways than women do to distract themselves from such a passionbuilding a political career traveling the world fighting in battles but when he returned with caesar from spain something stirred him to come and see me i think he was suddenly struck by the futility of all his frantic pursuits for money and power caesar had turned the world upside down and for a little while anything seemed possible sheer exhilaration drove caelius forward until he realized that nothing was going to change except perhaps for the worse he found himself back in rome stuck with a meaningless magistracy bored out of his wits he was dispirited angry depressed on a whim one afternoon he came to see me i was here in the garden when the slave announced him i thought surely the slave was mistaken or else someone was playing a joke on me show him in i said and a few moments later caelius appeared a thousand thoughts rushed through my head not least that i wanted to murder him i imagined stabbing him and pushing him into this fishpond that thought filled me with immense pleasure how it came about that he was sitting beside me on this couch i cant tell you nor can i tell you how it happened that his lips were on mine and our arms were around each other and we both were weeping you think that i hatched some insidious plot against him gordianus that i schemed to seduce him but caelius came to me and what happened between us was totally spontaneous and totally mutual years ago before we fell out i thought i was in love with him but what i had felt for him then was nothing compared to what i felt when he came to me that day both of us had received some very hard blows we had learned a few lessons about humility and survival and what really matters in the world the caelius who came to me that day was neither the caelius i had loved nor the caelius i had hated but another man larger than either of those others and infinitely more capable of loving me and i was a different woman from the one who had loved and then hated caelius though i didnt know it until that moment when we were reunited yet i never heard a whisper of gossip about you and caelius i said such a tale would have been just the thing to excite the chinwaggers in the forum we made no show of what happened between us we were discreet others would never have understood it was no one elses business yet calpurnia knew that caelius was seeing you i said as you say she has spies everywhere perhaps she intentionally had caelius followed or perhaps one of her informants just happened to notice him coming or going what happened between us may have piqued her curiosity but surely she had more pressing affairs of state to worry about caelius eventually gave her plenty to worry about after caesar left rome when caelius began to press his radical legislation and to agitate in the forumwhat role did you play in that you think i planted the idea in his head encouraged him spurred him on nothing could be further from the truth do you think after seeing what became of my brother that i wanted to see caelius meet the same end the roman mob is fickle i told him you can stir them up easily enough but once theres blood on the ground theyll scatter like dust for the moment the moneylenders and landlords hold caesar and his senate in the palms of their hands volumnius and his sort have rattled the dice and cast a venus throw theres no beating them at their own game but caelius wouldnt listen to me just as hed found me at lastfound the passion hed been missing for years and desperately searching forso he thought that hed finally hit his stride as a politician he was no longer ciceros errant flunky you see no longer milos redfaced apologist no longer caesars underutilized underling fobbed off with a safe useless post in the government caelius had become his own man dreaming his own dream i feared for him i told him so i begged him to stop to make peace with isauricus and trebonius but it did no good he believed he had discovered his destiny there was no stopping him at last he went too far the senate passed the ultimate decree against him they made caelius an outlaw and then he had no choice but to play his final gambit he had been in communication with milo for quite some time encouraging him to break out of massilia and to bring his troop of gladiators back to italy i think it was in caeliuss mind from the beginning to raise an armed revolt he meant for it to begin in rome then spread across the countryside but even his powers of persuasion couldnt incite the rabble to sacrifice themselves in such a hopeless cause caelius went underground slipping in and out of rome like a shadow often wearing a disguise rallying his supporters and trying to make allianceslaying the groundwork for a revolution he called itthough i dont think he accomplished much eventually he arranged to rendezvous with milo secretly here in rome he had the temerity to ask me if he could bring milo here to my house absolutely not i told him to even suggest such a thing was an insult to the shade of my brother so they met in that apartment building in the subura the one where cassandra kept a room i suppose it was calpurnia who arranged for cassandra to rent that room as a way to keep watch on caelius and his supporters in the building i think so yes clodia nodded caelius was suspicious of cassandra but he didnt know anything about her for certainwhether she was genuine or not or a black mailer or a spy or nothing more than a petty schemer i think he was glad to have her in the building for the same reason in reverse so that he could keep an eye on her and that mute companion of hers rupa that was how i found out about you and cassandra caeliuss agents had observed you coming and going in a manner that suggested only one thing that the two of you were lovers imagine my surprise gordianus that pillar of rectitude and restraint indulging his animal appetites at last it amused me that you of all people should have been stung by cupids arrow but secretly i was happy for you i was in love myself i wished for the whole world to be in love including you why not caelius met twice with milo two days running i saw him the night after the first meeting he was very excited very talkative i knew it might be the last time i would see him let him talk all he wants i told myself you may never hear his voice again he told me about milos fascination with cassandra fausta had told milo all about cassandra and he was desperate to meet her and receive a prophecy it hadnt happened that daycassandra was out apparently nowhere to be found caelius hoped she would be in the next day because milo seemed absolutely determined to hear what she had to say before he fully committed himself to the insurrection doesnt that sound just like milo stubborn and stupid and superstitious caelius was almost certain cassandra would be in her room the next day because his agents had observed a certain pattern in her routinethat would be the day that you would be calling on her caelius took it into his head not only to consult cassandra but to try to win you over to the cause i told him that youd never agree to such a thing what if you approach gordianus and he refuses i said then we shall have no choice but to kill him said caelius i absolutely forbade him to do that i made him give me his word that no harm would come to you no matter how you responded when he and milo tried to win you over i drew a sharp breath it was you to whom caelius made that promise i had thought i tried to remember exactly the exchange i had heard between milo and caelius as i lost consciousness we should have put hemlock in the wine instead of that other stuff said milo we should lop his head off here and now no said caelius i gave her my word i promised and you agreed a promise made to a witch said milo call her that if you want since youre not worthy to utter her name i gave her my word and my word still means something milo does yours i had thought it was cassandra who had somehow extracted that promise from caeliusbut it was clodia what about cassandra i asked when i woke the next day she was gone and so was rupa and her room was empty as if shed never been there im not sure what happened i didnt see caelius again but i did receive a message from hima few scribbled words obviously written in haste i think he must have handed it to a messenger just as he was leaving rome he mentioned cassandra though not by name he was careful to use no actual names with the intention of protecting me i suppose should the message be intercepted he ended by cautioning me to burn the parchment at once did you her smile seemed to arise from some ironic reflex the only possible response to a question so foolish her fingers trembled as she reached into the bosom of her stola and pulled forth a small rolled piece of parchment she handed it to me and i felt it still warm from its contact with her flesh i unrolled it and read squinting to make out some of the more hastily scribbled words little sparrow i am off wish me the favor of the gods dont say that the cause is impossible a year ago would you not have said the same about any chance that you and i would rediscover the joy we had lost my skittish partner is now bursting with confidence thanks to the words of that trojan princess she has promised us success beyond our wildest hopes i think that she truly is a seeress and it was apollo himself who showed her our glorious future make a sacrifice to apollo if you wish to do something useful better yet start working on that list and make it a long one look for good news from the south when i see you next everything shall be different i handed the message back to her he refers to a list i said a private joke he used to say make a list of the people you want beheaded little sparrow and i shall see to it straightaway when i take over the city i felt a chill the joke had been on caelius but i dont understand what he says about cassandra he makes it sound as if she gave milo the encouraging prophecy he was hoping for i presume she did success beyond our wildest hopes he says yet calpurnia gave her specific instructions to do quite the opposite cassandra was to do all she could to discourage them from mounting an insurrection why did cassandra disobey calpurnia perhaps someone bribed her to do so if she took money from calpurnia why not from someone else if that person offered her more i wrinkled my brow cassandra had disobeyed calpurnia to placate her old friend cytheris she had disobeyed calpurnia when she chose to see me but those had been petty infractions would she have dared to disobey calpurnia in a matter such as this with so many lives at stake who would have encouraged or bribed or threatened her to do so who knew how much milo was depending on that prophecy i said who wanted so desperately for milo to embark on the insurrection caelius of course clodia shook her head caelius didnt bribe cassandra you read the note gordianus he himself was persuaded by her he believed she was a genuine seeress then it can have been only one person there was a black wreath on her door i thought of the wreath that so recently had hung on my own door in memory of cassandra and the wreath i had seen on fulvias door still marking her grief months after curios death this wreath made a mockery of those others no doubt i would find her wearing black with her hair undressed did it amuse her to put on the trappings of a bereaved widow did she think of her widowhood as an honor she had earned even the gonetoseed gladiator who answered the door was wearing black hello birria i said that color flatters you it hides your fat he scowled at me then saw i was not alone it was not davus who stood behind me but a troop of calpurnias bodyguards from clodias house i had gone straight to calpurnias after a brief audience with calpurnia i had come here ill tell the mistress youre here birria said and skulked off a little later he returned and invited me to follow him the bodyguards remained outside but when birria tried to close the door on them one of them blocked it with his foot the fellow was every bit as big as birria and surrounded by ten more like him after a brief staring contest birria relented and stepped back the door remained open with the bodyguards standing at attention just outside birria led me to the chamber called the baiae room then stepped across the hallway into the garden looking nervous fausta stood just inside the room dressed in black her masses of ginger hair were unpinned and hung about her shoulders beside her was a little tripod table set with a small pitcher of wine and a single cup as on the previous occasion when i had called on her she indicated that i should take a chair at the far end of the room id rather stand i said and id rather stay here where i can see you in the light black suits you fausta it matches that bruise under your eye she winced at my rudeness and touched her face selfconsciously youve come without that handsome soninlaw of yours gordianus i didnt have time to fetch him ive come here straight from calpurnias house she was very interested to hear what i had to tell her she sent some of her men with me so birria told me is she trying to frighten me i cant imagine why my husband is dead poor milo he never posed much of a threat to the state anyway he incited a great many slaves to revolt along with milos gladiators they caused considerable havoc in the region around compsa yes that was unfortunate but all milos gladiators are dead now and so are all those slaves arent they yes they either died fighting or else were crucified thanks to milo and the false hope he gave them a tremendous waste of manpower im sure a tremendous amount of suffering do slaves really suffer like the rest of us im not sure the philosophers are agreed on that subject gordianus but certainly milo had a lot to answer forproperty damage lives lost wasted slaves not to mention the scare he threw into everyone but he paid the price didnt he he cast the dice and they came up dogs and now his lemur is wandering about hades without a head but what has any of this to do with me since when is a wife held liable under roman law for her husbands actions you conspired with milo against the state nonsense you encouraged him to raise the insurrection he might have balked at doing so but for your meddling she looked at me coldly you cant prove that calpurnia didnt require proof i merely had to convince her i explained what i knew and she insisted on sending those men along with me to make sure you dont try to slip away before isauricus and his lictors come for you conspiring against the roman state is a crime punishable by death fausta laughed shrilly will they put me on trial then they wont have to the ultimate decree is still in effect the consul isauricus has the authority to take any steps necessary to safeguard the state that includes the summary execution of traitors she looked at me with fear in her eyes damn you gordianus why are doing this to me you did it to yourself fausta why couldnt you leave milo to his fate without interfering because he was a hopeless bungler and a fool and a coward she cried left to his own devices hed still be hiding in some hole in the subura waiting for the right omen to come along he needed a nudgeno a kick in the back sideto get him moving and you gave him that kick by arranging for cassandra to utter a prophecy of success for the insurrection yes and it worked like a charm what an actress she was she delivered a performance that convinced even caelius it must have been quite magnificent i only wish id been there to see it but id surely have laughed and given her away where did it happen when in her shabby little room in the subura she stalled them until nightfallthe visions she described were always more convincing by lamplight she told meand then she delivered the last performance of her life while you were upstairs sleeping off the drug they gave you cassandra was groveling on the dirt floor of her room foaming at the mouth and uttering the words milo most wanted to hear id told her just what to say of course i knew the images that would appeal most to milos brutish imagination describe it thus i told her an endless triumphal procession with milo and caelius at the head the acclamations of the people like thunder in their ears trebonius and isauricus and all their other enemies in chains behind them and statues of solid gold in their likenesses installed in the forum while somewhere in a gray void we see pompey and caesar reduced to the size of dwarves ripping open each others bellies with their teeth devouring one anothers entrails in an endless circle like the worm that eats its own tail imagine the dreams that vision put into milos head the next morning he could hardly wait to set out caelius was just as eager they met with their closest supporters took some with them left others to manage affairs in their absence and off they went convinced that fortune and the fates were firmly on their side while i still slept i whispered alone in that room upstairs not alone before he left that morning caelius told cassandra what had become of you she looked in on you then left rupa to look after you where did she go she came to this house of course to collect her money money i said dully that was how you persuaded her to go against calpurnias wishes all it took was a little gold no it also required a great deal of persuasion when i told her what i wanted her to doto encourage milo to get on with his hopeless insurrectionshe resisted for a while she kept up her pretense of being a genuine seeress i told her it was no use trying to fool me and whatever calpurnia was paying herthat was an educated guess on my part that she was calpurnias agenti would pay her more i kept harrying her and offering more gold until at last she weakened put yourself in her place gordianus here in rome thanks to all the skullduggery surrounding the war cassandra found herself in a position to make a great deal of moneyprobably the only chance in her lifetime for such a woman to make so much money can you blame her for seizing the opportunity to maximize her fortune wheres the risk i asked her if milo wins hell shower you with riches and honors if he dies hell be silent forever whatever happens youll receive your pay from both of us with calpurnia never the wiser i shook my head then its just as i said in the end all it took was a little gold not a little gold gordianus a great deal of it thats what i promised her anyway and it wasnt entirely for herself she said she needed the money for you for me so she said when she came here to collect her money she seemed to think she had to justify herself to meas if i cared about her sense of honor i would never have done it she told me except that i need more money i need it for the man i love hes in a great deal of trouble hes accumulated an enormous debt its crushing the life out of him if i can free him of it i will you didnt know gordianus cassandra was thinking of you i felt a fire in my head but instead of paying her you poisoned her why fausta because i had no more money the partial payment i had given her in advance was all i had she came here looking for the balance but i had nothing to give her not even a token payment i stalled her for as long as i could i told her i was sending a slave to fetch the money for her in fact i dispatched the fellow to the subura to finish off rupa the slave i sent was a big burly fellow a former gladiator like birria i thought hed have no trouble but it seems that rupa was more than a match for him that was the dead body i found when i woke rupa killed himthere in the room while i lay unconscious cassandra left rupa to watch over me when your man arrived there must have been a struggle and rupa broke his neck then rupa must have panicked he gathered up everything in cassandras room and ran off everything i thought except her biting stick which he must have dropped or over looked so far as i know the mute is still in hiding said fausta and even as i woke cassandra was here in this house waiting with me in the garden when one of the slaves brought in a cold porridge for the midday meal and served a portion to each of us cassandra suspected nothing what poison did you use how should i know i bought it from a fellow whos been in that sort of business a long time milo used to go to him occasionally painful or painless he asked me i told him i didnt care so long as it was guaranteed to work quickly but it didnt the poison acted very slowly we both finished our porridge and put the bowls aside nothing happened i began to think i had misjudged the dose or perhaps id even given her the wrong portion had i poisoned myself i sat there imagining a burning in my gut as i watched her unable to take my eyes off her waiting to see the first sign of distress on her face finallyfinallythe poison began to take effect at first she merely felt ill she said she thought something in the porridge had disagreed with her then a look came over her faceshock panicas she realized what was happening she screamed and threw her empty bowl at me and ran from the garden i tried to stop her we struggled i tore her tunica she escaped and ran from the house birria went after her but she lost him he didnt know which way shed gone i was frantic with worry who might she see before the poison finished her what might she tell them finally later that day i heard the report of her death in the marketplace she died in your arms i was told had she told you what happened surely not because hours passed then days and you did nothing about it still i was torn by doubts that was why i dared to come to see her funeral pyre you were there so were calpurnia and some of the other women who had known cassandra everyone saw me yet no one reacted that was when i knew for certain that no one suspected i had killed her i watched her burn and i was finally satisfied that i had gotten away with it at last i could turn my thoughts to milo and wait for the delicious news of his destruction i shook my head i thought it was clodia i thought clodia would stop at nothing to destroy marcus caelius but in the end she was desperate to save himfrom himself and i thought that you would do whatever you could to stop milo from carrying out such a mad scheme but your only desire was to see him destroy himself paradoxes amuse you dont they finder i told you ive no patience with playwrights devices similes metaphors and such ironies and enigmas displease me even more but i do know when the final act is over fausta reached for the pitcher on the table beside her and filled the cup to the brim youll forgive me if i dont offer you a cup as well she said lifting it to her lips i gave a start and reached for the cup but too late she had swallowed the contents in a single draught fausta put down the cup her eyes glittered she blinked and swayed slightly the poison merchant promised me that this one would act much more quickly and without too much pain she grimaced the liar it hurts like hades she gripped her belly and staggered out of the room into the portico off the garden people will say i did it out of grief its an honorable thing for a widow to take her own life after her husband dies in battle sullas daughter shall bring no shame to his memory fausta collapsed to the floor birria who had been pacing the garden gave a cry and rushed to her he knelt and scooped her up her eyes were open but she was as limp as a sack of grain in his arms already dead he threw back his head and let out a howl tears streamed down his face no he cried he stared up at me what have you done to her she did it to herself i said pointing to the doorway and the little tripod table just inside birria spied the pitcher and the cup for a long moment he stared into faustas lifeless eyes finally he released her i heard a slither of metal as he pulled his short sword from its scabbard i started back but the blade was not for me kneeling over fausta he turned the sword against his belly and braced himself a look came over his features such as one sometimes sees on the face of a gladiator in the arena at the enda look at once resigned and defiant contemptuous of life itself birria drew a last breath and fell onto his sword his eyes rolled back in his head and he let out a gasp blood poured from the wound and trickled from his lips he pitched and heaved for a moment then stiffened then collapsed across the body of his mistress xix egypt bethesda delivered this pronouncement in much the same fashion that she had announced her previous sudden insights into a cure for her illness how she arrived at these revelations where the knowledge came from and why she trusted it i had no idea i only knew that where once she had uttered radishes and the household had gone on an expedition in search of radishes now she uttered egypt a trip to egypt would cure herthat and only that why egypt i asked because i came from egypt we all came from egypt egypt is where all life began she said this as if it were a fact that no one could possibly dispute like saying things fall down not up or the sun shines during the day not at night i had thought she might say because egypt is where we met husband egypt is where you found me and fell in love with me and egypt is where i intend to reclaim you and purify you of the transgression you committed with another woman but that was not what she said of course did she know about cassandra i thought not she had been too preoccupied with her own illness did diana know not for certain perhaps but diana had to suspect something so far she hadnt confronted or questioned me if she had suspicions she kept them to herselfmore for her mothers sake i suspected than for mine what was done was done and the important thing was to keep peace in the household at least until her mother got better i must return to alexandria bethesda announced at break fast one morning and not for the first time i must bathe once more in the nile the river of life in egypt i shall either find a cure or i shall find eternal rest mother dont say that diana put down her bowl of watery farina and gripped her stomach had her mothers words upset her digestionor was diana too falling prey to some malady she was nauseous as many mornings as not it seemed to me that a curse had fallen on all the women in my life this was the first time that bethesda had explicitly mentioned the possibility of dying in egypt was that the real point of the journey she insisted on making and was all her talk of a cure a mere pretense did she know that she was dying and did she wish to end her days in alexandria where her life had begun we cant afford it i said bluntly i wish we could but there was a noise at the front door not a friendly or respectful knocking but a loud insistent banging davus frowned exchanged a guarded look with me and went to answer it a moment later he returned and spoke in my ear trouble he said stay here i said to the others and followed davus to the foyer i looked through the peephole on my doorstep a pair of hulking giants flanked a small ferret of a man in a toga the ferret saw my eye at the peephole and spoke up its no good hiding behind that door gordianus the finder a man can avoid the day of reckoning for only so long who are you and what are you doing on my doorstep i asked though i knew already since the annihilation of caelius and milo the moneylenders and landlords of rome reigned supreme any organized resistance to them had evaporated trebonius was said to favor creditors quite blatantly now in any negotiation he brokered between them and their debtors those who had sought relief before the stillborn insurrection had received much better deals than those who were seeking relief now i represent volumnius said the ferret to whom you owe the sum of i know exactly how much i owe volumnius i said do you most people have difficulty calculating the interest that accumulates they almost always underestimate the amount they dont understand that if they miss making even a single payment i havent missed a payment according to the agreement i made with volumnius the first installment isnt due until tomorrow yes this is merely a courtesy call to remind you i presume you will have the first installment ready for me first thing in the morning i peered out the peephole at the faces of the ferrets two henchmen both had hands the size of small hams and small beady eyes they looked too slow and stupid to be gladiators their sort was good for only one thing overpowering and intimidating victims smaller and weaker than themselves the sum of their brainpower combined was probably below that of the average mule but they could probably follow simple orders from the ferretbreak this fellows finger say or break his arm or break both arms go away i said payment isnt due until tomorrow youve no right to come harassing me today harassing you said the ferret flashing a wicked smile if you call this harassment citizen then just wait until i slammed shut the little hatch over the peephole the noise it made was as feeble as i felt at that moment go to hades i shouted through the door i heard the ferret laugh then bark an order at his henchmen to move on then the sound of their footsteps receding davus frowned what are we going to do if they come back tomorrow if they come back davus i dont think theres any doubt about that we returned to the dining room bethesda looked at me expectantly diana i noticed looked first to davus to ascertain his expression and only then at me further proof if any was needed that she was now more his wife than my daughter that was only proper but still it irked me hieronymus was eating the last of his farina very slowly and looking glum androcles and mopsus having risen and eaten before anyone else were in the garden where i had assigned them some tasks to work off their morning burst of energy through the window i could see them squabbling and pelting each other with pulled weeds oblivious to the crisis in the household i opened my mouth to speak but what was there to say false words of reassurance an abrupt change of subject or perhaps a resumption of the previous subject namely the hopelessness of bethesdas demand for a journey to egypt at that moment nothing would have pleased me more than the prospect of a trip to alexandria or to any other place as long as it was as far from rome as possible i was spared from having to speak by an abrupt knock at the door not again i muttered stalking back to the foyer i didnt bother with the peephole but threw back the bar and pulled open the door even the ferret and his henchmen wouldnt dare to attack a roman citizen on his doorstep on the day before a loan came due or would they i wondered if i could gouge out the ferrets eyes before the two giants had time to disable me what are you doing back here i shouted i told you the man on my doorstep stared at me blankly i stared back at him just as blankly until i recognized him he was the personal secretary to calpurnia who had called at my door previously what are you doing here i asked in a very different tone of voice my mistress sent me she wants to see you now as soon as possible before before what please follow me and ask no questions i looked down at the old tunic i was wearing i shall have to change no need for that please come at once and you might want to bring a bodyguard with you for later later to walk you home safely the streets are likely to bewell youll see he smiled and i had a glimmer of what he was trying to tell me or more precisely what he was trying not to tell me come along davus i called over my shoulder weve been summoned by the first woman in rome the slave led us across the palatine hill to the large house where calpurnia was residing in her husbands absence even before we reached the house i could see that the surrounding streets were busier than normal messengers were fanning outward from the house while men in togas were converging upon it there was a sense of excitement of a charge like lightning in the air it intensified in the forecourt of the house where men in small groups talked in hushed voices while slaves scurried to and fro i recognized several senators and magistrates trebonius and isauricus stood together off to one side surrounded by their lictors something important had happened the eyes and ears of all rome were becoming trained upon this house the slave ushered us through the forecourt up the steps and into the house the guards recognized him and allowed us to pass without question from the buzz of excitement outside i expected the inside of the house to be a veritable beehive but the hall down which the slave led us was surprisingly empty and quiet we emerged in a sunlit garden where calpurnia seated in a backless chair was dictating in a low voice to a scribe at our approach she looked up and made a sign for the scribe to withdraw at another sign the slave who had escorted us also vanished gordianus you came very quickly with a raised eyebrow she took note of my shabby tunic and i knew i should have taken time to put on my toga no matter what the slave had said your man indicated that the summons was urgent only because in a few moments all rome shall know once the word is out theres no telling how people will react i assume that most people will be as overjoyed as i amor will pretend to be youve received good news calpurnia she drew a breath and closed her eyes for a moment she had not yet repeated the news often enough to have become inured to it when she opened her eyes they glittered with tears her voice trembled caesar has triumphed there was a great battle in thessaly near a place called pharsalus pompeys front lines gave way then his cavalry broke and fled it was a complete rout caesar himself led the charge to overrun the enemys camp some of their leaders escaped but the engagement was decisive almost fifteen thousand of the enemy were slain that day and more than twentyfour thousand surrendered caesars forces lost scarcely two hundred men victory is ours and pompey her face darkened even as caesar was leading his men over the ramparts into the enemys camp pompey fled from his tent threw off his scarlet cape to make himself less conspicuous mounted the first horse he could find and escaped through the rear gate he made his way to the coast and boarded a ship he appears to have headed for egypt caesar pursues him thats the only bad news that caesar cant yet return to rome but that was to be expected caesar will have to settle romes affairs in egypt and elsewhere before he can at last come home to rest for a long moment i took in the momentous nature of what calpurnia had just told me waves of emotion passed through me like her i experienced a trembling in my throat and tears came to my eyes then doubts and questions intruded on my thoughts could it really be over with a single battle was the war truly ended what of pompeys naval fleet which had always been superior to caesars and which was still presumably intact who else besides pompey had survived and how easily would they give up the fight what of romes other enemies such as king juba who had annihilated curio and his expedition in africa what of egypt which was engaged in its own dynastic civil war calpurnia spoke of settling affairs there as if the job involved tools no more complicated than a broom and a dustpan but when had anything to do with egypt ever been that simple would it really be such a trivial task to track down pompey as if he were an escaped slave if and when caesar trapped him did he intend to murder pompey in cold blood or would he bring him back to rome as a prisoner parading him in chains behind his chariot in a triumphal procession as he had done to vercingetorix the gaul doubts shadowed the news calpurnia had given me but i said nothing of them how many of the men in her forecourt were entertaining the same questions and how many would feign jubilation and leave their doubts unspokenfor the time being remarkable news i finally managed to say is there nothing you wish to ask no one you wish to ask after i thought for a moment what of domitius ahenobarbus he was one of caesars fiercest enemies at the outset of the war he had lost the italian city of corfinium to caesar botched a suicide attempt and been captured humiliated by caesars pardon he made his way to massiliawhere his path crossed mineand took command of the forces resisting caesars siege when caesar and trebonius took massilia domitius ahenobarbus had escaped once more to join pompey redbeard is no more said calpurnia with a glint of satisfaction in her eyes when the camp was overrun domitius fled on foot and headed up a mountainside antonys cavalry hunted him down like a stag in the woods he collapsed from fear and exhaustion his body was still warm when antony found him he died without a wound on him faustus sulla faustas brother apparently escaped there was a rumor he might head for africa cato he too eluded capture he may be on the way to africa as well cicero cicero lives he missed the battle entirely on account of an upset stomach rumor has it hes headed back to rome my husband is notorious for his clemency who knows he may yet forgive cicero for siding with pompey she stared at me for a long moment why not ask what you most want to ask finder why not indeed i bowed my head and sighed i tried to control the trembling in my voice what news of meto she nodded and smiled a bit more smugly than was warranted meto is well according to my husband he distinguished himself admirably throughout the campaign and most especially in the battle at pharsalus he remains at caesars side traveling with him to egypt i shut my eyes and held them shut to hold back tears when did this battle take place four days after the nones of sextilis i drew a breath the day cassandra was buried so it was i hadnt realized that on the very day cassandra turned to ashes upon her funeral pyre the fate of rome was decided i thought of all that had transpired and all i had discovered in the time it took the news from pharsalus to reach rome i thought of the women who had shared with me their secrets none of us knowing that even as we raked over the past and agonized over the future the battle between the titans was already decided why did you summon me here calpurnia and bid me come so quickly i should think that every man out there shuffling nervously about your forecourt is more deserving to be kept abreast of the latest news from caesar she laughed let those senators and magistrates grind their teeth and swap rumors and stand on pins awhile longer i intended to call you here today anyway because of a certain other event rupa step forward he had been standing in the shadows when he stepped into sight the look i saw on his face was closer to chagrin than anything else he put his hands on my shoulders and gave me a rather stiff embrace so youre alive after all i said where have you been all this time he covered one hand with the other in hiding who could blame him fausta had sent a slave to kill him when he learned about cassandras death he must have been as baffled as i was not knowing whom to blame or whom to fear he should have come straight to me of course said calpurnia but i suppose he was afraid of me thinking i might have had something to do with cassandras death but ever since fausta died all sorts of rumors have been circulating about her death and her role in the insurrection including a rumor about her poisoning cassandra rupa heard it and decided to risk coming here to find out the truth i told him of all your efforts to find his sisters killer not to mention the care you took to see that she was properly cremated rupa looked in my eyes and embraced me again less stiffly at that moment he looked very much like cassandra he also came here to collect cassandras earnings which i kept in trust for her its a considerable sum but theres a slight problem it has to do with you finder please explain at some point cassandra gave rupa a letter addressed to me to be delivered only in the event of her disappearance or death rupa cant read and of course he didnt dare to show the letter to anyone besides me so hes had no idea whats in the letter until today when he delivered it to me ive read it to him and discussed what it means hes agreed to its terms but i cant be certain that you will i dont understand the letter mentions me yes shall i read it to you without waiting for an answer she produced a scrap of parchment and read aloud to calpurnia wife of gaius julius caesar in recent days i have found myself thinking a great deal about my death were i truly gifted with the power of prophecy i might almost say that i have experienced a premonition of death perhaps i am only suffering a normal measure of trepidation given the inherent danger of my work for you but if you are reading these words then i must indeed be dead for my instructions to rupa are to deliver this letter to you only in the event of my death or if i should disappear under circumstances such that my death can almost certainly be presumed in such an event this is my desire regarding the disposition of the money i have earned from you and which you are holding for me because rupa himself would be illdisposed to handle such a large amount of money i wish for the entire sum to be given to gordianus called the finder a man who is known to you and to your husband upon this condition that he shall take rupa into his household and shall adopt him as his son in return for assuming a fathers responsibility for rupas wellbeing gordianus may dispose of the money as he sees fit i know he has great need of it i hope it will come as a boon to him and to his family this is the wish of your loyal agent cassandra calpurnia put down the letter im not sure about that last bither loyalty i mean she did conspire with fausta to induce milo to raise arms against the state one might argue that she was a traitor in the end and that i would be entirely justified to seize all her assetsincluding the money i was holding in trust for her but i ask myself what would caesar do and the answer is obvious for no leader of the roman state has ever shown as great an inclination to clemency as caesar cassandra cannot be made to suffer any more for her collusion with fausta she paid for that mistake with her life i see no reason why rupa should also suffer and i have no wish to take from you gordianus the money that cassandra wished for you to have you did me a great favor when you uncovered faustas perfidy and while i suspect you dont wish to be paid for that effortthat would make you my agent wouldnt iti do hope that this audience and its outcome may mark the first step toward a complete reconciliation between you and my husband as well as those who serve my husband including young meto i stared at her not sure how to answer what is the sum you hold in trust for cassandra i asked she named it the amount so surprised me that i asked her to repeat it i looked at rupa warily do you understand the amount of money that your sister earned he nodded yet you accept the terms she laid out in her letter that you should receive none of that money and instead should become my son by adoption he nodded again and would have embraced me a third time had i not stepped back i looked at calpurnia perhaps it would be fairer if rupa and i were to split the amount i suggested she shrugged once you receive the money from me gordianus you can do with it whatever you wish but youll receive it only if you agree to adopt rupa as cassandra requested you appear to be a bit taken aback by her generosity but i think she showed great wisdom in making such an arrangement rupa is a strong young man probably an excellent bodyguard and able to take care of himself in a fighthe certainly got the better of that gladiator fausta sent to kill him but in many ways hes not fit to look after himself cassandra was the one who always took care of him now that shes gone it was her wish that you should do so and why not havent you a propensity for taking strays into your housethe two sons you adopted and that pair of rowdy slave boys you acquired from fulvia it was also cassandras wish that the money she earned should buy you out of the hole youve dug yourself into i understand your debts are considerable even so given the amount shes left you there should be a tidy sum left overenough to look after rupa and the rest of your family for quite a while i thought about this and took a deep breath i looked over my shoulder at davus who had followed the entire exchange in silence he looked back at me with a furrowed brow and i realized that i would face no easy task when it came to explaining to bethesda and diana how i had come into such a fortune and why i was coming home with a new mouth to feed but why should i worry about explaining myself was i not a roman paterfamilias the supreme head of my own household granted by law the power of life and death over everyone in that household a paterfamilias had no need to justify himself so tradition dictated although real life never seemed to adhere very strictly to the model if my wife or daughter pestered me with uncomfortable questions about cassandra or rupa or my sudden windfall or the abrupt vanishing of my debts i could always fall back on my privileges as paterfamilias and simply refuse to answer them for a while anyway do you accept cassandras terms asked calpurnia suddenly impatient for the audience to end yes good ill have the money delivered to you this afternoon take rupa with you as you go stay in the forecourt for a while if you wish to hear the formal announcement she made a wave of dismissal guards appeared from the shadows to see us out we lingered for only a few moments in the forecourt before calpurnia appeared on the steps every voice fell silent as all eyes looked to her citizens i stand before you with wonderful news caesar has triumphed there was a great battle in thessaly near a place called pharsalus she repeated the news just as she had given it to me word for word when she was done the forecourt was oddly silent as those present absorbed the enormity of the news isauricus and trebonius were the first to cheer others joined them until the forecourt rang with acclamations for caesar and cries of venus for victory and so i made my way home with not one but two stout young men to act as my bodyguardsand a good thing that was for the streets of the palatine were suddenly thronged with people cheering and weeping and kissing one another and madly jumping up and down some appeared quietly pleased some genuinely ecstatic how many were simply experiencing a rush of emotion at the tremendous release of the tension that had been building in everyone for months and how many were not happy at all but were doing their best to laugh and shout and blend in with the rest as we slowly made our way through the crowd i was startled to see some distance off a familiar face amid the throng it was old volcatius pompeys most vociferous partisan among the chinwaggers his hands were in the air his head was thrown back his mouth open amid the din i could hear his reedy voice shouting hurrah for caesar venus for victory hurrah for caesar we are all caesarians now i muttered under my breath xx what about this asked diana holding up one of my better garments a green tunic with a greekkey border in yellow along the hem surely ive packed enough clothing already i said the shipmaster charges passengers by the trunk so we should take only what we need for the journey it will be cheaper to buy what we need when we get there mother will like that a shopping trip diana forced a smile she was not happy about her mothers trip to alexandria she had done all she could to dissuade her that part of the world was already unsettled and dangerous she pointed out and likely to become more so if pompey had fled there with caesar chasing after him besides that a sea journey was always dangerous and autumn was coming if we stayed in egypt past the sailing season we might be stranded there for months unable to find a ship willing to risk stormy waters but bethesda would not relent to be cured of her malady she must return to egypt and bathe in the nile dianas greatest worry she left unspoken that she would never see her mother again if the rigors of travel proved too much for her or if bethesdas true purpose in returning to egypt was to die perhapsperhaps i should come along she said absolutely not diana weve already discussed this but no its unthinkable that a young woman in your condition should take off on such a long and uncertain journey i shouldnt have told you that youre with child you couldnt have hidden it much longer you dont know how relieved i was to find out that your morning sickness was due to pregnancy and not something else no you will remain in rome to oversee the household and davus will remain by your side and dont worryyour mother and i will be back in plenty of time to see the birth of our grandchild do you think bethesda would miss that diana forced another smile and busied herself checking the contents of my trunk whats this she asked holding up a sealed bronze urn i took it from her and returned it to the trunk ashes i said ah her ashes you can say her name cassandra but why are you taking them to egypt it was rupas idea cassandra lived most of her life in alexandria he wants to scatter her ashes in the nile i dont see why she should go along on mothers trip dont forget that its her legacy thats paying for the trip ironic isnt it said diana sharply if this trip does cure mothers condition it shall have been paid for by the woman who she saw the look on my face and left the thought unfinished i suppose it is a good thing that youre taking rupa with you since davus isnt going along to protect you rupa will know his way around the city you forget that i lived in alexandria myself for a while but papa that was years and years ago surely its changed since then the alexandria of my youth was fixed in my memory encircled by nostalgia as a city is encircled by walls to keep it safe it seemed unthinkable that it could have changed but why not everything else in the world had changed and seldom for the better diana clicked her tongue but im not sure about the advisability of taking mopsus and androcles im an old man diana ill need quick feet to run my errands so will i once my belly begins to grow i suppose i could take only one of the boys with me and leave you the other no it would be unthinkable to separate them but theyre likely to get themselves thrown overboard if they behave on the ship the way they behave in this house theyre such a handful those two little something caught in her throat she cleared it with a cough and a sniffle and lowered her voice a shame youre not taking hieronymus he keeps hinting that hed like to go having lived all his life in massilia hes eager to see the world at my expense no hieronymus can stay here surely he hasnt exhausted all the discoveries that rome has to offer i sat on the bed diana sat beside me she took my hand in hers theres something we havent yet talked about she said your mother i think she truly believes this trip will cure her you shouldnt worry that no not that i sighed if you wish to finish what you were saying earlier about cassandra diana shook her head no i think it was the fates who guided your course and hers toward an end that neither of you foresaw what then she hesitated weve talked before about the danger in that part of the world surely its no more dangerous than rome isnt it ever since old king ptolemy died the egyptians have been as torn apart as we romans young ptolemy is at war with his sisterwhats she called i believe her name is cleopatra marc antony once mentioned to me that he had met her he said the oddest thing what was that he said that she reminded him of caesar imagine that cleopatra couldnt have been more than fourteen when antony met her she must be about twentytwo nowyes exactly the same age as you diana wonderful you shall find yourself in alexandria with pompey at his most desperate a royal civil war going on and a young female caesar to contend withif one can imagine such a creature i laughed at least it shouldnt be boring but stillthis wasnt what i meant to talk about what then she sighed caesar will be there too wont he very likely and if caesar is there ah i see where youre going youll already have so much to deal withand i dont mean pompey and cleopatra and all that i mean mother whether she gets well or not and the ashes in that urn and what youll feel when you scatter them in the nile and i know youll be worried about me and the child im carrying back here in rome and on top of all that if you should happen to confront meto again daughter daughter do you imagine that i havent thought of all this myself ive been lying awake at night pondering this journey and all the places it may lead but looking ahead serves no purpose its as you say the fates lead us to unseen ends so far on balance the fates have been kind to me there was a noise at the door both of us looked up to see bethesda she looked pale and delicate but in her eyes i saw a steady flame that signaled hope the journey to egypt had come to mean everything to her are you done packing husband yes good we leave at dawn diana if youve finished helping your father come help me sort my things of course diana rose and followed her mother in the doorway she paused and looked back her eyes glittered with tears can it really be tomorrow that youre leaving papa i suddenly feel like hieronymus i envy you you shall see the nile and the pyramids and the giant sphinx and the great library i said and the famous lighthouse at pharos and perhaps you shall even meet we laughed knowing we shared the same thought without speaking cleopatra i said finishing her sentence cleopatra she echoed as if that odd foreignsounding name were a code for all that was understood between us spoken or unspoken after she left the room i rose from the bed and stepped to the trunk i reached down and picked up the bronze urn i held it for a long time feeling the metals cold rigidity sensing the heaviness of its contents finally i returned the urn to the trunk and slowly gently closed the lid authors note after two novels recounting political maneuverings and military operations at the outset of the roman civil warrubicon and last seen in massiliait was my wish to return to the city of rome and to see what its beleaguered citizens especially its women were up to while caesar and pompey conducted an overt war in northern greece who can doubt that covert operations continued at an equally furious pace back in rome we can easily imagine that espionage bribery betrayals profiteering and all sorts of other skullduggery were rife but when it comes to eyewitness or even secondhand accounts our sources for this particular time and placerome in the year bcare scattered and obscure the challenge to the status quo posed by marcus caelius and its outcome are recounted in several ancient sources including velleius paterculus livy cassius dio and caesars the civil war unfortunately these authors offer contradictory and fragmentary details and do little to establish even an approximate timetable but the same chronological uncertainty and paucity of detail that constrain the historian offer a certain elasticity to the novelist of which i have taken considerable advantage in trying to make sense of the political milieu and the mood of rome in bc i found myself returning again and again to a book by jack lindsay marc antony his world and his contemporaries london george routledge amp sons ltd lindsay offers a far more complex ideological interpretation of the aims of marcus caelius than do most historians who tend to dismiss caelius as a mere opportunist for details of the conflict between pompey and caesar t rice holmess closely argued exhaustively annotated the roman republic and the founder of the empire oxford the clarendon press provides a vivid reconstruction the letters of cicero also yield much information on the chain of events i have spent many hours appreciating the labors of evelyn s shuck burgh of emmannel college cambridge who not only translated but arranged and indexed the entire correspondence in chronological order in the letters of cicero london george bell and sons what of titus annius milo and his fate did even his old champion cicero mourn him perhaps not consider that titus annius may have added the milo to his name because he wished to equate himself with the legendary olympic athlete milo of crotona consider that cicero probably felt guilty to the end of his days for botching milos defense at his trial for murdering clodius consider that in the dying republic milo must have become the epitome of the hasbeen who wouldnt stay gone and then read the following rather catty passage by cicero in his treatise on old age written in bc four years after milos death this is michael grants translation from ciceros selected works penguin books a man should use what he has and in all doings accommodate himself to his strength there is a story about milo of crotona in his later years watching the athletes train on the racecourse with tears in his eyes he looked at his own muscles and said a pitiable thing and these are now dead but you are the one who is now dead not they you stupid fellow because your fame never came from yourself it came from brute physical force milo is said to have walked from end to end of the racecourse at olympia with an ox on his back well which would you prefer to be given milos physical vigour or the intellectual might of milos friend pythagoras in short enjoy the blessing of strength while you have it and have no regrets when it has gone nature has one path only and you cannot travel along it more than once was this ciceros way of declaring to the world that his milo had no one to blame but himself what of the women of rome who populate these pages terentia tullia fabia fulvia sempronia antonia cytheris fausta clodia and calpurnia all existed gordianus has encountered some of them previously in the roma sub rosa seriesclodia in the venus throw and a murder on the appian way fulvia sempronia and fausta in a murder on the appian way and fabia in the eponymous short story in the house of the vestals terentias marriage to cicero ended when he divorced her and married a much younger woman probably late in bc at about the same time tullia and dolabella also divorced tullias death the next year caused her father much grief but according to pliny terentia went on to reach the remarkable age of probably fulvia made the greatest impact on history especially after her marriage to marc antony in bc following antonys divorce from antonia antony even gave up cytheris for her but neither fulvia nor any of these other women speaks to us across the ages in her own voice we have letters written by pompey and antony and caelius we have whole books by caesar and cicero but for these women we have only secondhand sources and mostly hostile sources at that unable to account for fulvias ruthlessness and ambition velleius paterculus called her a woman only on account of her gender as remarkable as these women must have been no ancient historian saw fit to leave us a biography of any of them to write the life story of a woman was beyond plutarchs imagination the reader who wishes to know more about them will find only scattered crumbs not the rich banquet afforded to anyone with an appetite for pompey caesar or any number of other men of antiquity for the modern historian working from such sources the task of bringing these women to life is problematic to the point of being insurmountable so it seems fitting
