ian rankin knots and crosses to miranda without whom nothing is worth finishing introduction the nineteenth of march was a big day for me i was a postgraduate student at the university of edinburgh studying the novels of muriel spark my thesis however was proving less important to me than my own writing id started with poetry then found some minor success with short stories a first novel had failed to find a publisher but my second attempt had just been given the thumbsup by a small edinburghbased outfit called polygon that novel was titled the flood and on march i went to the polygon offices to sign my first ever book contract i recorded the event in my diary where however it was reduced to second billing after the following its happened an idea for a novel crime thriller which started as one situation and has blossomed into a whole plot ive not written any of it yet but its all there in my head from page one to circa page by march i was working on this new story and two days later recorded that it needs a working title im going to give it knots amp crosses i certainly remember sitting in a chair in my bedsit directly in front of the gas fire and toying with the pun of noughtsknots and crosses rebus it seems to me now entered as a fully formed character complete with estranged wife young daughter and fragile sanity when i started writing i did so on an electric typewriter at the table by the window i stared from that window at the tenement opposite and decided that rebus would live there directly across from my own digs at arden street marchmont edinburgh by late october i had finished the second draft of the book two hundred and ten pages of sixty per cent satisfactory prose i had an agent by this time and she suggested some changes the most substantial of which involved cutting a large part of the central flashback section this i did making the book leaner but no less potent knots amp crosses is a pretty nasty book dealing as it does with a serial killer who preys on children im fairly sure i meant it to be a contemporary reworking of dr jekyll and mr hyde having studied stevensons masterpiece as part of my thesis i was intrigued that he chose to set the story in london yet it remains a very scottish novel based as it is at least partially on the reallife edinburgh character deacon william brodie who was gentleman by day criminal by night at the time i had no interest in reading detective fiction and no knowledge of police procedure i also had no notion that knots would be the first book of a series this led me blithely to give rebus a complex personal history and a name which was one of many injokes in the book a rebus being a pictorial puzzle in fact rereading the book now i find myself blushing at the number of literary puns and references including nods to spark mailer anthony burgess and thomas pynchon rebus himself is too wellread quoting from shakespeare and passionate about dostoevsky he thinks like the studentnovelist who created him rather than as a real cop the sky is described as being dark as wagnerian opera while the phrase the manumission of dreams sent me in to a dictionary im guessing it was a word id only just learned in and i was keen to show it off i was a young man in love with language striving for a voice and sometimes overreaching the story is set in at that time most of the shops on princes street closed on a sunday there was an abc cinema now an odeon on lothian road and a mr bonis icecream parlour now defunct at tollcross people used telex machines but no one had a mobile phone and when rebus sought out a bar he tended to choose one with larger quartergill measures since replaced by their metric equivalent already knots amp crosses feels like a historical document written in and about an edinburgh that no longer exists as for the books hero well hes changed in time as well in this his first outing he listens to jazz mainly using a nakamichi cassette deck probably the same one my girlfriend miranda had bought for me later on i would switch his preference to rock music and though ive never really described him physically in any of the novels here we learn that he has brown hair and green eyes same as me hes also meant to be a possible suspect which is why i make him so troubled suffering weird flashbacks and with a spare bedroom in his flat thats kept permanently locked some of the secondary characters in knots would become useful to me in future books the journalist jim stevens would play a role in a nonrebus novel watchman before reappearing in the series rebuss brother would return as would his fellow detective jack morton and gill templer is still around her relationship with rebus coloured even after all these years by the events of this first novel in later books of course i take rebus into real police stations and real pubs but the edinburgh of knots is altogether more fictive rebuss police station is sited on a nonexistent street and bars such as the sutherland remain figments of my imagination one other thing about rebus he dies at the end not in the final draft obviously but that was my original plan if id stuck to it i dont know what id be doing now the book climaxes in some tunnels beneath the central library on george iv bridge there may or may not be tunnels there however beneath the national library right across the street from the central there are certainly tunnels i know because we postgraduate students were given a tour of them and as muriel spark says nothing is ever lost to an author since i had no idea how the police went about investigating a murder i did what any good research student would have done wrote to the chief constable he took pity on me and directed me to leith police station where two wary detectives answered my questions and added my name to their database just in case i had some darker ulterior motive in my duffel coat and doc marten boots a dr who scarf wrapped around me i probably wasnt their idea of a novelist sometimes even now i look in the mirror and am forced to agree knots was finally published in london by the bodley head now also defunct on march exactly two years to the day since id had the initial idea the cover was a drawing of a game of noughts and crosses played with knotted pieces of twine and crosses made from matchsticks as for the author photo the less said the better by this time i was married living in london and working at middlesex polytechnic i went into work as usual and saw no reviews of the book in any of the days newspapers fortyeight hours later i headed to edinburgh to spend some weeks at a writers retreat there seemed no great fuss about the book sales would continue to be poor with few reviews i said as much in my diary knots has had less publicity than flood so much for my fledgling career as a crime writer i was by this time working on a londonbased spy novel called watchman and had plans to be the next le carre rebus was history as far as i was concerned but that would change april prologue the girl screamed once only the once even that however was a minor slip on his part that might have been the end of everything almost before it had begun neighbours inquisitive the police called in to investigate no that would not do at all next time he would tie the gag a little tighter just a little tighter just that little bit more secure afterwards he went to the drawer and took from it a ball of string he used a pair of sharp nailscissors the kind girls always seem to use to snip off a length of about six inches then he put the ball of string and the scissors back into the drawer a car revved up outside and he went to the window upsetting a pile of books on the floor as he did so the car however had vanished and he smiled to himself he tied a knot in the string not any special kind of knot just a knot there was an envelope lying ready on the sideboard it was th april wet naturally the grass percolating water as john rebus walked to the grave of his father dead five years to the day he placed a wreath so that it lay yellow and red the colours of remembrance against the still shining marble he paused for a moment trying to think of things to say but there seemed nothing to say nothing to think he had been a good enough father and that was that the old man wouldnt have wanted him to waste his words in any case so he stood there hands respectfully behind his back crows laughing on the walls around him until the water seeping into his shoes told him that there was a warm car waiting for him at the cemetery gates he drove quietly hating to be back here in fife back where the old days had never been good old days where ghosts rustled in the shells of empty houses and the shutters went up every evening on a handful of desultory shops those metal shutters that gave the vandals somewhere to write their names how rebus hated it all this singular lack of an environment it stank the way it had always done of misuse of disuse of the sheer wastage of life he drove the eight miles towards the open sea to where his brother michael still lived the rain eased off as he approached the skullgrey coast the car throwing up splashings of water from a thousand crevasses in the road why was it he wondered that they never seemed to fix the roads here while in edinburgh they worked on the surfaces so often that things were made even worse and why above all had he made the maniacal decision to come all the way through to fife just because it was the anniversary of the old mans death he tried to focus his mind on something else and found himself fantasising about his next cigarette through the rain falling as drizzle now rebus saw a girl about his daughters age walking along the grass verge he slowed the car examined her in his mirror as he passed her and stopped he motioned for her to come to his window her short breaths were visible in the cool still air and her dark hair fell in ratstails down her forehead she looked at him apprehensively where are you going love kirkcaldy do you want a lift she shook her head drops of water flying from her coiled hair my mum said i should never accept lifts from strangers well said rebus smiling your mum is quite right ive got a daughter about your age and i tell her the same thing but it is raining and i am a policeman so you can trust me youve still got a fair way to go you know she looked up and down the silent road then shook her head again okay said rebus but take care your mum was quite right he wound his window up again and drove off watching her in his mirror as she watched him clever kid it was good to know that parents still had a little sense of responsibility left if only the same could be said of his exwife the way she had brought up their daughter was a disgrace michael too had given his daughter too long a leash who was to blame rebuss brother owned a respectable house he had followed in the old mans footsteps and become a stage hypnotist he seemed to be quite good at it too from all accounts rebus had never asked michael how it was done just as he had never shown any interest or curiosity in the old mans act he had observed that this still puzzled michael who would drop hints and red herrings as to the authenticity of his own stage act for him to chase up if he so wished but then john rebus had too many things to chase up and that had been the position during all of his fifteen years on the force fifteen years and all he had to show were an amount of selfpity and a busted marriage with an innocent daughter hanging between them it was more disgusting than sad and meantime michael was happily married with two kids and a larger house than rebus could ever afford he headlined at hotels clubs and even theatres as far away as newcastle and wick occasionally he would make sixhundred quid from a single show outrageous he drove an expensive car wore good clothes and would never have been caught dead standing in the pissing rain in a graveyard in fife on the dullest april day for many a year no michael was too clever for that and too stupid john christ whats up i mean its great to see you why didnt you phone to warn me you were coming come on inside it was the welcome rebus had expected embarrassed surprise as though it were painful to be reminded that one still had some family left alive and rebus had noted the use of the word warn where tell would have sufficed he was a policeman he noticed such things michael rebus bounded through to the livingroom and turned down the wailing stereo come on in john he called do you want a drink coffee perhaps or something stronger what brings you here rebus sat down as though he were in a strangers house his back straight and professional he examined the panelled walls of the room a new feature and the framed photographs of his niece and nephew i was just in the neighbourhood he said michael turning from the drinks cabinet with the glasses ready suddenly remembered or did a good impersonation of just having remembered oh john i forgot all about it why didnt you tell me shit i hate forgetting about dad just as well youre a hypnotist then and not mickey the memory man isnt it give me that drink or are you two getting engaged michael smiling absolved handed over the glass of whisky is that your car outside asked rebus taking the glass i mean the big bmw michael still smiling nodded christ said rebus you treat yourself well as well as i treat chrissie and the kids were building an extension onto the back of the house somewhere to put a jacuzzi or a sauna theyre the in thing just now and chrissies desperate to keep ahead of the field rebus took a swallow of whisky it turned out to be a malt nothing in the room was cheap but none of it was exactly desirable either glass ornaments a crystal decanter on a silver salver the tv and video the inscrutably miniature hifi system the onyx lamp rebus felt a little guilty about that lamp rhona and he had given it to michael and chrissie as a wedding present chrissie no longer spoke to him who could blame her where is chrissie by the way oh shes out doing some shopping she has her own car now the kids will still be at school shell pick them up on the way home are you staying for something to eat rebus shrugged his shoulders youd be welcome to stay said michael meaning that rebus wouldnt so hows the copshop still muddling along we lose a few but they dont get the publicity we catch a few and they do its the same as always i suppose the room rebus was noticing smelled of toffeeapples of penny arcades michael was speaking this is a terrible business about those girls being kidnapped rebus nodded yes he said yes it is but we cant strictly call it kidnapping not yet there hasnt been a demand note or anything its more likely to be a straightforward case of sexual assault michael started up from his chair straightforward whats straightforward about that its just the terminology we use mickey thats all rebus shrugged again and finished his drink well john said michael sitting i mean weve both got daughters too youre so casual about the whole thing i mean its frightening to think of it he shook his head slowly in the worldwide expression of shared grief and relief too that the horror was someone elses for the moment its frightening he repeated and in edinburgh of all places i mean you never think of that sort of thing happening in edinburgh do you theres more happening in edinburgh than anyone knows yes michael paused i was across there just last week playing at one of the hotels you didnt tell me it was michaels turn to shrug his shoulders would you have been interested he said maybe not said rebus smiling but i would have come along anyway michael laughed it was the laughter of birthdays of money found in an old pocket another whisky sir he said i thought you were never going to ask rebus returned to his study of the room while michael went to the cabinet hows the act going he asked and i really am interested its going fine said michael in fact its going very well indeed theres talk of a television spot but ill believe that when i see it great another drink reached rebuss willing hand yes and im working on a new slot its a bit scary though an inch of gold flashed on michaels wrist as he tipped the glass to his lips the watch was expensive it had no numbers on its face it seemed to rebus that the more expensive something was the less of it there always seemed to be tiny little hifi systems watches without numbers the translucent dior anklesocks on michaels feet tell me about it he said taking his brothers bait well said michael sitting forward in his chair i take members of the audience back into their past lives past lives rebus was staring at the floor as if admiring the design of the dark and light green carpet yes michael continued reincarnation born again that sort of thing well i shouldnt have to spell it out to you john after all youre the christian christians dont believe in past lives mickey only future ones michael stared at rebus demanding silence sorry said rebus as i was saying i tried the act out in public for the first time last week though ive been practising it for a while with my private consultees private consultees yes they pay me money for private hypnotherapy i stop them smoking or make them more confident or stop them from wetting the bed some are convinced that they have past lives and they ask me to put them under so that they can prove it dont worry though financially its all above board the taxman gets his cut and do you prove it do they have past lives michael rubbed a finger around the rim of his glass now empty youd be surprised he said give me an example rebus was following the lines of the carpet with his eyes past lives he thought to himself now there was a thing there was plenty of life in his past well said michael remember i told you about my show in edinburgh last week well he leaned further forward in his chair i got this woman up from the audience she was a small woman middleaged shed come in with an officeparty she went under pretty easily probably because she hadnt been drinking as heavily as her friends once she was under i told her that we were going to take a trip into her past way way back before she was born i told her to think back to the earliest memory she had michaels voice had taken on a professional but easy mellifluence he spread his hands before him as if playing to an audience rebus nursing his glass felt himself relax a little he thought back to a childhood episode a game of football one brother pitted against the other the warm mud of a july shower and their mother her sleeves rolled up stripping them both and putting them giggling knots of arms and legs into the bath well michael was saying she started to speak and in a voice not quite her own it was weird john i wish you had been there to see it the audience were silent and i was feeling all cold and then hot and then cold again and it had nothing to do with the hotels heatingsystem by the way id done it you see id taken that woman into a past life she was a nun do you believe that a nun and she said that she was alone in her cell she described the convent and everything and then she started to recite something in latin and some people in the audience actually crossed themselves i was bloody well petrified my hair was probably standing on end i brought her out of it as quickly as i could and there was a long pause before the crowd started to applaud then maybe out of sheer relief her friends started to cheer and laugh and that broke the ice at the end of the show i found out that this woman was a staunch protestant a rangers supporter no less and she swore blind that she knew no latin at all well somebody inside her did ill tell you that rebus was smiling its a nice story mickey he said its the truth michael opened his arms wide in supplication dont you believe me maybe michael shook his head you must make a pretty bad copper john i had around a hundred and fifty witnesses ironclad rebus could not pull his attention away from the design in the carpet plenty of people believe in past lives john past lives yes he believed in some things in god certainly but past lives without warning a face screamed up at him from the carpet trapped in its cell he dropped his glass john is anything wrong christ you look as if youve seen no no nothings the matter rebus retrieved the glass and stood up i just im fine its just that he checked his watch a watch with numbers well id better be going im on duty this evening michael was smiling weakly glad that his brother was not going to stay but embarrassed at his relief well have to meet again soon he said on neutral territory yes said rebus tasting once again the tang of toffeeapples he felt a little pale a little shaky as though he were too far out of his territory lets do that once or twice or three times a year at weddings funerals or over the telephone at christmas they promised themselves this gettogether the mere promise now was a ritual in itself and so could be safely proffered and just as safely ignored lets do that rebus shook hands with michael at the door escaping past the bmw to his own car he wondered how alike they were his brother and him uncles and aunts in their funeralcold rooms occasionally commented ah youre both the spitting image of your mother that was as far as it went john rebus knew that his own hair was a shade of brown lighter than michaels and that his eyes were a shade of green darker he knew also however that the differences between them were such that any similarities were made to look unutterably superficial they were brothers without any sense of brotherhood brotherhood belonged to the past he waved once from the car and was gone he would be back in edinburgh within the hour and on duty another halfhour after that he knew that the reason he could never feel comfortable in michaels house was chrissies hatred of him her unshakeable belief that he alone had been responsible for the breakup of his marriage maybe she was right at that he tried ticking off in his mind the definite chores of the next seven or eight hours he had to tidy up a case of burglary and serious assault a nasty one that the cid was undermanned as it was and now these abductions would stretch them even more those two young girls girls his own daughters age it was best not to think about it by now they would be dead or would wish that they were dead god have mercy on them in edinburgh of all places in his own dear city a maniac was on the loose people were staying in their homes and a screaming in his memory rebus shrugged feeling a slight sensation of attrition in one of his shoulders it was not his business after all not yet back in his livingroom michael rebus poured himself another whisky he went to the stereo and turned it all the way up then reached underneath his chair and after a little fumbling pulled out an ashtray that was hidden there part one there are clues everywhere on the steps of the great london road police station in edinburgh john rebus lit his last legitimate cigarette of the day before pushing open the imposing door and stepping inside the station was old its floor dark and marbled it had about it the fading grandeur of a dead aristocracy it had character rebus waved to the duty sergeant who was tearing old pictures from the noticeboard and pinning up new ones in their place he climbed the great curving staircase to his office campbell was just leaving hello john mcgregor campbell a detective sergeant like rebus was donning coat and hat whats the word mac is it going to be a busy night rebus began checking the messages on his desk i dont know about that john but i can tell you that its been pandemonium in here today theres a letter there for you from the man himself oh yes rebus seemed preoccupied with another letter which he had just opened yes john brace yourself i think youre going to be transferred to that abduction case good luck to you well im off to the pub i want to catch the boxing on the bbc i should be in time campbell checked his watch yes plenty of time is anything wrong john rebus waved the now empty envelope at him who brought this in mac i havent the faintest john what is it another crank letter oh yes campbell sidled over to rebuss shoulder he examined the typed note looks like the same bloke doesnt it clever of you to notice that mac seeing as its the exact same message what about the string oh its here too rebus lifted a small piece of string from his desk there was a simple knot tied in its middle queer bloody business campbell walked to the doorway see you tomorrow john yes yes see you mac rebus paused until his friend had made his exit oh mac campbell came back into the doorway yes maxwell won the big fight said rebus smiling god youre a bastard rebus gritting his teeth campbell stalked out of the station one of the old school rebus said to himself now what possible enemies could i have he studied the letter again then checked the envelope it was blank save for his own name unevenly typed the note had been handed in just like the other one it was a queer bloody business right enough he walked back downstairs and headed for the desk jimmy yes john have you seen this he showed the envelope to the desk sergeant that the sergeant wrinkled not only his brow but it seemed to rebus his whole face only forty years in the force could do that to a man forty years of questions and puzzles and crosses to bear it must have been put through the door john i found it myself on the floor just there he pointed vaguely in the direction of the stations front door is anything up oh no its nothing really thanks jimmy but rebus knew that he would be niggled all night by the arrival of this note only days after he had received the first anonymous message he studied the two letters at his desk the work of an old typewriter probably portable the letter s about a millimetre higher than the other letters the paper cheap no watermark the piece of string tied in the middle cut with a sharp knife or scissors the message the same typewritten message there are clues everywhere fair enough perhaps there were it was the work of a crank a kind of practical joke but why him it made no sense then the phone rang detective sergeant rebus speaking rebus its chief inspector anderson here have you received my note anderson bloody anderson that was all he needed from one crank to another yes sir said rebus holding the receiver under his chin and tearing open the letter on his desk good can you be here in twenty minutes the briefing will be in the waverley road incident room ill be there sir the phone went dead on rebus as he read it was true then it was official he was being transferred to the abduction case god what a life he pushed the messages envelopes and string into his jacket pocket looking around the office in frustration who was kidding who it would take an act of god to get him to waverley road inside of half an hour and when was he supposed to get round to finishing all his work he had three cases coming to court and another dozen or so crying out for some paperwork before his memory of them faded entirely that would be nice actually nice to just erase the lot of them wipeout he closed his eyes he opened them again the paperwork was still there large as life useless always incomplete no sooner had he finished with a case than another two or three appeared in its place what was the name of that creature the hydra was it that was what he was fighting every time he cut off a head more popped into his intray coming back from a holiday was a nightmare and now they were giving him rocks to push up hills as well he looked to the ceiling with gods grace he whispered then he headed out to his car the sutherland bar was a popular wateringhole it contained no jukebox no video machines no bandits the decor was spartan and the tv usually flickered and jumped ladies had not been welcome until well into the s there had it seemed been something to hide the best pint of draught beer in edinburgh mcgregor campbell supped from his heavy glass his eyes intent on the television set above the bar who wins asked a voice beside him i dont know he said turning to the voice oh hello jim a stocky man was sitting beside him money in hand waiting to be served his eyes too were on the tv looks like a cracker of a fight he said i fancy mailer to win mac campbell had an idea no i reckon maxwell will walk it win by a mile fancy a bet the stocky man fished into his pocket for his cigarettes eyeing the policeman how much he asked a fiver said campbell youre on tom give me a pint over here please do you want one yourself mac same again thanks they sat in silence for a while supping the beer and watching the fight a few muffled roars went up occasionally from behind them as a punch landed or was dodged its looking good for your man if it goes the distance said campbell ordering more drinks aye but lets wait and see eh hows work by the way fine hows yours a pure bloody slog at the moment if you must ask some ash dropped onto his tie as he talked the cigarette never leaving his mouth though it wobbled precariously from time to time a pure slog are you still chasing up that drugs story not really ive landed on this kidnapping thing oh so has rebus youd better not get into his hair newspapermen get in everybodys hair mac it goes with the etcetera mac campbell though wary of jim stevens was grateful for a friendship however tenuous and strained it had sometimes been which had given him some information useful to his career stevens kept much of the juiciest tidbits to himself of course thats what exclusives were made of but he was always willing to trade and it seemed to campbell that the most innocuous pieces of gossip and information often seemed adequate for stevens needs he was a kind of magpie collecting everything without prejudice storing much more of it than surely he would ever use but with reporters you never could tell certainly campbell was happier with stevens as a friend than as an enemy so whats happening about your drugs dossier jim stevens shrugged his creased shoulders theres nothing in there just now that could be of much use to you boys anyway im not about to let the whole thing drop though if thats what you mean no thats too big a nest of vipers to be allowed to go free ill still be keeping my eyes open a bell rang for the last round of the fight two sweating dogtired bodies converged on one another becoming a single knot of limbs still looks good for mailer said campbell an uneasy feeling coming over him it couldnt be true rebus wouldnt have done that to him suddenly maxwell the heavier and slowermoving of the two fighters was hit by a blow to the face and staggered back the bar erupted sensing blood and victory campbell stared into his glass maxwell was taking a standing count it was all over a sensation in the final seconds of the contest according to the commentator jim stevens held out his hand ill kill bloody rebus thought campbell so help me ill kill him later over drinks bought with campbells money jim stevens asked about rebus so it looks as if ill be meeting him at last maybe maybe not hes not exactly friendly with anderson so he may well get the shitty end of the stick sitting at a desk all day but then john rebus isnt exactly friendly with anybody oh ach hes not that bad i suppose but hes not the easiest of men to like campbell ducking from his friends interrogative eyes studied the reporters tie the recent layer of cigaretteash had merely formed a veil over much older stains egg perhaps fat alcohol the scruffiest reporters were always the sharp ones and stevens was sharp as sharp as ten years on the local newspaper could make a man it was said that he had turned down jobs with london papers just because he liked to live in edinburgh and what he liked best about his job was the opportunity it gave him to uncover the citys murkier depths the crime the corruption the gangs and the drugs he was a better detective than anyone campbell knew and because of that very fact perhaps the highups in the police both disliked and distrusted him that seemed proof enough that he was doing his job well campbell watched as a little beer escaped from stevens glass and dripped onto his trousers this rebus said stevens wiping his mouth hes the brother of the hypnotist isnt he must be ive never asked him but there cant be too many people about with a name like that can there thats what i was thinking he nodded to himself as though confirming something of great importance so what oh nothing just something and hes not a popular man you say i didnt say that exactly i feel sorry for him really the poor bugger has a lot on his plate hes even started getting crank letters crank letters smoke enveloped stevens for a moment as he puffed on another cigarette between the two men lay a thin blue pubhaze i shouldnt have told you that that was strictly off the record stevens nodded absolutely no its just that i was interested that sort of thing does happen though doesnt it not often and not nearly as queer as the ones hes getting i mean theyre not abusive or anything theyre just queer go on how so well theres a bit of string in each one tied into a knot and theres a message that reads something like clues are everywhere bloody hell that is strange theyre a strange family one a bloody hypnotist and the other getting anonymous notes he was in the army wasnt he john was yes how did you know i know everything mac thats the job another funny thing is that he wont speak about it the reporter looked interested again when he was interested in something his shoulders shivered slightly he stared at the television wont speak about the army not a word ive asked him about it a couple of times like i said mac its a funny family that one drink up ive got lots of your money left to spend youre a bastard jim born and bred said the reporter smiling for only the second time that evening gentlemen and of course ladies thank you for being so quick to gather here this will remain the centre of operations during the inquiry now as you all know detective chief superintendent wallace froze in midspeech as the inquiry room door pushed itself open abruptly and john rebus all eyes turned towards him entered the room he looked about in embarrassment smiled a hopeful but wasted apology towards the senior officer and sat himself down on a chair nearest to the door as i was saying continued the superintendent rebus rubbing at his forehead studied the roomful of officers he knew what the old boy would be saying and right now the last thing he needed was a peptalk of the old school the room was packed many of them looked tired as if theyd been on the case for a while the fresher more attentive faces belonged to the new boys some of them brought in from stations outwith the city two or three had notebooks and pencils at the ready almost as if they were back in the school classroom and at the front of the group legs crossed sat two women peering up at wallace who was in full flight now parading before the blackboard like some shakespearean hero in a bad school play two deaths then yes deaths im afraid the room shivered expectantly the body of sandra adams aged eleven was found on a piece of waste ground adjacent to haymarket station at six oclock this evening and that of mary andrews at sixfifty on an allotment in the oxgangs district there are officers at both locations and at the end of this briefing more of you will be selected to join them rebus was noticing that the usual peckingorder was in play inspectors near the front of the room sergeants and the rest to the back even in the midst of murder there is a peckingorder the british disease and he was at the bottom of the pile because he had arrived late another black mark against him on someones mental sheet he had always been one of the top men while he had been in the army he had been a para he had trained for the sas and come out top of his class he had been chosen for a crack special assignments group he had his medal and his commendations it had been a good time and yet it had been the worst of times too a time of stress and deprivation of deceit and brutality and when he had left the police had been reluctant to take him he understood now that it was something to do with the pressure applied by the army to get him the job that he wanted some people resented that and they had thrown down banana skins ever since for him to slide on but he had sidestepped their traps had performed the job and had grudgingly been given his commendations here also but there was precious little promotion and that had caused him to say a few things out of line a few things that were always to be held against him and then he had cuffed an unruly bastard one night in the cells god forgive him he had simply lost his head for a minute there had been more trouble over that ah but it was not a nice world this not a nice world at all it was an old testament land that he found himself in a land of barbarity and retribution we will of course have more information for you to work on come tomorrow after the postmortems but for the moment i think that will do im going to hand you over to chief inspector anderson who will assign you to your tasks for the present rebus noticed that jack morton had nodded off in the corner and if left unattended would begin snoring soon rebus smiled but the smile was shortlived killed by a voice at the front of the room the voice of anderson this was all rebus needed anderson the man at the centre of his outofline remarks it felt for one sickening moment like predestination anderson was in charge anderson was doling out their tasks rebus reminded himself to stop praying perhaps if he stopped praying god would take the hint and stop being such a bastard to one of his few believers on this neargodforsaken planet gemmill and hartley will be assigned to doortodoor well thank god hed not been landed with that one there was only one thing worse than doortodoor and for an initial check on the mo files detective sergeants morton and rebus and that was it thank you god oh thank you thats just what i wanted to do with my evening read through the case histories of all the bloody perverts and sexoffenders in east central scotland you must really hate my guts am i job or something is that it but there was no ethereal voice to be heard no voice at all save that of the satanic leering anderson whose fingers slowly turned the pages of the roster his lips moist and full his wife a known adulteress and his son of all things an itinerant poet rebus heaped curse after curse upon the shoulders of that priggish stickthin superior officer then kicked jack mortons leg and brought him snorting and chaffing into consciousness one of those nights one of those nights said jack morton he sucked luxuriously on his short tipped cigarette coughed loudly brought his handkerchief from his pocket and deposited something into it from his mouth he studied the contents of the handkerchief ah ha some vital new evidence he said all the same he looked rather worried rebus smiled time to stop smoking jack he said they were seated together at a desk upon which were piled about a hundred and fifty files on known sexoffenders in central scotland a smart young secretary doubtless relishing the overtime that came with a murder inquiry kept bringing more files into the office and rebus stared at her in mock outrage every time she entered he was hoping to scare her away and if she came back again the outrage would become real no john its these tipped bastards i cant take to them really i cant sod that bloody doctor so saying morton took the cigarette from his lips broke off the filter and replaced the cigarette now ridiculously short between thin bloodless lips thats better thats more like a fag rebus had always found two things remarkable one was that he liked and in return was liked by jack morton the other was that morton could pull so hard on a cigarette and yet release so little smoke where did all that smoke go he could not figure it out i see youre abstaining this evening john limiting myself to ten a day jack morton shook his head ten twenty thirty a day take it from me john it makes no difference in the end what it comes down to is this you either stop or you dont and if you cant stop then youre as well smoking as many as you like thats been proven i read about it in a magazine aye but we all know the magazines you read jack morton chuckled gave another tremendous cough and searched for his handkerchief what a bloody job said rebus picking up the first of the files the two men sat in silence for twenty minutes flicking through the facts and fantasies of rapists exhibitionists pederasts paedophiles and procurers rebus felt his mouth filling with silt it was as if he saw himself there time after time after time the self that lurked behind his everyday consciousness his mister hyde by robert louis stevenson edinburghborn he felt ashamed of his occasional erection doubtless jack morton had one too it came with the territory as did the revulsion the loathing and the fascination around them the station whirled in the business of the night men in shirtsleeves walked purposefully past their open door the door of their assigned office cut off from everyone else so that no one would be contaminated by their thoughts rebus paused for a moment to reflect that his own office back in great london road was in need of much of this equipment the modern desk unwobbly with drawers that could be opened easily the filingcabinets ditto the drinksdispenser just outside there were carpets even rather than his own liverred linoleum with its curled dangerous edges it was a very palatable environment this in which to track down the odd pervert or killer what exactly are we looking for jack morton snorted threw down a slender brown file looked at rebus shrugged his shoulders and lit a cigarette garbage he said picking up another folder and whether or not it was meant as an answer rebus was never to know detective sergeant rebus a young constable acne on his throat cleanlyshaven stood at the open door yes message from the chief sir he handed rebus a folded piece of blue notepaper good news asked morton oh the best news jack the very best news our boss sends us the following fraternal message any leads from the files end of message will there be any reply sir asked the constable rebus crumpled the note and tossed it into a new aluminium bin yes son there will be he said but i very much doubt whether youd want to deliver it jack morton wiping ash from his tie laughed it was one of those nights jim stevens walking home at long last had not found anything interesting since his conversation with mac campbell all of four hours ago he had told mac then that he was not about to drop his own investigation into edinburghs burgeoning drugs racket and that had been the whole truth it was becoming a private obsession and though his boss might move him on to a murder case still he would follow up his old investigation in his free spare and private time time found late at night when the presses were rolling time spent in lower and lower dives further and further out of town for he was close he knew to a big fish and yet not close enough to be able to enlist the help of the forces of law and order he wanted the story to be watertight before he called for the cavalry he knew the dangers too the ground he walked upon was always likely to fall away beneath his feet letting him slip into leith docks of a dark and silent morning finding him trussed and gagged in some motorway ditch outside perth he didnt mind all that it was no more than a passing thought brought on by tiredness and a need to lift his emotions out of the rather tawdry unglamorous world of edinburghs dope scene a scene carried out in the sprawling housingschemes and afterhours drinking holes more than in the glittery discotheques and chintzy rooms of the new town what he disliked really disliked was that the people ultimately behind it all were so silent and so secretive and so alien to it all he liked his criminals to be involved to live the life and stick close to the lifestyle he liked the glasgow gangsters of the s and s who lived in the gorbals and operated from the gorbals and loaned illicit money to neighbours and who would slash those same neighbours eventually when the need arose it was like a family affair not like this not at all like this this was other and he hated it for that reason his talk with campbell had been interesting though interesting for other reasons rebus sounded a fishy character so was his brother they might be in it together if the police were involved in all of this then his task would be all the harder and all the more satisfying for that now what he needed was a break a nice break in the investigation it couldnt be far off he was supposed to have a nose for that sort of thing at onethirty they took a break there was a small canteen in the building open even at this ungodly hour outside the majority of the days petty crime was being committed but inside it was warm and cosy and there was hot food to be had and endless cups of coffee for the vigilant policemen this is a complete shambles said morton pouring coffee back from his saucer into the cup anderson hasnt a clue what hes up to give me a cigarette will you im out rebus patted his pockets convincingly christ john said morton wheezing an old mans cough and passing across the cigarettes the day you give up smoking is the day i change my underwear jack morton was not an old man despite the excesses that were leading him quickly and inexorably towards that early fate he was thirtyfive six years younger than rebus he too had a broken marriage behind him the four children now resident with their grandmother while their mother was off on a suspiciously long vacation with her present lover misery he had told rebus surrounded the whole bloody setup and rebus had agreed with him having a daughter who troubled his own conscience morton had been a policeman for two decades and unlike rebus had started at the extreme bottom of the heap pulling himself up to his present rank through sheer hard slog alone he had given rebus his life story when the two of them had gone off for a days flyfishing near berwick it had been a glorious day both of them landing fine catches and over the course of the day they had become friends rebus however had not deigned to tell his own life story to morton it felt to jack morton as if the man were in a little prisoncell of his own construction he seemed especially tightlipped about his years in the army morton knew that the army could occasionally do that to a man and he respected rebuss silence perhaps there were a few skeletons in that particular closet he knew all about those himself some of his most noteworthy arrests had not exactly been conducted along correct procedural lines nowadays morton did not concern himself with headlines and highprofile arrests he got on with the job collected his salary thought now and then of his pension and the fishingyears to come and drank his wife and children out of his conscience this is a nice canteen said rebus smoking struggling to start a conversation yes it is im in here now and again i know one of the guys who work in the computer room comes in handy you know having one of those terminaloperators in your pocket they can track down a car a name an address quicker than you can blink it only costs the occasional drink get them to sort out this lot of ours then give them time john then all the files will be on computer and a little while after that theyll find that they dont need the workhorses like us any more therell just be a couple of dis and a desk console ill bear that in mind said rebus its progress john where would we be without it wed still be out there with our pipes and our guesswork and our magnifying glasses i suppose youre right jack but remember what the super says give me a dozen good men every time and send your machines back to their makers rebus looked around him as he spoke he saw that one of the two women from the briefing room had settled at a table by herself and besides said rebus therell always be a place for people like us jack society couldnt do without us computers can never have inspired guesses thats where weve got them beat hands down maybe i dont know still we better be getting back eh morton looked at his watch drained his cup and pushed back his chair you go on ahead jack ill be with you in a minute i want to check out an inspired guess mind if i join you rebus a fresh cup of coffee in his hand pulled out the chair from opposite the woman officer who had her head buried in the days newspaper he noted the garish headline on the front page someone had slipped out a little information to the local media not at all she said not looking up rebus smiled to himself and sat down he began to sip the powdery instant murk busy he asked yes shouldnt you be your friend left a few minutes ago sharp then very sharp very very sharp indeed rebus began to feel a mite uneasy he disliked ballcrushers and here were all the outward signs of one yes he did didnt he but then hes a glutton for punishment were working on the modus operandi files id do anything to defer that particular pleasure she looked up at last bitten by the potential insult thats what i am is it a delaying tactic rebus smiled and shrugged what else he said it was her turn to smile now she closed the paper and folded it twice placing it before her on the formicatopped table she tapped the headline looks like were in the news she said rebus turned the paper towards him edinburgh abductions now its murder a terrible bloody case he offered just terrible and the newspapers dont make it any better yes well well have the pm results in a couple of hours and then we just might have something to go on i hope so just so long as i can put away those bloody files i thought policemen stressing the latter part of the word got their kicks from reading that stuff rebus spread his hands before him a gesture he seemed to have picked up from michael you have us to a t how long have you been in the force rebus took her to be thirty give or take two years she had thick short brown hair and a long straight skislope of a nose there were no rings on her fingers but these days that told him nothing long enough she said i think i knew you would say that she was smiling still no ballcrusher then then youre cleverer than i took you for she said youd be surprised he was growing tired realising that the game was going nowhere it was all midfield a friendly rather than a cuptie he checked his watch conspicuously time i was getting back he said she picked up her newspaper are you doing anything this weekend she asked john rebus sat down again he left the station at four oclock the birds were doing their best to persuade everyone that it was dawn but no one seemed fooled it was dark still and the air was chilled he decided to leave his car and walk home a distance of two miles he needed it needed to feel the cool damp air the expectancy of a morning shower he breathed deep trying to relax to forget but his mind was too full of those files and little pieces of recollected fact and figure pieces of horror no bigger than a paragraph haunted his walk to indecently assault an eightweek old baby girl the babysitter who had calmly admitted to the assault saying that she had done it for a kick to rape a grandmother in front of her two grandchildren then give the kids some sweets from a jar before leaving the act premeditated committed by a bachelor of fifty to burn with cigarettes the name of a street gang onto the breasts of a twelveyear old leaving her for dead in a burning hut never caught and now the crux to abduct two girls and then strangle them without having sexually abused them that anderson had posited only thirty minutes before was a perversion in itself and in a funny way rebus knew what he meant it made the deaths even more arbitrary more pointless and more shocking well at least they were not dealing with a sexoffender not right away which only rebus was forced to agree made their task that much more difficult for now they were confronted with something like a serial killer striking at random and without clues aiming at the record books rather than at any idea of kicks the question now was would he stop at two it seemed unlikely strangulation it was a fearful way to go wrestling kicking your way towards oblivion panic the fretful sucking for air and the killer behind you most likely so that you faced the fear of something totally anonymous a death without knowledge of who or why rebus had been taught methods of killing in the sas he knew what it felt like to have the garotte tighten on your neck trusting to the opponents prevailing sanity a fearful way to go edinburgh slept on as it had slept on for hundreds of years there were ghosts in the cobbled alleys and on the twisting stairways of the old town tenements but they were enlightenment ghosts articulate and deferential they were not about to leap from the darkness with a length of twine ready in their hands rebus paused and looked around him besides it was morning now and any godfearing spirit would be tucked up in bed as he john rebus flesh and blood would be soon near his flat he passed a little grocery shop outside which were stacked crates of milk and morning rolls the owner had complained in private to rebus about petty and occasional thefts but would not submit a complaint proper the shop was as dead as the street the solitude of the moment disturbed only by the distant rumble of a taxi on cobblestones and the persistence of the dawn chorus rebus looked around him examining the many curtained windows then swiftly he tore six rolls from a layer and stuffed them into his pockets walking away a little too briskly a moment later he hesitated then walked on tiptoe back to the shop the criminal returning to the scene of the crime the dog to its vomit rebus had never actually seen dogs doing that but he had it on the authority of saint peter looking round again he lifted a pint of milk out of its crate and made his getaway whistling silently to himself nothing in the world tasted as good for breakfast as stolen rolls with some butter and jam and a mug of milky coffee nothing tasted better than a venial sin he sniffed the stairwell of his tenement catching the faint odour of tomcats a persistent menace he held his breath as he climbed the two flights of stairs fumbling in his pocket beneath the squashed rolls trying to liberate his doorkey the interior of the flat felt damp and smelt damp he checked the central heating and sure enough the pilotlight had gone out again he cursed as he relit it turning the heat up all the way and went through to the livingroom there were still spaces on the bookcase the wallunit the mantelpiece where rhonas ornaments had once stood but many of the gaps had already been filled by new mementoes of his own bills unanswered letters old ringpulls from tins of cheap beer the occasional unread book rebus collected unread books once upon a time he had actually read the books that he bought but these days he seemed to have so little time also he was more discriminating now than he had been then back in the old days when he would read a book to its bitter end whether he liked it or not these days a book he disliked was unlikely to last ten pages of his concentration these were the books that lay around his livingroom his books for reading tended to congregate in the bedroom lying in coordinated rows on the floor like patients in a doctors waitingroom one of these days he would take a holiday would rent a cottage in the highlands or on the fife coast and would take with him all of these waitingtobereadorreread books all of that knowledge that could be his for the breaking open of a cover his favourite book a book he turned to at least once a year was crime and punishment if only he thought modern murderers would exhibit some show of conscience more often but no modern killers bragged of their crimes to their friends then played pool in their local pub chalking their cues with poise and certainty knowing which balls would drop in which order while a policecar slept nearby its occupants unable to do anything save curse the mountains of rules and regulations and rue the deep chasms of crime it was everywhere crime it was the lifeforce and the blood and the balls of life to cheat to edge to take that bodyswerve at authority to kill the higher up you climbed into crime the more subtly you began to move back towards legitimacy until a handful of lawyers only could crack open your system and they were always affordable always on hand to be bribed dostoevsky had known all that clever old bastard he had felt the stick burning from both ends but poor old dostoevsky was dead and had not been invited to a party this weekend while he john rebus had often he declined invitations because to accept meant that he had to dust off his brogues iron a shirt brush down his best suit take a bath and splash on some cologne he had also to be affable to drink and be merry to talk to strangers with whom he had no inclination to talk and with whom he was not being paid to talk in other words he resented having to play the part of a normal human animal but he had accepted the invitation given to him by cathy jackson in the waverley road canteen of course he had and he whistled at the thought of it wandering through to the kitchen to make some breakfast which he then took through to his bedroom this was a ritual after a night duty he stripped climbed into bed balanced the plate of rolls on his chest and held a book to his nose it was not a very good book it was about a kidnapping rhona had taken away the bed proper but had left him the mattress so it was easy for him to reach down for his mug of coffee easy for him to discard one book and find another he fell asleep soon enough the lamp still burning as cars began to pass by his window his alarm did the trick for a change pulling him off the mattress as a magnet attracts filings he had kicked off the duvet and was drenched in sweat he felt suffocated and remembered suddenly that the central heating was still boiling away like a steamship on his way to switching off the thermostat he stooped at the front door to pick up the days mail one of the letters was unstamped and unfranked it bore only his name in typescript across the front rebuss stomach squeezed hard on the paste of rolls and butter he ripped the envelope open pulling out the single sheet of paper for those who read between the times so now the lunatic knew where he lived checking in the envelope laconic now and expecting to find the knotted string he found instead two matchsticks tied together with thread into the shape of a cross part two for those who read between the times organized chaos that summed up the newspaper office organized chaos on the grandest of scales stevens rummaged amongst the sheaf of paper in his tray looking for a needle had he perhaps filed it somewhere else he opened one of the large heavy drawers of his desk then shut it quickly afraid that some of the mess in there might escape controlling himself he took a deep breath and opened it again he plunged a hand into the jumble of paper inside the drawer as if something in there would bite a huge dogclip springing loose from one particular file did bite it nicked his thumb and he slammed the drawer shut the cigarette wobbling in his mouth as he cursed the office the journalistic profession and trees begetters of paper sod it he sat back and squeezed his eyes shut as the smoke began to sting it was eleven in the morning and already the office was a blue haze as though everything were happening on the set of a brigadoon marshscene he grabbed a sheet of typescript turned it over and began to scribble with a nub of pencil which he had lifted from a betting shop x mr big delivers to rebus m how does the policeman fit in answer perhaps everywhere perhaps nowhere he paused taking the cigarette from his mouth replacing it with a fresh one and using the butt to light its successor now anonymous letters threats a code stevens found it unlikely that john rebus could not know about his brothers involvement in the scottish drugpushing world and knowing the chances were that he was involved in it too perhaps leading the whole investigation the wrong way to protect his flesh and blood it would make a cracking good story when it broke but he knew that he would be treading on eggs from here on in no one would go out of their way to help him nail a policeman and if anyone found out what he was up to he would be in very serious trouble indeed he needed to do two things check his life insurance policy and tell nobody about this jim the editor gestured for him to step into the torture chamber he rose from his seat as though tearing himself up from something organic straightened his mauve and pink striped tie and headed towards a presumed bawlingout yes tom arent you supposed to be at a press conference plenty of time tom which photographer are you taking does it matter id be better off taking my bloody instamatic these young boys dont know the ropes tom what about andy fleming cant i have him no chance jim hes covering the royal tour what royal tour tom jameson seemed about to rise again from his chair which would have been an unprecedented move he only straightened his back and shoulders however and eyed his star crime reporter suspiciously you are a journalist jim arent you i mean youve not gone into early retirement or become a recluse no history of senile dementia in the family listen tom when the royal family commits a crime ill be the first on the scene otherwise as far as im concerned they dont exist not outside of my nightmares anyway jameson pointedly examined his wristwatch okay okay im going with that stevens turned on his heels with amazing speed and left the office ignoring the cries of his boss at his back asking which of the available photographers he wanted it wouldnt matter he had yet to meet a policeman who was photogenic then leaving the building he remembered who was liaison officer on this particular case and he changed his mind smiling there are clues everywhere for those who read between the times its pure gobbledygook isnt it john morton was driving the car towards the haymarket district of the city it was another afternoon of consistent winddriven rain the rain itself fine and cold the kind that seeped into bones and marrow the city had been dull all day to a point where motorists were using their headlamps at noon a great day for some outside work im not so sure jack the second part leads on from the first as if there was a logical connection well lets hope he sends you some more notes maybe that would make things clearer maybe id rather hed just stop this shit altogether its not very nice knowing that a crank knows where you work and where you live is your phone number in the telephone book no unlisted that rules out that idea then so how does he know your home address he or she said rebus tucking the notes back into his pocket how should i know he lit two cigarettes and passed one to morton breaking the filter off for him ta said morton placing the tiny cigarette in the corner of his mouth the rain was easing floods in glasgow he said expecting no reply both men were blearyeyed from lack of sleep but the case had taken possession of them so they drove minds numbed towards the bleak heart of the inquiry a portakabin had been set up on waste ground next to the spot where the girls body had been found from there a doortodoor operation was being coordinated friends and family were also to be interviewed rebus foresaw much tedium in the day ahead what worries me morton had said is that if the two murders are linked then were dealing with someone who probably didnt know either of the girls that makes for a bastard of a job rebus had nodded there was still the chance however either that both girls had known their murderer or that the murderer had been someone in a position of trust otherwise the girls being nearly twelveyears old and not daft they would surely have struggled when abducted yet no one had come forward to say that they had witnessed any such thing it was bloody strange the rain had stopped by the time they reached the cramped operationsroom the inspector in charge of outdoor operations was there to hand them lists of names and addresses rebus rejoiced to be away from the hq away from anderson and his thirst for paperwork results this was where the work really took place where the contacts were made where one slip by a suspect could tip a case one way or the other do you mind me asking sir who it was that suggested my colleague and me for this particular job the di his eyes twinkling studied rebus for a second yes i bloody well do mind rebus it doesnt matter one way or the other does it every single task in this case is as vital and as important as every other lets not forget that yes sir said rebus this must be a bit like working inside a shoebox sir said morton examining the cramped interior yes son im in the shoebox but you lot are the shoes so get bloody well moving this particular inspector thought rebus pocketing his list seemed a nice bloke his tongue just sharp enough for rebuss taste dont worry sir he said now this wont take us long he hoped that the inspector noted the irony in his voice last one backs a fairy said morton they were doing this by the rulebook then yet the case would seem to demand that new rules be drawn up anderson was sending them out to look for the usual suspects family acquaintances people with records doubtless back at hq groups such as the paedophile information exchange were being investigated rebus hoped that there were plenty of crank calls for anderson to sift through there usually were the callers who admitted to the crime the callers who were psychic and could help by getting in touch with the deceased the callers who pressed a redherring to your nose so that you could have a sniff they were all mastered by past guilt and present fantasies perhaps everyone was at his first house rebus battered on the door and waited it was opened by a rank old woman her feet bare a cardigan comprised of ninetypercent hole to tenpercent wool hanging around her scarplike shoulders whit is it police madam its about the murder eh whitever it is i dinnae want it away ye get afore i ca for the coppers the murders shouted rebus tm a policeman ive come to ask you a few questions eh she stood back a little to peer at him and rebus could swear that he saw the faint glow of a past intelligence in the dulled black of her pupils whit murders she said one of those days to improve matters the rain began again heavy dollops of stinging water gripping to his neck and face seeping into his shoes just like that day at the old mans grave only yesterday a lot could happen in twentyfour hours all of it to him by seven oclock rebus had covered six of the fourteen individuals on his list he walked back to the operationsshoebox his feet sore his stomach awash with tea and craving something stronger at the boggy waste ground jack morton stood and stared out over the acres of clay strewn with bricks and detritus a childs heaven what a hellish place to die in she didnt die here jack remember what forensic said well you know what i mean yes rebus knew what he meant by the way said morton youre the fairy ill drink to that said rebus they drank in some of edinburghs seedier bars bars the tourist never sees they tried to shut the case out of their minds but could not it was like that with big murder inquiries they got to you physically and mentally consuming you and making you work all the harder there was a rush of pure adrenalin behind every murder it kept them going past the point of no return id better be getting back to the flat said rebus no have another jack morton weaved towards the bar his empty glass in his hand rebus his mind foggy thought more about his mysterious correspondent he suspected rhona though it could not be said to be her style he suspected his daughter sammy perhaps taking a delayedaction revenge for her fathers dismissal of her from his life family and acquaintances were initially at least always the chief suspects but it could be anyone anyone who knew where he worked and where he lived someone in his own force was always a possibility to be feared the dollar question as ever was why here we go two lovely pints of beer gratis from the management i call that very publicspirited said rebus or publicanspirited eh john morton chuckled at his joke wiping froth from his top lip he noticed that rebus wasnt laughing a penny for them he said a serial killer said rebus it must be in which case weve not seen the last of our friends handiwork morton put down his glass suddenly not very thirsty those girls went to different schools continued rebus lived in different areas of the city had different tastes different friends were of different religions and were killed by the same murderer in the same way and without noticeable abuse of any kind were dealing with a maniac he could be anywhere a fight was breaking out at the bar apparently over a game of dominoes which had gone very badly wrong a glass fell to the floor followed by a hush in the bar then everyone seemed to calm down a little one man was led outside by his supporters in the argument another remained slumped against the bar muttering to a woman beside him morton took a gulp of beer thank god were off duty he said then fancy a curry morton finished the chicken vindaloo and threw his fork down on to the plate i reckon i ought to have a word with the health department boys he said still chewing either that or the trading standards whatever that was it wasnt chicken they were in a small curryhouse near haymarket station purple lighting red flock wallpaper a churning wall of sitarmusic you looked as if you were enjoying it said rebus finishing his beer oh yes i enjoyed it but it wasnt chicken well theres nothing to complain about if you enjoyed it rebus sat slantwise on his chair his legs straight out before him an arm along the chairs back while he smoked his umpteenth cigarette that day morton leaned unsteadily towards his partner john theres always something to complain about especially if you think you can get off with not paying the bill by doing so he winked at rebus sat back burped and reached into his pocket for a cigarette garbage he said rebus tried to count the number of cigarettes he himself had smoked that day but his brain told him that such calculations were not to be attempted i wonder what our friend the murderer is up to at this exact moment he said finishing a curry suggested morton trouble is john he could be one of these joe normal types clean on the surface married with kids your average suburban hardworking chap but underneath a nutter pure and simple theres nothing simple about our man true but you could well be right you mean that hes a sort of jekyll and hyde right exactly morton flicked ash onto the tabletop already splashed with curry sauce and beer he was peering at his empty plate as though wondering where all the food had gone jekyll and hyde youve got it in a nutshell ill tell you john id lock these bastards up for a million years a million years of solitary in a cell the size of a shoebox thats what id do rebus was staring at the flock wallpaper he thought back to his own days in solitary days when the sas were trying to crack him days of the ultimate testing of sighs and silence starvation and filth no he wouldnt want that again and yet they had not beaten him not really beaten him the others had not been so lucky trapped in its cell the face screaming let me out let me out let me out john are you okay there if youre going to be sick the toilets behind the kitchen listen when youre passing do me a favour and see if you can notice what it is that theyre chopping up and throwing into the pot rebus walked smartly to the toilet with the overcautious gait of the tremendously drunk yet he did not feel drunk not that drunk his nostrils filled with the smells of curry disinfectant shit he washed his face no he was not going to be sick it wasnt too much to drink for he had felt the same shudder at michaels the same momentary horror what was happening to him it was as if his insides were concretizing slowing him down allowing the years to catch up on him it felt a little like the nervous breakdown which he had been awaiting yet it was no nervous breakdown it was nothing it had passed can i give you a lift john no thanks ill walk clear my head they parted at the door of the restaurant an officeparty loosened neckties and strong sickly perfume made its way towards haymarket station haymarket was the last station into edinburgh before the much grander waverley rebus remembered that the premature withdrawal of the penis during intercourse for contraceptive reasons was often referred to as getting off at haymarket who said the people in edinburgh were dour a smile a song and a strangulation rebus wiped sweat from his forehead he felt weak still and leaned against a lamppost he knew vaguely what it was it was a rejection by his whole being of the past as though his vital organs were rejecting a donor heart he had pushed the horror of the training so far to the back of his mind that any echo of it at all was now to be violently fought against and yet it was in that same confinement that he had found friendship brotherhood camaraderie call it what you like and he had learned more about himself than human beings ever do he had learned so much his spirit had not been broken he had come out of the training on top and then had come the nervous breakdown enough he began to walk steadying himself with thoughts of his day off tomorrow he would spend the day reading and sleeping and readying himself for a party cathy jacksons party and the day after that sunday he would be spending a rare day with his daughter then perhaps he would find out who was behind the crank letters the girl woke up with a dry salty taste in her mouth she felt sleepy and numb and wondered where she was she had fallen asleep in his car she had not felt sleepy before then before he had given her a piece of his chocolatebar now she was awake but not in her bedroom at home this room had pictures on its walls pictures cut out of colour magazines some were photographs of soldiers with fierce expressions on their faces others were of girls and women she looked closely at some selfdeveloping photographs grouped together on one wall there was a picture of her there asleep on the bed with her arms spread wide she opened her mouth in a slight gasp outside in the livingroom he heard her movements as he prepared the garotte that night rebus had one of his nightmarish dreams again a long lingering kiss was followed by an ejaculation both in the dream and in reality he woke up immediately afterwards and wiped himself down the breath of the kiss was still around him hanging to him like an aura he shook his head clear of it he needed a woman remembering the party to come he relaxed a little but his lips were dry he padded into the kitchen and found a bottle of lemonade it was flat but served the purpose then he remembered that he was still drunk and would have a hangover if he wasnt careful he poured himself three glassfuls of water and forced them down he was pleased to find that the pilotlight was still on it was like a good omen when he slipped back into bed he even remembered to say his prayers that would surprise the big man upstairs he would note it in his muckle book rebus remembered me tonight may give him a nice day tomorrow amen michael rebus loved his bmw as dearly as he loved life itself perhaps more so as he sped down the motorway the traffic to his left hardly appearing to move at all he felt that his car was life in a strange satisfying sort of way he pointed its nose towards the bright point of the horizon and let it forge towards that future revving it hard making no concessions to anyone or anything that was the way he liked it hard fast luxury pushbutton and onhand he drummed his fingers on the leather of the steeringwheel toyed with the radiocassette eased his head back onto the padded headrest he dreamed often of just taking off leaving wife and children and house just his car and him taking off towards that far point never stopping except to eat and fill up the car driving until he died it seemed like paradise and so he felt quite safe fantasising about it knowing that he would never dare put paradise into practice when he had first owned a car he had wakened in the middle of the night opening his curtains to see if it was still waiting for him outside sometimes he would rise at four or five in the morning and take off for a few hours astonished at the distance he could cover so quickly glad to be out on the silent roads with only the rabbits and the crows for company his hand on the horn scaring fluttering clouds of birds into the air he had never lost that initial loveaffair with cars the manumission of dreams people stared at his car now he would park it in the streets of kirkcaldy and stand a little distance away watching people envy that car the younger men full of bravado and expectancy would peer inside staring at leather and dials as though examining living things at the zoo the older men some with their wives in tow would glance at the machine sometimes spitting on the road afterwards knowing that it represented everything they had wanted for themselves and failed to find michael rebus had found his dream and it was a dream he could watch any time he chose in edinburgh however it depended where you parked as to whether your car would attract attention he had parked on george street one day only to find a rollsroyce cruising to a stop behind him he had keyed the ignition again fuming nearspitting he had parked eventually outside a discotheque he knew that parking an expensive car outside a restaurant or a discotheque would mean that a few people would mistake you for the owner of the particular setup and that thought pleased him immensely erasing the memory of the rollsroyce and infusing him with new versions of the dream stopping at trafficlights too could be exciting except when some halfarsed biker on a big machine roared to a standstill behind him or even worse beside him some of those bikes were made for initial acceleration more than once he had been beaten mercilessly in a race from trafficlights he tried not to think about those times either today he parked where he had been told to park in the car park atop calton hill he could see over to fife from his front window and from the back he could see princes street laid out before him like a toyset the hill was quiet it was not quite the tourist season and it was cold he knew that things hotted up at night car chases girls and boys hoping for a ride parties at queensferry beach edinburghs gay community would mix with those merely curious or lonely and a couple handinhand would now and again enter the graveyard at the bottom of the hill when darkness fell the east end of princes street became a territory all of its own to be passed around to be shared but he was not about to share his car with anyone his dream was a fragile entity he watched fife across the firth of forth looking quite splendid from this distance until the mans car slowed and stopped beside him michael slid across to his passenger seat and wound down the window just as the other man was winding down his got the stuff he said of course said the man he checked in his mirror some people a family of all things had just come over the rise we better wait for a minute they paused staring blankly at the scenery no hassles across in fife asked the man none the words going round that your brother was over seeing you is that correct the mans eyes were hard his whole being was hard but the car he drove was a heap michael felt safe for the moment yes but it was nothing it was just the anniversary of our dads death that was all he doesnt know anything absolutely not do you think im thick or something the mans glance silenced michael it was a mystery to him how this one man could invoke such fear in him he hated these meetings if anything happens the man was saying if anything goes wrong youll be in for it i really mean that keep well clear of that bastard in future it wasnt my fault he just dropped in on me he didnt even phone first what could i do his hands were gripping hard to the steeringwheel cemented there the man checked in his mirror again all clear he said reaching behind him a small package slipped through michaels window he took a look inside it brought an envelope out of his pocket and reached for the ignition be seeing you around mister rebus said the man opening the envelope yes said michael thinking not if i can help it this work was getting a bit too hairy for him these people seemed to know everything about his movements he knew however that the fear always evaporated to be replaced by euphoria when he had rid himself of another load pocketing a nice profit on the deal it was that moment when fear turned to euphoria that kept him in the game it was like the fastest piece of acceleration from trafficlights that you could experience ever jim stevens watching from the hills victorian folly a ridiculous nevercompleted copy of a greek temple saw michael rebus leave that much was old news to him he was more interested in the edinburgh connection a man he could not trace and did not know a man who had lost him twice before and who could doubtless lose him again nobody seemed to know who this mysterious figure was and nobody particularly wanted to know he looked like trouble stevens feeling suddenly impotent and old could do nothing other than jot down the car registration number he thought that perhaps mcgregor campbell could do something with it but he was wary of being found out by rebus he felt trapped in the middle of something which was proving altogether a knottier problem than he had suspected shivering he tried to persuade himself that he liked it that way come in come in whoever you are rebuss coat gloves and bottle of wine were taken from him by complete strangers and he was plunged into one of those packed smoky loud parties where it is easy to smile at people but near impossible to get to know anyone he moved from the hall into the kitchen and from there through a connectingdoor into the livingroom itself the chairs table settee had been pushed back to the walls and the floor was filled with writhing whooping couples the men tieless their shirts sticking to them the party it appeared had started earlier than he had anticipated he recognized a few faces around and beneath him stepping over two inspectors as he waded into the room he could see that the table at the far end had bottles and plastic cups heaped upon it and it seemed as good a vantage point as any and safer than some getting to it was the problem however and he was reminded of some of the assault courses of his army days hi there cathy jackson doing a passable imitation of a ragdoll reeled into his path for a second before being swept off her feet by the large the very large man with whom she was pretending to dance hello managed rebus his face twisting into a grimace rather than a smile he achieved the relative safety of the drinkstable and helped himself to a whisky and a chaser that would do for starters then he watched as cathy jackson for whom he had bathed polished scraped adjusted and sprayed pushed her tongue into the cavernous mouth of her dancingpartner rebus thought that he was going to be sick his partner for the evening had done a bunk before the evening had begun that would teach him to be optimistic so what did he do now leave quietly or try to pull a few words of introduction out of his hat a stocky man not at all a policeman came from the kitchen and cigarette in mouth approached the table with a couple of empty glasses in his hand bloody hell he said to nobody in particular rummaging amongst the bottles this is all a bit fucking grim isnt it excuse my language yes it is a bit rebus thought to himself well there it is ive done it now ive spoken to someone the ice is broken so i may as well leave while the goings good but he did not leave he watched as the man weaved his way quite expertly back through the dancers the drinks as safe as tiny animals in his hands he watched as another record pounded out of the invisible stereo system the dancers recommenced their wardance and a woman looking every inch as uncomfortable as he did squeezed her way into the room and was pointed in the direction of rebuss table she was about his own age a little ragged around the edges she wore a reasonably fashionable dress he supposed who was he to talk about fashion his suit looked downright funereal in the present company and her hair had been styled recently perhaps as recently as this afternoon she wore a secretarys glasses but she was no secretary rebus could see that much by looking at her by examining the way she handled herself as she picked her way towards him he held a bloody mary newlyprepared towards her is this okay for you he shouted have i guessed right or wrong she gulped the drink thankfully pausing for breath as he refilled the tumbler thanks she said i dont normally drink but that was much appreciated great rebus thought to himself the smile never leaving his eyes cathy jacksons out of her head and her morals on alcohol and im landed with a tt oh but that thought was unworthy of him and did no justice to his companion he breathed a quick prayer of contrition would you like to dance he asked for his sins youre kidding im not whats wrong rebus guilty of a streak of chauvinism could not believe it she was a di moreover she was press liaison officer on the murder case oh he said its just that im working that case too listen john if it keeps on like this every policeman and policewoman in scotland is going to be on the case believe me what do you mean theres been another abduction the girls mother reported her missing this evening shit excuse my language they had danced drunk separated met again and were now old friends for the evening it seemed they stood in the hallway a little way from the noise and chaos of the dancefloor a queue for the flats only toilet was becoming unruly at the end of the corridor rebus found himself staring past gill templers glasses past all that glass and plastic to the emeraldgreen eyes beyond he wanted to tell her that he had never seen eyes as lovely as hers but was afraid of being accused of cliche she was sticking to orange juice now but he had loosened himself up with a few more whiskies not expecting anything special from the evening hello gill rebus recognized the stocky man before them as the person he had spoken with at the drinkstable long time no see the man attempted to peck gill templers cheek but succeeded only in falling past her and butting the wall had a drop too much to drink jim said gill coolly the man shrugged his shoulders he was looking at rebus we all have our crosses to bear eh a hand was extended towards rebus jim stevens said the man oh the reporter rebus accepted the mans warm moist hand for a moment this is detective sergeant john rebus said gill rebus noticed the quick flushing in stevens face the startled eyes of a hare he recovered quickly though expertly pleased to meet you he said then motioning with his head gill and i go back a long way dont we gill not as far as you seem to think jim he laughed then glancing towards rebus shes just shy he said another girl murdered i hear jim has spies everywhere stevens tapped the side of his bloodred nose grinning towards rebus everywhere he said and i get everywhere too yes spreads himself a little thin does our jim said gill her voice sharp as a blades edge her eyes suddenly shrouded in glass and plastic inviolable another press briefing tomorrow gill said stevens searching through his pockets for his cigarettes lost long before yes the reporters hand found rebuss shoulder a long way me and gill then he was gone his hand held back towards them as he retreated waving without the necessity of acknowledgement searching out his cigarettes filing away john rebuss face gill templer sighed leaning against the wall where stevens failed kiss had landed one of the best reporters in scotland she said matteroffactly and your job is dealing with the likes of him hes not so bad an argument seemed to be starting in the livingroom well said rebus all smiles shall we phone for the police or would you rather be taken to a little restaurant i know is that a chatup line maybe you tell me after all youre the detective well whatever it is detective sergeant rebus youre in luck im starving ill get my coat rebus feeling pleased with himself remembered that his own coat was lurking somewhere he found it in one of the bedrooms along with his gloves and a cracking surprise his unopened bottle of wine he pocketed this seeing it as a divine sign that he would be needing it later gill was in the other bedroom rummaging through the pile of coats on the bed beneath the bedcovers congress seemed to be taking place and the whole mess of coats and bedclothes seethed and writhed like some gigantic amoeba gill giggling through it all found her coat at last and came towards rebus who smiled conspiratorially in the doorway goodbye cathy she shouted back into the room thanks for the party there was a muffled roar perhaps an acknowledgement from beneath the bedclothes rebus his eyes wide felt his moral fibre crumbling like a dry cheesebiscuit in the taxi they sat a little distance apart so do you and this stevens character go back a long way only in his memory she stared past the driver at the sleek wet road beyond jims memory cant be what it was seriously we went out together once and i do mean once she held up a finger a friday night i think it was a big mistake it certainly was rebus was satisfied with that he began to feel hungry again by the time they reached the restaurant however it was closed even to rebus so they stayed in the taxi and rebus directed the driver towards his flat im a dab hand at bacon sandwiches he said what a pity she said im a vegetarian good god you mean you eat no vegetables at all why is it acid seeping into her voice that carnivores always have to make a joke out of it its the same with men and womens lib why is that its because were afraid of them said rebus quite sober now gill looked at him but he was watching from his window as the citys latenight drunks rolled their way up and down the obstaclestrewn hazard of lothian road seeking alcohol women happiness it was a neverending search for some of them staggering in and out of clubs and pubs and takeaways gnawing on the packaged bones of existence lothian road was edinburghs dustbin it was also home to the sheraton hotel and the usher hall rebus had visited the usher hall once sitting with rhona and the other smug souls listening to mozarts requiem mass it was typical of edinburgh to have a crumb of culture sited amidst the fastfood shops a requiem mass and a bag of chips so how is the old press liaison these days they were seated in his rapidly tidied livingroom his pride and joy a nakamichi tapedeck was tastefully broadcasting one of his collection of latenightlistening jazz tapes stan getz or coleman hawkins he had rustled up a round of tuna fish and tomato sandwiches gill having admitted that she ate fish occasionally the bottle of wine was open and he had prepared a pot of freshly ground coffee a treat usually reserved for sunday breakfasts he now sat across from his guest watching her eat he thought with a small start that this was his first female guest since rhona had left him but then recalled very vaguely a couple of other onenighters press liaison is fine its not really a complete waste of time you know it serves a useful purpose in this day and age oh im not knocking it she looked at him trying to gauge how serious he was being well she went on its just that i know a lot of our colleagues who think that a job like mine is a complete waste of time and manpower believe me in a case like this one its absolutely crucial that we keep the media on our side and that we let them have the information that we want made public when it needs to be made public it saves a lot of hassle hear hear be serious you rat rebus laughed im never anything other than serious a onehundred percent policemans policeman thats me gill templer stared at him again she had a real inspectors eyes they worked into your conscience sniffing out guilt and guile and drive seeking give and being a liaison officer said rebus means that you have to liaise with the press quite closely right i know what youre getting at sergeant rebus and as your superior im telling you to stop it maam rebus gave her a short salute he came back from the kitchen with another pot of coffee wasnt that a dreadful party said gill it was the finest party i have ever attended said rebus after all without it i might never have met you she roared with laughter this time her mouth filled with a paste of tuna and bread and tomato youre a nutter she cried you really are rebus raised his eyebrows smiling had he lost his touch he had not it was miraculous later she needed to go to the bathroom rebus was changing a tape and realising how limited his musical tastes were who were these groups that she kept referring to its in the hall he said on the left when she returned more jazz was playing the music at times almost too low to be heard and rebus was back in his chair whats that room across from the bathroom john well he said pouring coffee it used to be my daughters but now its just full of junk i never use it when did your wife and you split up not as long ago as we should have i mean that seriously how old is your daughter she sounded maternal now domestic no longer the acid single woman or the professional nearly twelve he said nearly twelve its a difficult age arent they all when the wine was finished and the coffee was down to its last halfcup one or the other of them suggested bed they exchanged sheepish smiles and ritual promises about not promising anything and the contract agreed and signed without words went to the bedroom it all started well enough they were mature had played this game before too often to let the little fumblings and apologies get to them rebus was impressed by her agility and invention and hoped that she was being impressed by his she arched her spine to meet him seeking the ultimate and unobtainable ingress john pushing at him now what is it nothing im just going to turn over okay he knelt up and she turned her back to him sliding her knees down the bed clawing at the smooth wall with her fingertips waiting rebus in the slight pause looked around at the room the pale blue light shading his books the edges of the mattress oh a futon she had said pulling her clothes off quickly he had smiled in the silence he was losing it come on john come on he bent towards her resting his face on her back he had talked about books with gordon reeve when they had been captured talked endlessly it seemed reading to him from his memory in close confinement torture a closed door away but they had endured it was a mark of the training john oh john gill raised herself up and turned her head towards his seeking a kiss gill gordon reeve seeking something from him something he couldnt give despite the training despite the years of practice the years of work and persistence john but he was elsewhere now back inside the training camp back trudging across a muddy field the boss screaming at him to speed up back in that cell watching a cockroach pace the begrimed floor back in the helicopter a bag over his head the spray of the sea salty in his ears john she turned round now awkwardly concerned she saw the tears about to start from his eyes she held his head to her oh john it doesnt matter really it doesnt and a little later dont you like it that way they lay together afterwards he guiltily and cursing the facts of his confusion and the fact that he had run out of cigarettes she drowsily caring still whispering bits and pieces of her lifestory to him after a while rebus forgot to feel guilty there was nothing after all to feel guilty about he felt merely the distinct lack of nicotine and he remembered that he was seeing sammy in six hours time and that her mother would instinctively know what he john rebus had been up to these past few hours she was cursed with a witchlike ability to see into the soul and she had seen his occasional bouts of crying at very close quarters indeed partly he supposed that had been responsible for their breakup what time is it john four maybe a little after he slid his arm from beneath her and rose to leave the room do you want anything to drink he said what did you have in mind coffee maybe its hardly worth going to sleep now but if you feel sleepy dont mind me no ill take a cup of coffee rebus knew from her voice from its slurred growliness that she would be fast asleep by the time he reached the kitchen okay he said he made himself a cup of dark sweet coffee and slumped into a chair with it he turned on the livingrooms small gas fire and began to read one of his books he was seeing sammy today and his mind wandered from the story in front of him a tale of intrigue which he could not remember having started sammy was nearly twelve she had survived many years of danger and now for her other dangers were imminent the perverts in watch the ogling old men the teenage cockfighters would be supplemented by the new urges of boys her age and boys she already knew as friends would become sudden and forceful hunters how would she cope with it if her mother had anything to do with it she would cope admirably biting in a clinch and ducking on the ropes yes she would survive without her fathers advice and protection the kids were harder these days he thought back to his own youth he had been mickeys big brother fighting battles for the two of them going home to watch his brother coddled by his father he had pushed himself further into the cushions on the settee hoping to disappear one day then theyd be sorry then theyd be sorry at seventhirty he went through to the musky bedroom which smelt two parts sex to one part animal lair and kissed gill awake its time he said get up ill run you a bath she smelt good like a baby on a fireside towel he admired the shapes of her twisted body as they awoke to the thin watery sunlight she had a good body all right no real stretchmarks her legs unscarred her hair just tousled enough to be inviting thanks she had to be at hq by ten in order to coordinate the next press release there could be no rest the case was still growing like a cancer rebus filled the bath wincing at the rim of grime around it he needed a cleaninglady perhaps he could get gill to do it another unworthy thought forgive me which brought him to think of churchgoing it was another sunday after all and for weeks he had been promising himself that he would try again would find another church in the city and would try all over again he hated congregational religion he hated the smiles and the manners of the sundaydressed scottish protestant the emphasis on a communion not with god but with your neighbours he had tried seven churches of varying denominations in edinburgh and had found none to be to his liking he had tried sitting for two hours at home of a sunday reading the bible and saying a prayer but somehow that did not work either he was caught a believer outwith his belief was a personal faith good enough for god perhaps but not his personal faith which seemed to depend upon guilt and his feelings of hypocrisy whenever he sinned a guilt assuaged only by public show is my bath ready john she retousled her hair naked and confident her glasses left behind in the bedroom john rebus felt his soul to be imperilled sod it he thought catching her around the hips guilt could wait guilt could always wait he had to mop up the bathroom floor afterwards empirical evidence that archimedes displacement of water had been proved once again the bathwater had flowed like milk and honey and rebus had nearly drowned still he felt better now lord i am a poor sinner he whispered as gill dressed she looked stern and efficient when she opened the frontdoor almost as if she had been on a twentyminute official visit can we fix a date he suggested we can she replied looking through her bag rebus was curious to know why women always did that especially in films and thrillers after they had been sleeping with a man did women suspect their sleeping partners of rifling their purses but it might be difficult she continued the case going the way it is lets just promise to keep in touch okay okay he hoped that she took note of the dismay in his voice the disappointment of the small boy at having his request denied they pecked a final kiss mouths brittle by now and then she was gone her scent remained however and he breathed it in deeply as he prepared for the day ahead he found a shirt and a pair of trousers that didnt reek of tobacco and these he put on slowly admiring himself in the bathroom mirror the soles of his feet damp while he hummed a hymn sometimes it was good to be alive sometimes jim stevens poured another three aspirin into his mouth and drank his orange juice the ignominy of it being seen in a leith bar sucking on fruit juice yet the idea of drinking even a halfpint of the rich frothing beer made him feel nauseous he had drunk far too much at that party too much too quickly and in too many combinations leith was trying to improve itself someone somewhere had decided to give it a bit of a dust and a wash it boasted frenchstyle cafes and wine bars studio flats delicatessen but it was still leith still the old port an echo of its roaring bustling past when bordeaux wines would be unloaded by the gallon and sold on the streets from a horse and cart if leith retained nothing else it would retain a ports mentality and a ports traditional drinking dens by christ roared a voice behind him the man drinks everything in doubles even his soft drinks a heavy fist twice the dimensions of his own landed on stevens back the swarthy figure landed on a stool beside him the hand stayed firmly where it was hello podeen said stevens he was starting to sweat in the heavy atmosphere of the saloon and his heart was pounding terminal hangover symptoms he could smell the alcohol squeezing itself out of his pores lordy james me boy what the hells that youre supping barman get this man a whisky quick hes wasting away on kiddies juice with a roar podeen took his hand off the reporters back just long enough to relieve the pressure before bringing it back down again in a stinging backslap stevens felt his insides shudder rebelliously anything i can do for you today said podeen his voice much lower big podeen had been a sailor for twenty years with the scars and nicks of a thousand ports on his body how he made his money these days stevens did not wish to know he did some bouncing for pubs on lothian road and dubious drinkingdens around leith but that would be the tip of his earnings iceberg podeens fingers were so encrusted with dirt that he might have carved out the black economy singlehandedly from the rotten fertile soil beneath him not really big man no im just mulling things over get me a breakfast will you double helpings of everything the barman almost saluting went off to give the order see said podeen youre not the only man who orders everything in doubles eh jimmy the hand was lifted from stevens back again he grimaced waiting for the slap but the arm flopped onto the bar beside him instead he sighed audibly rough night last night was it jimmy i wish i could remember he had fallen asleep in one of the bedrooms very late in the evening then a couple had come in and they had lifted him into the bathroom depositing him in the bath there he had slept for two hours maybe three he had awakened with a terrific stiffness in his neck back and legs he had drunk some coffee but not enough never enough and had walked in the chilled morning air chatting in a newsagents shop with some taxidrivers sitting in the porters cubbyhole of one of the big hotels on princes street supping sweet tea and talking football with the bleary nightporter but he had known he would end up down here for this was his morning off and he was back on the drugs case his own little baby is there much stuff around at the moment big oh now that depends what youre looking for jimmy words out that youre getting to be a bit too nosy in every department best if you were sticking to the safe drugs keep away from the big stuff is this a timely warning or a threat or what stevens wasnt in the mood to be threatened not when he had a sunday morning hangover to sort out its a friendly warning a warning from a friend whos the friend big me you silly sod dont be so suspicious all the time listen theres a little cannabis around but thats about it nobody brings the stuff into leith any more they land it on the fife coast or up by dundee places the customs men have all but disappeared from and thats the truth i know big i know but there is a delivery going on around here ive seen it i dont know what it is whether its big stuff or not but ive seen a handover very recently how recent yesterday where calton hill big podeen shook his head then its nothing at all to do with anyone or anything i know jimmy stevens knew the big man knew him well he gave out good information but it was only what was given to him by people who wanted stevens to get to know about something so the heroin boys would come across via big with information about cannabis dealing if stevens took the story up chances were the cannabis dealers would be caught and that left the territory and the demand to the heroin boys it was clever stuff ploy and counterploy the stakes were high too but stevens was a clever player himself he knew that there was a tacit understanding that he was never to aim for the really big players for that would mean aiming for the citys businessmen and bureaucrats the titled landowners the new towns mercedes owners and that would never be allowed so he was fed tidbits enough to keep the presses rolling the tongues wagging about what a terrible place edinburgh was becoming always a little never the lot stevens understood all that he had been playing the game so long he hardly knew sometimes what side he was on in the end it hardly mattered you dont know about it nothing jimmy but ill nose around see whats doing listen though theres a new bar opened up by the mackay showroom know the one i mean stevens nodded well went on podeen its a bar at the front but its a brothel at the back theres a wee cracker of a barmaid does her stuff of an afternoon if youre interested stevens smiled so a new boy was trying to move in and the old boys podeens ultimate employers didnt like it and so he jim stevens was being given enough information to close down the new boy if he liked there was a nice headlinecatcher in it certainly but it was a oneday wonder why didnt they just telephone the police anonymously he thought he knew the answer to that one though once it had puzzled him they were playing the game by its oldfashioned rules which meant no snitching no grassing to the enemy he was left to play the part of messengerboy but a messengerboy with power built into the system just a little power but more power than lay in doing things along the straight and narrow thanks big ill bear that in mind the food arrived then great piles of curled shining bacon two soft neartransparent eggs mushrooms fried bread beans stevens kept his eyes to the bar suddenly interested in one of the beermats damp still from saturday night im going across to my table to eat this okay jimmy stevens could not believe his good luck oh fine big man fine cheers then and with that he was left alone only the ghost of a smell remaining he noticed that the barman was standing opposite him his hand shiny with grease was held out two pounds sixty he said stevens sighed put that one down to experience he thought to himself as he paid or to the hangover the party had been worth it however for he had met john rebus and rebus was friendly with gill templer it was all becoming just a little confusing but interesting too rebus was certainly interesting though physically he did not resemble his brother in the slightest the man had looked honest enough but how did you tell a bent copper from the outside it was the inside that was rotten so rebus was seeing gill templer he remembered the night they had spent together and shuddered that surely had been his nadir he lit a cigarette his second of the day his head was still clotted but his stomach felt a little more composed he might even be getting hungry rebus looked a tough nut but not as tough as he would have been ten years ago at this moment he was probably in bed with gill templer the bastard the lucky bastard his stomach turned a tiny somersault of chilled jealousy the cigarette felt good it poured life and strength back into him or seemed to yet he knew that it was scooping him out too tearing his guts to shreds of darkened meat the hell with it he smoked because without cigarettes he couldnt think and he was thinking now hey give me a double here will you the barman came over orange juice again stevens looked at him disbelievingly dont be daft he said whisky grouse if thats whats in the grouse bottle we dont play those sorts of game here im glad to hear it he drank the whisky and felt better then he began to feel worse again he went to the toilet but the smell in there made him feel even worse he held himself over the sink and brought up a few bubbles of liquid retching loudly but emptily he had to get off the booze he had to get off the ciggies they were killing him yet they were the only things keeping him alive he walked over to big podeens table sweating feeling older than his years that was a good breakfast that was said the hulk of a man his eyes gleaming like a childs stevens sat down beside him whats the word on bent coppers he asked hello daddy she was eleven but looked and spoke and smiled older eleven going on twentyone that was what living with rhona had done to his daughter he pecked her cheek thinking back to gills leavetaking there was perfume around her and a hint of makeup on her eyes he could kill rhona hello sammy he said mummy says that im to be called samantha now that im growing up so quickly but i suppose its all right for you to call me sammy oh well mummy knows best samantha he cast a look towards the retreating figure of his wife her body pressed pushed and prodded into a shape attainable only with the aid of some superstrong girdle she was not he was relieved to find wearing as well as their occasional telephone conversations would have had him believe she stepped into her car now never looking back it was a small and expensive model but had a sizeable dent in one side rebus blessed that dent he recalled that making love he had gloried in her body in the soft flesh the padding as she had called it of her thighs and her back today she had looked at him with cold eyes filled with a cloud of unknowing and had seen in his eyes the gleam of sexual satisfaction then she had turned on her heels so it was true she could still see into his heart ah but she had failed to see into his soul she had missed that most vital organ completely what do you want to do then they were standing at the entrance to princes street gardens adjacent to the tourist haunts of edinburgh a few people wandered past the closed shops of a princes street sunday while others sat on benches in the gardens feeding crumbs to the pigeons and the canadian squirrels or else reading the heavyprinted sunday papers the castle reared above them its flag flying briskly in the alltootypical breeze the gothic missile of the scott monument pointed religious believers in the right direction but few of the tourists who snapped it with their expensive japanese cameras seemed at all interested in the structures symbolic connotations never mind its reality just so long as they had some snaps of it to show off to their friends back home these tourists spent so much time photographing things that they never actually saw anything unlike the young people milling around who were too busy enjoying life to be bothered capturing false impressions of it what do you want to do then the tourist side of his capital city they were never interested in the housingestates around this central husk they never ventured into pilton or niddrie or oxgangs to make an arrest in a pissdrenched tenement they were not moved by leiths pushers and junkies the defthanded corruption of the city gents the petty thefts of a society pushed so far into materialism that stealing was the only answer to what they thought of as their needs and they were almost certainly unaware they were not after all here to read local newspapers and watch local tv of edinburghs newest media star the child murderer the police could not catch the murderer who was leading the forces of law and order a merry dance without a clue or a lead or a cat in hells chance of finding him until he slipped up he pitied gill her job he pitied himself he pitied the city right down to its crooks and bandits its whores and gamblers its perpetual losers and winners so what do you want to do his daughter shrugged her shoulders i dont know walk maybe go for a pizza see a film they walked john rebus had met rhona phillips just after joining the police he had suffered a nervous breakdown just prior to his joining the force why did you leave the army john and had recuperated in a fishingvillage on the fife coast though he had never told michael of his presence in fife during that time on his first holiday from policework his first proper holiday in years the others having been spent on courses or working towards examinations rebus had returned to that fishingvillage and there had met rhona she was a schoolteacher already with a brutally short and unhappy marriage behind her in john rebus she saw a strong and able husband someone who would not flinch in a fight someone she could care for too however since his strength failed to conceal an inner fragility she saw that he was haunted still by his years in the army and especially by his time in special services he would awake crying some nights and sometimes would weep as he made love weeping silently the tears falling hard and slow on her breasts he would not speak about it much and she had never pushed him she was aware that he had lost a friend during his training days she understood that much and he appealed to the child in her and to the mother he seemed perfect too too perfect he was not he should never have married they lived happily enough she teaching english in edinburgh until samantha was born then however niggling fights and powerplays had turned into sourer unabated periods of resentment and suspicion was she seeing another man a teacher at her school was he seeing another woman when he claimed to be involved in his numerous doubleshifts was she taking drugs without his knowledge was he taking bribes without hers in fact the answer to all of these suspicions was no but that did not seem to be what was at stake in any case rather something larger was looming yet neither could perceive the inevitability of it until too late and they would cuddle up and make things right between them over and over again as though in some moralitytale or soapopera there was they agreed the child to think of the child samantha had become the young woman and rebus felt his eyes straying appreciatively and guiltily yet again over her as they walked through the gardens around the castle and up towards the abc cinema on lothian road she was not beautiful for only women could be that but she was growing towards beauty with a confident inevitability which was breathtaking in itself and horrifying he was after all her father there had to be some feelings there it went with the territory do you want me to tell you about mummys new boyfriend you know damn well i do she giggled still something of the girl left in her then and yet even a giggle seemed different in her now seemed more controlled more womanly hes a poet supposedly but really he hasnt had a book out or anything yet his poems are crap too but mummy wont tell him that she thinks the sun shines out of his youknowwhere was all this adult talk supposed to impress him he supposed so how old is he rebus asked flinching at his suddenly revealed vanity i dont know twenty maybe he stopped flinching and started to reel twenty she was cradlesnatching now my god what effect was all this having on sammy on samantha the pretend adult he dreaded to think but he was no psychoanalyst that was rhonas department or once had been honest though dad hes an awful poet ive done better stuff than his in my essays at school i go to the big school after the summer itll be funny to go to the school where mum works yes wont it rebus had found something niggling him a poet aged twenty whats this boys name he asked andrew she said andrew anderson doesnt that sound funny hes nice really but hes a bit weird rebus cursed under his breath andersons son the dreaded andersons itinerant poet son was shacked up with rebuss wife what an irony he didnt know whether to laugh or cry laughter seemed marginally more appropriate what are you laughing at daddy nothing samantha im just happy thats all what were you saying i was saying that mum met him at the library we go there a lot mum likes the literature books but i like books about romances and adventures i can never understand the books mum reads did you read the same books as her when you were before you yes yes we did but i could never understand them either so dont worry about it im glad that you read a lot whats this library like its really big but a lot of tramps go there to sleep and spend a lot of time they get a book and sit down and just fall asleep they smell awful well you dont need to go near them do you best to let them keep themselves to themselves yes daddy her tone was slightly reproachful warning him that he was giving fatherly advice and that such advice was unnecessary fancy seeing a film then do you the cinema however was not open so they went to an icecream parlour at tollcross rebus watched samantha scoop five colours of icecream from a knickerbocker glory she was still at the stickinsect stage eating without putting on an ounce of weight rebus was conscious of his sagging waistband a stomach pampered and allowed to roam as it pleased he sipped cappuccino without sugar and watched from the corner of his eye as a group of boys at another table looked towards his daughter and him whispering and sniggering they pushed back their hair and smoked their cigarettes as though sucking on life itself he would have arrested them for selfafflicted growthstunting had sammy not been there their cigarettes he did not smoke when with sammy she did not like him smoking her mother also once upon a time had screamed at him to stop and had hidden his cigarettes and lighter so that he had made secret little nests of cigarettes and matches all around the house he had smoked on regardless laughing in victory when he sauntered into the room with another lit cigarette between his lips rhona screeching at him to put the bloody thing out chasing him around the furniture her hands flapping to knock the incendiary from his mouth those had been happy times times of loving conflict hows school its okay are you involved in the murder case yes god he could murder for a cigarette could tear a young male head from its body will you catch him yes what does he do to the girls daddy her eyes trying to seem casual examined the nearempty icecream glass very scrupulously he doesnt do anything to them just murders them her lips were pale suddenly she was very much his child his daughter very much in need of protection rebus wanted to put his arms around her to comfort her to tell her that the big bad world was out there not in here that she was safe thats right he said instead im glad thats all he does the boys were whistling now trying to attract her attention rebus felt his face growing red on another day any day other than this he would march up to them and ram the law into their chilled little faces but he was offduty he was enjoying an afternoon out with his daughter the freakish result of a single grunted climax that climax which had seen a lucky sperm crawling through the ooze make it all the way to the winningpost doubtless rhona would already be reaching over for her book of the day her literature she would prise the still spent body of her lover from her without a word being passed between them was her mind on her books all the time perhaps and he the lover would feel deflated and empty a vacant space but suddenly as if no form of transference had taken place that was her victory and then he would scream at her with a kiss the scream of longing of his solitary let me out let me out come on lets get out of here okay and as they passed the table of hankering boys their faces full of barely restrained lust jabbering like monkeys samantha smiled at one of them she smiled at one of them rebus sucking in fresh air wondered what his world was coming to he wondered whether his reason for believing in another reality behind this one might not be because the everyday was so frightening and so very sad if this were all there was then life was the sorriest invention of all time he could kill those boys and he wanted to smother his daughter to protect her from that which she wanted and would get he realised that he had nothing to say to her and that those boys did that he had nothing in common with her save blood while they had everything in common with her the skies were dark as wagnerian opera dark as a murderers thoughts darkening like similes while john rebuss world fell apart its time she said by his side yet so much bigger than him so much more full of life its time and indeed it was we better hurry said rebus its going to rain he felt tired and recalled that he had not slept that he had been involved in strenuous labour throughout the short night he took a taxi back to the flat sod the expense and crawled up the winding stairs to his front door the smell of cats was overpowering inside his door a letter unstamped awaited him he swore out loud the bastard was everywhere everywhere and yet invisible he ripped open the letter and read youre getting nowhere nowhere are you signed but there was no signature not in writing anyway but inside the envelope like some childs plaything lay the piece of knotted twine why are you doing this mister knot said rebus fingering the twine and just what are you doing inside the flat was like a fridge the pilotlight had blown out again part three knot the media sensing that the edinburgh strangler was not about to vanish in the night took the story by its horns and created a monster tv crews moved into some of the better hotel rooms in the city and the city was happy enough to have them it being not quite the tourist season yet tom jameson was as astute an editor as any and he had a team of four reporters working on the story he could not help noticing however that jim stevens was not on his best form he seemed uninterested never a good sign in a journalist jameson was worried stevens was the best he had a household name he would speak to him about it soon as the case grew along with the interest in it john rebus and gill templer became confined to communicating by telephone and via the occasional chance meeting in or around hq rebus hardly saw his old station now he was strictly a murdercase victim himself and was told to think about nothing else during his waking hours he thought about everything else about gill about the letters about his cars inability to pass its mot and all the time he watched anderson father of rhonas lover watched him as he grew ever more frantic for a motive a lead anything it was almost a pleasure to watch the man in action as to the letters rebus had pretty much discounted his wife and daughter a slight mark on knots last missive had been checked by the forensic boys for the price of a pint and had turned out to be blood had the man nicked his finger while cutting the twine it was yet another small mystery rebuss life was full of mysteries not the least of which was where his ten legitimate daily cigarettes went he would open his packet of a late afternoon count the contents and find that he was supposed to have smoked all ten of his ration already it was absurd he could hardly remember smoking one of the alloted ten never mind all of them yet a count of the butts in his ashtray would produce empirical evidence enough to withstand any denials on his part bloody strange though it was as though he were shutting out a part of his waking life he was stationed in the hqs incident room at the moment while jack morton poor sod was on doortodoor from his vantage point he could see how anderson was running the shambles it was little wonder the mans son had turned out to be less than bright rebus also had to deal with the many phonecalls from those of the tryingtobehelpfuls to those of the psychiccrankswhowanttoconfess and with the interviews carried out in the building itself at all hours of the day and night there were hundreds of these all to be filed and put into some kind of order of importance it was a huge task but there was always the chance that a lead would come from it so he was not allowed to slack in the hectic sweaty canteen he smoked cigarette number eleven lying to himself that it was from the next days ration and read the daily paper they were straining for new shocked adjectives now having exhausted their thesauruses the appalling mad evil crimes of the strangler this insane evil sexcrazed man they did not seem to mind that the killer had never sexually assaulted his victims gymslip maniac what are our police doing all the technology in the world cannot replace the reassurance offered by bobbies on the beat we need them now that was from james stevens our crime correspondent rebus remembered the stocky drunk man from the party he recalled the look on stevens face when he had been told rebuss name that was strange everything was bloody strange rebus put down the newspaper reporters again he wished gill well in her job he studied the blurred photograph on the front of the tabloid it showed a crophaired unintelligent child she was grinning nervously as though snapped at a moments notice there was a slight endearing gap between her front teeth poor nicola turner aged twelve a pupil at one of the southsides comprehensive schools she had no attachments to either of the other dead girls there were no visible links between them and what was more the killer had moved up a year choosing a high school kid this time so there was to be no regularity about his choice of agegroups the randomness continued unabated it was driving anderson nuts but anderson would never admit that the killer had his beloved police force tied in knots tied in absolute knots yet there had to be clues there had to be rebus drank his coffee and felt his head spin he was feeling like the detective in a cheap thriller and wished that he could turn to the last page and stop all his confusion all the death and the madness and the spinning in his ears back in the incident room he gathered together reports of phonecalls that had come in since he had left for his break the telephonists were working flat out and near them a telexmachine was almost constantly printing out some new piece of information thought useful to the case and sent on by other forces throughout the country anderson pushed his way through the noise as if swimming in treacle a car is what we need rebus a car i want all the sightings of men driving away with children collated and on my desk in an hour i want that bastards car yes sir and he was off again wading through treacle deep enough to drown any normal human being but not indestructible anderson impervious to any danger that made him a liability thought rebus sifting through the piles of paper on his desk which were meant to be in some system of order cars anderson wanted cars and cars he would have there were swearonabible descriptions of a man in a blue escort a white capri a purple mini a yellow bmw a silver tr a converted ambulance an icecream van the telephonecaller sounding italian and wishing to remain anonymous and a great big rollsroyce with personalized number plates yes lets put them all into the computer and have it run a check of every blue escort white capri and rollsroyce in britain and with all that information at our fingertips then what more doortodoor more gathering of telephonecalls and interviews more paperwork and bullshit never mind anderson would swim through it all indomitable amidst all the craziness of his personal world and at the end of it all he would come out looking clean and shiny and untouchable like an advertisement for washing powder three cheers hip hip rebus had not enjoyed bullshit during his army days either and there had been plenty of it then but he had been a good soldier a very good soldier when finally they had got down to soldiering but then in a fit of madness he had applied to join the special air squadron and there had been very little bullshit there and an incredible amount of savagery they had made him run from the railway station to the camp behind a sergeant in his jeep they had tortured him with twentyhour marches brutal instructors the works and when gordon reeve and he had made the grade the sas had tested them just that little bit further just that inch too far confining them interrogating them starving them poisoning them and all for a little piece of worthless information a few words that would show they had cracked two naked shivering animals with sacks tied over their heads lying together to keep warm i want that list in an hour rebus called anderson walking past again he would have his list he would have his pound of flesh jack morton arrived back looking footweary and not at all amused with life he slouched across to rebus a sheaf of papers under his arm a cigarette in the other hand look at this he said lifting his leg rebus saw the footlong gash in the material what happened to you then what do you think i got chased by a great fucking alsatian thats what happened to me will i get a penny for this will i hell you could try claiming for it anyway whats the point id just be made to look stupid morton dragged a chair across to the table what are you working on he asked seating himself with visible relief cars lots of them fancy a drink later on rebus looked at his watch considering might do jack thing is im hoping to make a date for tonight with the ravishing inspector templer how did you know that rebus was genuinely surprised come on john you cant keep that sort of thing a secret not from policemen better watch your step mind rules and regulations you know yes i know does anderson know about this has he said anything no then he cant can he youd make a good policeman son youre wasted in this job youre telling me dad rebus busied himself with lighting cigarette number twelve it was true you couldnt keep anything secret in a police station not from the lower ranks anyway he hoped anderson and the chief wouldnt find out about it though any luck with the doortodoor he asked what do you think morton you have an annoying habit of answering a question with another question have i it must be all this work then spending my days asking questions mustnt it rebus examined his cigarettes he found he was smoking number thirteen this was becoming ridiculous where had number twelve gone ill tell you john theres nothing to be had out there not a sniff of a lead no ones seen anything no one knows anything its almost like a conspiracy maybe thats what it is then a conspiracy and has it been established that all three murders were the work of a single individual yes the chief inspector did not believe in wasting words especially with the press he sat like a rock behind the table his hands clasped before him gill templer on his right her glasses an affectation really her vision was nearperfect were in her bag she never wore them while on duty unless the occasion demanded it why had she worn them to the party they were like jewellery to her she found it interesting too to gauge different reactions towards her when she was and was not wearing them when she explained this to her friends they looked at her askance as if she were joking perhaps it all went back to her first true love who had told her that girls who wore glasses seemed in his experience to be the best fucks that had been fifteen years ago but she still saw the look on his face the smile the glint she saw too her own reaction shock at his use of the word fuck she could smile at that now these days she swore as much as her male colleagues again gauging their reaction everything was a game to gill templer everything but the job she had not become an inspector through luck or looks but through hard efficient work and the will to climb as high as they would let her go and now she sat with her chief inspector who was a token presence at these gatherings it was gill who made up the handouts who briefed the chief inspector who handled the media afterwards and they all knew it a chief inspector might add weight of seniority to the proceedings but gill templer it was who could give the journalists their extras the useful snippets left unsaid nobody knew that better than jim stevens he sat to the back of the room smoking without removing the cigarette from his mouth once he took little of the chief inspectors words in he could wait still he jotted down a sentence or two for future use he was still a newsman after all old habits never died the photographer a keen teenager nervously changing lenses every few minutes had departed with his roll of film stevens looked around for someone he might have a drink with later on they were all here all the old boys from the scottish press and the english correspondents too scottish english greek it didnt matter pressmen always looked like nothing other than pressmen their faces were robust they smoked their shirts were a day or two old they did not look wellpaid yet were extremely wellpaid and with more fringe benefits than most but they worked for their money worked hard at building up contacts squeezing into nooks and crannies stepping on toes he watched gill templer what would she know about john rebus and would she be willing to tell they were still friends after all her and him still friends maybe not good friends certainly not good friends though he had tried and now she and rebus wait until he nailed that bastard if there was anything there to nail of course there was something there to nail he could sense it then her eyes would be opened truly opened then they would see what they would see he was already preparing the headline something to do with brothers in law brothers in crime yes that had a nice ring to it the rebus brothers put behind bars and all his own work he turned his attention back to the murder case but it was all too easy too easy to sit down and write about police inefficiency about the conjectured maniac still it was bread and butter for the moment and there was always gill templer to stare at gill he caught her as she was getting into her car hello jim cold businesslike listen i just wanted to apologise for my behaviour at the party he was out of breath after a brief jog across the car park and the words came slowly from his burning chest i mean i was a bit pissed anyway sorry but gill knew him too well knew that this was merely a prelude to a question or request suddenly she felt a little sorry for him sorry for his fair thick hair which needed a wash sorry for his short stocky she had once thought it powerful body for the way he trembled now and again as though cold but the pity soon wore off it had been a hard day why wait till now to tell me you could have said something at sundays briefing he shook his head i didnt make sundays briefing i was a bit hungover you must have noticed i wasnt there why should i have noticed that plenty of other people were there jim that cut him but he let it pass well anyway he said sorry okay fine she made to step into her car can i buy you a drink or something to cement the apology so to speak sorry jim im busy meeting that man rebus maybe look after yourself gill that one might not be what he seems she straightened up again i mean said stevens just take care all right he wouldnt say any more just yet having planted a seed of suspicion he would give it time to grow then he would question her closely and perhaps then she would be willing to tell he turned away from her and walked hands in pockets towards the sutherland bar at edinburghs main public lending library a large unstuffy old building sandwiched between a bookshop and a bank the tramps were settling down for a days snoozing they came here as though waiting out fate itself to see through the few days of absolute poverty before their next amount of state benefit was due this money they would then spend in a day perhaps if stretched two days of festivity wine women and songs to an unappreciative public the attitudes of the library staff towards these downandouts ranged from the immensely intolerant usually voiced by the older members of staff to the sadly reflective the youngest librarians it was however a public library and as long as the worldlywise travellers picked up a book at the start of the day there was nothing that could be done about them unless they became rowdy in which case a securityman was quickly on the scene so they slept in the comfortable seats sometimes frowned upon by those who could not help wondering if this was what andrew carnegie had in mind when he put up the finance for the first public libraries all those years ago the sleepers did not mind these stares and they dreamed on though nobody bothered to inquire what it was they dreamed of and no one thought them important they were not however allowed into the childrens section of the library indeed any browsing adult not dragging a child in tow was looked at askance in the childrens section and especially since the murders of those poor wee girls the librarians talked about it amongst themselves hanging was the answer they were agreed on that and indeed hanging was being discussed again in parliament as happens whenever a mass murderer emerges out of the shadows of civilized britain the most oftrepeated statement amongst the people of edinburgh however did not concern hanging at all it was put cogently by one of the librarians but here in edinburgh its unthinkable mass murderers belonged to the smoky back streets of the south and the midlands not to scotlands picturepostcard city listeners nodded horrified and sad that this was something they all had to face each and every morningside lady in her faded hat of gentility every thug who roamed the streets of the housingestates every lawyer banker broker shopassistant and vendor of evening newspapers vigilante groups had been hastily set up and just as hastily disbanded by the swiftly reacting police this was not said the chief constable the answer be vigilant by all means but the law was never to be taken into ones own hands he rubbed together his own gloved hands as he spoke and some newspapermen wondered if his subconscious were not washing its freudian hands of the whole affair jim stevens editor decided to put it thus lock up your daughters and left it pretty much at that indeed the daughters were being locked up some of them were being kept away from school by their parents or were under heavy escort all the way there and all the way back home with an additional check on their welfare at lunchtime the childrens section of the main lending library had grown deathly quiet of late so that the librarians there had little to do with their days except talk about hanging and read the lurid speculations in the british press the british press had cottoned onto the fact that edinburgh had a rather less than genteel past they ran reminders of deacon brodie the inspiration it was said behind stevensons jekyll amp hyde burke and hare and anything else that came to light in their researches right down to the ghosts that haunted a suspicious number of the citys georgian houses these tales kept the imaginations of the librarians alive while there was a lull in their duties they made sure each to buy a different paper so that they could glean as many pieces of information as possible but were disillusioned by how often journalists seemed to swap a central story between them so that an identical piece would appear in two or three different papers it was as if a conspiracy of writers was at work some children however did still come to the library the vast majority of these were accompanied by mother father or minder but one or two still came alone this evidence of the foolhardiness of some parents and their offspring further disturbed the fainthearted librarians who would ask the children appalled where their mothers and fathers were samantha rarely came to the librarys childrens section preferring older books but she did so today to get away from her mother a male librarian came over to her as she pored over the most childish stuff are you here on your own dear he said samantha recognised him hed been working here ever since she could remember my mums upstairs she said im glad to hear it stick close to her thats my advice she nodded inwardly fuming her mother had given her a similar lecture only five minutes before she wasnt a child but no one seemed prepared to accept that when the librarian went over to talk with another girl samantha took out the book she wanted and gave her ticket to the old lady librarian with the dyed hair whom the children called mrs slocum then she hurried up the steps to the librarys reference section where her mother was busy looking for a critical study of george eliot george eliot her mother had told her was a woman who had written books of tremendous realism and psychological depth at a time when men were supposed to be the great realists and psychologists and women were supposed to be for nothing but the housework that was why she had been forced to call herself george to get published to counter these attempts at indoctrination samantha had brought from the childrens section an illustrated book about a boy who flies away on a giant cat and has adventures in a fantasy land beyond his dreams that she hoped would piss her mother off in the reference section a lot of people sat at desks coughing their coughs echoing around the hushed hall her mother glasses perched on her nose looking very much like a schoolteacher argued with a librarian about some book she had ordered samantha walked between the rows of desks glancing at what people were reading and writing she wondered why people spent so much time reading books when there were other things to be doing she wanted to travel round the world perhaps then she would be ready to sit in dull rooms poring over these old books but not until then he watched her as she moved up and down the rows of desks he stood with his face half to her looking as if he were studying a shelf of books on angling she wasnt looking around her though there was no danger she was in her own little world a world of her own design and her own rules that was fine all the girls were like that but this one was with someone he could see that he took a book from the shelf and flicked through it one chapter caught his eye and turned his thoughts away from samantha it was a chapter dealing with flyknotting there were lots of designs for knots lots of them another briefing rebus enjoyed the briefings now for there was always the possibility that gill would be present and that afterwards they would be able to go for a cup of coffee together last night they had eaten late at a restaurant but she had been tired and had looked at him strangely quizzing him a little more even than usual with her eyes not wearing her spectacles at first but then slipping them on halfway through the meal i want to see what im eating but he knew she could see well enough the glasses were a psychological strengthener they protected her perhaps he was just being paranoid perhaps she had been tired merely but he suspected something more though he could not think what had he insulted her in some way snubbed her without realising he was tired himself they went to their separate flats and lay awake wanting not to be alone then he dreamed the dream of the kiss and awoke to the usual result the sweat tainting his forehead his lips moist would he awake to another letter to another murder now he felt lousy from lack of sleep but still he enjoyed the briefing and not just because of gill there was the inkling of a lead at long last and anderson was anxious to have it substantiated a pale blue ford escort said anderson behind him sat the chief superintendent whose presence seemed to be unnerving the chief inspector a pale blue ford escort anderson wiped his brow we have reports of such a car being seen in the haymarket district on the evening when victim number ones body was found and we have two sightings of a man and a girl the girl apparently asleep in such a car on the night that victim number three went missing andersons eyes came up from the document before him to gaze it seemed into the eyes of every officer present i want this made top priority or better i want to know the ownership details of every blue ford escort in the lothians and i want that information sooner than possible now i know youve been working flat out as it is but with a little extra push we can nail chummy before he does any more killing to this end inspector hartley has drawn up a roster if your names on it drop what youre doing and get busy on tracing this car any questions gill templer was scribbling notes in her tiny notepad perhaps concocting a story for the press would they want to release this probably not not straight away they would wait first to see if anything came of the initial search if nothing did then the public would be asked to help rebus didnt fancy this at all gathering ownership details trekking out to the suburbs and massinterviewing the suspects trying to nose whether they were probable or possible suspects then perhaps a second interview no he did not fancy this at all he fancied accompanying gill templer back to his cave and making love to her her back was all he could see of her from his present vantage point by the door he had been last into the room yet again having stayed at the pub a little longer than anticipated it had been a prior appointment lunch liquid with jack morton morton told him about the slow steady progress of the outdoor inquiry fourhundred people interviewed whole families checked and rechecked the usual cranks and amoral groups examined and not a jot of actual light had been thrown on the case but now they had a car or at least thought they did the evidence was tenuous but it was there the likeness of a fact and that was something rebus felt a little proud of his own part in the investigation for it had been his painstaking crossreferencing of sightings which had thrown up this slender link he wanted to tell gill all about it then arrange a rendezvous for later in the week he wanted to see her again to see anybody again for his flat was becoming a prisoncell he would slouch home of a late evening or early morning tip onto his bed and sleep not bothering these days to tidy or to read or to buy or even steal any foodstuffs he had neither the time nor the energy instead he ate from kebabhouses and chipshops earlymorning bakeries and chocolatedispensers his face was becoming paler than usual and his stomach groaned as though there were no skin left to distend he still shaved and put on a tie as a matter of necessary propriety but that was about it anderson had noticed that his shirts were not as clean as they might have been but had said nothing so far for one thing rebus was in his good books begetter of the lead and for another anyone could see that in rebuss present mood he was likely to take a swing at any detractor the meeting was breaking up there were no questions in anyones mind except the obvious one when do we start cracking up rebus hovered just outside the door waiting for gill she came out in the last group in quiet conversation with wallace and anderson the superintendent had his arm around her waist playfully gently ushering her out of the room rebus glared at the group this motley crew of superior officers he watched gills face but she did not seem to notice him rebus felt himself slide back down the snake on the board right down to the bottom line again back into the heap so this was love who was kidding who as the group of three walked up the corridor rebus stood there like a jilted teenager and cursed and cursed and cursed hed been let down again let down dont let me down john please please please please and a screaming in his memory he felt dizzy his ears ringing with the sea staggering a little he caught hold of the wall trying to take comfort in its solidity but it seemed to be throbbing he breathed hard thinking back to his days on the rockstrewn beach recovering from his breakdown the sea had been in his ears then too the floor adjusted itself slowly people walked by quizzically but no one stopped to help sod them all and sod gill templer too he could manage on his own he could manage on his own god save him he would be okay all he needed was a cigarette and some coffee but really he needed their pats on the back their congratulations on a job well done their acceptance he needed someone to assure him that it was all going to be all right that he would be all right that evening a couple of afterduty drinks under his belt already he decided to make a night of it morton had to go off on some errand but that was okay too rebus didnt need company he walked along princes street breathing in the evenings promise he was a free man after all just as free as any of the kids hanging about outside the hamburger bar they preened and joked and waited waiting for what he knew that waiting for the time to come when they could go home and sleep into tomorrow he too was waiting in his own way killing time in the rutherford arms he met a couple of drinkers whom he knew from evenings like this just after rhona had left him he drank with them for an hour sucking at the beer as though it were mothers milk they talked about football about horseracing about their jobs and the whole scene brought tranquillity to rebus it was a normal evenings conversation and he embraced it greedily throwing in his own snippets of news but enough was as good as a feast and he walked briskly drunkenly out of the bar leaving his friends with promises of another time edging his way down the street towards leith jim stevens sitting at the bar watched in the mirror as michael rebus left his drink on his table and went to the toilet a few seconds later the mystery man followed him inside having been sitting at another table it looked as though they were meeting to discuss the next swapover both seeming too casual actually to be carrying anything incriminating stevens smoked his cigarette waiting in less than a minute rebus reappeared coming up to the bar for another drink john rebus pushing through the pubs swingdoors could not believe his eyes he slapped his brother on the shoulder mickey what are you doing here michael rebus nearly died at that moment his heart leapt high into his throat causing him to cough just having a drink john but he looked guilty as hell he was sure of that you gave me a fright he went on trying to smile hitting me like that a brotherly slap thats all it was what are you drinking while the brothers were in conversation the man slipped out of the toilet and walked out of the bar his eyes never glancing to left or right stevens watched him go but had other things on his mind now he could not let the policeman see him he turned away from the bar as if searching for a face amongst the people at the tables now he was sure the policeman had to be in on it the whole sequence of actions had been very slick indeed but now he was sure so youre doing a show down here john rebus cheered by his previous drinks now felt that things were going right for a change he was reunited with his brother for that drink they had always been promising themselves he ordered whiskies with lager chasers this is a quartergill pub he told michael thats a decent size of a measure michael smiled smiled smiled as though his life depended upon it his mind was racing and jumbled the last thing he needed was another drink if word of this got out it would seem too unlikely to his edinburgh connection too unlikely he michael would have his legs broken for this if it ever was to get out he had been warned and what was john doing here anyway he seemed complacent enough drunk even but what if it were all a setup what if his connection had already been arrested outside he felt as he had when as a child he had stolen money from his fathers wallet denying the crime for weeks afterwards his heart heavy with guilt guilty guilty guilty john rebus meantime drank on and chatted unaware of the sudden change of atmosphere the sudden interest in him all he cared about was the whisky in front of him and the fact that michael was about to go off and do a show at a local bingo hall mind if i come along he asked i might as well see how my brother earns his crust sure said michael he toyed with the whisky glass id better not drink this john ive got to keep my mind clear of course you have need to let the mysterious sensations flood over you rebus made an action with his hands as though hypnotising michael his eyes wide smiling and jim stevens picked up his cigarettes and his back to them still left the smoky noisy public house if only it had been quieter in there if only he could have heard what they were saying rebus saw him go i think i know him he told michael gesturing towards the door with his head hes a reporter on the local rag michael rebus tried to smile smile smile but it seemed to him that his world was falling apart the rio grande bingo hall had been a cinema the front twelve rows of seats had been taken out and bingo boards and stools put in their place but to the back of these were still many rows of dusty red seats and the balcony seating was completely intact john rebus said that he preferred to sit upstairs so that he would not distract michael he followed an elderly man and his wife upstairs the seats looked comfortable but as he eased himself into the second row rebus felt springs jar against his buttocks he moved around a little trying to get comfortable and settled finally for a position where one cheek supported most of his weight there seemed a good enough crowd downstairs but up here in the gloom of the neglected balcony there were only the old couple and himself then he heard shoes tapping on the aisle they paused for a second before a hefty woman slid into the second row rebus was forced to look up and saw her smiling at him mind if i sit here she said not waiting for anyone are you her look was hopeful rebus shook his head smiling politely thought not she said sitting down beside him and he smiling he had never seen michael smile so much or so uneasily was it so embarrassing for him to meet his elder brother no there had to be more to it than that michaels had been the smile of the smalltime thief caught yet again they needed to talk i come here a lot to the bingo but i thought this might be a good laugh you know ever since my husband died meaningful pause well its not been the same i like to get out now and again you know everybody does dont they so i thought id come along dont know what made me come upstairs fate i suppose her smile broadened rebus smiled back she was in her early forties a little too much makeup and scent but quite wellpreserved she talked as if she had not spoken to anyone in days as if it were important for her to establish that she could still speak and be listened to and understood rebus felt sorry for her he saw a little of himself in her not much but almost enough so what are you doing here she was forcing him to speak just here for the show same as you are he didnt dare say that his brother was the hypnotist that would have left too many avenues for a response you like this sort of thing do you ive never been before neither have i she smiled again conspiratorially this time she had found that they had something in common thankfully the lights were going down what lighting there was and a spot had come up on the stage someone was introducing the show the woman opened her handbag and produced a noisy bag of boiled sweets she offered one to rebus rebus found himself to his own surprise enjoying the show but not half as much as the woman beside him was she howled with laughter as one willing participant his trousers left on the stage pretended to swim up and down the aisles another guineapig was made to believe that he was ravenously hungry another that she was a professional striptease artiste at one of her bookings another that he was falling asleep still enjoying the show rebus began to nod off himself it was the effect of too much alcohol too little sleep and the warm broody darkness of the theatre only the final applause of the audience awoke him michael sweating in his glittery stage suit took the applause as though addicted to it coming back for another bow when most of the people were leaving their seats he had told his brother that he had to get home quickly that he would not see him after the show that he would phone him sometime for his reaction and john rebus had slept through much of it he felt refreshed however and could hear himself accepting the perfumed womans offer of a one for the road drink at a local bar they left the theatre arminarm smiling at something rebus felt relaxed a child again this woman was treating him like her son really and he was happy enough to be coddled a final drink and then hed go home just one drink jim stevens watched them leave the theatre it was becoming very strange indeed rebus seemed to be ignoring his brother now and he had a woman with him what did it all mean one thing it meant was that gill should be told about it at some opportune moment stevens smiling added it to his collection of such moments it had been a good nights work so far so where in the evening had motherlove changed into physical contact in that pub perhaps where her reddened fingers had bitten into his thigh outside in the cooling air when he wrapped his arms around her neck in a fumbled attempt at a kiss or here in her musty flat smelling still of her husband where rebus and she lie across an old settee and exchange tongues no matter its too late to regret anything and too early so he slouches after her when she retires to her bedroom he tumbles into the huge doublebed springy and covered in thick blankets and quilts he watches her undress in darkness the bed feels like one he had as a kid when a hotwaterbottle was all he had to keep the chill off and mounds of gritty blankets puffedout quilts heavy and suffocating tiring in themselves no matter rebus did not enjoy the particulars of her heavy body and was forced to think of everything in the abstract his hands on her wellsuckled breasts reminded him of late nights with rhona her calves were thick unlike gills and her face was worn with too much living but she was a woman and she was with him so he squeezed her into an abstract and tried to make them both happy but the heaviness of the bedding oppressed him caging him making him feel small and trapped and isolated from the world he fought against it fought against the memory of gordon reeve and he as they sat in solitary listening to the screams of those around them but enduring always enduring and reunited finally having won having lost lost everything his heart was pounding to her grunts now some distance away it seemed he felt the first wave of that absolute repulsion hit him in the stomach like a truncheon and his hands slid around the hanging yielding throat beneath him the moans were inhuman now catlike keening his hands pushed a little the fingers finding their own purchase against skin and sheet they locked him up and they threw away the key they pushed him to his death and they poisoned him he should not have been alive he should have died back then back in the rank animal cells with their powerhoses and their constant questionings but he had survived he had survived and he was coming he alone all alone and the screaming screaming rebus became aware of the gurgling sounds beneath him just before his head started to fry he fell over onto the gasping figure and lost consciousness it was like a switch being flipped he awoke in a white room it reminded him very much of the hospital room in which he had awoken after his nervous breakdown all those years ago there were muffled noises from outside he sat up his head throbbing what had happened christ that woman that poor woman he had tried to kill her drunk way too drunk merciful god he had tried to strangle her hadnt he why in gods name had he done that why a doctor pushed open his door ah mister rebus good youre awake were about to move you into one of the wards how do you feel his pulse was taken simple exhaustion we think simple nervous exhaustion your friend who called for the ambulance my friend yes she said that you just collapsed and from what we can gather from your employers youve been working pretty hard on this dreadful murder hunt simple exhaustion what you need is a break wheres my my friend no idea at home i expect and according to her i just collapsed thats right rebus felt immediate relief flooding through him she had not told them she had not told them then his head began to pulse again the doctors wrists were hairy and scrubbed clean he slipped a thermometer into rebuss mouth smiling did he know what rebus had been doing prior to the blackout or had his friend dressed him before calling the ambulance he had to contact the woman he didnt know where she stayed not exactly but the ambulancemen would know and he could check exhaustion rebus did not feel exhausted he was beginning to feel rested and though slightly unnerved quite unworried about life had they given him anything while he was asleep can i see a newspaper he muttered past the thermometer ill get an orderly to fetch you one is there anyone you wish us to contact any close relative or friend rebus thought of michael no he said theres nobody to contact all i want is a newspaper fair enough the thermometer was removed the details noted how long do you want to keep me in here two or three days i may want you to see an analyst forget the analyst ill need some books to read well see what we can do rebus settled back then having decided to let things take their course he would lie here resting though he needed no rest and would let the rest of them worry about the murder case sod them all sod anderson sod wallace sod gill templer but then he remembered his hands slipping around that ageing throat and he shivered it was as though his mind were not his own had he been about to kill that woman should he see the analyst after all the questions made his headache worse he tried not to think about anything at all but three figures kept coming back to him his old friend gordon reeve his new lover gill templer and the woman he had betrayed her for and nearly strangled they danced in his head until the dance became blurred then he fell asleep john she walked quickly to his bed fruit and vitamindrink in her hands she had makeup on her face and was wearing strictly offduty clothes she pecked his cheek and he could smell her french perfume he could also see down the front of her silk blouse he felt a little guilty hello di templer he said here lifting one edge of the bedcover get in she laughed dragging across a sternlooking chair other visitors were entering the ward their smiles and quiet voices redolent of illness an illness rebus did not feel how are you john terrible what have you brought me grapes bananas diluting orange nothing very imaginative im afraid rebus picked a grape from the bunch and popped it into his mouth setting aside the trashy novel in which he had been painfully involved i dont know inspector the things i have to do to get a date with you rebus shook his head wearily gill was smiling but nervously we were worried about you john what happened i fainted in the home of a friend by all accounts its nothing very serious i have a few weeks to live gills smile was warm they say its overwork then she paused whats all this inspector stuff rebus shrugged then looked sulky his guilt was mixing with the remembrance of that snub he had been given that snub which had started the whole ball rolling he turned into a patient again weakly slumping against his pillow im a very ill man gill too ill to answer questions well in that case i wont bother to slip you the cigarettes sent by jack morton rebus sat up again bless that man where are they she brought two packs from her jacket pocket and slipped them beneath the bedclothes he gripped her hand i missed you gill she smiled and did not withdraw the hand limitless visitingtime being a prerogative of the police gill stayed for two hours talking about her past asking him about his own she had been born on an airforce base in wiltshire just after the war she told rebus that her father had been an engineer in the raf my dad rebus said was in the army during the war i was conceived while he was on one of his last leaves he was a stage hypnotist by profession people usually raised an eyebrow at that but not gill templer he used to work the musichalls and theatres doing summer stints in blackpool and ayr and places like that so we were always sure of a summer holiday away from fife she sat with her head cocked to one side content to be told stories the ward was quiet once the other visitors had obeyed the leavingbell a nurse pushed around a trolley with a huge battered pot of tea on it gill was given a cup the nurse smiling at her in sisterhood shes a nice kid that nurse said rebus relaxed he had been given two pills one blue and one brown and they were making him drowsy she reminds me of a girl i knew when i was in the paras how long were you in the paras john six years no eight years it was what made you leave what made him leave rhona had asked him the same question over and over her curiosity piqued by the feeling that he had something to hide some monstrous skeleton in his closet i dont know really its hard to remember that far back i was picked for special training and i didnt like it and this was the truth he had no use for memories of his training the reek of fear and mistrust the screaming that screaming in his memory let me out the echo of solitary well said gill if my memory serves me right ive got a case waiting for me back at basecamp that reminds me he said i think i saw your friend last night the reporter stevens wasnt it he was in a pub the same time i was strange not so very strange thats his kind of huntingground funny hes a bit like you in some ways not as sexy though she smiled and pecked his cheek again rising from the metal chair ill try to drop in again before they let you out but you know what its like i cant make any concrete promises ds rebus standing she seemed taller than rebus had imagined her her hair fell forward onto his face for another kiss full on the lips this time and he staring at the dark cleft between her breasts he felt a little tired so tired he forced his eyes to remain open while she walked away her heels clacking on the tiled floor while the nurses floated past like ghosts on their rubbersoled shoes he pushed himself up so that he could watch her legs retreat she had nice legs he had remembered that much he remembered them gripping his sides the feet resting on his buttocks he remembered her hair falling across the pillow like a turner seascape he remembered her voice hissing in his ears that hissing oh yes john oh john yes yes yes why did you leave the army as she turned over turning into the woman with the choking cries of his climax why did you oh oh oh oh oh yes the safety of dreams the editors loved what the edinburgh strangler was doing for the circulations of their newspapers they loved the way his story grew almost organically as though carefully nurtured the modus operandi had altered ever so slightly for the killing of nicola turner the strangler had it seemed tied a knot in the cord prior to strangulation this knot had pressed heavily on the girls throat bruising it the police did not consider this of much significance they were too busy checking through the records of blue ford escorts to be busy with a slight detail of technique they were out there checking every blue escort in the area questioning every owner every driver gill templer had released details of the car to the press hoping for a huge public response it came neighbours reported their neighbours fathers their sons wives their husbands and husbands their wives there were over twohundred blue escorts to investigate and if nothing came of that they would be reinvestigated before moving on to other colours of ford escort other makes of lightblue saloon car it might take months certainly it would take weeks jack morton another xeroxed list folded in his hand had consulted his doctor about swollen feet the doctor had told him that he walked too much in cheap unsupportive shoes this morton already knew he had now interviewed so many suspects that it was all becoming a blur to him they all looked the same and acted the same nervous deferential innocent if only the strangler would make a mistake there were no clues worth going on morton suspected the car to be a false trail no clues worth going on he remembered john rebuss anonymous letters there are clues everywhere could that be true of this case could the clues be too big to notice or too abstract certainly it was a rare an extraordinarily rare murder case that did not have some bumper extravagant clue lying about somewhere just waiting to be picked up he was damned if he knew where this one was though and that was why he had visited his doctor hoping for some sympathy and a few days off rebus had landed on his feet again lucky sod morton envied him his illness he parked his car on a doubleyellow line outside the library and sauntered in the great front hall reminded him of the days when he had used this library himself clutching picturebooks borrowed from the childrens section it used to be situated downstairs he wondered if it still was his mother would give him the busfare and he would come into town ostensibly to change his library books but really so that he could wander the streets for an hour or two savouring the taste of what it would be like to be grown up and free he would trail american tourists taking note of their swaggering selfconfidence and their bulging wallets and waistbands he would watch them as they photographed greyfriars bobbys statue across from the kirkyard he had stared long and hard at the statue of the small dog and had felt nothing he had read of covenanters of deacon brodie of public executions on the high street wondering what kind of city this was and what kind of country he shook his head now past caring about fantasies and went to the information desk hello mister morton he turned to find a girl more a young lady really standing before him a book clasped to her small chest he frowned its me samantha rebus his eyes went wide goodness so it is well well youve certainly grown since i last saw you mind you that must have been a year or two back how are you im fine thanks im here with my mother are you here on police business something like that yes morton could feel her eyes burning into him god she had her fathers eyes all right he had left his mark hows dad keeping to tell or not to tell why not tell her then again was it his place to tell her hes fine so far as i know he said knowing this to be seventypercent truth im just going down to the teenagers section mums in the reference room its dead boring in there ill go with you thats just where i was headed she smiled at him pleased about something that was going on in her adolescent head and jack morton had the thought that she wasnt at all like her father she was far too nice and polite a fourth girl was missing the outcome seemed a foregone conclusion no bookie would have given odds we need special vigilance stressed anderson more officers are being drafted in tonight remember the officers present looked holloweyed and demoralized if and when he kills this victim he will attempt to dispose of the body and if we can spot him doing that or if any member of the public can spot him doing that just once then weve got him anderson slapped a fist into his open hand nobody seemed very cheered so far the strangler had dumped three corpses quite successfully in different areas of the city oxgangs haymarket colinton the police could not be everywhere though these days it seemed to the public that they were no matter how hard they tried again continued the chief inspector consulting a file the recent abduction seems to have little enough in common with the others the victims name is helen abbot eight years of age a bit younger than the others youll notice lightbrown shoulderlength hair last seen with her mother in a princes street store the mother says that the girl simply disappeared one minute there the next minute gone as was the case with the second victim gill templer thinking this over later found it curious the girls could not themselves have been abducted actually in the shops that would have been impossible without screams without witnesses one member of the public had come forward to say that a girl resembling mary andrews the second victim had been seen by him climbing the steps from the national gallery up towards the mound she had been alone and had seemed happy enough in which case gill mused the girl had sneaked away from her mother but why for some secret rendezvous with someone she had known someone who had turned out to be her killer in that case it seemed likely that all the girls had known their murderer so they had to have something in common different schools different friends different ages what was the common denominator she admitted defeat when her head started to hurt besides she had reached johns street and had other things to think about he had sent her here to collect some clean clothes for his release and to see if there were any mail as well as to check that the central heating was working still he had given her his key and as she climbed the stairs pinching her nose against the pervasive smell of cats she felt a bond between john rebus and herself she wondered if the relationship were about to turn serious he was a nice man but a little hungup a little secretive maybe that was what she liked she opened his door scooped up the few letters lying on the hallcarpet and made a quick tour of the flat standing by the bedroom door she recalled the passion of that night the odour of which seemed to cling in the air still the pilotlight was lit he would be surprised to learn that what a lot of books he had but then his wife had been an english teacher she lifted some of them off the floor and arranged them on the empty shelves of the wallunit in the kitchen she made herself some coffee and sat down to drink it black looking over the mail one bill one circular and one typed letter posted in edinburgh and three days ago at that she stuffed the letters into her bag and went to inspect the wardrobe samanthas room she noted was still locked more memories pushed safely away poor john jim stevens had far too much work to do the edinburgh strangler was proving himself a meaty individual you couldnt ignore the bastard even if you felt you had better things to do stevens had a staff of three working with him on the newspapers daily reports and features child abuse in britain today was the flavour of tomorrows piece the figures were horrifying enough but more horrifying yet was the sense of biding time waiting for the dead girl to turn up waiting for the next one to go missing edinburgh was a ghost town children were kept indoors those allowed out scuttling through the streets like creatures under chase stevens wanted to turn his attentions to the drugs case the mounting evidence the police connection he wanted to but there simply was not the time tom jameson was on his back every hour of the day roaming through the office wheres that copy jim its about time you earned your keep jim whens the next briefing jim stevens was burned out by the end of each and every day he decided that his work on the rebus case had to stop for the moment which was a pity because with the police at full stretch working on the murders the field was left wide open for any and all other crimes including pushing drugs the edinburgh mafia must be having a fieldday he had used the story of the leith bordello hoping for some information in return but the big boys appeared not to be playing well sod them his time would come when she arrived in the ward rebus was reading through a bible courtesy of the hospital when the sister had found out about his request she had asked him if he wished to speak to a priest or a minister but this offer he had declined strenuously he was quite content more than content to flick through some of the better passages in the old testament refreshing his memory of their power and their moral strength he read the stories of moses samson and david before coming to the book of job here he found a power he could not remember having encountered before when an innocent man suddenly dies god laughs god gave the world to the wicked he made all the judges blind and if god didnt do it who did if i smile and try to forget my pain all my suffering comes back to haunt me i know that god does hold me guilty since i am held guilty why should i bother no soap can wash away my sins rebus felt his spine shiver though the ward itself was oppressively warm and his throat cried out for water as he poured some of the tepid liquid into a plastic beaker he saw gill coming towards him on quieter heels than previously she was smiling bringing what joy there was into the ward with her a few of the men eyed her appreciatively rebus felt glad all of a sudden to be leaving this place today he put the bible aside and greeted her with a kiss on the nape of her neck what have you got there he took the parcel from her and found it to contain his change of clothes thanks he said i didnt think this shirt was clean though it wasnt she laughed and pulled across a chair nothing was id to wash and iron all your clothes they constituted a health hazard youre an angel he said putting the parcel aside speaking of which what were you reading in the book she tapped the red fakeleather binding of the bible oh nothing much job actually i read it once a long time ago it seems more frightening now though the man who begins to doubt who shouts out against his god looking for a response and who gets one god gave the world to the wicked he says at one point and why should i bother at another it sounds interesting but he goes on bothering yes thats the incredible thing tea arrived the young nurse handing gill her cup there was a plate of biscuits for them ive brought you some letters from the flat and heres your key she held the small yale key towards him but he shook his head keep it he said please ive got a spare one they studied one another all right gill said finally i will thanks with that she handed him the three letters he sorted through them in a second hes started sending them by mail i see rebus tore open the latest bulletin this guy he said is haunting me mister knot i call him my own personal anonymous crank gill looked interested as rebus read through the letter it was longer than usual you still havent guessed have you youve no ideas not an idea in your head and its almost over now almost over dont say ive not given you a chance you can never say that signed rebus pulled a small matchstick cross out of the envelope ah mister cross today i see well thank god hes nearly finished getting bored i suppose what is all this john havent i told you about my anonymous letters its not a very exciting story how long has this been going on gill having studied the letter was now examining the envelope six weeks maybe a little longer why well its just that this letter was posted on the day helen abbot went missing oh rebus reached for the envelope and looked at its postmark edinburgh lothian fife borders it read a big enough area he thought again of michael i dont suppose you can remember when you received the other letters what are you getting at gill he looked up at her and saw a professional policewoman suddenly staring back at him for christs sake gill this case is getting to all of us were all beginning to see ghosts im just curious thats all she was reading the letter again it was not the usual cranks voice nor a cranks style that was what worried her and now that rebus thought about it the notes had seemed to appear around the time of each abduction hadnt they had there been a connection of some kind staring him in the face all this time he had been very myopic indeed had been wearing a carthorses blinkers either that or it was all a monstrous coincidence its just a coincidence gill so tell me when the other notes arrived i cant remember she bent over him her eyes huge behind her glasses she said calmly are you hiding anything from me no the whole ward turned to his cry and he felt his cheeks flush no he whispered im not hiding anything at least but how could he be sure all those years of arrests of chargesheets of forgettings so many enemies made but none would torment him like this surely surely with pen paper and a lot of thought on his part they went over the arrival of each note dates contents style of delivery gill took off her glasses rubbing between her eyes sighing its just too big a coincidence john and he knew that she was right way down inside him he knew that nothing was ever what it seemed that nothing was arbitrary gill he said at last pulling at the bedcover ive got to get out of here in the car she goaded him spurred him on who could it be what was the connection why what is this he roared at her am i a suspect now or something she studied his eyes trying to pierce them trying to bite right into the truth behind them oh she was a detective at heart and a good detective trusts nobody she gazed at him as though he were a scolded schoolboy with secrets still to spill with sins to confess confess gill knew that all this was only a hunch insupportable yet she could feel something there something perhaps behind those burning eyes stranger things had happened during her time on the force stranger things were always happening truth was always stranger than fiction and nobody was ever wholly innocent those guilty looks when you questioned somebody anybody everyone had something to hide mostly though it was small time and covered by the intervening years you would need thought police to get at those kinds of crime but if john if john rebus proved to be part of this whole caboodle then that that was too absurd to think about of course youre not a suspect john she said but it could be important couldnt it well let anderson decide he said falling silent but shaking it was then that gill had the thought what if he sent the letters to himself he felt his arms ache and looking down saw that the girl had stopped struggling there came that point that sudden blissful point when it was useless to go on living and when the mind and body came to accept that such was the case that was a beautiful peaceful moment the most relaxed moment of ones life he had many years ago tried to commit suicide savouring that very moment but they had done things to him in hospital and in the clinic afterwards they had given him back the will to live and now he was repaying them repaying all of them he saw this irony in his life and chuckled peeling the tape from helen abbots mouth using the little scissors to snip away her bonds he brought out a neat little camera from his trouser pocket and took another instant snap of her a memento mori of sorts if they ever caught him theyd kick the shit out of him for this but they would never be able to brand him a sexkiller sex had nothing to do with it these girls were pawns fated by their christenings the next and last one was the one that really mattered and he would do that one today if possible he chuckled again this was a better game than noughts and crosses he was a winner at both chief inspector william anderson loved the feel of the chase the battle between instinct and plodding detection he liked to feel too that he had the support of his division behind him dispenser of orders of wisdom of strategies he was in his element he would rather have caught the strangler already that went without saying he was no sadist the law had to be upheld all the same the longer an investigation like this went on the greater became the feel of nearing the kill and to relish that extended moment was one of the great perks of responsibility the strangler was making an occasional slip and that was what mattered to anderson at this stage the blue ford escort and now the interesting theory that the killer had been or was still an army man suggested by the tying of a knot in the garotte snippets like that would culminate eventually in a name an address an arrest and at that moment anderson would lead his officers physically as well as spiritually there would be another interview on the television another rather flattering photograph in the press he was quite photogenic oh yes victory would be sweet unless of course the strangler vanished in the night as so many before him had done that possibility was not to be considered it made his legs turn into paper he did not dislike rebus not exactly the man was a reasonable enough copper a bit loud in his methods perhaps and he understood that rebuss personal life had experienced an upheaval indeed he had been told that rebuss exwife was the woman with whom his own son was cohabiting he tried not to think about it when andy had slammed the front door on his leaving he had walked right out of his fathers life how could anyone these days spend their time writing poetry it was ludicrous and then moving in with rebuss wife no he did not dislike rebus but watching rebus come towards him with that pretty liaison officer anderson felt his stomach cough as though his insides suddenly wanted to become his outsides he leaned back on the edge of a vacant desk the officer assigned to it had gone off for a break nice to have you back john feeling fit anderson had shot out his hand and rebus stunned was forced to take it and return the grip im fine sir he said sir interrupted gill templer can we speak to you for a minute theres been a new development the mere hint of a development sir corrected rebus staring at gill anderson looked from one to the other youd better come into my office then gill explained the situation as she saw it to anderson and he wise and safe behind his desk listened glancing occasionally towards rebus who smiled apologetically at him sorry to be wasting your time rebuss smile said well rebus said anderson when gill had finished what do you say to all this could someone have a reason for informing you of their plans i mean could the strangler know you rebus shrugged his shoulders smiling smiling smiling jack morton sitting in his car jotted down some remarks on his reportsheet saw suspect interviewed same casual helpful another dead end he wanted to say another dead fucking end a parking warden was looking at him trying to scare him as she neared his car he sighed putting down the pen and paper and reaching for his id one of those days rhona phillips wore her raincoat it being the end of may and the rain slashing through the skyline as though painted upon an artists canvas she kissed her curlyheaded poetlover goodbye as he watched afternoon tv and left the house feeling for the carkeys in her handbag she picked sammy up from school these days though the school was only a mile and a quarter away she also went with her to the library at lunchtimes not allowing her any escape with that maniac still on the loose she was taking no chances she rushed to her car got in and slammed shut the door edinburgh rain was like a judgement it soaked into the bones into the structures of the buildings into the memories of the tourists it lingered for days splashing up from puddles by the roadside breaking up marriages chilling killing omnipresent the typical postcard home from an edinburgh boardinghouse edinburgh is lovely the people rather reserved saw the castle yesterday and the scott monument its a very small city almost a town really you could fit it inside new york and never notice it weather could be better weather could be better the art of euphemism shitty shitty rain it was so typical when she had a free day typical too that andy and she should have argued and now he was sulking in his chair legs tucked beneath him one of those days and she had reports to write out this evening thank god the exams had started the kids seemed more subdued at school these days the older ones gripped by examfever or examapathy and the younger ones seeing their ineluctable future mapped out for them in the faces of their doomed superiors it was an interesting time of year soon the fear would be sammys called samantha to her face now that she was so nearly a woman there were other fears there too for a parent the fear of adolescence of experiment as she reversed the car out of the driveway he watched her from his escort perfect he had about fifteen minutes to wait when her car had disappeared he drove his car to the front of the house and stopped he examined the windows of the house her man would be in there alone he left his car and walked to the front door back in the incident room after the inconclusive meeting rebus could not know that anderson was arranging to have him put under surveillance the incident room looked like an incident itself paper covered every surface a small computer was crammed into a spare corner charts and rotas and the rest covered every available inch of wallspace ive got a briefing said gill til see you later listen john i do think theres a link call it female intuition call it a detectives nose call it what you like but take me seriously think it over think about possible grudges please he nodded then watched her leave making for her own office in her own part of the building rebus wasnt sure which desk was his any more he surveyed the room it all seemed different somehow as though a few of the desks had been changed around or put together a telephone rang on the desk next to him and though there were officers and telephonists nearby he picked it up himself making an attempt to get back into the investigation he prayed that he was not himself the investigation he prayed forgetting what prayer was incident room he said detective sergeant rebus speaking rebus what a curious name that is the voice was old but lively certainly welleducated rebus it said again as though jotting it down onto a piece of paper rebus studied the telephone and your name sir oh im michael eiser thats eiser professor of english literature at the university oh yes sir rebus grabbed a pencil and jotted down the name and what can i do for you sir well mister rebus its more a case of what i think i can do for you though of course i may be mistaken rebus had a picture of the man if this were not a hoax call frizzyhaired bowtied wearing crushed tweeds and old shoes and waving his hands about as he spoke im interested in wordplay you see in fact im writing a book on the subject its called reading exercises and directed exegetic responses do you see the wordplay there its an acrostic the first letter of each word makes up another word reader in this case its a game as old as literature itself my book however concentrates on its manifestation in more recent works nabokov and burgess and the like of course acrostics are a small part of the overall set of ploys used by the author to entertain direct or persuade his audience rebus tried to interrupt the man but it was like trying to interrupt a bull so he was forced to listen wondering all the time if it were a crank call if he should strictly against procedure simply put down the telephone he had more important things to think about the back of his head ached and the point is mister rebus that i have noticed quite by chance a kind of pattern in this murderers choice of victims rebus sat down on the edge of the desk he clasped the pencil as though trying to crush it oh yes he said yes i have the names of the victims here in front of me on a piece of paper perhaps one would have noticed it sooner but it was only today that i saw a report in one newspaper which grouped the poor girls together i usually take the times you see but i quite simply couldnt find one this morning so i bought another paper and there it was it may be nothing at all mere coincidence but then again it may not ill leave that for you chaps to decide i merely offer it as a proposition jack morton puffing smoke all around him entered the office and noticing rebus waved rebus jerked his head in response jack looked worn out everyone looked worn out and here he was fresh from a period of rest and relaxation dealing with a lunatic on the telephone offer what exactly professor eiser well dont you see in order the victims names were sandra adams mary andrews nicola turner and helen abbot jack slouched towards rebuss table taken as an acrostic continued the voice their names make up another name samantha the murderers next victim perhaps or it may be simple coincidence a game where no game really exists rebus slammed down the telephone was off the desk in a second and pulled jack morton around by his necktie morton gasped and his cigarette flew from his mouth got your car outside jack still choking he nodded a reply jesus christ jesus christ it was all true then it was all to do with him samantha all the clues all the killings had been meant merely as a message to him jesus christ help me oh help me his daughter was to be the stranglers next victim rhona phillips saw the car parked outside her house but thought nothing of it all she wanted was to get out of the rain she ran to the front door samantha following desultorily behind and keyed open the door its horrible outside she shouted into the livingroom she shook off her raincoat and walked through to where the tv still blared in his chair she saw andy his hands were tied behind him and his mouth was taped shut with a huge piece of stickingplaster the length of twine still dangled from his throat rhona was about to let out the most piercing scream of her life when a heavy object came down on the back of her head and she staggered forward towards her lover slumping across his legs as she passed out hello samantha said a voice she recognised though his face was masked so that she could not see his smile mortons car tore across town its blue light flashing as though it were being followed by all hell itself rebus tried explaining it all as they drove but he was too edgy to make much sense and jack morton was too busy avoiding traffic to make much attempt at taking it in they had called for assistance one car to the school in case she were still there and two cars to the house with the warning that the strangler might be there caution was to be exercised the car reached eightyfive along queensferry road made an insane right turn across the oncoming traffic and reached the brightasapin housing estate where rhona samantha and rhonas lover now lived turn right here shouted rebus over the engines roar his mind clinging to hope as they turned into the street they saw the two police cars already motionless in front of the house and rhonas car sitting like a potent symbol of futility in the driveway they wanted to give him sedatives but he wouldnt take any of their drugs they wanted him to go home but he would not take their advice how could he go home with rhona lying somewhere above him in the hospital with his daughter abducted his whole life ripped apart like a worn garment being transformed into dusters he paced the hospital waitingroom he was fine he told them fine he knew that gill and anderson were somewhere along the corridor poor anderson he watched from the grime of the window as nurses walked by outside laughing in the rain their capes blowing about them like something out of an old dracula movie how could they laugh mist was settling over the trees and the nurses still laughing unaware of the worlds suffering faded into that mist as though some edinburgh of the past had sucked them into its fiction taking with them all the laughter in the world it was nearly dark now the sun a memory behind the heavy fabric of the clouds the religious painters of old must have known skies like this must have lived with them each and every day accepting the bruised colouring of the clouds as a mark of gods presence an essence of creations power rebus was no painter his eyes beheld beauty not in reality but in the printed word standing in the waitingroom he realised that in his life he had accepted secondary experience the experience of reading someone elses thoughts over real life well he was face to face with it now all right he was back in the paras he was back in the sas his face a sketchpad of exhaustion his brain aching every muscle tensed he caught himself beginning to abstract everything again and slapped the wall with the palms of both hands as though ready to be frisked sammy was out there somewhere in the hands of a maniac and he was composing eulogies excuses and similes it wasnt enough in the corridor gill kept a watch on william anderson he too had been told to go home a doctor had examined him for the effects of shock and had spoken of putting anderson to bed for the night im waiting right here anderson had said with quiet determination if this all has something to do with john rebus then i want to stay close to john rebus im all right honestly but he was not all right he was dazed and remorseful and a bit confused about everything i cant believe it he told gill i cant believe that this whole thing was merely a prelude to the abduction of rebuss daughter its fantastical the man must be deranged surely john must have an inkling whos responsible gill templer was wondering the same thing why hasnt he told us continued anderson then without warning or any show of ceremony he became a father again and started to sob very quietly andy he said my andy he put his head in his hands and allowed gill to put her arm around his crumpled shoulders john rebus watching darkness descend thought about his marriage his daughter his daughter sammy for those who read between the times what was it he was blocking out what was it that had been rejected by him all those years ago as he had walked the fife shoreline having his final fit of the breakdown and shutting out the past as securely as if he had been shutting the door on a jehovahs witness it was not that easy the unwanted caller had waited his time deciding to break and enter into rebuss life again the foot in the door the door of perception what good was his reading doing him now or his faith slender thread that it was samantha sammy his daughter dear god let her be safe dear god let her live john you must know who it is but he had shaken his head shaken his tears onto the folds of his trousers he did not he did not it was knot it was cross names meant nothing to him any more knots and crosses he had been sent knots and crosses string and matches and a load of gobbledygook as jack morton had called it that was all dear god he went out into the corridor and confronted anderson who stood before him like a piece of wreckage waiting to be loaded up and shunted away and the two men came together in a hug squeezing life into one another two old enemies realising in a moment that they were on the same side after all they hugged and they wept draining themselves of all they had been bottling up all those years of pounding the beat having to appear emotionless and unflappable it was out in the open now they were human beings the same as everybody else and finally assured that rhona had suffered a fractured skull only allowed into her room for a moment to watch her breathing oxygen rebus had let them take him home rhona would live that was something andy anderson though was cold on a slab somewhere while doctors examined his leftovers poor bloody anderson poor man poor father poor copper it was becoming very personal now wasnt it all of a sudden it had become bigger than they had imagined it ever could it had become a grudge they had a description at last though not a good one a neighbour had seen the man carry the still form of the girl out to the car a pale coloured car she had told them a normal looking car a normal looking man not too tall his face hard he was hurrying she didnt get a good look at him anderson would be off the case now and so would rebus oh it was big now the strangler had entered a home had murdered there he had gone way too far over the edge the newspapermen and the cameras outside the hospital wanted to know all about it superintendent wallace would have organised a press conference the newspaperreaders the voyeurs needed to know all about it it was big news edinburgh was the crime capital of europe the son of a chief inspector murdered and the daughter of a detective sergeant abducted possibly murdered already what could he do but sit and wait for another letter he was better off in his flat no matter how dark and barren it seemed no matter how like a cell gill promised to visit him later after the press conference an unmarked car would be outside his tenement as a matter of course for who knew how personal the strangler wanted this to become meantime unknown to rebus his file was being checked back at hq his past dusted off and examined there had to be the strangler in there somewhere there had to be of course there had to be rebus knew that he alone held the key but it seemed locked in a drawer to which it itself was the key he could only rattle that locked away history gill templer had telephoned rebuss brother and though john would hate her for doing so she had told michael to come across to edinburgh at once to be with his brother he was rebuss only family after all he sounded nervous on the phone nervous but concerned and now she puzzled over the matter of the acrostic the professor had been correct they were trying to locate him this evening in order to interview him again as a matter of course but if the strangler had planned this then surely he must have been able to get his hands on a list of people whose names would fit the bill and how would he have done that a civil servant perhaps a teacher someone working away quietly at a computerterminal somewhere there were many possibilities and they would go through them one by one first however gill was going to suggest that everyone in edinburgh called knott or cross be interviewed it was a wild card but then everything about this case so far had been wild and then there was the press conference held since it was convenient in the hospitals administration building there was standing room only at the back of the hall gill templers face human but unsmiling was becoming well known to the british public as well known certainly as that of any newscaster or reporter tonight however the superintendent would be doing the talking she hoped he would not take long she wanted to see rebus and more urgently perhaps she wanted to talk with his brother someone had to know about johns past he had never apparently spoken to any of his friends on the force about his army years did the key lie there or in his marriage gill listened to the super saying his piece cameras clicked and the large hall grew smoky and there was jim stevens smiling from the corner of his mouth as if he knew something gill grew nervous his eyes were on her though his pen worked away at its notepad she recalled that disastrous evening they had spent together and her much less disastrous evening with john rebus why had none of the men in her life ever been uncomplicated perhaps because complications interested her the case was not becoming more complex it was becoming simpler jim stevens halflistening to the police statement thought of how complex this story was becoming rebus and rebus drugs and murder anonymous messages followed by abduction of daughter he needed to get behind the polices public face on this one and knew that the best way forward lay with gill templer with a little trading of knowledge if the drugs and the abduction were linked as they probably were then perhaps one or other of the rebus brothers had not been playing the game according to the set rules maybe gill templer would know he came up behind her as she left the building she knew it was him but for once she wanted to speak with him hello jim can i give you a lift somewhere he decided that she could she could drop him off at a bar unless of course he could see rebus for a moment he could not they drove this story is becoming more and more bizarre by the second dont you think she concentrated her eyes on the road seeming to mull over his question really she was hoping he would open up a little more and that her silence would lead him to believe that she was holding back on him that there was something there between them to swop rebus seems to be the main actor though interesting that gill sensed that he was about to play a card i mean he went on lighting a cigarette dont mind if i smoke do you no she said slowly though inside she was jarring with electricity thanks i mean its interesting because ive got rebus pencilled into another story im working on she pulled the car up at a red light but her eyes still gazed through the windscreen would you be interested in hearing about this other story gill would she of course she would but what in return yes a very interesting man mister rebus and his brother his brother yes you know michael rebus the hypnotist an interesting pair of brothers oh listen gill lets cut the crap i was hoping you would she put the car into gear and started off again are you lot investigating rebus for anything thats what i want to know i mean do you really know whos behind all this but arent saying she turned to him now thats not the way it works jim he snorted it may not be the way you work gill but dont pretend it doesnt happen i just wondered if youd heard anything any rumbles from higher up maybe to the effect that someone had made a botchup in allowing things to come to this jim stevens was watching her face very closely indeed throwing out ideas and vague theories in the hope that one of them would catch her but she didnt seem to be taking the bait very well maybe she didnt know anything that didnt mean his theories were wrong necessarily it could just mean that things started at a higher plane than that on which gill templer and he operated jim what is it you think you know about john rebus it could be important you know we could bring you in if we thought you were withholding stevens began to make tutting sounds shaking his head we know thats not on dont we though i mean that is just not on she looked at him again i could make a precedent she said he stared at her yes maybe she could at that thisll do just here he said pointing out of the window some ash fell from his cigarette onto his tie gill stopped the car and watched him climb out he leaned back in before shutting the door a swop can be arranged if youd like one you know my phone number yes she knew his phone number he had written it down for her a very long time ago so long ago that they were on different sides of a wall now so that she could hardly understand him at all what did he know about john about michael as she drove off towards rebuss flat she hoped that she would find out there john rebus read a few pages from his good news bible but put it down when he realised that he was taking none of it in he prayed instead screwing up his eyes into tiny fists then he walked around the flat touching things this he had done before that first breakdown he was not afraid now though let it come if it would let everything come he had no resilience left he was passive to the will of his malevolent creator there was a ring at the door he did not answer they would go away and he would be alone again with his grief his impotent anger and his undusted possessions the bell rang again more persistently this time cursing he went to the door and pulled it open michael was standing there john he said i came as soon as i could mickey what are you doing here he ushered his brother into the flat somebody phoned me she told me all about it terrible news john just terrible he placed a hand on rebuss shoulder rebus tingling realised how long it had been since he had felt the touch of a human being a sympathetic brotherly touch i was confronted by two gorillas outside they seem to have you under close watch here procedure said rebus procedure maybe but michael knew how guilty he must have looked when they had pounced on him he had wondered at the phonecall wondered about the possibility of a trap so he had listened to the local radio news there had been an abduction a killing it was true so he had driven over into this lions den knowing that he should stay well away from his brother knowing that they would kill him if they found out and wondering whether the abduction could have anything to do with his own situation was this a warning to both brothers he could not say but when those two gorillas had approached him in the shadows of the tenement stairs he had thought the game all over firstly they had been gangsters out to get him then they had been police officers about to arrest him but no they were procedure you say it was a woman who called you did you catch her name no never mind i know who it was anyway they sat in the livingroom michael removing his sheepskin jacket brought a bottle of whisky out of one of the pockets would this help he said it wont do any harm rebus went to fetch glasses from the kitchen while michael inspected the livingroom this is a nice place he called well its a bit big for my needs said rebus a choking sound came from the kitchen michael walked through to discover his big brother leaning into the sink weeping grimly but quietly john said michael hugging rebus its okay its going to be okay he felt guilt well up inside him rebus was fumbling for a handkerchief and having found it gave his nose a good blow and wiped his eyes thats easy for you to say he sniffed trying out a smile youre a heathen they drank half of the whisky sitting back in their chairs silently contemplating the shadowy ceiling above rebuss eyes were redrimmed and his eyelashes stung he sniffed occasionally rubbing at his nose with the back of his hand to michael it was like being boys again but with the roles reversed for a moment not that they had been that close but sentiment would always win over reality certainly he remembered john fighting one or two of his playground battles for him guilt welled up again he shivered slightly he had to get out of this game but perhaps already he was in too deep and if he had brought john unknowingly into the game too that did not bear thinking about he had to see the man had to explain things to him but how he had no telephone number or address it was always the man who called him never the other way round it was farcical now that he thought about it like a nightmare did you enjoy the show the other night rebus forced himself to think back to it to the perfumed and lonely woman to his fingers around her throat the scene which had signalled the beginning of his end yes it was interesting he had fallen asleep had he not never mind silence again the broken sounds of traffic outside a few shouts from distant drunks they say its someone with a grudge against me he said finally oh and is it i dont know it looks like it but surely you would know rebus shook his head thats the trouble mickey i cant remember michael sat up in his chair you cant remember what exactly something i dont know just something if i knew what i would remember wouldnt i but theres a gap i know there is i know that theres something i should remember something from your past michael was keening now perhaps this had nothing at all to do with himself perhaps it was all to do with something else someone else he grew hopeful from the past yes but i cant remember rebus rubbed his forehead as though it were a crystal ball michael was fumbling in his pocket i can help you to remember john how like this michael was holding between thumb and forefinger a silver coin you remember what i told you john i take my patients back into past lives every day it should be easy enough to take you back into your real past it was john rebuss turn to sit up he shook away the whisky fumes come on then he said what do i do but inside part of him was saying you dont want this you dont want to know he wanted to know michael came over to his chair lie back in the chair get comfortable dont touch any more of that whisky but remember not everyone is susceptible to hypnotism dont force yourself dont try too hard if its going to come itll come whether you will it or not just relax john relax the doorbell rang ignore it said rebus but michael had already left the room there were voices in the hall and when michael reappeared he was followed into the room by gill the telephone caller it seems said michael how are you john her face was angled into a portrait of concern fine gill listen this is my brother michael the hypnotist hes going to put me under thats what you called it wasnt it mickey to remove whatever block there might be in my memory maybe you should be ready to take some notes or something gill looked from one brother to the other feeling a little out of things an interesting pair of brothers thats what jim stevens had said she had been working for sixteen hours and now this but she smiled and shrugged her shoulders can a girl get a drink first it was john rebuss turn to smile help yourself he said theres whisky or whisky and water or water come on mickey lets get on with this sammys out there somewhere there might still be time michael spread his legs a little leaning down over rebus he seemed to be about to consume his brother his eyes close to rebuss eyes his mouth working in a mirrorimage thats what it looked like to gill pouring whisky into a tumbler michael held up the coin trying to find the angle of the rooms single lowwattage bulb finally the glint was reflected in johns retina the pupils expanding and contracting michael felt sure that his brother would be amenable he certainly hoped so listen carefully john listen to my voice watch the coin john watch it shine and spin see it spinning can you see it spinning john now relax just listen to me and watch the spin watch it glow for a moment it seemed that rebus would not go under perhaps it was the familial tie that was making him immune to the voice to its suggestive power but then michael saw the eyes change a little imperceptibly to the uninitiated but he was initiated his father had taught him well his brother was in the limbo world now caught in the coins light transported to wherever michael wanted him to go under his power as ever michael felt a little shiver run through him this was power power total and irreducible he could do anything with his patients anything michael whispered gill ask him why he left the army michael swallowed lining his throat with saliva yes that was a good question one he had wanted to ask john himself john he said john why did you leave the army john what happened john why did you leave the army tell us and slowly as though learning to use words strange or unknown to him rebus began to tell his story gill rushed to her bag for a pen and a notepad michael sipped his whisky they listened part four the cross i had been in the parachute regiment since the age of eighteen but then i decided to try for the special air service why did i do that why will any soldier take a cut in pay to join the sas i cant answer that all i know now is that i found myself in herefordshire at the sass training camp i called it the cross because id been told that they would try to crucify me and there along with the other volunteers i went through hell marching training testing pushing they took us to the breaking point they taught us to be lethal at that time there were rumours of an imminent civil war in ulster of the sas being used to root out insurrectionists the day came for us to be badged we were given new berets and capbadges we were in the sas but there was more gordon reeve and myself were called into the bosss office and told that we had been judged the two best trainees of the batch there was a twoyear training period in front of us before we could become regulars but great things were predicted for us later reeve spoke to me as we left the building listen he said ive heard a few of the rumours ive heard the officers talking theyve got plans for us johnny plans mark my words weeks later we were put on a survival course hunted by other regiments who if they captured us would stop at nothing to prise from us information about our mission we had to trap and hunt our food lying low and travelling across bleak moorland by night we seemed destined to go through these tests together though on this occasion we were working with two others theyve got something special lined up for us reeve kept saying i can feel it in my bones lying in our bivouac we had just slipped into our sleepingbags for a twohour nap when our guard put his nose into the shelter i dont know how to tell you this he said and then there were lights and guns everywhere and we were halfbeaten into unconsciousness as the shelter was ripped open foreign tongues clacked at us their faces masked behind the torches a riflebutt to the kidneys told me that this was for real for real the cell into which i was thrown was real enough too the cell into which i was thrown was smeared with blood faeces and other things it contained a stinking mattress and a cockroach that was all i lay down on the damp mattress and tried to sleep for i knew that sleep would be the first thing to be stripped from us all the bright lights of the cell came on suddenly and stayed on burning into my skull then the noises started noises of a beating and a questioning taking place in the cell next to me leave him alone you bastards ill tear your fucking heads off i slammed at the wall with fists and boots and the noises stopped a cell door slammed shut a body was dragged past my metal door there was silence i knew my time would come i waited there waited for hours and days hungry thirsty and every time i closed my eyes a sound like that of a blaring radio caught between stations would sound from the walls and the ceiling i lay with my hands over my ears fuck you fuck you fuck you i was supposed to crack now and if i cracked i would have failed everything all the months of training so i sang tunes loudly to myself i scraped my nails across the walls of the cell walls wet with fungus and scratched my name there as an anagram bruse i played games in my head thought up crosswordpuzzle clues and little linguistic tricks i turned survival into a game a game a game a game i had to keep reminding myself that no matter how bad things seemed to be getting this was all a game and i thought of reeve who had warned me of this big plans indeed reeve was the nearest thing i had to a friend in the unit i wondered if it had been his body dragged across the floor outside my cell i prayed for him and one day they sent me food and a mug of brown water the food looked as though it had been scooped straight from the mudcrawl and pushed through the little hole which had suddenly appeared in my door and just as suddenly vanished i willed this cold swill into becoming a steak with two veg and then placed a spoonful of it in my mouth immediately i spat it out again the water tasted of iron i made a show of wiping my chin on my sleeve i felt sure i was being watched my compliments to the chef i called next thing i knew i was falling over into sleep i was in the air there could be no doubt of that i was in a helicopter the air blowing into my face i came round slowly and opened my eyes on darkness my head was in some kind of sack and my arms were tied behind my back i felt the helicopter swoop and rise and swoop again awake are you a butt prodded me yes good now give me the name of your regiment and the details of your mission were not going to fuck around with you sonny so you better do it now get stuffed i hope you can swim sonny i hope you get the chance to swim were about twohundred feet above the irish sea and were about to push you out of this fucking chopper with your hands still tied youll hit that water as though it was fucking concrete do you know that it may kill you or it may stun you the fish will eat you alive sonny and your corpse will never be found not out here do you understand what im saying it was an official and businesslike voice yes good now the name of your regiment and the details of your mission get stuffed i tried to sound calm id be another accident statistic killed on training no questions asked id hit that sea like a lightbulb hitting a wall get stuffed i said again intoning to myself its only a game its only a game this isnt a game you know not anymore your friends have already spilled their guts rebus one of them reeve i think it was spilled his guts quite literally okay men give him the heave wait enjoy your swim rebus hands gripped my legs and torso in the darkness of the sack with the wind blowing fiercely against me i began to feel that it had all been a grave mistake wait i could feel myself hanging in space twohundred feet up above the sea with the gulls shrieking for me to be let go wait yes rebus take the fucking sack off my head at least i was shrieking now desperate let the bastard drop and with that they let me go i hung in the air for a second then i dropped dropped like a brick i was falling through space trussed up like a christmas turkey i screamed for one second maybe two and then i hit the ground i hit solid ground and lay there while the helicopter landed people were laughing all around me the foreign voices were back they lifted me up and dragged me along to the cell i was glad of the sack over my head it disguised the fact that i was crying inside i was a mass of quivering coils tiny serpents of fear and adrenaline and relief which bounced through my liver my lungs my heart the door slammed behind me then i heard a shuffling sound at my back hands fumbled at the knots of my bonds with the hood off it took me a few seconds to regain my sight i stared into a face that seemed to be my own another twist to the game then i recognised gordon reeve at the same time as he recognised me rebus he said they told me youd they told me the same thing about you how are you fine fine jesus though im glad to see you we hugged one another feeling the others weakened but still human embrace the smells of suffering and of endurance there were tears in his eyes it is you he said im not dreaming lets sit down i said my legs arent too steady what i meant was that his legs werent too steady he was leaning into me as if i were a crutch he sat down thankfully how has it been i asked i kept in shape for a while he slapped one of his legs doing pushups and stuff but i soon grew too tired theyve tried feeding me with hallucinogens i keep seeing things when im awake theyve tried me with knockout drops those drugs theyre something else then theres the powerhose i get sprayed about once a day i suppose freezing cold can never seem to get dry how long do you suppose weve been here did i look as bad to him as he looked to me i hoped not he hadnt mentioned the chopper drop i decided to keep quiet about that one too long he was saying this is fucking ridiculous you were always saying that they had something special in store for us i didnt believe you god forgive me this wasnt exactly what i had in mind it is us theyre interested in though what do you mean it had been only half a thought until now but now i was sure well when our sentry put his nose into the tent that night there was no surprise in his eyes and even less fear i think they were both in on it from the start so whats this all about i looked at him sitting with his chin on his knees we were frail creatures on the outside piles biting like the hungered jaws of vampire bats mouths aching with sores and ulcers hair falling out teeth loose but there was strength in numbers and that was what i could not understand why had they put us together when apart we were both on the edge of breaking so whats this all about perhaps they were trying to lull us into a false sense of security before really tightening the screws the worst is not so long as we can say this is the worst shakespeare king lear i wouldnt have known that at the time but i know it now let it stand i dont know i said theyll tell us when theyre good and ready i suppose are you scared he said suddenly his eyes were staring at the raddled door of our cell maybe you should be fucking scared johnny i am i remember once when i was a kid some of us went along a river near our housingscheme it was in spate it had been pissing down for a week it was just after the war and there were a lot of ruined houses about we headed upriver and came to a sewagepipe i played with older kids i dont know why they made me the brunt of all their fucking games but i stuck with them i suppose i liked the idea of running about with kids who scared the shit out of all the kids of my own age so that though the older kids were treating me like shit they gave me power over the younger kids do you see i nodded but he wasnt looking this pipe wasnt very thick but it was long and it was high above the river they said i was to cross it first christ i was afraid i was so fucking scared that my legs wobbled and i froze there halfway across and then piss started to run down my legs out of my shorts and they noticed that and they laughed they laughed at me and i couldnt run couldnt move so they left me there and went away i thought of the laughter as i had been dragged away from the helicopter did anything like that ever happen to you when you were a kid johnny i dont think so then why the hell did you join up to get away from home i didnt get along with my father you see he preferred my kid brother i felt out in the cold i never had a brother neither did i not in the proper sense i had an adversary im going to bring him out dont you dare this isnt telling us anything keep going what did your father do johnny he was a hypnotist he used to make people come on stage and do stupid things youre joking its true my brother was going to follow in his footsteps but i wasnt so i got out they werent exactly sad to see me go reeve chuckled if you put us into a sale youd have to say slightly soiled on the ticket eh johnny i laughed at that laughed longer and louder than necessary and we put an arm round one another and stayed that way keeping warm we slept side by side pissed and defecated in the presence of the other tried to exercise together played little mind games together and endured together reeve had a piece of string with him and would wind it and unwind it making up the knots we had been taught in training this led me to explain the meaning of a gordian knot to him he waved a miniature reef knot at me gordian knot reef knot gordian reef it sounds just like my name doesnt it again there was something to laugh about we also played noughts and crosses scratching the games onto the powdery walls of the cell with our fingernails reeve showed me a ploy which meant that the least you could achieve was a draw we must have played about threehundred games before then with reeve winning twothirds of them the trick was simple enough your first o goes in the top left corner and your second diagonally across from it its an unbeatable position what if your opponent puts his x diagonally opposite that first o you can still win by going for the corners reeve seemed cheered by this he danced round the cell then stared at me a leer on his face youre just like the brother i never had john there and then he took my palm and nicked the flesh open with one of his fingernails doing the same to his own hand we touched palms smearing a spot of blood backwards and forwards blood brothers said gordon smiling i smiled back at him knowing that he had become too dependent on me already and that if we were separated he would not be able to cope and then he knelt down in front of me and gave me another hug gordon grew more restless he did fifty pressups in any one day which considering our diet was phenomenal and he hummed little tunes to himself the effects of my company seemed to be wearing off he was drifting again so i began to tell him stories i talked about my childhood first and about my fathers tricks but then i started to tell him proper stories giving him the plots of my favourite books the time came to tell him the story of raskolnikov that most moral of tales crime and punishment he listened enthralled and i tried to spin it out as long as i could i made bits up invented whole dialogues and characters and when id finished it he said tell me that one again so i did was it all inevitable john reeve was pushing his fingers across the floor of the cell seated on his haunches i was lying on the mattress yes i said i think it was certainly its written that way the end of the book is there before the beginnings hardly started yes thats the feeling i got there was a long pause then he cleared his throat whats your idea of god john id really like to know so i told him and as i spoke lacing my erroneous arguments with little stories from the bible gordon reeve lay down and stared up at me with eyes like the full moons of winter he was concentrating like mad i cant believe any of that he said at last as i swallowed dry saliva i wish i could but i cant i think raskolnikov should have relaxed and enjoyed his freedom he should have got himself a browning and blown the lot of them away i thought about that comment there seemed to me a little justice in it but a great deal against it also reeve was like a man trapped in limbo believing in a lack of belief but not necessarily lacking the belief to believe whats all this shit sshhhh and in between the games and the storytelling he put his hand on my neck john were friends arent we i mean really close friends ive never had a close friend before his breath was hot despite the chill in the cell but were friends arent we i mean ive taught you how to win at noughts and crosses havent i his eyes were no longer human they were the eyes of a wolf i had seen it coming but there had been nothing i could do not until now but now i saw everything with the clear hallucinogen eyes of one who has seen everything there is to see and more i could see gordon bring his face up to mine and slowly so slowly that it might not have been happening at all plant a breathy kiss on my cheek trying to turn my head around so as to connect with the lips and i saw myself yield no no this was not to happen this was intolerable this wasnt what wed been building up all these weeks was it and if it was then id been a fool throughout just a kiss he was saying just one kiss john hell come on and there were tears in his eyes because he too could see that everything had gone haywire in an instant he too could see that something was ending but that didnt stop him from edging his way behind me making the twobacked beast shakespeare let it go and i was trembling but strangely immobile i knew that this was beyond my ken beyond my control so i forced the tears up into my eyes and my nose started to run just a kiss all the training all the pushing towards that final lethal goal it had all come to this moment in the end love was still behind everything john and i could feel only pity for the two of us stinking besmirched barren in our cell i could feel only the frustration of the thing the poor tears of a lifetimes indignation gordon gordon gordon john the celldoor burst open as though it had never been locked a man stood there english not foreign and of high rank he looked in on the spectacle with some distaste no doubt he had been listening to it all if not watching it he pointed to me rebus he said youve passed youre on our side now i looked at his face what did he mean i knew full well what he meant youve passed the test rebus come on come with me well get you kitted up youre on our side now the interrogation of your friend continues youll be helping us with the interrogation from now on gordon jumped to his feet he was directly behind me still i could feel his breath on the back of my neck what do you mean i said my mouth and stomach were dry looking at this crisply starched officer i became painfully aware of my own filth but then it was all his fault this is a trick i said it must be im not going to tell you im not going with you ive not given away any information ive not cracked you cant fail me now i was shouting now delirious yet i knew there was truth in what he was saying he shook his head slowly i can understand your suspicion rebus youve been under a lot of pressure a hellish lot of pressure but thats past youve not failed youve passed passed with flying colours i think we can say that with certainty youve passed rebus youre on our side now youll be helping us now to try to crack reeve here do you understand i shook my head its a trick i said the officer smiled sympathetically hed dealt with the like of me a hundred times before look he said just come with us and everything will be made clear gordon jumped forward at my side no he shouted hes already told you that hes not fucking well going now piss off out of here then to me a hand on my shoulder dont listen to him john its a trick its always a trick with these bastards but i could see that he was worried his eyes moved rapidly his mouth slightly open and feeling his hand on me i knew that my decision had been made already and gordon seemed to sense as much i think thats for trooper rebus to decide dont you the officer was saying and then the man stared at me his eyes friendly i didnt need to look back at the cell or at gordon i just kept thinking to myself its another part of the game just another part of the game the decision had been made a long time ago they were not lying to me and of course i wanted out of the cell it was preordained nothing was arbitrary i had been told that at the start of my training i started forwards but gordon held onto the tatters of my shirt john he said his voice full of need dont let me down john please but i pulled away from his weak grip and left the cell no no no his cries were huge fiery things dont let me down john let me out let me out and then he screamed and i almost crumpled on the floor it was the scream of the mad after i had been cleaned up and seen by a doctor i was taken to what they euphemistically called the debriefingroom id been through hell was still going through hell and they were about to discuss it as though it had been nothing more than a school exercise there were four of them there three captains and a psychiatrist they told me everything then they explained that a new elitist group was about to be set up from within the sas and that its role would be the infiltration and destabilization of terrorist groups starting with the irish republican army who were becoming more than a mere nuisance as the irish situation deteriorated into civil war because of the nature of the job only the best the very best would be good enough and reeve and i had been judged the best in our section therefore we had been trapped had been taken prisoner and had been put through tests the like of which had never been tried in the sas before none of this really surprised me by now i was thinking of the other poor bastards who were being put through this whole sick bloody thing and all so that when we were being kneecapped we would not let on who we were and then they came to gordon our attitude towards trooper reeve is rather ambivalent this was the man in the white coat talking hes a bloody fine soldier and give him a physical job to do and hell do it but he has always worked as a loner in the past so we put the two of you together to see how you would react to sharing a cell and more especially to see how reeve would cope once his friend had been taken away from him did they know of that kiss then or did they not im afraid went on the doctor that the result may be negative hes come to depend upon you john hasnt he we are of course aware that you have not been dependent upon him what about the screams from the other cells taperecordings i nodded tired suddenly uninterested the whole thing was another bloody test then of course it was they had a little smile between them but that neednt bother you now what matters is that youve passed it did worry me though what was it all about id exchanged friendship for this informal debriefing id exchanged love for these smirks and gordons screams were still in my ears revenge he was crying revenge i laid my hands on my knees bent forward and started to weep you bastards i said you bastards and if id had a browning pistol with me at that moment id have put large holes into their grinning skulls they had me checked again more thoroughly this time in a military hospital civil war had indeed broken out in ulster but i stared past it towards gordon reeve what had happened to him was he still in that stinking cell alone because of me was he falling apart i took it all on my shoulders and wept again they had given me a box of tissues that seemed to be the way of things then i started to weep all day sometimes uncontrollably taking it all on taking everything on my conscience i suffered from nightmares i volunteered my resignation i demanded my resignation it was accepted reluctantly i was after all a guineapig i went to a small fishingvillage in fife and walked along the pebbled beach recovering from my nervous breakdown and putting the whole thing out of my mind stuffing the most painful episode of my life into drawers and attics in my head locking it all away learning to forget so i forgot and they were good to me they gave me some compensation money and they pulled a lot of strings when i decided that i wanted to join the police force oh yes i could not complain about their attitude towards me but i wasnt allowed to find out about my friend and i wasnt ever to get in touch with them again i was dead i was strictly off their records i was a failure and im still a failure broken marriage my daughter kidnapped but it all makes sense now the whole thing makes sense so at least i know that gordon is alive if not well and i know that he has my little girl and that hes going to kill her and kill me if he can and to get her back im going to have to kill him and i would do it now god help me i would do it now part five knots amp crosses when john rebus awoke from what had seemed a particularly deep and dreamtroubled sleep he found that he was not in bed he saw that michael was standing over him a wary smile on his face and that gill was pacing to and fro sniffing back tears what happened said rebus nothing said michael then rebus recalled that michael had hypnotised him nothing cried gill you call that nothing john said michael i didnt realise that you felt that way about the old man and me im sorry we made you feel bad michael rested his hand on his brothers shoulder the brother he had never known gordon gordon reeve what happened to you youre all torn and dirty whirling around me like grit on a windswept street like a brother youve got my daughter where are you oh jesus rebus let his head fall screwing his eyes shut gills hand stroked his hair it was growing light outside the birds were back into their untiring routine rebus was glad that they were calling him back into the real world they reminded him that there might be someone out there who was feeling happy perhaps lovers awakening in each others arms or a man who was realising that today was a holiday or an elderly woman thanking god that she was alive to see the first hints of reawakening life a real dark night of the soul he said beginning to shake its cold in here the pilotlight must have blown out gill blew her nose and folded her arms no its warm enough in here john listen she spoke slowly deferentially we need a physical description of this man i know that it will have to be a fifteenyearold description but itll be a start then we need to check up on what happened to him after you des after you left him that will be classified if it exists at all and we need to tell the chief about all of this gill went on as if rebus had said nothing her eyes were fixed in front of her we need to find that creep the room seemed very quiet to rebus as though a death had occurred when really it had been a birth of sorts the birth of his memory of gordon of walking out of that cold merciless cell of turning his back can you be sure that this reeve character is your man michael was pouring more whisky rebus shook his head at the proffered glass not for me thanks my head feels all fuzzy oh yes i think we can be pretty certain whos behind it the messages the knots and the crosses it all makes sense now its been making sense all along reeve must think im really thick hes been sending me clear messages for weeks and ive failed to realise ive let those girls die all because i couldnt face the facts the facts gill bent down behind him and put her hands on his shoulders john rebus shot out of his chair and turned to her reeve no gill gill he shook his head in mute apology then burst into tears gill looked towards michael but michael had lowered his eyes she hugged rebus hard not allowing him to break away from her again all the time whispering that it was she gill beside him and not any ghost from the past michael was wondering what he had got himself into he had never seen john cry before again the guilt flooded him he would stop it all he didnt need it any more he would lie low and just let his dealer get tired of looking for him let his clients find new people he would do it not for johns sake but for his own we treated him like shit he thought to himself its true the old man and me treated him as though he were an intruder later over coffee rebus seemed calm though gills eyes were still on him wondering fearing we can be sure that this reeve is off his chump she said perhaps said rebus one thing is for sure hell be armed hell be ready for anything the man was a seaforths regular and a member of the sas hell be hard as nails you were too john thats why im the man to track him down the chief must be made to understand that gill im back on the case gill pursed her lips im not sure hell go for that she said well sod him then ill find the bastard anyway you do that john said michael you do that dont care what any of them say mickey said rebus you are absolutely the best brother i could have had now is there any food on the go im starved and im whacked said michael feeling pleased with himself do you mind if i lie down for an hour or two here before i drive back not at all go through to my room mickey goodnight michael said gill he was smiling as he left them knots and crosses noughts and crosses it was so blatant really reeve must have taken him for a fool and in a way he had been right those endless games they had played all those tricks and manoeuvres and their talk about christianity those reef knots and gordian knots and the cross god how stupid he had been allowing his memory into tricking him that the past was a cracked and useless vessel emptying its spirit how stupid john youre spilling your coffee gill was bringing in a plateful of cheese on toast from the kitchen rebus roused himself awake eat this ive been on to hq weve to be there in two hours time theyve already started running a check on reeves name we should find him i hope so gill oh god i hope so they hugged she suggested that they lie on the couch they did so tight in a warming embrace rebus couldnt help wondering whether his dark night had been an exorcism of sorts whether the past would still haunt him sexually he hoped not certainly it was neither the time nor the place to try it out gordon my friend what did i do to you stevens was a patient man the two policemen had been firm with him no one could see detective sergeant rebus for the moment stevens had returned to the newspaper office worked on a report for the papers threeam printrun and then had driven back to rebuss flat there were still lights on up there but also there were two new gorillas by the door of the tenement stevens parked across the street and lit another cigarette it was tying together nicely the two threads were becoming one the murders and the drugpushing were involved in some way and rebus was the key by the look of things what were his brother and he talking about at this hour a contingency plan perhaps god he would have given anything to be a fly on the livingroom wall just now anything he knew reporters in fleet street who went in for sophisticated surveillance techniques bugs highpowered microphones telephonetaps and he wondered if it might not be worthwhile to invest in some of that equipment himself he formulated new theories in his head theories with hundreds of permutations if edinburghs drugracketeers had gone into the abductionandmurder business to put the frights on some poor bastards then things were taking a very grim turn indeed and he jim stevens would have to be even more careful in future yet big podeen had known nothing say then that a new gang had broken into the game bringing with it new rules that would make for a gangwar glasgowstyle but things surely were not done that way today maybe in this way stevens kept himself awake and alert scribbling his thoughts into a notebook his radio was on and he listened to the halfhourly news reports a policemans daughter was the new victim of edinburghs childmurderer in the most recent abduction a man was killed strangled in the house of the childs mother and so on stevens went on formulating went on speculating it had not yet been revealed that all the murders were linked to rebus the police were not about to make that public not even to jim stevens at seventhirty stevens managed to bribe a passing newspaperboy into bringing him rolls and milk from a nearby shop he washed the dry powdery rolls down with the icy milk the heating was on in his car but he felt chilled to the marrow he needed a shower a shave and some sleep not necessarily in that order but he was too close to let this go now he had the tenacity some would call it madness fanaticism of every good reporter he had watched other hacks arriving in the night and being sent away again one or two had seen him sitting in his car and had come across for a chat and to sniff out any leads he had hidden away his notebook then feigning disinterest telling them that he would be going home shortly lies damned lies that was part of the business and now finally they were emerging from the building a few cameras and microphones were there of course but nothing too tasteless no pushing and shoving and harassing for one thing this was a grieving father for another he was a policeman nobody was about to harass him stevens watched as gill and rebus were allowed to disappear into the back of an idling rover policecar he studied their faces rebus looked washedout that was only to be expected but behind that lay a grimness of look something about the way his mouth made a straight line that bothered stevens a little it was as if the man were about to enter a war bloody hell and then there was gill templer she looked rough rougher even than rebus her eyes were red but here too there was something a little out of the ordinary something was not quite as it should be any respecting reporter could see that if he knew what he was looking for stevens gnawed at himself he needed to know more it was like a drug his story he needed bigger and bigger injections of it he was a bit startled too to find himself admitting that the reason he needed these injections was not for the sake of his job but for his own curiosity rebus intrigued him gill templer of course interested him and michael rebus michael rebus had not appeared from the flat the circus was leaving now the rover turning right out of the quiet marchmont street but the gorillas remained new gorillas stevens lit a cigarette it might be worth a try at that he walked back to his car and locked it then taking a walk round the block formed another plan excuse me sir do you live here of course i live here whats all this about eh i need to get to my bed had a heavy night sir the blearyeyed man shook three brown paperbags at the policeman the bags each contained six rolls im a baker shiftwork now if youll and your name sir making to pass the man stevens had just had time enough to make out a few of the names on the doorbuzzer laidlaw he said jim laidlaw the policeman checked this against a list of names in his hand all right sir sorry to have bothered you whats all this about youll find out soon enough sir good night now there was one more obstacle and stevens knew that for all his cunning if the door was locked then the door was locked and his game was up he made a plausible push at the heavy door and felt it give they had not locked it his patron saint was smiling on him today in the tenement hallway he ditched the rolls and thought of another ploy he climbed the two flights of stairs to rebuss door the tenement seemed to smell exclusively of catspiss at rebuss door he paused catching his breath partly he was out of condition but partly also he was excited he had not felt anything like this on a story for years it felt good he decided that he could get away with anything on a day like this he pushed the doorbell relentlessly the door was opened at last by a yawning puffyfaced michael rebus so at last they were face to face stevens flashed a card at michael the card identified james stevens as a member of an edinburgh snooker club detective inspector stevens sir sorry to get you out of bed he put the card away your brother told us that youd probably still be asleep but i thought id come up anyway may i come in just a few questions sir wont keep you too long the two policemen their feet numb despite thermal socks and the fact that it was the beginning of summer shuffled one foot and then the other hoping for a reprieve the talk was all of the abduction and the fact that a chief inspectors son had been murdered the main door opened behind them you lot still here the wife told me there was bobbies at the door but i didnae believe her yon wis last night though whats the matter this was an old man still in his slippers but with a thick winter overcoat on he was halfshaven only and his bottom falseteeth had been lost or forgotten about he was attaching a cap to his bald head as he sidled out of the door nothing for you to worry about sir youll be told soon enough im sure oh aye well then im just away to fetch the paper and the milk we usually have toast for breakfast but some buggers gone and left about twa dozen new rolls in the lobby well if theyre no wanted theyre aye welcome in my house he chuckled showing the raw red of his bottom gum can i get you twa anything at the shop but the two policemen were staring at one another alarmed speechless get up there one said finally to the other then and your name sir the old man preened himself an old trooper jock laidlaw he said at your service stevens was drinking thankfully the black coffee the first hot thing hed had in ages he was seated in the livingroom his eyes everywhere im glad you woke me michael rebus was saying ive got to get back home ill bet you have thought stevens ill bet you have rebus looked altogether more relaxed than he had foreseen relaxed rested easy with his conscience curiouser and curiouser just a few questions mister rebus as i said michael rebus sat down crossing his legs sipping his own coffee yes stevens produced his notebook your brother has had a very great shock yes but hell be all right you think yes stevens pretended to write in his book did he have a good night by the way did he sleep all right well none of us got much sleep im not sure john slept at all michaels eyebrows were gathering look what is all this just routine mister rebus you understand we need all the details from everyone involved if were going to crack this case but its cracked isnt it stevens heart jumped is it he heard himself say well dont you know yes of course but we have to get all the details from everyone concerned yes so you said look can i see your identification again just to be on the safe side there was the sound of a key prodding at the front door christ thought stevens theyre back already listen he said through his teeth we know all about your little drugsracket now tell us whos behind it or else well put you behind bars for a hundred years sonny michaels face went lightblue then grey his mouth seemed ready to drop open with a word the one word stevens needed but then one of the gorillas was in the room propelling stevens out of his chair ive not finished my coffee yet he protested youre lucky i dont break your flaming neck pal replied the policeman michael rebus stood up too but he was saying nothing a name cried stevens just give me the name thisll be spread right across the front pages my friend if you dont cooperate give me the name he kept up his cries all the way down the stairwell right down to the last step all right im going he said eventually breaking free of the heavy grip on his arm im going you were a bit slack there boys werent you ill keep it quiet this time but next time you better be ready okay get to fuck out of here said one gorilla stevens got to fuck he slid into his car feeling more frustrated and more curious than ever god hed been close but what did the hypnotist mean by that the case was cracked was it if so he wanted to be there with the first details he was not used to being so far behind in the game usually games were played by his rules no he was not used to this and he did not like it at all he loved it but if the case was cracked then time was tight and if you could not get what you wanted from one brother then go to the other he thought he knew where john rebus would be his intuition ran high today he felt inspired well john this all seems quite fantastical but im sure its a possibility certainly its the best lead weve got though i find it hard to conceive of a man with so much hate that he would murder four innocent girls just to give you the clues as to his ultimate victim chief superintendent wallace looked from rebus to gill templer and back again to rebuss left sat anderson wallaces hands lay like dead fish on his desk a pen in front of him the room was large and uncluttered a selfassured oasis here problems were always solved decisions were made always correctly the problem now is finding him if we make this thing public then that might scare him off endangering your daughters life in the process on the other hand a public appeal would be by far the quickest way of finding him you cant possibly it was gill templer who in that quiet room was on the verge of exploding but wallace silenced her with a wave of his hand i am merely thinking aloud at this stage inspector templer merely casting stones into a pond anderson sat like a corpse his eyes to the floor he was on leave now officially and in mourning but he had insisted on keeping in touch with the case and superintendent wallace had acquiesced of course john wallace was saying its impossible for you to remain on the case rebus rose to his feet sit down john please the supers eyes were hard and honest the eyes of a real copper one of the old school rebus sat down again now i know how you must feel believe it or believe it not but theres too much at stake here too much for all of us youre far too involved to be of any objective use and the public would cry out about vigilante tactics you must see that all i see is that without me reeve will stop at nothing its me he wants exactly and wouldnt we be stupid to hand you over to him on a plate well do everything we can as much as you could do leave it to us the army wont tell you anything you know theyll have to wallace began to toy with his pen as though it were there for that very purpose ultimately theyve got the same boss we have theyll be made to tell rebus shook his head theyre a law unto themselves the sas is hardly even a part of the army if they dont want to tell you then believe me they wont tell you a bloody thing rebuss hand came down onto the desk not a bloody thing john gills hand squeezed his shoulder asking him to be calm she herself looked like a fury but she knew when to keep quiet and let looks alone transmit her anger and her displeasure for rebus however it was actions that counted hed been sitting outside reality for way too long he rose from his small chair like a pure force no longer human and left the room in silence the superintendent looked at gill hes off the case gill he must be made to realise that i believe that you he paused while opening and shutting a drawer that you and he have an understanding that at least is how we used to phrase it in my day perhaps you should make him aware of his position well get this man but not with rebus hanging around intent on revenge wallace looked towards anderson who stared drily at him we dont want vigilante tactics he went on not in edinburgh what would the tourists say then his face broke into a cold smile he looked from anderson to gill then rose from his chair this is all becoming extremely internecine suggested gill i was going to say incestuous what with chief inspector anderson here his son and rebuss wife yourself and rebus rebus and this man reeve reeve and rebuss daughter i hope the press dont get wind of this youll be responsible for seeing that they dont and for punishing any that do am i making myself clear gill templer nodded stifling a sudden yawn good the super nodded across to anderson now see that chief inspector anderson gets home safely will you william anderson seated in the back of the car went through his mental list of informants and friends he knew a couple of people who might know about the special air service certainly something like the rebusreeve case could not have been hushed up totally though it might well have been struck from the records the soldiers would have known about it though grapevines existed everywhere and especially where you would least expect them he might need to twist a few arms and lay out a few tenners but he would find the bastard if it was his last action on gods earth or he would be there when rebus did rebus had left the hq by a back entrance as stevens had hoped he followed rebus as the policeman looking the worse for wear stalked away what was it all about no matter as long as he stuck to rebus he could be sure of getting his story and what a story it promised to be stevens kept checking behind him but there seemed to be no tail on rebus no police tail that was it seemed strange to him that they would allow rebus to go off on his own when there was no telling what a man would do whose daughter had been abducted stevens was hoping for the ultimate plot he was hoping that rebus would lead him straight to the big boys behind this new drugs ring if not one brother then the other like a brother to me and i to him what happened he knew what was to blame at heart the method that was the cause of all of this the caging and the breaking and then the patching up the patching up had not been a success had it they were both broken men in their own ways that knowledge wouldnt stop him from shearing reeves head from its shoulders though nothing would stop that but he had to find the bastard yet and he had no idea where to start he could feel the city closing in on him bringing to bear all of its historical weight smothering him dissent rationalism enlightenment edinburgh had specialized in all three and now he too would need these charms he needed to work on his own quickly yet methodically using ingenuity and every tool at his disposal most of all he needed instinct after five minutes he knew he was being followed and the hair stood up at the back of his neck it was not the usual police tail that would not have been so easy to spot but was it could he be so close at a busstop he stopped and turned suddenly as though checking to see if a bus was coming he saw the man dodge into a doorway it wasnt gordon reeve it was that bloody reporter rebus listened to his heart slow again but the adrenaline was already pumping through him filling him with a desire to run to take off along this long straight road and run into the strongest headwind imaginable but then a bus came trundling round the corner and he boarded that instead from the back window he saw the reporter jump out of the doorway and desperately flag down a taxicab rebus had no time to be bothered with the man he had some thinking to do thinking about how in the world he could find reeve the possibility haunted him hell find me i dont need to chase but somehow that scared him most of all gill templer could not find rebus he had disappeared as though he had been a shadow merely and not a man at all she telephoned and hunted and asked and did all the things a good copper should do but she was confronted by the fact of a man who was not only a good copper himself but had been one of the best in the sas to boot he might have been hiding under her feet under her desk in her clothes and she would never have found him so he stayed hidden he stayed hidden she surmised because he was on the move swiftly and methodically moving through the streets and bars of edinburgh in search of his prey knowing that when found the prey would turn hunter once more but gill went on trying shivering now and then when she thought of her lovers grim and horrific past and of the mentality of those who decided that such things were necessary poor john what would she have done she would have walked right out of that cell and kept on walking just as he had done and yet she would have felt guilty too just as he had felt guilt and she would have put it all behind her scarred invisibly why did the men in her life have to be such complicated fraught screwedup bastards did she attract the soiled goods only it might have been humorous but then there was samantha to think about and that wasnt funny at all where did you start looking if you wanted to find a needle she remembered superintendent wallaces words theyve got the same boss we have that was a truth well worth contemplating in all its complexity for if they had the same boss then perhaps a coverup could be arranged at this end now that the ancient and terrible truth had surfaced again if this got into the papers all hell would be let loose at every level of the service perhaps they would want to cooperate in hushing it up perhaps they would want rebus silenced my god what if they should want john rebus silenced that would mean silencing anderson too and herself it would mean bribes or a total wipeout she would have to be very careful indeed one false move now might mean her dismissal from the force and that would not do at all justice had to be seen to be done there could be no coverups the boss whoever or whatever that anonymous term was meant to imply would not have his or its day there had to be truth or the whole thing was a sham and so were its actors and what of her feelings towards john rebus himself spotlit on the reddened stage she hardly knew what to think the notion still niggled at her that no matter how absurd it might appear john was somehow behind this whole thing no reeve the notes sent to himself jealousy leading him to kill his wifes lover his daughter now hidden somewhere somewhere like that locked room it was hardly to be contemplated which considering the way the whole thing had gone thus far was why gill contemplated it very hard indeed and rejected it rejected it for no other reason than that john rebus had once made love to her once bared his soul to her once clasped her hand beneath a hospital blanket would a man with something to hide have become involved with a policewoman no it seemed wholly unlikely so again it became a possibility joining the others gills head began to pulse where the hell was john and what if reeve found him before they found reeve if john rebus was a walking beacon to his enemy then wasnt it crazy for him to be out there on his own wherever he was of course it was stupid it had been stupid to let him walk out of the room out of the building vanishing like a whisper shit she picked up the telephone again and dialled his flat john rebus was moving through the jungle of the city that jungle the tourists never saw being too busy snapping away at the ancient golden temples temples long since gone but still evident as shadows this jungle closed in on the tourists relentlessly but unseen a natural force the force of dissipation and destruction edinburghs an easy beat his colleagues from the west coast would say try partick for a night and tell me that its not but rebus knew different he knew that edinburgh was all appearances which made the crime less easy to spot but no less evident edinburgh was a schizophrenic city the place of jekyll amp hyde sure enough the city of deacon brodie of fur coats and no knickers as they said in the west but it was a small city too and that would be to rebuss advantage he hunted in the hardmans drinking dens in the housing estates where heroin and unemployment were the totem kings for he knew that somewhere in this anonymity a hard man could hide and could plan and could survive he was trying to get inside gordon reeves skin it was a skin sloughed many times and rebus had to admit finally that he was further away from his insane murderous bloodbrother than ever before if he had turned his back on gordon reeve then reeve was refusing to show himself anyway perhaps there would be another note another teasing clue oh sammy sammy sammy please god let her live let her live gordon reeve had levitated right out of rebuss world he was floating overhead floating and gloating in his newfound power it had taken him fifteen years to accomplish his trick but my god what a trick fifteen years within which time he had probably changed his name and appearance taken on a menial job researched rebuss life how long had this man been watching him watching and hating and scheming all those times that he had felt his flesh creep for no reason that the telephone had rung without a voice behind it that small easily forgotten accidents had occurred and reeve grinning above him a little god over rebuss destiny rebus shivering entered a pub for the hell of it and ordered a triple whisky its quartergills in here pal are you sure you want a treble sure what the hell it was all one if god swirled in his heaven leaning down to touch his creatures then it was a curious touch indeed that he gave them looking around rebus stared into a heart of desperation old men sat with their halfpint glasses staring emptily towards the front door were they wondering what was outside or were they just scared that whatever was out there would one day force its way in pushing into their dark corners and cowered glances with the wrath of some old testament monster some behemoth some flood of destruction rebus could not see behind their eyes just as they could not see behind his that ability not to share the sufferings of others was all that kept the mass of humanity rolling on concentrating on the me shunning the beggars and their folded arms rebus behind his eyes was begging now begging to that strange god of his to allow him to find reeve to explain himself to the madman god did not answer the tv blared out some banal quiz show fight imperialism fight racism a young girl wearing a mockleather coat and little round glasses stood behind rebus he turned to her she had a collecting tin in one hand and a pile of newspapers in the other fight imperialism fight racism so you said even now he could feel the alcohol working on his jaw muscles freeing them of stiffness who are you from workers revolutionary party the only way to smash the imperialist system is for the workers to unite and smash racism racism is the backbone of repression oh arent you confusing two entirely different arguments there love she bristled but was ready to argue they always were the two are inextricable capitalism was built on slave labour and is maintained by slave labour you dont sound much like a slave dear where did you get that accent cheltenham my father was a slave to capitalist ideology he didnt know what he was doing you mean you went to an expensive school she was bristling now all right rebus lit a cigarette he offered her one but she shook her head a capitalist product he supposed the leaves picked by slaves in south america she was quite pretty though eighteen nineteen funny victorian shoes on tight pointed little things a long straight black skirt black the colour of dissent he was all for dissent youre a student i suppose thats right she said shuffling uncomfortably she knew a buyer when she saw one this was not a buyer edinburgh university yes studying what english and politics english have you heard of a guy called eiser he teaches there she nodded hes an old fascist she said his theory of reading is a piece of rightwing propaganda to pull the wool over the eyes of the proletariat rebus nodded what was your party again workers revolutionary but youre a student eh not a worker not one of the proletariat either by the sound of you her face was red her eyes burning fire come the revolution rebus would be first against the wall but he had not yet played his trump card so really youre contravening the trades description act arent you and what about that tin do you have a licence from the proper authority to collect money in that tin the tin was old its old jobdescription torn from it it was a plain red cylinder the kind used on poppyday but this was no poppyday are you a cop got it in one love have you got a licence i may have to pull you in otherwise fucking pig feeling this a fitting exit line she turned from rebus and walked to the door rebus chuckling finished his whisky poor girl she would change the idealism would vanish once she saw how hypocritical the whole game was and what luxuries lay outside university when she left shed want it all the executive job in london the flat car salary winebar she would chuck it all in for a slice of pie but she wouldnt understand that just now now was for the reaction against upbringing that was what university was about they all thought they could change the world once they got away from their parents rebus had thought that too he had thought to return home from the army with a row of medals and a list of commendations just to show them it had not been that way though chastened he was about to go when a voice called to him from three or four barstools away it disnae cure anything dis it son an aged crone offered him these few pearls of wisdom from her carious mouth rebus watched her tongue slopping around in that black cavern aye he said paying the barman who thanked him with green teeth rebus could hear the television the jingle of the cashregister the shouted conversations of the old men but behind it all behind the cacophony lay another sound low and pure but more real to him than any of the others it was the sound of gordon reeve screaming let me out let me out but rebus did not go dizzy this time nor did he panic and run for it he stood up to the sound and allowed it to make its point let it wash over him until it had had its say he would never run away from that memory again drink never cured anything son continued his personal witch look at me i wis as guid as anybody once upon a time but when my husband died i just went tae pieces dye ken whit i mean son the drink wis a great comfort tae me then or so i thocht but it tricks ye it plays games wi ye ye jist sit aw day daein nothing but drinking and life passes ye by she was right how could he take the time to sit here guzzling whisky and sentiment when his daughters life was balanced so finely he must be mad he was losing reality again he had to hang onto that at the very least he could pray again but that only seemed to take him further away from the brute facts and it was facts that he was chasing now not dreams he was chasing the fact that a lunatic from his cupboard of bad dreams had sneaked into this world and carried off his daughter did it resemble a fairy tale all the better there was bound to be a happy ending youre right love he said then ready to leave he pointed to her empty glass want another of those she stared at him through rheumy eyes then wagged her chin in a parody of compliance another of what the ladys drinking rebus said to the greentoothed barman he handed over some coins and give her the change then he left the bar i need to talk i think you do too stevens was lighting a cigarette rather melodramatically to rebuss mind directly outside the bar beneath the glare of the streetlighting his skin seemed almost yellow seemed hardly thick enough to cover his skull well can we talk the reporter put his lighter back in his pocket his fair hair looked greasy he had not shaved for a day or so he looked hungry and cold but inside he felt electric youve led me a merry dance mister rebus can i call you john look stevens you know the score here ive got enough on my plate without all this rebus made to move past the reporter but stevens caught his arm no he said i dont know the score not the final score i seem to have been ejected from the park at halftime what do you mean you know exactly whos behind all this dont you of course you do and so do your superiors or do they have you told them the whole truth and nothing but the truth john have you told them about michael what about him oh come on stevens started to shuffle his feet looking around him at the high blocks of flats the lateafternoon sky behind them he chuckled shivering rebus recalled seeing him make that curious shivery motion at the party where can we talk said the reporter now what about in the pub or is there someone in there youd rather i didnt see stevens youre off your bloody head im serious go home get some sleep eat have a bath just get to hell away from me okay or youll do what exactly get your brothers heavy friend to rough me up a little listen rebus the games over i know but i dont know all of it youd be wise to have me as a friend rather than as an enemy dont take me for a monkey i credit you with more sense than to do that dont let me down dont let me down after all theyve got your daughter you need my help ive got friends everywhere weve got to fight this together rebus confused shook his head i dont have a bloody clue what youre talking about stevens go home will you jim stevens sighed shaking his own head ruefully he threw his cigarette onto the pavement and stubbed it out heavily sending little flares of burning tobacco across the concrete well im sorry john i really am michaels going to be put behind bars for a very long time on the evidence i have against him evidence of what his drugpushing of course stevens didnt see the blow coming it wouldnt have helped if he had it was a vicious curving swipe sweeping up from rebuss side and catching him very low in the stomach the reporter coughed out a little puff of wind then fell to his knees liar stevens coughed and coughed it was as if he had run a marathon he gulped in air staying on his knees his arms folded in front of his belly if you say so john but its the truth anyway he looked up at rebus you mean you honestly dont know anything about it nothing at all you better have some good proof stevens or im going to see you swing stevens hadnt expected this he hadnt expected this at all well he said this puts a different complexion on everything christ i need a drink will you join me i think we should talk a little now dont you i wont keep you long but i think you should know and of course thinking back rebus realised that he had known but not consciously that day the day of the old mans death of visiting the rainsoaked graveyard of visiting mickey he had smelled that toffeeapple smell in the livingroom he knew now what it had been he had thought of it then but had been distracted jesus christ rebus felt his whole world sinking into the morass of a personal madness he hoped the breakdown was not far off he couldnt keep going on like this for much longer toffeeapples fairytales sammy sammy sammy sometimes it was hard to hold onto reality when that reality was overpowering the shield came to protect you the shield of the breakdown of forgetting laughter and forgetting this rounds on me said rebus feeling calm again gill templer knew what she had always known there was method in the killers choice of girls so he must have had access to their names prior to the abductions that meant that the four girls had to have something in common some way that reeve could have picked them all out but what they had checked up on everything certain hobbies the girls did have in common netball pop music books netball pop music books netball pop music books that meant checking through netballcoaches all women so scratch that recordshop workers and djs and bookshopworkers and librarians libraries libraries rebus had told stories to reeve samantha used the citys main lending library so occasionally had the other girls one of the girls had been seen heading up the mound towards the library on the day she disappeared but jack morton had checked the library already one of the men there had owned a blue ford escort the suspect had been passed over but had that initial interview been enough she had to speak to morton then she would conduct a second interview herself she was about to look for morton when her telephone rang inspector templer she said to the beige mouthpiece the kid dies tonight hissed a voice on the other end she sat bolt upright in her chair almost causing it to topple listen she said if youre a crank shut up bitch im no crank and you know it im the real thing listen there was a muffled cry from somewhere the sob of a young girl then the hiss returned tell rebus tough luck he cant say i never gave him a chance listen reeve i she had not meant to say that had not meant to let him know but she had panicked on hearing samanthas cry now she heard another cry the banshee cry of the madman who has been discovered it sent the hairs on her neck climbing up each other it froze the air around her it was the cry of death itself in one of its many guises it was a lost souls final triumphant scream you know he gasped his voice a mixture of joy and terror you know you know you know arent you clever and youve got a very sexy voice too maybe ill come for you sometime was rebus a good lay was he tell him that ive got his baby and she dies tonight got that tonight listen i no no no no more from me miss templer youve had nearly long enough to trace this bye click brrrr time to trace it she had been stupid she should have thought of that first indeed she had not thought of it at all perhaps superintendent wallace had been right perhaps it was not only john who was too emotionally involved in the whole affair she felt tired and old and spent she felt as if all the casework was suddenly an impossible burden all the criminals invincible her eyes were irritating her she thought of putting on her glasses her personal shield from the world she had to find rebus or should she seek out jack morton first john would have to be told of this they had a little time but not much the first guess had to be the right one who first rebus or morton she made the decision john rebus unnerved by stevens revelations rebus made his way back to his flat he needed to find out about some things mickey could wait he had drawn too many bad cards in the course of his afternoons footslogging he had to get in touch with his old employers the army he had to make them see that a life was at stake they who prized life so strangely a lot of phonecalls might be necessary so be it but the first call he made was to the hospital rhona was fine that was a relief still however she had not been told of sammys abduction rebus swallowed hard had she been told of her lovers death she had not of course not he arranged for some flowers to be sent to her he was about to pluck up the courage to telephone the first of a long list of numbers when his own telephone rang he let it ring for a while but the caller was not about to let him go hello john thank god ive been looking for you everywhere it was gill sounding excited and nervous and yet trying to sound sympathetic too her voice modulated wildly and rebus felt his heart what was left of it for public consumption go out to her what is it gill has anything happened ive had a call from reeve rebuss heart pounded against the walls of its cell tell me he said well he just phoned up and said that hes got samantha and gill swallowed hard and that hes going to kill her tonight there was a pause at rebuss end strange distant sounds of movement john hello john rebus stopped punching the telephonestool yes im here jesus christ did he say anything else john you really shouldnt be on your own you know i could did he say anything else he was shouting now his breath short like a runners well i yes i let slip that we know who he is rebus sucked in his breath examining his knuckles noting that he had torn one of them open he sucked blood staring from his window what was his reaction to that he said at last he went wild ill bet he did jesus i hope he doesnt take it out on oh jesus why do you suppose he phoned you specifically he had stopped licking his wound and now turned his attention on his dark fingernails tearing at them with his teeth spitting them out across the room well i am liaison officer on the case he may have seen me on the television or read my name in the newspapers or maybe hes seen us together he may have been following me during this whole thing he looked from his window as a shabbilydressed man shuffled his way up the street stopping to pick up a cigaretteend christ he needed a cigarette he looked around for an ashtray source of a few reusable butts i never thought of that how the hell could you we didnt know that any of this was to do with me until it was yesterday wasnt it it seems like days ago but remember gill his notes were delivered by hand in the beginning he lit the remnants of a cigarette sucking in the stinging smoke hes been so close to me and i didnt feel a thing not a tingle so much for a policemans sixth sense speaking of sixth senses john ive had a hunch gill was relieved to hear how his voice had become calmer she felt a little calmer too as though they were helping each other to hang on to a crowded lifeboat in a stormtorn sea whats that rebus slumped himself into his chair looking around his barren room dusty and chaotic he saw the glass used by michael a plate of toast crumbs two empty cigarette packets and two coffee cups he would sell this place soon no matter how low the price he would move well away from here he would libraries gill was saying staring at her own office the files and mounds of paperwork the clutter of months and years the electric buzz in the air the one thing that all the girls samantha included have in common is that they used if irregularly the same library the central library reeve might have worked there once and been able to find the names he needed to fit his puzzle thats certainly a thought said rebus suddenly interested it was too much of a coincidence surely or was it how better to find out about john rebus than to get a quiet job for a few months or a few years how better to trap young girls than by posing as a librarian reeve had gone undercover all right so wellcamouflaged as to be invisible it just so happens gill continued that your friend jack morton has been to the central library already he checked up on a suspect there who owned a blue escort he gave the man a clean bill of health yes and they gave the yorkshire ripper a clean bill of health on more than one occasion didnt they its worth rechecking what was the suspects name ive no idea ive been trying to find jack morton but hes off somewhere john ive been worried about you where have you been ive been trying to find you i call that a waste of police time and effort inspector templer get your nose back to the real grindstone find jack find that name yes sir ill be here for a while if you need me ive got a few phone calls of my own to make i hear that rhona is stable but rebus had already put down his receiver gill sighed rubbing at her face desperate for some rest she decided to arrange for someone to be sent over to john rebuss flat he could not be left to fester and perhaps explode then she had to find that name she had to find jack morton rebus made himself some coffee thought about going out for milk but decided in the end to have the coffee bitter and black the taste and the colour of his thoughts he thought over gills idea reeve as a librarian it seemed improbable unthinkable but then everything that had happened to him of late had been unthinkable rationality could be a powerful enemy when you were faced with the irrational fight fire with fire accept that gordon reeve might have secured a job in the library something innocuous yet essential to his plan and suddenly for john rebus as for gill it all seemed to fit for those who read between the times for those who are involved with books between one time the cross and another the present my god was nothing arbitrary in this life no nothing at all behind the seemingly irrational lay the clear golden path of the design behind this world there was another reeve was in the library rebus felt sure of that it was five oclock he could reach the library just as it was closing but would gordon reeve still be there or would he have moved on now that he had his final victim but rebus knew that sammy was not reeves final victim she was not a victim at all she was merely another device there could be only one victim rebus himself and for that reason reeve would still be nearby still within rebuss reach for reeve wanted to be found but slowly a sort of catandmouse game in reverse rebus thought back to the game of catandmouse as played in his schooldays sometimes the boy being chased by a girl or the girl being chased by a boy would want to be caught because he or she felt something for the chaser and so the whole thing became something other than it seemed that was reeves game cat and mouse and he the mouse with the sting in his tail the bite in his teeth and rebus as soft as milk as pliant as fur and contentment there had been no contentment for gordon reeve not for many years not since he had been betrayed by one whom he had come to call brother just a kiss the mouse caught the brother i never had poor gordon reeve balancing on that slender pipe the piss trickling down his legs and everybody laughing at him and poor john rebus shunned by his father and his brother a brother who had turned to crime now and who must be punished eventually and poor sammy she was the one he should be thinking of think only of her john and everything will turn out all right but if this was a serious game a game of life and death then he had to remember that it was still a game rebus knew now that he had reeve but having caught him what would happen the roles would switch in some way he did not yet know all the rules there was one way and only the one way to learn them he left the coffee to go cold on his coffeetable beside all the other waste there was bitterness enough in his mouth as it was and out there out in the irongrey drizzle there was a game to be finished from his flat in marchmont to the library could be a delightful walk showing the strengths of edinburgh as a city he passed through a verdant open area called the meadows and on the skyline before him stood the great grey castle a flag blowing in the fine rain over its ramparts he passed the royal infirmary home of discoveries and famous names part of the university greyfriars kirkyard and the tiny statue of greyfriars bobby how many years had that little dog lain beside its masters grave how many years had gordon reeve gone to sleep at night with burning thoughts of john rebus on his mind he shuddered sammy sammy sammy he hoped that he would get to know his daughter better he hoped that he would be able to tell her that she was beautiful and that she would find great love in her life dear god he hoped she was alive walking along george iv bridge which took tourists and others over the citys grassmarket safely away from that areas tramps and derelicts latterday paupers with nowhere to turn john rebuss mind churned a few facts for one reeve would be armed for another he might be in disguise he remembered sammy talking about the downandouts who sat around all day in the library he could be one of them he wondered what he would do if and when he met reeve face to face what would he say questions and theories began to disturb him frightened him almost as much as did the recognition that sammys fate at the hands of reeve would be painful and protracted but she was more important to him than memory she was the future and so he stalked towards the gothic facade of the library with determination not fear on his face a news vendor outside his coat wrapped around him like damp tissuepaper cried out the latest news not of the strangler today but of some disaster at sea news did not last for long rebus swerved past the man eyeing his face carefully he noticed that his own shoes were letting in water as usual then he entered the oak swingdoors at the main desk a security man flicked through a newspaper he did not resemble gordon reeve not in any way at all rebus breathed deeply trying to stop himself from shaking were closing sir said the guard from behind his newspaper yes im sure you are the guard did not appear to like the sound of rebuss voice it was a hard icy voice used like a weapon my names rebus detective sergeant rebus im looking for a man called reeve who works here is he around rebus hoped that he sounded calm he did not feel calm the guard left his newspaper on the chair and came up to face him he studied rebus as though wary of him good rebus wanted it that way can i see your identification clumsily his fingers not ready to be delicate rebus fished out his id card the guard looked at it for some time glancing up at him reeve did you say he handed rebuss card back and brought out a list of names attached to a yellow plastic clipboard reeve reeve reeve reeve no theres nobody called reeve works here are you sure he may not be a librarian he could be a cleaner or something anything no everybodys on my list from the director down to the porter look thats my name there simpson everybodys on this list hed be on this list if he worked here you must have made a mistake staff were beginning to leave the building calling out their goodnights and their see yous he might lose reeve if he didnt hurry always supposing that reeve still worked here it was such a slender straw such a tenuous hope that rebus began to panic again can i see that list he put out his hand making his eyes burn with authority the guard hesitated then handed over the clipboard rebus searched it furiously looking for anagrams clues anything he didnt have to look far ian knott he whispered to himself ian knott gordian knot reef knot gordian reef its just like my name he wondered if gordon reeve could smell him he could smell reeve he was as close as a short walk perhaps a flight of stairs that was all where does ian knott work mister knott he works parttime in the childrens section nicest man you could hope to meet why whats he done is he in today i think so i think he comes in for two hours at the end of the afternoon look whats this all about the childrens section you said thats downstairs isnt it thats right the guard was really flustered now he knew trouble when he saw it ill just phone down and let him rebus leaned across the desk so that his nose touched that of the guard youll do nothing understand if you buzz down to him ill come back up and kick that telephone so far up your arse that you really will be able to make internal calls do you get my drift the guard started to nod slowly and carefully but rebus had already turned his back on him and was heading for the gleaming stairwell the library smelled of used books of damp of brass and polish in rebuss nostrils it was the smell of confrontation a smell that would remain with him walking down the stairs down into the heart of the library it became the smell of a hosing down in the middle of the night of wrenching a gun away from its owner of lonely marches overland of washhouses of that whole nightmare he could smell colours and sounds and sensations there was a word for that feeling but he could not remember it for the moment he counted the steps down using the exercise to calm himself twelve stairs then around a corner then twelve more and he found himself at a glass door with a small painting on it a teddy bear and a skippingrope the bear was laughing at something to rebus it was smiling at him not a pleasant smile but a gloating one come in come in whoever you are he studied the rooms interior there was nobody about not a soul quietly he pushed open the door no children no librarians but he could hear someone placing books on a shelf the sound came from a partition behind the lendingdesk rebus tiptoed over to the desk and pressed a little bell there from behind the partition humming brushing invisible dust from his hands came an older chubbier smiling gordon reeve he look a bit like a teddy bear himself rebuss hands were gripping the edge of the desk gordon reeve stopped humming when he saw rebus but the smile still played games with his face making him seem innocent normal safe good to see you john he said so youve tracked me down at last you old devil how are you he was holding out a hand for rebus to shake but john rebus knew that if he lifted his fingers from the edge of the desk he would crumple to the floor he remembered gordon reeve now recalled every detail of their time together he remembered the mans gestures and his jibes and his thoughts blood brothers they had been enduring together able to read the others mind almost blood brothers they would be again rebus could see it in the mad clear eyes of his smiling tormentor he felt the sea rushing through him stinging his ears this was it then this was what had been expected of him i want samantha he enunciated i want her alive and i want her now then we can settle this any way you like where is she gordon do you know how long it is since anyone called me that ive been ian knott for so long i can hardly bring myself to think of me as a gordon reeve he smiled looking behind rebuss back wheres the cavalry john dont tell me youve come along here on your own thats against procedure isnt it rebus knew better than to tell him the truth theyre outside dont worry ive come in here to talk but ive got plenty of friends outside youre finished gordon now tell me where she is but gordon reeve only shook his head chuckling come on john it wouldnt be your style to bring anyone with you you forget that i know you he looked tired suddenly i know you so well his disguise was slipping away piece by careful piece no youre alone all right all alone just like i was remember where is she not telling there could be no doubt that the man was insane perhaps he always had been he looked the way he had looked on the days just before the bad days in their cell on the edge of an abyss an abyss created in his own mind but fearful all the same for the very reason that it was outwith any physical control he was smiling surrounded by colourful posters glossy drawings and picturebooks the most dangerouslooking man rebus had met in his entire life why reeve looked at him as though he could not have asked a more infantile question he shook his head smiling still the whores smile the cool professional smile of the killer you know why he said because of everything because you left me in the lurch just as surely as if we had been in the hands of the enemy you deserted john you deserted me you know what the sentence is for that dont you you know what the sentence is for desertion reeves voice had become hysterical he chuckled again trying to calm himself rebus steadied himself for violence pumping adrenaline through his body knotting his fists and his muscles i know your brother what your brother michael i know him did you know that hes a drugs pusher well more of a middleman really anyway hes up to his neck in trouble john ive been his supplier for a while long enough to find out about you michael was very keen to reassure me that he wasnt a plant a police informer he was keen to spill the beans about you john so that wed believe him he always thought of the setup as a we but it was just little me wasnt that clever of me ive already fixed your brother his heads in a noose isnt it you could call it a contingency plan he had john rebuss brother and he had his daughter there was only one more person he wanted and rebus had walked straight into this trap he needed time to think how long have you been planning all this im not sure he laughed growing in confidence ever since you deserted i suppose michael was the easiest part really he wanted easy money it was simple enough to persuade him that drugs were the answer hes in it up to his neck your brother the last word was spat out at rebus as though it were venom through him i found out a little more about you john and that made everything easier in its turn reeve shrugged his shoulders so you see if you turn me in ill turn him in it wont work i want you too badly so youll let your brother rot in jail fair enough either way i win cant you see that yes rebus could see it but dimly as though it were a difficult equation in a hot classroom what happened to you anyway he asked now unsure why he was playing for time he had come charging in here without a selfprotective thought or a plan in his head and now he was stuck awaiting reeves move which must surely come i mean what happened after i deserted oh they cracked me quite quickly after that reeve was nonchalant he could afford to be i was out on my ear they put me into a hospital for a while then let me go i heard that youd gone gaga that cheered me up a little but then i heard a rumour that youd joined the police force well i couldnt stand the thought of you having a cosy life of it not after what wed been through and what youd done his face began to jerk a little his hands rested on the desk and rebus could smell the vinegary sweat coming from him he spoke as though drifting off to sleep but with each word rebus knew that he was becoming more dangerous still and yet he could not make himself move not yet it took you long enough to get to me it was worth the wait reeve rubbed at his cheek sometimes i thought i might die before it was all finished but i think i always knew that i wouldnt he smiled come on john ive got something to show you sammy dont be fucking stupid the smile disappeared again only for a second do you think id keep her here no but ive got something else that will interest you come on he led rebus behind the partition rebus his nerves jangling studied reeves back the muscles covered in a layer of easy living a librarian a childrens librarian and edinburghs own mass murderer behind the partition were shelves and shelves of books some piled haphazardly others in neat rows their spines matching these are all waiting to be reshelved said reeve waving a custodial hand around him it was you that got me interested in books john do you remember yes i told you stories rebus had started to think about michael without him reeve might never have been found might never have been suspected even and now he would go to jail poor mickey now where did i put it i know its here somewhere i put it aside to show you if you ever found me god knows its taken you long enough youve not been very bright have you john it was easy to forget that the man was insane that he had killed four girls in a game and had another at his mercy it was so easy no said rebus ive not been very bright he could feel himself tightening the very air around him seemed to be getting thinner something was about to happen he could feel it and to stop it from happening all he had to do was punch reeve in the kidneys chop him behind the neck restrain him and bundle him out of here so why didnt he do just that he did not know himself all he knew was that whatever would happen would happen and that it had been set out like the plan of a building or a game of noughts and crosses many years before reeve had started the game that left rebus in a nowin situation but he could not leave it unfinished there had to be this rummaging in the shelves this find ah here it is its a book ive been reading but john rebus realised if reeve had been reading it then why was it so well hidden crime and punishment you told me the story do you remember yes i remember i told it to you more than once thats right john you did the book was a quality leather edition quite old it did not seem like a library copy reeve handled it as though he were handling money or diamonds it was as though he had owned nothing so precious in all his life theres one illustration in here that i want you to see john do you recall what i said about old raskolnikov you said he should have shot the lot of them rebus caught the undermeaning a second too late he had misread this clue as he had misread so many of reeves clues meantime gordon reeve his eyes shining had opened the book and brought out a small snubnosed revolver from its hollowedout interior the gun was being raised to meet rebuss chest when he sprang forward and butted reeve on the nose planning was one thing but sometimes dirty inspiration was needed blood and mucus came crashing from the suddenly broken bones reeve gasped and rebuss hand pushed the gunarm away from him reeve was screaming now a scream from the past from so many living nightmares it set rebus off balance plunging him back into his act of betrayal he could see the guards the open door and he with his back to the screams of the trapped man the scene before him blurred and was replaced by an explosion the soft thump in his shoulder turned quickly to a spreading numbness and then to an intense pain seeming to fill his entire body he clutched at his jacket feeling blood soak through the padding through the lightweight material jesus christ so that was what it was like to be shot he felt as though he would be sick would faint clean away but then he felt an onrush of something coming up from his soul it was the blinding force of anger he was not about to lose this one he saw reeve wiping the mess from his face trying to stop his eyes from watering the gun still wavering before him rebus picked up a heavylooking book and swiped at reeves hand sending the gun flying into a pile of books and then reeve was gone staggering through the shelves pulling them down after him rebus ran back to the desk and telephoned for help his eyes wary for gordon reeves return there was silence in the room he sat down on the floor suddenly the door opened and william anderson came through it dressed in black like some cliched avenging angel rebus smiled how the hell did you find me ive been following you for quite a while anderson bent down to examine rebuss arm i heard the shot i take it youve found our man hes still in here somewhere unarmed the guns back there anderson tied a handkerchief around rebuss shoulder you need an ambulance john but rebus was already rising to his feet not yet lets get this finished how come i didnt spot you trailing me anderson allowed himself a smile it takes a very good copper to know when im trailing them and youre not very good john youre just good they went behind the partition and began to move carefully further and further into the shelves rebus had picked up the gun he pushed it deep into his pocket there was no sign of gordon reeve look anderson was pointing to a half open door at the very back of the stacks they moved towards it slowly still and rebus pushed it open he confronted a steep iron stairwell badly lit it seemed to twist down into the foundations of the library there was nowhere to go but down ive heard about this i think whispered anderson his whispers echoing around the deep shaft as they descended the library was built on the site of the old sheriff court and the cells which used to be beneath the courthouse are still there the library stores old books in them a whole maze of cells and passageways leading right under the city smooth plaster walls gave way to ancient brickwork as they descended rebus could smell fungus an old bitter smell left over from a previous age he could be anywhere then anderson shrugged his shoulders they had reached the bottom of the stairs and found themselves in a wide passageway clear of books but off this passageway were alcoves the old cells presumably in which were stacked rows of books there seemed no order no pattern they were just old books he could probably get out of here whispered anderson i think there are exits to places like the presentday courthouse and saint giles cathedral rebus was in awe here was a piece of old edinburgh intact and undefiled its incredible he said i never knew about this theres more underneath the city chambers there are supposed to be whole streets of the old city which the builders just built right on top of whole streets shops houses roads hundreds of years old anderson shook his head realising as was rebus that you could not trust your own knowledge you could walk right over a reality without necessarily encroaching on it they worked their way along the passage thankful for the dim electric lighting on the ceiling checking each and every cell with no success who is he then anderson whispered hes an old friend of mine said rebus feeling a little dizzy it seemed to him that there was very little oxygen down here he was sweating profusely he knew that it had to do with the loss of blood and that he shouldnt be here at all yet he needed to be here he remembered that there were things he should have done he should have found out reeves address from the guard and sent a police car round in case sammy were there too late now there he is anderson had spotted him way ahead of them in such shadow that rebus could not make out a shape until reeve started to run anderson ran after him with rebus swallowing hard trying to keep up watch him hes dangerous rebus felt his words fall away from him he had not the strength to shout suddenly everything was going wrong ahead he saw anderson catch up with reeve and saw reeve lash out with a nearperfect roundhouse kick learned all those years ago and not forgotten andersons head swivelled to one side as the kick landed and he fell against the wall rebus had slumped to his knees panting hard his eyes hardly able to focus sleep he needed sleep the cold uneven ground felt comfortable to him as comfortable as the best bed he could want he wavered ready to fall reeve seemed to be walking towards him while anderson slid down the wall reeve seemed massive now still in shadow growing larger with each step until he consumed rebus and rebus could see him grinning from ear to ear now you reeve roared now for you rebus knew that somewhere above them traffic was probably moving effortlessly across george iv bridge people were probably walking smartly home to an evening of television and family comfort while he knelt at the feet of this nightmare a poor forked animal at the end of the chase it would do him no good to scream no good to fight against it he saw a blur of gordon reeve bend down in front of him its face pushed awkwardly to one side rebus remembered that he had broken reeves nose quite successfully so did reeve he stood back and swung a heaving kick at john rebuss chin rebus managed to move slightly something still working away inside him and the blow caught him on the cheek sending him sideways lying in a halfprotective foetal position he heard reeve laugh and watched the hands as they closed around his throat he thought of the woman and his own hands around her neck this was justice then so be it and then he thought of sammy of gill of anderson and andersons murdered son of those little girls all dead no he could not let gordon reeve win it wouldnt be right it wouldnt be fair he felt his tongue and eyes bulging straining he slipped his hand into his pocket as gordon reeve whispered to him youre glad its all over arent you john youre actually relieved and then another explosion filled the passage hurting rebuss ears the recoil from the gunshot tingled through his hand and his arm and he caught the sweet smell again something like the smell of toffeeapples reeve startled froze for a second then folded like paper falling across rebus smothering him rebus unable to move decided it was safe to go to sleep now epilogue they kicked down the door of ian knotts small bungalow a tiny quiet suburban house in full view of his curious neighbours and found samantha rebus there petrified tied to a bed her mouth taped shut and with pictures of the dead girls for company everything became very professional after that as samantha was led weeping from the house the driveway was hidden from the neighbouring bungalow by a tall hedge and so nobody had seen anything of reeves comings and goings he was a quiet man the neighbours said he had moved into the house seven years ago at the time when he had started work as a librarian jim stevens was happy enough with the conclusion of the case it made for a full weeks stories but how could he have been so wrong about john rebus he couldnt work that one out at all still his drugs story had been completed too and michael rebus would go to jail there was no doubt about that the london press came in search of their own versions of the truth stevens met one journalist in the bar of the caledonian hotel the man was trying to buy samantha rebuss story he patted his pocket assuring jim stevens that he had his editors chequebook with him this seemed to stevens to be part of some larger malaise it wasnt just that the media could create reality and then tamper with that creation whenever they liked there was something beneath the surface of it all something different to the usual dirt and squalor and mess something much more ambiguous he didnt like it at all and he didnt like what it had done to him he talked with the london journalist about vague concepts such as justice and trust and balance they talked for hours drinking whisky and beer but still the same questions remained edinburgh had shown itself to jim stevens as never before cowering beneath the shadow of the castle rock in hiding from something all the tourists saw were shadows from history while the city itself was something else entirely he didnt like it he didnt like the job he was doing and he didnt like the hours the london offers were still there he clutched at the biggest straw and drifted south acknowledgements the writing of this novel was aided hugely by the help given to me by the leith cid in edinburgh who were patient about my many questions and my ignorance of police procedures and although this is a work of fiction with all the faults of such i was aided in my research into the special air service by tony geraghtys excellent book who dares wins fontana reading group notes knots crosses about ian rankin ian rankin obe writes a huge proportion of all the crime novels sold in the uk and has won numerous prizes including in the crime writers association diamond dagger his work is available in over languages home sales of his books exceed one million copies a year and several of the novels based around the character of detective inspector rebus his name meaning enigmatic puzzle have been successfully transferred to television introduction to di john rebus the first novels to feature rebus a flawed but resolutely humane detective were not an overnight sensation and success took time to arrive but the wait became a period that allowed ian rankin to come of age as a writer and to develop rebus into a thoroughly believable fleshandblood character straddling both industrial and postindustrial scotland a gritty yet perceptive man coping with his own demons as rebus struggled to keep his relationship with daughter sammy alive following his divorce and to cope with the imprisonment of brother michael while all the time trying to strike a blow for morality against a fearsome array of sinners some justified and some not readers began to respond in their droves fans admired ian rankins recreation of a picturepostcard edinburgh with a vicious toothandclaw underbelly just a heartbeat away his believable but at the same time complex plots and best of all rebus as a conflicted man trying always to solve the unsolvable and to do the right thing as the series progressed ian rankin refused to shy away from contentious issues such as corruption in high places paedophilia and illegal immigration combining his unique seal of tight plotting with a bleak realism leavened with brooding humour in rebus the reader is presented with a rich and constantly evolving portrait of a complex and troubled man irrevocably tinged with the sense of being an outsider and potentially unable to escape being a justified sinner himself rebuss life is intricately related to his scottish environs too enriched by ian rankins attentive depiction of locations and careful regard to rebuss favourite music watering holes and books as well as his often fraught relationships with colleagues and family and so alongside rebus the reader is taken on an often painful sometimes hellish journey to the depths of human nature always rooted in the minutiae of a very recognisable scottish life the oxford bar rebus and many of the characters who appear in the novels are regulars of the ox as is ian rankin himself the pub is now synonymous with the rebus novels to the extent that one of the regular medical examiners called in to assist with investigations is named after the pubs owner john gates edinburgh plays an important role throughout the rebus novels a character itself as brooding and as volatile as rebus the edinburgh depicted in the novels is far short of the beautiful city that tourists in their thousands flood to visit hidden behind the historic buildings and elegant facades is the world that rebus inhabits for general discussion regarding the rebus series how does ian rankin reveal himself as an author interested in using fiction to tell the truths the real world cant there are similarities between the lives of the author and his protagonist for instance both ian rankin and rebus were born in fife lost their mothers at an early age have children with physical problems so is it useful therefore to think of john rebus and ian rankin as each others alter egos could it be said that rebus is trying to make sense in a general way of the world around him or is he seeking answers to the big questions and is it relevant therefore that he is a believer in god and comes from a scottish presbyterian background would rebus see confession in both the religious and the criminal sense as similar in any way how does ian rankin explore notions of edinburgh as a character in its own right in what way does he contrast the glossy public and seedy private faces of the city with the public and private faces of those rebus meets how does ian rankin use musical sources the elvis references in the black book for instance or the rolling stones allusions in let it bleed as a means of character development through the series what does rebuss own taste in music and books say about him as a person what do you think about rebus as a character if you have read several or more novels from the series discuss how his character is developed if rebus has a problem with notions of pecking order and the idea of authority generally what does it say about him that he chose careers in hierarchical institutions such as the army and then the police how does rebus relate to women as lovers flirtations family members and colleagues do the flashes of gallows humour as often shown by the pathologists but sometimes also in rebuss own comments increase or dissipate narrative tension does rebus use black comedy for the same reasons the pathologists do do rebuss personal vulnerabilities make him understanding of the frailties of others how does the characterisation of rebus compare to other longstanding popular detectives from british authors such as holmes poirot morse or dalgleish and are there more similarities or differences between them knots crosses things arent going well for john rebus a detective sergeant when we first meet him hes smoking and drinking too much as he smarts from the breakup of his marriage to rhona who has taken their daughter sammy with her to london and work is a trial as someone is seizing and killing young girls and taunting the police with their deaths as a journalist becomes intent on exposing rebus as being implicated in his brother michaels drugs scam and after a series of peculiar letters each containing some knotted string and a tiny cross made of matches arrives at his home rebuss antennae begin to twitch uncontrollably although this could be more because hes heading for a physical breakdown that necessitates a brief hospital sojourn but its only after someone phones in with an acrostic clue that the game starts to unfold and rebus realises that this series of murders is in fact intensely personal the direct result of an sas training exercise many years earlier that went disastrously wrong even worse sammys life is now in peril as part of a frantic contest played out in the network of foetid tunnels that lie beneath the streets of edinburgh ian rankin intended knots amp crosses to be in part a reworking of the classic dr jekyll and mr hyde story with an additional nod towards the reallife edinburgh character deacon william brodie a gentleman by day but a criminal by night in this debut already many of the themes appear that will be expanded on in later books the grimy underside of edinburgh rebus isolated and ill at ease as he remains dogged in his determination to track down a variety of troublesome killers characters who will return in later novels but scant reviews and modest sales of knots amp crosses did little to suggest how popular rebus would become discussion points for knots ctosses in what ways does knots amp crosses reveal the passage of time since it was written rebuss relationship with his brother michael isnt easy is this a metaphor for the difficulties rebus faces regarding other sorts of brotherhood such as within the police force or the army ian rankin refers several times to practical jokes in knots amp crosses how does he explore themes of jokes games and linguistic trickery are the skills of journalist jim stevens mirrored by those of rebus do the two men respect the similarities between them and what do they each feel about drawing close to the big fish does the act of reading a crime story put the reader in a similar role to that of either detective or investigative journalist and if so in what way what contrasts does jim stevens make between oldfashioned crime such as the families of s glasgow gangsters and the new crime wave such as drugdealing and which does he favour what do you make of rebuss behaviour towards the woman he picks up at the rio grande bingo hall was nothing arbitrary in this life rebus wonders no nothing at all behind the seemingly irrational lay the clear golden path of the design consider how even in his debut novel ian rankin explores this notion are there any signs remaining that ian rankin toyed with the idea of killing rebus off at the end of knots amp crosses if ian rankin had envisaged knots amp crosses to be the opener for the lengthy and detailed series the rebus books were to become how could he have allowed his plotting to draw to a close in a more openended manner and might this have made the narrative stronger ultimately by ian rankin the inspector rebus series knots crosses hide seek tooth nail strip jack the black book mortal causes let it bleed black blue the
