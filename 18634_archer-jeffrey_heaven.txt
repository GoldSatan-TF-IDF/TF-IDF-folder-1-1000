jeffrey archer heaven the third book in the prison diary series day monday october pm the signpost announces north sea camp one mile as we approach the entrance to the prison the first thing that strikes me is that there are no electric gates no high walls and no razor wire i am released from my sweat box and walk into reception where i am greeted by an officer mr daff has a jolly smile and a military air he promises that after wayland this will be more like butlins in fact he adds theres a butlins just up the road in skegness the only difference is theyve got a wall around them here mr daff explains the walls are replaced by rollcalls am am pm pm and pm when i must present myself to the spur office a whole new regime to become accustomed to while mr daff completes the paperwork i unpack my hmp plastic bags he barks that i will only be allowed to wear prison garb so all my tshirts are taken away and placed in a possessions box marked archer ff dean a prison orderly helps me once all my belongings have been checked he escorts me to my room please note room not cell at nsc prisoners have their own key and there are no bars on the windows so far so good however im back to sharing with another prisoner my roommate is david he doesnt turn the music down when i walk in and a rolledup cigarette doesnt leave his mouth as i make my bed david tells me that hes a lifer whose original tariff was fifteen years so far hes served twentyone because hes still considered a risk to the public despite being in a dcat prison his original crime was murder an attack on a waiter who leered at his wife pm dean reception orderly informs me that mr berlyn one of the governors wants to see me he accompanies me to the governors portakabin where i am once again welcomed with a warm smile after a preliminary chat mr berlyn says that he plans to place me in the education department the governor then talks about the problem of nscs being an open prison and how they hope to handle the press he ends by saying his door is always open to any prisoner should i need any help or assistance pm dean takes me off to supper in the canteen the food looks far better than waylands and it is served and eaten in a central hall rather like at boarding school pm write for two hours and feel exhausted when ive finished i walk across to join doug in the hospital he seems to have all the uptodate gossip hes obviously going to be invaluable as my deep throat we sit and watch the evening news in comfortable chairs dean joins us a few minutes later despite the fact that he is only hours away from being released he says that my laundry has already been washed and returned to my room pm i walk back to the north block and report to the duty officer for rollcall mr hughes wears a peaked cap that resembles mr mackays in porridge and he enjoys the comparison he comes across as a fierce sergeant major type twenty years in the army but within moments i discover hes a complete softie the inmates like and admire him if he says hell do something he does it if he cant he tells you i return to my room and push myself to write for another hour despite a smokefilled room and loud music pm final rollcall fifteen minutes later im in bed and fast asleep oblivious to davids smoke and music day tuesday october am alsatians woke me at belmarsh at wayland it was officers jangling keys as they made their early morning rounds but as nsc is only yards from the coastline its the constant squawk of seagulls that causes you to open your eyes later much later the muffled grunts of swine are added as the largest group of residents at nsc are the pigs living on the acre prison farm i drape a pair of black boxer shorts over the light above my head to make sure david is not woken while i continue my writing routine he doesnt stir at seventhirty i make my way to the shower room at the end of the corridor am dean accompanies me to breakfast porridge from monday to friday and cereal at weekends he explains i satisfy myself with a very hardboiled egg and a couple of slices of burnt toast am induction during the first week at nsc a prisoner spends his time finding out how the place works while the officers try to discover as much as possible about the new inmate my first appointment is with dr walling the prison doctor who asks the usual questions about drugs smoking drinking illnesses and allergies after twenty minutes of prodding breathing in being weighed and having my eyes ears teeth and heart checked dr wallings only piece of advice is not to overdo it in the gym try not to forget you are sixtyone he reminds me as i leave the surgery doug the hospital orderly a friend of darren wayland marijuana only beckons me into the private ward doug is six foot and about sixteen stone with a full head of hair just beginning to grey and i would guess is in his late forties the ward has eight beds one of which is dougs as someone has to be resident at night in case a prisoner is suddenly taken ill but what a job not only does doug have a room the size of a penthouse suite but he also has his own television and his own bathroom he tells me that hes in for tax evasion but doesnt elaborate doug closes the door to his kingdom and confirms that medical orderly is the best job in the prison however he assures me that the secondbest position at nsc is orderly at the sentence management unit smu doug whispers that the smu job is coming up in just over four weeks time when the present incumbent matthew will be released mr new the senior officer equivalent to mr tinkler at wayland will make the final decision but doug will put in a good word for me whatever you do he adds dont end up working on the farm winters not far off so if the food doesnt kill you the farm will as i leave he adds come and have a drink this evening by that he means tea or coffee im allowed two guests from seven to ten and youd be welcome i thank him and silently my old mentor darren who you know is just as important on the inside as it is on the outside am my second induction meeting is to decide what job ill do while im at nsc i make my way to the sentence management unit a building that was formerly the governors house and is situated just a few yards from the front gate the pathway leading up to the entrance is lined with tired red flowers the light blue front door could do with a lick of paint it looks as if it is regularly kicked open rather than pushed the first room i enter has the feel of a conservatory it has a dozen wooden chairs and a notice board covered in information leaflets four officers including a mr gough who looks like a prep school master occupy the first room on the ground floor as he ticks off my name mr gough announces in a broad norfolk accent that he will be speaking to all the new inductees once everyone has come across from their medical examination but as dr walling is taking fifteen minutes with each new prisoner we may be sitting around for some time as i wait impatiently in the conservatory i become aware how filthy the room is at wayland the floors shone from their daily buffing and if you stood still for more than a few moments someone painted you eventually all seven new inductees turn up mr gough welcomes us and begins by saying that as most prisoners spend less than three months at nsc the officers aim to make our time as civilized as possible while they prepare us for returning to the outside world mr gough explains that at nsc anyone can abscond its all too easy as there are no walls to keep you in but if you do decide to leave us please remember to leave your room key on your pillow hes not joking he then tells us about a young man who absconded sixteen hours before he was due to be released he was picked up in boston the following morning and transferred to a ccat where he spent a further six weeks point taken mr gough takes us through the jobs that are available for all prisoners under the age of sixty pointing out that over half the inmates work on the farm the other half can enrol for education or take on the usual jobs in the kitchen or painting gardening or as a cleaner mr gough ends by telling us that we all have to abide by a no drugs policy refusing to sign the three documents stating you are not on drugs and will agree at any time to a voluntary drugs test will rule you out of becoming enhanced in eight weeks time enhancement allows you a further a week to spend in the canteen along with several other privileges to a question mr gough replies wearing your own clothes is not permitted in an open prison as it would make absconding that much easier however i did notice that doug tax evasion was wearing a green tshirt and brown slacks held up by the most outrageous walt disney braces theres always someone who finds a way round the system i happily sign all of mr goughs drug forms and am then sent upstairs to be interviewed by another officer mr donnelly not only looks like a farmer but is also dressed in green overalls and wearing wellington boots no wonder the place is so dirty he appears keen for me to join him on the farm but i explain on dougs advice that i would like to be considered for matthews job as smu orderly he makes a note and frowns noon after ten weeks locked up in wayland and always being handed a plate of food i cant get used to helping myself one of the kitchen staff laughs when i pass over my plate and expect to be served a clear sign youve just arrived from a closed prison he remarks welcome to the real world jeff after lunch dean takes me across to view the more secluded quieter south block which is at the far end of the prison and houses the older inmates nsc has two blocks north and south with about prisoners resident in each here there is a totally different atmosphere dean shows me an empty room large by normal standards about twenty by eight feet with a window that looks out over the bleak north sea he explains that the whole spur is in the process of redecoration and is scheduled to reopen on monday incell electricity ice will be added and all rooms will eventually have a television on our way back to the north block an officer informs me that the principal officer mr new wants to see me immediately im nervous what have i done wrong is he going to send me back to wayland po new is in his late forties around five feet eleven with a shock of thick white hair he greets me with a warm smile i hear you want to work at smu he says and before i can reply adds youve got the job as matthew is leaving in four weeks time youd better start straight away so there can be a smooth takeover ive hardly got the words thank you out before he continues i hear you want to move to the south block which im sure will be possible and im also told you want to be transferred to spring hill which he adds will not be quite as easy because they dont want you and the attendant publicity that goes with you my heart sinks however he says again before i can respond if thats what you want ill have a word with my opposite number at spring hill and see if she can help once mr new has completed his discourse we go downstairs to meet matthew the current orderly matthew is a shy young man who has a lost academic air about him i cant imagine what hes doing in prison despite mr new talking most of the time matthew manages to tell me what his responsibilities are from making tea and coffee for the eleven occupants of the building through to preparing induction files for every prisoner hes out on a town leave tomorrow so i will be thrown in at the deep end pm dean grabs my laundry bag and then accompanies me to supper explaining that orderlies have the privilege of eating on their own thirty minutes ahead of all the other inmates you get first choice of the food he adds and as there are about a dozen of us hospital stores reception library gym education chapel and gardens its quite a privilege all this within twentyfour hours isnt going to make me popular day wednesday october am i wake a few minutes after five and go for a pee in the latrine at the end of the corridor have you noticed that when youre disoriented or fearful you dont go to the lavatory for some time there must be a simple medical explanation for this i didnt open my bowels to use the doctors expression for the first five days at belmarsh the first three days at wayland and so far nogo at nsc am dean turns up to take me to breakfast i may not bother in future as i dont eat porridge and its hardly worth the journey for a couple of slices of burnt toast dean warns me that the press are swarming all over the place and large sums are being offered for a photo of me in prison uniform should they get a snap they will be disappointed to find me strolling around in a tshirt and jeans no arrows no number no ball and chain am at reception i ask mr daff if it would be possible to have a clean tshirt as my wife is visiting me this afternoon where do you think you fuckin are archer fuckin harrods am as a new prisoner i continue my induction course my first meeting this morning is in the gym we all assemble in a small portacabin and watch a ten minute blackandwhite video on safety at work the instructor concentrates on lifting as there are several jobs at nsc that require you to pick up heavy loads not to mention numerous prisoners who will be pumping weights in the gym mr masters the senior gym officer who has been at nsc for nineteen years then gives us a guided tour of the gym and its facilities it is not as large or well equipped as wayland but it does have three pieces of cardiovascular kit that will allow me to remain fit a rowing machine a step machine and a bicycle the gym itself is just large enough to play basketball whereas the weights room is about half the size of the one at wayland the gym is open every evening except monday from pm to pm so you dont have grunt grunt the pigs are having breakfast to complete the programme in a given hour i hope to start this weekend by which time i should have found my way around grunt grunt badminton is the most popular sport and although nsc has a football team the recent footandmouth problems have played havoc when it comes to being allowed out onto the pitch grunt grunt am education we all meet in the chapel the education officer takes us through the various alternatives on offer most of the new inmates sit sulkily in their chairs staring blankly at her as i have already been allocated a job as the smu orderly i listen in respectful silence and once shes finished her talk report back to my new job am matthew is away on a town visit today but i quickly discover that the smu job has three main responsibilities a making tea and coffee for the eleven staff who regularly work in the building plus those who drop in to visit a colleague b preparing the files for new inductees so that the officers have all their details to hand sentence fled full licence eligibility date home address whether they have a home or job to go to whether they have any money of their own whether their family want them back c preparing prisoners forms for visits days out weekend leave work out and compassionate or sick leave it will also be part of my job to see that every prisoner is sent to the relevant officer according to his needs mr simpson the resident probation officer tells me ill see anyone if im free otherwise ask them to make an appointment allowing him to deal with those prisoners who have a genuine problem and avoid those who stroll in to complain every other day am i go to lunch with the other orderlies the officer in charge of the kitchen wendy tells me that nsc was commended for having the best food in the prison service she says you should try the meat and stop being a vip vegetarian in prison wendy is a sort of pocketsized margaret thatcher her kitchen is spotless while her men slave away in their pristine white overalls leaving one in no doubt of their respect for her i promise to try the meat in two weeks time when i fill in my next menu voucher see overleaf pm now im in a dcat prison im allowed one visit a week after onethird of my sentence has been completed other privileges will be added heaven knows what the press will make of my first town visit however all of this could change rapidly once my appeal has been heard if your sentence is four years or more you are only eligible for parole whereas if its less than four years you will automatically be released after serving half your sentence and if youve been a model prisoner you can have another two months off while being tagged while tagged you must remain at home between pm and am back to todays visit two old friends david paterson and tony bloom accompany mary the three of them turn up twenty minutes late which only emphasizes how dreadful the mile round journey from london must be mary and i have thirty minutes on our own and she tells me that my solicitors have approached sir sydney kentridge qc to take over my appeal if it involves that mr justice potts was prejudiced against me before the trial started the one witness who could testify godfrey barker is now proving reluctant to come forward he fears that his wife who works at the home office may lose her job mary feels he will do what is just i feel he will vacillate and fall by the wayside she is the optimist i am the pessimist its usually the other way round during the visit both governor berlyn and po new stroll around talking to the families of the prisoners how different from wayland mr new tells us that nsc has now been dubbed the cushiest prison in england sun which he hopes will produce a better class of inmate in future the best food in any prison daily star i have the biggest room in the quietest block daily mail and hes the only one allowed to wear his own clothes daily mirror not one fact correct the hour and a half passes all too quickly but at least i can now have a visitor every week i can only wonder how many of my friends will be willing to make a sevenhour round trip to spend an hour and a half with me pm canteen at wayland you filled in an order form and then your supplies were delivered to your cell at nsc there is a small shop which you are allowed to visit twice a week between pm and pm so you can purchase what you need razor blades toothpaste chocolate water blackcurrant juice and most important of all phonecards i also need a can of shaving foam as i still shave every day what a difference a dcat makes pm i go across to the kitchen for supper and join two prisoners seated at the far end of the room i select them because of their age one turns out to be an accountant the other a retired insurance broker they do not talk about their crimes they tell me that they no longer work in the prison but travel into boston every morning by bus and have to back each afternoon by five they work at the local red cross shop and earn a week which is credited to their canteen account some prisoners can earn as much as a week giving them a chance to save a considerable sum by the time theyre released this makes a lot more sense than turfing them out onto the street with the regulation and no job to go to pm i join doug at the hospital for a blackcurrant juice a mcvities biscuit and the channel news in washington dc congress and the senate were evacuated because of an anthrax scare there seem to be so many ways of waging a modern war are we in the middle of the third world war without realizing it pm i return to the north block for rollcall to prove i have not absconded you cannot escape from an open prison only abscond there are no walls just a car barrier at the entrance and a public footpath at the back most prisoners who abscond do so in the first two weeks nine out of ten are back behind bars within fortyeight hours doug assures me that it becomes a lot easier after the first couple of weeks when the checks fall from six a day to four my problem is that the final rollcall is at ten and by then ive usually fallen asleep day thursday october am because so much is new to me and so much unknown i am still finding my way around mr hughes and mr jones the officers in charge of the north block try to deal quickly with prisoners queries and more important attempt to get things sorted making them popular with the other inmates the two blocks resemble second world war nissen huts the north block consists of a yard corridor with five spurs running off each side each corridor has nine rooms you have your own key and there are no bars on the windows two prisoners share each room my roommate david is a lifer murder and has the largest room not the usual five paces by three but seven paces by three i have already requested a transfer to the nosmoking spur on the south block which tends to house the older more mature prisoners despite the news of the world headline archer demands cell change the nosmoking rule is every prisoners right however governor berlyn is unhappy about my going across to the south block because its next to a public footpath which is currently populated by several journalists and photographers the corridor opposite mine has recently been designated a nosmoking zone and mr berlyn suggests i move across to one of the empty rooms on that spur as the prison is presently low in numbers i might even be left on my own every prisoner i have shared a cell with has either sold his story to the tabloids or been subjected to frontpage exposés always exaggerated and never accurate am my working day as smu orderly is am to lunch then pm to pm i arrive expecting to find matthew so he can begin the handover but mr gough is the only person on parade he has his head down brow furrowed staring at his computer he makes the odd muttering sound to himself before asking politely for a cup of tea am still no sign of matthew i read through the daily duties book and discover that among my responsibilities are mopping the kitchen floor sweeping all common areas vacuuming the carpets and cleaning the two lavatories as well as the kitchen thankfully the main occupation and the only thing that will keep me from going insane is dealing with prisoners queries by the time ive read the eightpage folder twice there is still no sign of matthew which is beginning to look like a hanging offence if you are late for work you are nicked rare in a dcat prison because being put on report can result in loss of privileges even being returned to a ccat according to the severity of your offence being caught taking drugs or absconding is an immediate recategorization offence these privileges and punishments are in place to make sure everyone abides by the rules mr new the principal officer arrives just as mr gough enters the room wheres matthew he asks i then observe the officers at their best but the prison service at its most ineffective thats why i came looking for you says mr gough matthew reported back late last night an offence that can have you transferred to a ccat because its assumed that youve absconded and he was put on report the atmosphere immediately changes but i took him off why asks mr new as he lights a cigarette his father collapsed yesterday afternoon and was taken into canterbury hospital hes been diagnosed with a brain tumour and the doctors think he may not survive the week right says mr new stubbing out his cigarette sign him up for a compassionate leave order and lets get him off to canterbury as quickly as possible mr new tells me that matthews mother died a year ago having suffered from ms and his grandmother a few weeks later this all took place soon after he committed the offence that resulted in him being sent to prison for fifteen months matthew walks in mr new and mr gough could not have been more sympathetic forms are signed and countersigned with unusual speed and matthew is even allowed to use the office phone to arrange for his girlfriend to pick him up a few minutes later governor berlyn appears and agrees with mr new that the boy i think of matthew as a boy because hes even younger than my son must be shipped out as quickly as possible then the problems start to arise matthew who only has four weeks left to serve doesnt know anyone in canterbury so hell have to be locked up overnight in the local jail despite his girlfriend and her mother staying at a hotel near the hospital but worse because matthew is only allowed twentyfour hours compassionate leave he will have to travel back from canterbury and spend the second night at nsc after which he will be released on friday morning for weekend leave when he need not return until sunday evening why not just let the boy go and be with his father and return on sunday night i ask both mr berlyn and mr new nod their agreement but tell me that there is no way round the home office regulations am matthews girlfriend arrives at the barrier and he is driven quickly away i pray that matthews father doesnt die while they are on the motorway i recall with sadness learning that my mother was dying during my trial mr justice potts wouldnt allow me to leave the court to be with her as he didnt accept the doctors opinion that she only had a few hours to live i eventually arrived at her bedside an hour or so before she died by which time she was past recognizing me am three prisoners who arrived yesterday check in for their induction talk they pepper me with questions i feel a bit of a fraud trying to answer them having only been around for fortyeight hours and still on induction myself mr gough gives them the talk i heard two days ago i hand out a booklet emphasizing his comments a young prisoner whispers in my ear that he cant read help i tell him to come back and see me if he has any further problems pm mr new appears and runs through my responsibilities we open a large cupboard crammed full of forms and files which he feels needs reorganizing he lights up another cigarette pm mr simpson the probation officer asks me to join him in his office on the first floor as he wants to bring my case file up to date he asks me if i saw a probation officer after being convicted yes but only for a few minutes i tell him while i was still at the old bailey good he says because that will show youre domiciled in london and make it easier for you to be moved to spring hill he checks his computer and gives me the name of my probation officer drop her a line he advises and tell her you want to be transferred pm mr new joins me in the kitchen for another cigarette break i learn that hes due to leave nsc in january when he will be transferred to norwich prison as a governor grade there are five grades of governor the top man or woman is known as the governing governor i still havent met one he then produces all the necessary forms for my transfer although hell speak to mrs mckenziehowe his opposite number at spring hill hes not optimistic not only are they full but its a resettlement prison and i dont need resettling im not looking for a job when im released or a home and as i have no financial problems i just dont fit any of the usual categories pm i go off to the canteen for supper and again sit at a table with two older prisoners they are both in for fraud one was a local councillor three and a half months and the other an ostrich farmer the latter promises to tell me all the details when he has more time its clear theres going to be no shortage of good stories belmarsh murder and gbh wayland drug barons and armed robbers nsc is looking a little more sophisticated pm i join doug in the hospital he has allowed me to store a bottle of blackcurrant juice and a couple of bottles of evian in his fridge so ill always have my own supply as doug chats away i learn a little more about his crime he hates drug dealers and considers his own incarceration a temporary inconvenience in fact he plans a cruise to australia just as soon as hes released on the out he runs a small transport company he has a yard and seven lorries and employs still employs twelve people he spends half an hour a day on the phone keeping abreast of whats going on back at base now to his crime his exportimport business was successful until a major client went bankrupt and renegued on a bill for placing him under extreme pressure with his bank he began to replenish his funds by illegally importing cigarettes from france he received a twoyear sentence for failing to pay customs and excise duty to the tune of day friday october am i write for two hours boxer shorts draped over the little light that beams down onto my desk ensure that i dont disturb david am i prepare identity cards for the three new prisoners who arrived yesterday as each officer comes in i make them tea or coffee in between i continue to organize the filing system for inductees i will still be one myself for another week when mr new arrives he leaves his copy of the times in the kitchen and retrieves it at six before going home i am slowly getting into a routine i now meet new prisoners as they appear and find out what their problems are before they see an officer often theyve come to the wrong office or simply dont have the right form many of them want to be interviewed for risk assessment others need to see the governor whose office is in the administration block on the other side of the prison but the real problem is mr new himself because many prisoners believe that if their request doesnt have his imprimatur it wont go any further this is partly because he takes an interest in every prisoner but mainly because he wont rush them he can often take twenty minutes to listen to their problems when all that is needed is for a form to be signed which results in four other prisoners having to sit in the waiting room until hes finished during any one day about thirty prisoners visit smu i have to be careful not to overstep the mark as inmates need to see me as fighting their corner while the officers have to feel im helping to cut down their workload i certainly need a greater mental stimulation than making cups of tea but however much i take on the pay remains p an hour a week noon i pick up my lunch vegetable pie and beans no pudding i take my tray back to the smu and read the times pm a prisoner marches in and demands to be released on compassionate grounds because his mother is ill mr downs a shrewd experienced officer tells him that hell send a probation officer round to see his mother so that they can decide if he should be released the prisoner slopes off without another word mr downs immediately calls the probation officer in leicester just in case the prisoner does have a sick mother bob lifer comes to see the psychiatrist christine bob is preparing for life outside once hes released possibly next year but before that can happen he has to complete ten town visits without incident once hes achieved this he will be allowed out at weekends unescorted the authorities will then assess if he is ready to be released bob has been in prison for twentythree years having originally been sentenced to fifteen but as christine points out however strongly she recommends his release in the end it is always home office decision christine joins me in the kitchen and tells me about a lifer who went out on his first town visit after twenty years he was given so he could get used to shopping in a supermarket when he arrived at the cash till and was asked how he would like to pay he ran out leaving the goods behind he just couldnt cope with having to make a decision we also have to prepare all lifers for survival cooking she adds you have to remember that some prisoners have had three cooked meals a day for twenty years and theyve become so institutionalized they cant even boil an egg the next lifer to see christine is mike after twentytwo years in prison hes fortynine mike is also coming to the end of his sentence he invites me to supper on sunday night chicken curry hes determined to prove that he can not only take care of himself but cook for others as well pm i walk over to the canteen and join ron the fraudster and dave the ostrich farmer for cauliflower cheese ron declares that the food at nsc is as good as most motorway cafés this is indeed a compliment to wendy pm mr hughes my wing officer informs me i can move across to room twelve in the nosmoking corridor when i locate the room i find its filthy and the only furniture is a single unmade bed a table and a chair i despair i am so pathetic at times like this in the opposite cell is a prisoner called alan who is cleaning out his room and asks if he can help i enquire what he would charge to transform my room so that it looks like his four phonecards he says three i counter he agrees i tell him i will return at eightfifteen for rollcall and see how hes getting on pm i check in for rollcall before going off to see my new quarters alan has taken on an assistant and they are slaving away while alan scrubs the cupboards the assistant is working on the walls i tell them ill return at ten and clear my debts the only trouble is that i dont have any phonecards and wont have before canteen on wednesday doug comes to my rescue and takes over darrens role of purveyor of essential goods doug appears anxious he tells me that his fourteenyearold daughter has suffered an epileptic fit hes being allowed to go home tomorrow and visit her we settle down to watch the evening film and are joined by the senior security officer mr hocking he warns me that a news of the world journalist is roaming around the grounds but with a bit of luck will fall into the wash just before he leaves he asks doug if hes on home leave tomorrow yes im off to see my daughter back by seven doug confirms then well need someone to be on duty after sister leaves at one we mustnt forget how many drugs there are in this building would you be willing to stand in as temporary hospital orderly jeffrey he asks yes of course i reply pm i return to the north block for rollcall before checking my room i dont recognize it its spotless i thank alan who takes a seat on the corner of the bed he tells me that he has a twelvemonth sentence for receiving stolen goods he owns two furniture shops in leicester whose turnover last year was a little over showing him a profit of around he has a wife and two children and between them theyre keeping the business ticking over until he has completed his sentence in four weeks time its his first offence and he certainly falls into that category of never again pm i spend my first night at nsc in my own room no music no smoke no hassle day saturday october am weekends are deadly in a prison jules my padmate at wayland used to say the only time youre not in prison is when youre asleep so over the weekend a lot of prisoners just remain in bed im lucky because i have my writing to occupy me am i spot matthew who must have returned from canterbury last night his father is still in a coma and he accompanies me to the office so he can phone the hospital although my official working week is monday to friday its not unusual for an officer to be on duty at smu on a saturday morning mr downs and mr gough are already at their desks and after ive made them both a cup of tea matthew takes me through my official duties for any given day or week if i were to stick to simply what was required it would take me no more than a couple of hours each day over a cup of tea bovril for me matthew tells me about his nightmare year matthew is twentyfour six foot one slim darkhaired and handsome without being aware of it hes highly intelligent but also rather gauche and totally out of place in prison he read marine anthropology at manchester university and will complete his phd once hes released i ask him if hes a digger or an academic an academic he replies without hesitation his first job after leaving university was as a volunteer at a museum in his home town he was happy there but soon decided he wanted to return to university that was when his mother contracted ms and everything began to go badly wrong after his mother was bedridden he and his sister took it in turns to help around the house so that his father could continue to work all three found the extra workload a tremendous strain one evening while at work in the museum matthew took home some ancient coins to study i havent used the word stole because he returned all the coins a few days later but the incident weighed so heavily on his conscience that he informed his supervisor matthew thought that would be the end of the matter but someone decided to report the incident to the police matthew was arrested and charged with breach of trust he pleaded guilty and was assured by the police that they would not be pushing for a custodial sentence his solicitor was also of the same opinion advising matthew that he would probably get a suspended sentence or a community service order the judge gave him fifteen months matthew will end up serving five and a half months matthew is a classic example of someone who should not have been sent to jail a hundred hours of community service might serve some purpose but this boy has spent the last three months with murderers drug addicts and burglars he wont turn to a life of crime but how many less intelligent people might its a rotten system that allows such a person to end up in prison my former secretary angie peppiatt stole thousands of pounds from me and still hasnt been arrested i feel for matthew noon lunch today is just as bad as belmarsh or wayland matthew explains that wendy is off i must remember to eat only when wendy is on duty pm i report to the hospital and take over dougs caretaker role while he visits his daughter i settle down with a glass of blackcurrant juice and evian to watch england slaughter ireland and win the grand slam the triple crown and after all we are far superior on paper unfortunately rugby is not played on paper but on pitches ireland hammer us and return to the emerald isles with smiles on their faces im still sulking when a tall handsome black man strolls in his name is clive i only hope hes not ill because if he is im the last person he needs he tells me that hes serving the last third of his sentence and has just returned from a weeks home leave part of his rehabilitation programme clive and i are the only two prisoners who have the privilege of visiting doug in the evenings i quickly discover why doug enjoys clives company hes bright incisive and entertaining and if it were not politically incorrect i would describe him as sharp as a cartload of monkeys let me give you just one example of how he works the system during the week clive works as a line manager for a fruitpacking company in boston he leaves the prison after breakfast at eight and doesnt return until seven in the evening for this he is paid a week so during the week nsc is no more than a bed and breakfast and the only day he has to spend in prison is sunday but clive has a solution for that as well two sundays in every month he takes up his allocated town visits while on the third sunday hes allowed an overnight stay but what about the fourth or fifth sunday i ask religious exemption he explains but why when theres a chapel in the grounds i demand your chapel is in your grounds says clive because youre c of e not me he adds im a jehovahs witness i must visit my place of worship at least one sunday in every month and the nearest one just happens to be in leicester after a coffee clive invites me over to his room on the south block to play backgammon his room turns out not to be five paces by three or even seven by three its a little over ten paces by ten in fact its larger than my bedroom in london or grantchester how did you manage this i ask as we settle down on opposite sides of the board well it used to be a storeroom he explains until i rehabilitated it but it could easily house four prisoners true says clive but remember im also the race relations representative so theyll only allow black prisoners to share a room with me there arent that many black prisoners in dcats he adds with a smile i hadnt noticed the sudden drop in the black population after leaving wayland until clive mentioned it but i have seen a few at nsc so i ask why they arent allowed to room with him they all start life on the north block and thats where they stay he adds without explanation he also beat me at backgammon leaving me three mars bars light day sunday october am sunday is a day of rest and if theres one thing you dont need in prison its a day of rest am smu is open as mr downs is transferring files from his office to the administration block before taking up new responsibilities fifteen new prisoners arrived on friday giving me an excuse to prepare files and make up their identity cards north sea camp whose capacity is rarely has more than inmates at any one time as inmates have the right to be within fifty miles of their families being stuck out on the east coast limits the catchment area two of the spurs are being refurbished at the moment which shows the lack of pressure on accommodation this is only true in dcats open prisons the turnover at nsc is about fifteen prisoners a week what i am about to reveal is common to all dcat prisons and by no means exclusive to nsc on average one prisoner absconds every week unlawfully at large the figures have a tendency to rise around christmas and drop a little during the summer so nsc loses around fifty prisoners a year this explains the need for five rollcalls a day many absconders return within twentyfour hours having thought better of it they have twentyeight days added to their sentence a few often foreigners return to their countries and are never seen again quite recently two dutchmen absconded and were picked up by a speedboat as the beach is only yards out of bounds they were back in holland before the next rollcall most absconders are quickly recaptured many only getting as far as boston a mere six miles away they are then transferred to a ccat with its high walls and razor wire and will never under any circumstances be allowed to return to an open prison even if at some time in the future they are convicted of a minor offence a few very few get clean away but they must then spend every day looking over their shoulder there are even some cases of wives or girlfriends sending husbands or partners back to prison and in one case a motherinlaw returning an errant prisoner to the front gate declaring that she didnt want to see him again until he completed his sentence this is all relevant because of something that took place today when granted weekend leave you must report back by seven oclock on sunday evening and if you are even a minute late you are placed on report yesterday a wife was driving her husband back to the prison when they became involved in a heated row the wife stopped the car and dumped her husband on the roadside some thirty miles from the jail he ran to the nearest phone box to let the prison know what had happened and a taxi was sent out to pick him up he checked in over an hour late thirty pounds was deducted from his canteen account to pay for the taxi and hes been placed on report pm i go for a twomile walk with clive who is spending a rare sunday in prison we discuss the morning papers they have me variously working on the farmin the hospitalcleaning the latrineseating alonelording it over everyone however nothing beats the mail on sunday which produces a blurred photo of me proving that i have refused to wear prison clothes this despite the fact that im wearing prison jeans and a grey prison sweatshirt in the photo after our walk clive and i play a few games of backgammon hes in a different class to me so i decide to take advantage of his superiority and turn each session into a tutorial pm i write for two hours and then sign in for rollcall with mr hughes pm doug clive and i watch a magnificent period drama set in guildford and cornwall in mike lifer appears twenty minutes into the film with a chicken curry in plastic containers part of his cookery rehabilitation course doug serves it up on china platesa real luxury in itself even though we have to eat the meal with plastic knives and forks i eat the meal very slowly and enjoy every morsel day monday october am ive been at nsc for a week and am beginning to feel that i know my way around i report to work at smu matthew shows me how to make out an order form for any supplies that are needed for the office which will then be sent to the stores who should see that we have it the same day we discover an outstanding order from october for files and paper marked urgent and another for october marked very urgent inefficiency is endemic in parts of the prison service millions of pounds of taxpayers money is wasted every year the departments responsible for this differ from prison to prison but to give you a small example some years ago there was a prisoner at hmp gartree who was a vicious killer and needed to be transferred from one cell to another a distance of less than a hundred yards fifteen officers arrived to move him an operation that took five minutes all fifteen officers claimed four hours overtime how do i know this a senior officer who previously worked at gartree told me noon matthew and i have lunch in the canteen with the other orderlies and are joined by roger lifer murdered his wife who berated me about england losing to ireland on saturday but you sound welsh i venture i am he replies but i dont care who beats the english its one of the few pleasures i get in here pm mr new arrives in the office having spent the morning in court on a domestic matter one has a tendency to forget that prison officers have problems of their own matthew and i discuss how to improve office efficiency id like to clear out every drawer and cupboard and start again he agrees were about to begin when the door opens and the governing governor walks in mr lewis greets me with a warm jovial smile he asks matthew to leave us and wastes no time with small talk the press he tells me are still camped at both ends of the prison and he adds that a prisoner has been caught with an expensive camera and long lens in his room mr lewis has no idea which paper smuggled it in or how much money was involved the inmate concerned is already on his way to a ccat and will not be allowed to return to an open prison apparently several prisoners have complained about the press invading their privacy and the governor has given his assurance that if a photograph of them appears in a national newspaper they have legal recourse a rule that doesnt seem to apply to me we then discuss my move to spring hill before the governor calls matthew back in mr lewis grants him a further two days compassionate leave which will allow matthew to spend five days with his father mr lewis appears to have combined compassion and common sense while remaining inside the home office guidelines pm mr new arrives back in the office anxious to know what the governor wanted to see me about i dont mention the camera as mr lewis specifically asked me not to i tell him that mr lewis intends to speak to the governor of spring hill but hes leaving all the paperwork to him its been dealt with mr new replies ive already sent all the documents to my opposite number pm i ask matthew on a visit to his room in the south block if he could redo the officers list of needs presently listed on the back of the kitchen cabinet so that its as smart as the one doug displays in the hospital i glance up at matthews bookshelf pliny the younger and augustus caesar he asks me if ive read herodotes no i confess im still circa currently reading about john adams and the first congress ill need a little longer sentence if im ever to get back to bc pm i return to my room i hate the north block its noisy dirty and smelly were opposite the pig farm i lock myself in and write for a couple of hours pm i stroll across to doug tax avoidance in the hospital he allows me the use of his bathroom once ive had a bath and put on clean clothes i feel almost human clive fraud joins us after his day job in the fruit factory he tells me that his fellow workers believe what they read about me in the sun and the mirror i despair pm i leave the hospital and return for rollcall before going back to my room to write for a couple hours the tannoy keeps demanding that jackson should report for rollcall hes probably halfway to boston by now pm final rollcall mr hughes waves from the other end of the corridor to show my name has been ticked off hes already worked out that i will be the last person to abscond i certainly wouldnt get halfway to boston before being spotted day tuesday october am all the lifers at nsc are coming to the end of their sentence and are being prepared to reenter the outside world the very fact that they have progressed from an acat through b c to d over a period of twenty years is proof that they want a second chance one of the fascinating things about murderers and we have a dozen or more at nsc is that you cannot generalize about them however i have found that they roughly fall into two categories those who are first offenders and unlikely to commit another crime especially after twenty years in jail and those who are evil and should be locked away in an acat for the rest of their lives almost all the lifers at nsc fall into the former category otherwise they would never have made it to an open prison bob chris mike and roger are all now middle aged and harmless this might seem strange to those reading this diary but i feel none of the fear when im with them that i do with some of the young tearaways who only have a few weeks left to serve am matthew starts cleaning out the cupboard and drawers while i concentrate on the new inductees there are fifteen of them and its lunchtime before the last one has all his questions answered noon lunch is memorable only because wendy says my menu sheet is missing she suspects its been stolen and will appear in one of the tabloids tomorrow she supplies me with a new one but asks me not to put my name on the top or sign it just hand the sheet over to her pm while clearing out the drawers matthew comes across a box of biros marked and a ledger with the initials gr and a crown above it two hours later every shelf has been washed and scrubbed all the documents we need for inductees are in neat piles and we have three bin bags full of outofdate material pm i join doug and matthew for supper vegetarian sausage and mash pm back in my room i write for two hours tomorrow i musti repeat must go to the gym day wednesday october am today is labour board all inductees having completed their other interviews must now be allocated a job otherwise they will receive no income the board consists of two members from management the farm and other activities and a senior officer before any inductee faces the board i brief them on what to expect as i went through the process only a week ago i tell them it helps if they know what they want to do and one of them a bright young asian called ahmed tells me hes after my job another mr clarke informs me that hes sixtyseven and wants a parttime cleaning job perhaps a couple of hours a day i immediately go upstairs and ask the board if he could be allocated to this office which would allow me to concentrate on the weekly inductions and the several prisoners who pop in during the day to talk about their problems they tell me theyll think about it pm i return to the smu after lunch to find a drugs officer in the kitchen his black labrador jed is sniffing around i melt into the background and listen to a conversation hes having with mr new it seems theres going to be another clampdown on drugs the drugs officer tells mr new that last year thirtysix visitors were found with drugs on them two of them solicitors and one a barrister i am so surprised by this that i later ask mr new if he believes it he nods ironically the headline in todays times is cannabis to be legalized i leave the office at pm as i have a visit myself today pm alison my pa david my driver and chris beetles are sitting at a little square table in the visitors room waiting for me after weve picked up diet cokes and chocolate mostly for me we seem to chat about everything except prison from joseph my butler who is in hospital seriously injured after being knocked down by a bus on his way to work and the folly at the bottom of the garden in grantchester being flooded to how the public are responding to the events of september alison and i then go through my personal letters and the list of people who have asked to visit me at nsc these weekly visits are a wonderful tonic but they also serve to remind me just how much i miss my friends holed up in this godforsaken place pm i return to the office to find mr new and a security officer mr hayes waiting to see me the photographers just wont go away one has even offered mr hayes for the charity of his choice if i will agree to pose for a picture i refuse aware how much more will go into the journalists pocket its against the law to take a photograph of a serving prisoner not that that seems to bother any of the vultures currently hovering around both officers promise to do their best to keep them at bay mr new then tells me that a second camera has been found in an inmates room and the prisoner involved was transferred back to a closed prison this morning i try to concentrate on my work pm i visit the canteen to discover i have in my account of my own money and added as my weekly wage my gillette blades alone cost and two phonecards so theres not a lot over for extras like toothpaste soap bottles of evian water and perhaps even a bar of chocolate i mention this only in passing lest any of you should imagine that i am as the tabloids suggest living the life of riley pm i stroll across to the hospital and enjoy the fresh country air even if the surroundings are rather bleak doug tells me that my application to spring hill is being processed how does doug know before mr new it turns out that he has a friend inmate who works in the administration block at spring hill i have a long warm bath heaven day thursday october am mr simpson probation and mr gough induction officer are the first to arrive in the office they supply me with todays list of appointments this has two advantages i can process those inmates who have booked in while dealing with the ones that just drop by on the off chance mr clarke crime not yet identified our sixtysevenyearold cleaner also turns up on time matthew runs through his duties with him while i make tea for the officers am mr hocking security officer appears in the kitchen to let me know that a daily mail photographer whose hair is longer than that of any of the inmates has entrenched himself on a local farmers land hell be able to take a picture whenever i return to the north block mr hocking is going to seek the farmers permission to eject him am mr clarke has done a superb job not only is the office spotless but tomorrow he plans to get a grip on the waiting room which presently resembles a gwr tea room noon i have lunch with malcolm fraud and librarian orderly hes quiet well spoken and intelligent and even in prison garb has the air of a professional man what could he have done to end up here pm mr new appears then disappears upstairs to join mr simpson the probation officer this afternoon theyll conduct interviews with three prisoners to discuss their sentence plans that usually means that the inmate concerned only has a few months left to serve so judgments have to be made on whether he is ready to take up work outside the prison and if he is suitable for tagging the main factors in any decision are a is the prisoner likely to reoffend based on his past record b has he any record of violence c is he or has he been on drugs d has he completed all his town visits and his weeks leave without incident ticks in all those boxes means he can hope for early release ie a twoyear sentence becomes one year with an extra two months off for tagging all three of todays applicants leave smu with smiles on their faces pm mr hocking returns accompanied by a police officer he tells me another camera has been found in an inmates room once again the prisoner concerned has been shipped off to a ccat prison the third in less than a week no doubt whichever newspaper was responsible will try again a few weeks of this and ill be the only prisoner still in residence pm mr lewis the governing governor calls in to discuss the problem of lurking photographers he asks me if i wish to return to wayland you must be joking are my exact words mr new later explains that he only asked to protect the prison service so that when a picture eventually appears in the press i wont be able to suggest that i wasnt given the opportunity to return to closed conditions pm supper with malcolm fraud roger murdered his wife martin possession of a firearm which went off and matthew breach of trust all the talk is about an absconder who missed his girlfriend so much that he decided to leave us he only had another nine weeks to go before his release date day friday october a century of days in prison am breakfast as its friday were offered weekend provisions a plastic bag containing half a dozen tea bags four sachets of sugar some salt and pepper and a couple of pats of butter those of you who have read the previous two volumes of these diaries will recall my days in belmarsh when i was on a chain gang along with five other prisoners putting tea bags into a plastic bag well theyve finally turned up at north sea camp prisoners do make useful contributions that can then be taken advantage of in other prisons thus saving the taxpayer money and giving inmates an occupation as well as a small weekly wage for example the tea towels in the kitchen were made in dartmoor the green bath towels in liverpool the brown sheets and pillowcases at holloway and my blankets at durham now dont forget the tea bags because doug has just told me over his eggs and bacon that a lifer has been shipped out to lincoln prison for being caught in possession of drugs and where were they discovered in his tea bags security staff raided his room this morning and found sixty tea bags containing cannabis along with in cash which they consider proof that he was a dealer but now for the ridiculous sad stupid lunatic choose your own word aspect of this story the prisoner in question was due for parole in eleven weeks time he will now spend the next eighteen months in a bcat before going on to a ccat probably for a couple of years before being allowed to return to a dcat in around four years time doug adds that the security staff didnt know what he was up to until another prisoner grassed on him why would anyone do that i ask probably to save their own skin doug replies perhaps he was about to be shipped out for a lesser offence so he offered them a bigger fish in exchange for a reprieve it happens all the time am when i arrive at smu mr clarke is already standing by the door he immediately sets about emptying the bins and mopping the kitchen floor while were working i discover that its his first offence and hes serving a fifteenmonth sentence for misappropriation of funds and is due to be released in march am in the morning post there is a registered letter from my solicitors i read the pages with trembling hands my leave to appeal against conviction has been turned down only my leave to appeal against length of sentence has been granted i cant describe how depressed i feel noon lunch doug nods in the direction of another prisoner who takes a seat at the next table thats roy he says hes a burglar serving his fifteenth sentence when the judge sentenced him this time to six months he said thank you my lord ill do that standing on my head then ill add a couple of months to help you get back on your feet replied the judge pm i call my barrister nick purnell qc he feels we should still go for an appeal on conviction because three elements of our defence have been overlooked how can ted francis be innocent if i am guilty how can mrs peppiatts evidence be relied upon when she confessed in the witness box to being a thief how can i have perverted the course of justice when the barrister representing the other side mr shaw said he had never considered the first diary date to be of any significance we also discuss the witness who could help me prove that potts should never have taken the case nick warns me that godfrey barker is getting cold feet and his wife claims she cannot remember the details pm i see david murder in the corridor he has a big grin on his face hell be spending tomorrow with his wife for the first time in two decades hes very nervous about going out on his own and tells me the sad story of a prisoner who went on a town visit for the first time in twentyfive years and was so frightened that he climbed up a tree the fire service had to be called out to rescue him the police drove him back to prison and hes never been out since pm my evenings are now falling into a set pattern i join doug at sixthirty and have a bath before watching the seven oclock news on channel pm i report for rollcall and then return to play a few games of backgammon with clive pm final rollcall day saturday october am there are some prisoners who prefer to remain in jail rather than be released those who have become institutionalized and have no family no friends no money and no chance of a job and then there is rico rico arrived at nsc from lincoln prison this morning its his fourth burglary offence and hes always welcomed back because he enjoys working on the farm rico particularly likes the pigs and by the time he left he knew them all by name he even used to sleep with them at night well up until final rollcall he has a single room because no one is willing to share with him thats one way of getting a single room am i check in at smu but as there are no officers around i write for two hours am i try to phone mary at grantchester but because the flash flood has taken the phones out all i get is a long burr noon on the way to lunch i pass peter lifer arson who is sweeping leaves from the road peter is a sixfootfour eighteenstone hungarian who has served over thirty years for setting fire to a police station although no one was killed i have lunch with malcolm fraud who tells me that his wife has just been released from holloway having completed a ninemonth sentence for money laundering the he made was placed in her account without her knowledge malcolms words but she was also convicted malcolm asked to have her sentence added to his but the judge declined wives or partners are a crucial factor in a prisoners survival its not too bad if the sentence is short but even then the partner often suffers as much if not more being alone on the outside in marys case she is now living her life in a glare of publicity she never sought pm theres a timid knock on the door i open it to find a prisoner who wants to talk about writing a book this occurs at least once a week his name is saman and hes a muslim kurd he is currently working on a book entitled the history of kurdistan and wonders if ill read a few chapters saman read engineering at a university in kurdistan when he has completed his sentence saman wants to settle down in this country but fears he may be deported why are you at nsc i ask him saman tells me that he was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving for which he was sentenced to three years hes due to be released in december day sunday october am todays is my mothers birthday she would have been eightynine am after breakfast i read the sunday times in the library rules concerning newspapers differ from prison to prison often without rhyme or reason at wayland the papers were delivered to your cell but you cant have your own newspaper at nsc while im reading a long article on anthrax another prisoner looks over his copy of the news of the world and says im glad to find out youre earning fifty quid a week jeff we both laugh he knows only too well that orderlies are paid a week and only those prisoners who go out to work can earn more funnily enough this sort of blatant invention or inaccuracy has made my fellow inmates more sympathetic am phone mary in grantchester and at last get a ringing tone shes just got back from munich which she tells me went well not all the germans are aware that her husband is a convict her book clean electricity from photovoltaics was received by the conference with acclaim after struggling for some years to complete volume one she ended up selling copies mind you it is a copy and by scientific standards that is a bestseller i use up an entire phonecard twenty units getting myself up to date with all her news am a message over the tannoy informs inmates that they can report to the drug centre for voluntarily testing a negative result can help with parole or tagging applications by the time i arrive theres already a long queue i stand behind alan fraud who is being transferred to spring hill tomorrow he says hell write and let me know how the place compares to nsc and try and find out how my application is progressing i reach the head of the queue mr vessey he of the hatchet face who never smiles points to a lavatory so i can give him a sample of urine in a little plastic bottle he then places a filter into the bottle that will show by five separate black lines if i am positive or negative for everything from cannabis to heroin if two little black lines come up opposite each drug then youre clear if only one line appears youve tested positive and will be up in front of the governor first thing in the morning an inmate three ahead of me tests positive for cannabis and explodes when mr vessey says hell be on report tomorrow he storms out mouthing expletives mr vessey smiles my own test comes up with only double lines which is greeted with mock applause by those still waiting in the queue and pour your piss down the drain archer says mr vessey if you leave it hanging around this lot would happily sell it to the news of the world noon lunch im joined by brian chapel orderly and organist he was convicted of conspiracy to defraud an ostrich farming company of seven million pounds his barrister convinced him that if he pleaded not guilty a trial could take ten months and if he were then found guilty he might end up with a six or sevenyear sentence he advised brian to plead guilty to a lesser charge so that he would be sentenced to less than four years he took the advice and was sentenced to three years ten months his two codefendants decided on a trial and the jury found them not guilty brian considers that pleading guilty was the biggest mistake of his life pm write for two hours pm i go to chapel to be joined by five other prisoners brian the ostrich man is playing the organ very professionally i take holy communion in memory of my mother and cant help reflecting that its my first sip of wine in three months the vicar offers each of us a tiny plastic thimble of wine its only later that i work out why some prisoners would attend the service just to drain the chalice the vicar the rev johnson is over seventy a short dapper man he gives us a short dapper sermon on why he is not quite sure about bornagain christians we then pray for those christians who were murdered while taking part in a church service in pakistan covering the wall behind the altar and part of the ceiling is a painting of the last supper after the service the vicar tells me that a former prisoner painted it and each of the disciples was modelled on an inmate he chuckles only christ isnt a convict day monday october am i wake early and think about home i have a little pottery model of the old vicarage on the table in front of me along with a photograph of mary and the boys and another of a view of parliament from our apartment in london quite a contrast to the view from my little room on the north block the sky is grey and threatening rain thats the one thing i share with you am breakfast with malcolm fraud chief librarian and roger murder twelve years so far malcolm is able to tell me more about the young man called arnold who absconded last week i recall him from his induction at smu a shy and nervous little creature he was sharing a room with two of the most unpleasant men ive ever come across one of them has been moved from prison to prison during the past seven months because of the disruption he causes wherever he goes and the other is a heroin addict serving out the last months of his sentence i have never given a moments thought to absconding however if i had to spend a single night with either of those men i might have to reconsider my position am today i set myself the task of reorganizing the muddled and misleading notice board in the waiting room matthew and i spend the first thirty minutes taking down all thirtyseven notices before deciding which are out of date redundant or simply on the wrong notice board only sixteen survive we then pin up five new neatly printed headings drugs education leave tagging and general information before replacing the sixteen posters neatly in their correct columns by lunchtime the waiting room is clean thanks to mr clarke and the notice board easy to understand thanks to matthew although i think ive also earned my p an hour noon i have to repeat that as far as prison food goes nsc is outstanding wendy and val her assistant set standards that i would not have thought possible in any institution that has only per prisoner for three meals a day today im down for the pizza but wendy makes me try a spoonful of her lamb stew because she doesnt approve of my being a vip vegetarian in prison its excellent and perhaps next week ill risk a couple of meat dishes pm the turnover at nsc is continual last week fifteen inmates departed one way or another end of sentence twelve moved to another prison two absconded one so after only two weeks per cent of the prison population has changed give me another month and ill be an old lag while im washing the teacups matthew tells me that his father has taken a turn for the worse and the governor has pushed his compassionate leave forward by a day hell be off to canterbury first thing in the morning so he can be at his fathers bedside for the next ten days he doesnt complain about having to spend the ten nights in canterbury prison bcat which cant be pleasant when your father is dying and you dont have anyone to share your grief with pm another pile of letters awaits me when i return from work among them missives from chris de burgh patrick moore and alan coren alans letter makes me laugh so much rather than share snippets with you ive decided to print it in full see overleaf all my life i have been graced with remarkable friends who have tolerated my ups and downs and this latest episode doesnt seem to have deterred them one iota pm tomorrow im going to the gym i only write this to make sure i do pm write for two hours alan coren october my dear jeffrey lots of forgivenesses to be begged first off forgive the typing but not only is my longhand illegible i should also be writing for some days because i havent picked up a pen for anything but cheques since about more important try to forgive the fact that i havent written before but the truth is that i should so much have preferred to chat to you face to face albeit chained to a radiator or whatever the social protocols required than to engage in the onesided conversation of letters so as you probably knowi kept trying to get a visit and kept being turned down most important of all forgive me for not trying to spring you i have spent a small fortune on grapnels ropes boltcutters fake numberplates oneway tickets to sao paolo and drinks for large men from the mile end road with busted conks and tattooed knuckles but whenever i managed to put all these elements together there was always a clear night and a full moon anyway i gather from your office that it might now be possible to arrange a visit once i and they have filled in all sorts of bumf and you have been given enough notice to stick a jeroboam of krug on ice and slip into a brocade dressinggown and fez so i shall set that in train forthwithif of couurse you agree you are by the way bloody lucky not to be in that office now these are bad days to be living at the top of a tall building next to mi and opposite the h of c and i speak as one who knows having as youll spot from the letterhead recently moved to a house in regents park where from my topfloor study window as i type i can see the regents park mosque metres to my right and the american ambassadors residence metres to my left i am ground bloody zero right here every time his excellencys helicopter trrobs in we rush down to the cellar could by anybody or anything since even i dont know where freiston is i rather doubt that osama bin laden could find it and you are further fortunate in the fact that because every envelope to the clink is doubtless slit open poked about in and generally vetted to the last square millimetre if anybodys going to get anthrax it wont be you life goes on in london as normal anne and i have grown used to wearing our gasmasks in bed though its still a bit of a bugger waking up in the night and unthinkingly reaching for a bedside drink so theres more nocturnal tumbledrying going on than there used to be giles and victoria wish to be remembered to you and want you to know that theyre fine and settling down well with their foster parents in timbuktu where they tell me they have made lots of new friends among the other evacuees although hp sauce is proving dificult to find your beloved conservative party has elected a new leader who may be seen every day at the doors of the commons handing out his business cards to mps and officials who would otherwise think we was someone who had turned up to flog them personal pension schemes are you writing a book about chokey ff would make a terrific title and since i am only one of countless hacks who envy you the opportunity to scribble away unencumbered by all the distractions that stop the rest of us from knocking out finnegans remembrance of war punishment i would if i were you seriously consider not going ahead with your appeal giving up the chance of another couple of years at the typewriter could cost you millions all right if we must lets be serious for a moment do you need anything is there anything i can do anyone i can see for you all that i know that you have truckloads of closer and far more influential friends than i but because its always on the cards that there may just be something you need that noone else can come up with i want you to know that i should do my very best to sort it out but if nothing else do drop me the briefest of notes to let me know whether or not youd like a visit if youd rather be left in peace i should of course understand but it would be nice to meet for the odd laugh as if there could be any other kind of laugh these days pm i sign in for rollcall from tomorrow as i will have completed my two weeks induction i need only sign in at am pm and pm because ill be at work in future pm will be the one time i have to appear in person doug says i will feel the difference immediately day tuesday october am write for two hours ive now completed words since being incarcerated perhaps alan coren is right am ten new prisoners arrived yesterday they will be seeing the doctor straight after breakfast before coming to smu to be given their induction pack and then be interviewed by the labour board one by one they make an appearance some are cocky know it all seen it all nothing to learn while others are nervous and anxious and full of desperate questions and then theres michael keane lifer fourteen years so far aged thirtynine those of you whove been paying attention for the past words will recall my twenty days at belmarsh where i met william keane on the teabag chain gang his brother michael has the same irish charm wit and love of literature but never forget that all seven keane brothers have been in jail at the same time costing the taxpayer a million pounds a year michael passes on williams best wishes and adds that he heard today that his sister has just been released from holloway after serving nine months for a string of creditcard crimes michael is hoping for parole in march and if irish charm were enough hed make it but unfortunately the decision has to be ratified by the home office who will only read his files and never see him face to face his fame among the keanes is legendary because when he was at belmarsh a highsecurity prison he got as far as the first outer gate while emptying dustbins the furthest anyone has manage while trying to escape from hell am a scruffy unshaven prisoner called potts checks into smu to confirm that he has a meeting with his solicitor this afternoon i check my day sheet to see that his lawyer is booked in for three oclock potts who has just come off a threehour shift in the kitchen smiles see you at three jeff am all ten inductees have been seen by the labour board and are fixed up with jobs on the farm in the kitchen or at the officers mess one kevin six years for avoiding paying vat has opted for fulltime education as hes in his final year of a law degree noon over lunch doug asks me if ive put in my takeaway order for the weekend i realize im being set up but happily play along he then tells me the story of two previous inmates bruce and roy who were partners in crime bruce quickly discovered that it was not only easy to abscond from nsc but equally straightforward to return unobserved so one night he walked the six miles to boston purchased some fish and chips stole a bicycle rode back hid the bike on the farm and went to bed thus began a thriving enterprise known as weekend orders his roommate roy would spend the week taking orders from the other prisoners for supper on saturday night the last meal every day is at five oclock so you can be a bit peckish by nine armed with the orders bruce would then cycle into boston immediately after the eightfifteen rollcall visit the local fish and chip shop mcdonalds or kfc not to mention the pub and arrive back within the hour so he could drop off his orders and still be seen roaming round the corridors long before the pm rollcall this dotcon service ran successfully for several months in the best traditions of free enterprise unfortunately theres always some dissatisfied customer who will grass and one night two officers caught bruce about a mile away from the prison laden with food and drink he was transferred to a ccat the following morning his roommate roy aware it would only be a matter of days before he was implicated absconded with all the cash and hasnt been seen since pm potts returns to smu for the meeting with his solicitor he has shaved washed his hair and is wearing a clean wellironed shirt and his shoes are shining i have the unenviable task of telling him that his solicitor rang a few moments ago to cancel the appointment this is a message to all solicitors and barristers who deal with the incarcerated your visit can be the most important event of the week if not the month so dont cancel lightly potts walks dejectedly back down the path head bowed pm mr hocking drops into smu he tells me that the whole of spur four on the north block nine rooms has just been searched because an officer thought he heard a mobile phone ringing possession of a mobile phone is an offence that will ensure you are sent back to a ccat the same day pm write for two hours feel exhausted but at least i no longer have to report for the pm rollcall pm i join doug and clive at the hospital clive tells me that the officers found nothing during this mornings search often hearing a mobile phone is just an excuse to carry one out when they are actually trying to find something else doug chips in truth is they were looking for another camera which the press have recently smuggled in they even know the name of the prisoner involved and as hes due to be released on friday they want to be sure he doesnt leave with a role of photos that would embarrass them pm potts is rushed to boston hospital having taken an overdose day wednesday october am i wake thinking about potts he reminds me how awful being incarcerated is and why inmates forever live in hope i later discover that potts will be moved to sudbury prison so that he can be near his wife and family i know how he feels im still waiting to hear from spring hill am this morning we have a riskassessment board four prisoners who are applying for early release on tag hcd are to appear before the deputy governor mr leighton and the senior probation officer mr simpson if a candidate has an unblemished record while in jail never been put on a charge never been involved with drugs he is in with a chance but the prime consideration is whether the prisoner is likely to reoffend so if the inmate is in for burglary or creditcard fraud his chances arent that good during the next hour i take each of the four prisoners up to face the board they leave twenty minutes later two with smiles on their faces who want to shake me by the hand and two who barge past me effing and blinding anyone who crosses their path am mr new has received a fax from spring hill requesting three more documents and five more questions answered a clearance release from the hospital to confirm im fit and well and not on any medication my records from belmarsh and wayland to show i have never been put on report and confirmation from nsc that i have not been put on a charge since ive been here they also want to know if i intend to appeal against my sentence and if so will i be appearing in court mr new looks surprised when i say that i wont there are two reasons for my decision i never wish to spend another minute of my life in belmarsh which is where they transfer you if you are due to appear at the high court and im damned if ill put my wife through the ordeal of facing the press outside the court as she arrives and departs am at the hospital sister checks over the forms from spring hill linda ticks all the little boxes and confirms i am remarkably fit for my age cheeky lady noon over lunch doug warns me that it still might be a couple of months before spring hill have a vacancy because its the most popular prison in britain and in any case they may not enjoy the attendant publicity that i would attract bell a gym orderly leans across and informs me its the best nick ive ever been to i only moved here to be closer to my wife pm mr new reappears clutching my blameless record from belmarsh and wayland at he faxes spring hill with the eight pages they requested he receives confirmation that they arrived at pm ill keep you informed pm the senior listener brian conspiracy to defraud an ostrich company turns up at smu he asks if the backs of prisoners identity cards can be redesigned as they currently advertise the samaritans and crimestoppers brian points out that as no prisoner can dial an number the space would be better used informing new arrivals about the listeners scheme he has a point pm write for two hours pm doug tells me that the governing governor mr lewis dropped into the hospital today as hed read in the news of the world that i keep a secret store of chocolate biscuits in the fridge quite right doug informed him jeffrey buys them from the canteen every thursday and leaves a packet here for both of us which we have with my coffee and his bovril a week ago i told linda that you could buy a jar of marmite from the canteen but not bovril which i much prefer the following day a jar of bovril appeared prisoners break rules all the time often without realizing it officers have to turn a blind eye otherwise everyone would be on a charge every day of the week and the prison service would grind to a halt of course theres a difference between bovril and beer between having an extra towel and a mobile phone or a hardback book and a tea bag full of heroin most officers accept this and use their common sense pm two officers mr spencer and mr hayes join us in the hospital for a coffee break we learn that eleven new prisoners came in this evening and only seven will be released tomorrow so the prison is nearly full they also add that another prisoner has been placed in the segregation cell overnight and will be up in front of the governor tomorrow hes likely to be on his way back to lincoln prison it appears that a camera was found in his room the third one in the past ten days they also know which newspaper is involved day thursday november am in prison you dont think about what can be achieved long term all thoughts are short term when is the next canteen so i can buy another phonecard can i change my job will i be enhanced can i move into a single room at the moment the only thought on my mind is can i get to spring hill not when can in prison when will only happens after can has been achieved am fifteen new prisoners in today among them a major willis who is sixtyfour i look forward to finding out what hes been up to willis clarke the cleaner and myself do not have to work because were all over sixty but willis makes it clear hes looking for a job and the labour board allocate him to works engineering am mr hocking the security officer drops in for a cup of tea he tells me that braithwaite who was found to have a camera in his room is now on his way back to lincoln the newspaper involved was the mail on sunday all the relevant papers have been sent to the local police as an offence of aiding and abetting a prisoner may have been committed pm i call alison mary has been invited to margaret and denis thatchers golden wedding anniversary on december james will be making the long journey to visit me on saturday pm doug tells me that his contact in the administration office at spring hill isnt sure if theyll have me ill bet that doug finds out my fate long before any of the officers at nsc pm a fight breaks out on spur six it involves a tragic young man who has been a heroin addict since the age of fourteen he is due to be released tomorrow morning leaving ceremonies are common enough in prison and an inmates popularity can be gauged by his fellow prisoners farewells on the night before he departs this particular prisoner had a bucket of shit poured over his head and his release papers burned in front of him theres a lookout posted at the end of the spur and the nearest officer is in the unit office at the far end of the corridor reading a paper so you can be sure the humiliation will continue until he begins his right rounds when i return to the hospital i tell doug the name of the prisoner involved he expresses no surprise and simply adds that boy wont see the other side of forty pm returning to my room i pass alan selling stolen goods in the corridor he asks if he can leave a small wooden rocking horse in my room as his is a little overcrowded with two inmates he paid for the toy a postal order sent by someone on the outside to the wife of the prisoner who made it its a gift for his fourteen month old grandson as i write this diary in front of me are several cards from wellwishers a pottery model of the old vicarage a photo of mary and the boys and now a rocking horse alan is due to be released in two weeks time and when he leaves no excrement will be poured over his head the prisoners will line up to shake hands with this thoroughly decent man day friday november am absconding is a dcat phenomenon its almost impossible to escape from an a or bcat prison and extremely difficult to do so even from a ccat wayland for example in order for a prisoner to become eligible for dcat status he or she must be judged likely to complete their sentence without attempting to abscond in practice prisons are so overcrowded that ccat establishments which are desperate to empty their cells often clear out prisoners who quite simply should not be sent to an open prison one intake of eleven such prisoners arrived from lincoln last year and was down to seven before the final rollcall that night i discovered today that because of the chronic shortage of staff there are only five officers on duty at night and two of them are on overtime so absconding isnt too difficult prisoners abscond for a hundred and one different reasons but mainly because of outside family pressures a wife who is having an affair a partner who takes the children away or a death in the family that doesnt fulfil the criteria for compassionate leave the true irony is that these prisoners are the ones mostly likely to be apprehended because the first place they turn up at is the family abode and there waiting for them on the doorstep are a couple of local bobbies who then return them to closed conditions and a longer sentence before i was sent to prison i would have said quite right too its no more than they deserve however after days of an intense learning curve i now realize that each individual has to be judged on his own merits i accept that they have to be punished but it rarely falls neatly into black or white territory then theres a completely different category of absconders foreigners they simply wish to get back to their country aware that the british police have neither the time nor the resources to go looking for them for every ronnie biggs there are a hundred ronnie smalls mr new tells me about two absconders who are part of north sea camp folklore some years ago boston held a marathon in aid of a local cancer charity and the selected route took the competitors across a public footpath running along the east side of the prison one prisoner slipped out of the gym in his running kit joined the passing athletes and has never been seen since the second story concerns a prisoner who had to make a court appearance on a second charge while serving a sixyear sentence for a previous conviction when the jury returned to deliver their verdict his guards were waiting for him downstairs in the cells the jury delivered a verdict of not guilty on the second charge the judge pronounced you are free to leave the court and thats exactly what he did the reason i raise this subject is because potts whos had a bad week absconded yesterday following his suicide attempt it turns out that the final straw concerned the custody of his children the subject he was going to raise with his solicitor am after the frantic rush of events following the arrival of fifteen new prisoners yesterday today is comparatively quiet allen cannabis six years drops in to tell me that his weekend leave forms still havent been processed and its this weekend the duty officer mr hayes deals with it thomas in charge of a gun that discharged says his town visit form has not been authorized and asks how much longer he will have to wait to find out if he will be allowed out mr hayes deals with it merry embezzlement arrives with still no word as to when group will be transporting him to sudbury so that he can be nearer his family mr hayes deals with it mr hayes is an unusual officer hes not frightened of making decisions and standing by them he also makes his own tea when i asked him why he simply replied youre not here to serve me but to complete your sentence i dont need to be waited on am mr hocking and i agree it would be better for the press to take a photograph and then go away leaving his little band of security officers to get on with their job i walk out of the smu building and deliberately stop to chat to peter lifer arson who is sweeping leaves from the path he keeps his back to the cameras three minutes later i return to the building and true to form the photographers all disappear noon major willis comes to smu to hand back his red induction folder he tells me that hes sixtyfour first offence gbh sentence one year and that hell be released in march he was a major in the army and after retiring fell in love with a young nigerian girl a prostitute whom he later married she soon began to bully him and to spend what little money he had one day he could take no more blew his top and stuck a kitchen knife in her she reported him to the police he will end up doing ten months if he gets his tag six of them at nsc hes puzzled as to why i got four years pm a quiet afternoon a fleeting visit from mr berlyn to check that im wearing a prison shirt as the press keep reporting that mine isnt regulation issue he checks the blue and white hmp label and leaves satisfied pm fall asleep in front of the tv doug says i snore im writing five hours a day on top of a thirtyfourhour week and im not even going to the gym day saturday november ive written several times about the boredom of weekends but something takes place today that turns the normal torpor into frantic activity am the photographers have returned they either missed getting a good shot yesterday or work for the sundays who want a today pic i agree with the deputy governor mr berlyn to do another walk on walk off in order to get rid of them once and for all he seems grateful pm im expecting a visit from my son james when i enter the visitors room i cant see him but then spot someone waving at me it turns out to be my son hes grown a beard i hate it and tell him so which is a bit rough as hes just travelled miles to see me james tells me that my legal team are concentrating their efforts on my appeal mr and mrs barker have confirmed that they heard the judge discussing me at a dinner party over a year before i was arrested this could change my appeal pm doug and i are having tea in the hospital when clive strolls in to announce that hes moving to another room why i ask when he has the largest space in the prison because theyre fitting electrics into all the other rooms i cant believe hed give up his large abode in exchange for a tv if you want to move in jeffrey youd better come over to the south block now we all go off in search of the duty officer who approves the move i spend the next two hours assisted by alan selling stolen goods transferring all my possessions from the north block to the south while clive moves into a little single room at the other end of the corridor i am now lodged in a room twentyone by sixteen feet most prisoners assume ive paid clive some vast sum of money to move out and make way for me whereas the truth is that clive wanted out there is only one disadvantage there always has to be a disadvantage my new abode is next to the tv room but as thats turned off at eleven each night and i rarely leave doug in the hospital before pm i dont think it will be a real problem i now have an interesting job a better room edible food and a week what more could a man ask for day sunday november am write for two hours before i join doug at the hospital we watch david frost whose guests include northern irelands chief constable of the police service sir ronnie flanagan while discussing the morning papers sir ronnie says that its an infringement of my privacy that the tabloid press are taking pictures of me while im in jail the pictures are fine but the articles border on the farcical a security officer later points out that two tabloids have bylines attributed to women and there hasnt been a female journalist or photographer seen by anyone at nsc during the past three weeks noon over lunch i sit opposite an inmate called andy who is a rare phenomenon in any jail as he previously served ten years as a prison officer he is now doing a sevenyear sentence having pleaded guilty to smuggling drugs into prison for an inmate andy tells me that the only reason he did so was because the inmate in question was threatening to have his daughter beaten up she was married to an exprisoner did you fall for that one jeffrey i hear you ask yes i did the police presented irrefutable evidence to the jury showing that andys daughter had been threatened and asked the judge to take this into consideration when he passed sentence although andy claims he didnt know what was in the packages the final one he smuggled in a box of cadburys quality street contained four grams of pure heroin had it been cannabis he might have been sentenced to a year or eighteen months if he hadnt confessed he might have got away with a suspension he tells me that he knew he would eventually be caught and once he was called in for questioning he wanted to get the whole thing off his chest andy was initially sent to hmp gartree bcat with a new identity and a different offence on his charge sheet he had to be moved the moment he was recognized by an old lag from there he went to swalesdale where he lasted twentyfour hours he was then moved on to elmsley a sex offenders prison where he lived on the same landing as roy whiting who was convicted of the murder of sarah payne once hed earned his dcat andy came to nsc where hell complete his sentence the only other comment he makes which ive heard repeated again and again and therefore consider worthy of mention is sex offenders live in far better conditions than any other prisoners day monday november am when i was an mp i often heard the sentiment expressed that life should mean life i am reminded of this because we have a lifers board meeting at smu today there are nine lifers at nsc and you can be fairly confident that if theyve reached a dcat they wont consider absconding in truth theyre all fairly harmless two of them go out each day to work in an old peoples home one in a library in boston and another for the local oxfam shop linda their probation officer joins us for coffee during the morning break she adds to the research ive pieced together over the past three months i began my prison life at belmarsh on a spur with twentythree murderers lifers range from coldblooded killers like denis nielsen who pleaded guilty to murdering thirteen victims down to chris who killed his wife in a fit of rage after finding her in bed with another man hes already spent fourteen years regretting his loss of temper nielsen began his sentence and will end it in the highest security acategory facility he is currently locked up in a ssu a special security unit a sort of prison within a prison when he moves anywhere within the prison he is always accompanied by at least two officers and a dog and he is searched every time he leaves his cell or returns to it at night he places all his clothes outside the cell door and an officer hands them back to him the following morning nielsen told po new on several occasions that it would have been better for everyone if theyd hanged him now that the ira terrorists are no longer locked up on the mainland of the murderers in custody there are currently only seven ssu inmates now chris who killed his wife is at the other end of the scale hes reached dcat status after eleven years and works in the kitchens he therefore has access to several instruments with which he could kill or maim only yesterday i watched him chopping up some meat rather efficiently he hopes that the parole board will agree to release him in eighteen months time during the past eleven years he has moved from acat to dcat via seventeen jails three of them in one weekend when he was driven to preston swalesdale and whitemoor only to find each time that they didnt have a cell for him all nine lifers at nsc will be interviewed today so further reports can be sent to the home office to help decide if they are ready to return to the outside world the home office will make the final decision they are traditionally rather conservative and accept about per cent of the boards recommendations the board convenes at am when linda the lifers probation officer is joined by the deputy governor mr berlyn a psychiatrist called christine and the lifers prison officer the first prisoner in front of the board is peter who set fire to a police station hes so far served thirtyone years and frankly is now a great helpless hunk of a man who has become so institutionalized that the parole board will probably have to transfer him straight to an oldpeoples home peter told me he has to serve at least another eighteen months before the board would be willing to consider his case i dont think hell ever be released other than in a coffin the next to come in front of the board is leon the biggest problem lifers face is their prison records for the first ten years of their sentences they can see no light at the end of the tunnel so the threat of another twentyeight days added to their sentence is hardly a deterrent after ten years linda says there is often a sea change in a lifers attitude that coincides with their move to a bcat and then again when they reach a ccat this is even more pronounced when they finally arrive at a dcat and can suddenly believe release is possible by the way its almost unknown for a lifer to abscond not only would they be returned to an acat closed prison but its possible they never would be considered for parole again however most of the lifers being interviewed today have led a farily blameless existence for the past five years although there are often scars missing teeth and broken bones to remind them of their first ten years in an acat during the day each of them goes meekly in to face the board no swagger no swearing no attitude that alone could set them back another year leon is followed by michael then chris roger bob john john and john a coincidence not acceptable in a novel at the end of the day linda comes out exhausted by the way they all adore her she not only knows their life histories to the minutest detail but also treats them as human beings pm only one other incident of note today the appearance at smu of a man who killed a woman in a road accident and was sentenced to three years for dangerous driving hes a mildmannered chap who asked me for help with his book on kurdistan mr new tells me that he is going to be transferred to another jail the husband of his victim lives in boston and as the inmate is coming up for his first town visit the victims husband has objected on the grounds that he might come across him in his daily life the inmate joins me after his meeting with mr new hes philosophical about the decision he accepts that the victims family have every right to ask for him to be moved hes so clearly racked with guilt and seems destined to relive this terrible incident for the rest of his life that i find myself trying to comfort him in truth hes a different kind of lifer pm it must be guy fawkes day because from my little window i can see fireworks exploding over boston day tuesday november am the big news in the camp today is that from november nsc is to become a resettlement prison no doubt you will have noticed that its november the change of status could spell survival for nsc which has been under threat of closure for several years resettlement means quite simply that once a prisoner has reached his fled facility licence eligibility date in my case july next year he can take a job outside the prison working for fiftyfive hours a week not including travelling time the whole atmosphere of the prison will change when inmates are translated into outmates they will leave the prison every morning between seven and eight and not return until seven in the evening prisoners will be able to earn to a week just as clive does as a line manager for exotic foods it will be interesting to see how quickly nsc implements the new home office directive am seven new arrivals at nsc today who complete their induction talk and labour board by am my job as smu orderly is now running smoothly although matthew tells me that an officer said that for the first week i made the worst cup of tea of any orderly in history but now that ive worked out how to avoid tea leaves ending up in the mug i need a fresh challenge pm mr new warns me that the prison is reaching full capacity and they might have to put a second bed in my room not that they want anyone to share with me after the news of the world covered three pages with the life history of my last unfortunate cellmate its simply a gesture to prove to other inmates that my spacious abode is not a single dwelling pm i write or to be more accurate work on the sixth draft of my latest novel sons of fortune pm doug and i watch channel news fighting breaks out in stormont during david trimbles press conference following his reappointment as first minister if what i am witnessing on television were to take place at nsc they would all lose their privileges and be sent back to closed conditions doug has a natural gift of timing and waits until the end of the news before he drops his bombshell the monthly prison committee meeting made up in equal numbers of staff and prisoners is to have its next gettogether on friday the governor is chairman and among the five prison representatives are doug and clive two men who understand power however limited doug tells me that the main item on the agenda will be resettlement and he intends to apply to work at his haulage company in cambridgeshire his application fulfils the recommended criteria as march is within the fiftyfivemile radius it is also the job he will return to once hes released relieving his wife of the pressure of running the company while hes been locked up but now for the consequences his job as hospital orderly the most soughtafter position in the prison will become available he makes it clear that if i want the job he will happily make a recommendation to linda who has already hinted that such an appointment would meet with her approval this would mean my moving into the hospital and although id be working seven days a week there is an added advantage of a pay rise of so with my personal income of id have over a week to spend in the canteen but the biggest luxury of all would be sleeping in the hospital which has an ensuite bathroom a sixteeninch tv and a fridge its too much to hope for and might even tempt me to stay at nsc well at least until my fled day wednesday november am they call him mick the key he arrived yesterday and if he hadnt been turned down for a job in the kitchens i might never have heard his story even now im not sure how much of it i believe originally sentenced to two years for breaking and entering mick is now serving his ninth year they have only risked moving him to a dcat for his last twelve weeks the reason is simple mick likes escaping or assisting others to escape and he has one particular gift that aids him in this enterprise he only needs to look at a key once and he can reproduce it he first commits the shape to memory then draws the outline on a piece of paper before transferring that onto a bar of prison soap the first impression of the key the next stage is to reproduce the image in plastic using prison knives or forks he then covers the newly minted key with thick paint he obtains from the works department the next day he has a key during his years in prison mick has been able to open not only his own cell door but also anyone elses in fact while he was at whitemoor they closed the prison for twentyfour hours because they had to change the locks on all cells getting out of prison is only half the enjoyment this charming irishman tells me getting into kitchens stores or even the governors office adds to the quality of ones life in fact he concludes my greatest challenge was opening the hospital drugs cabinet in under an hour on that occasion the officers knew who was responsible but as nothing was missing mick says hes never taken a drug in his life they could only charge him on suspicion and were later unable to make the charge stick some of the prison keys are too large and complicated to reproduce inside so undaunted mick joined the art class he drew pictures of the skylines of new york dallas and chicago before sending them home to his brother it was some weeks before the innocent art teacher caught on the security staff intercepted a package of keys brought into the prison by his sister what a useful fellow mick would have been in colditz mick tells me that he hopes to get a job in the kitchen where he intends to be a good boy as he wants to be released in twelve weeks time in any case he adds it will do my reputation no good to escape from an open prison the labour board turned down micks application to work in the kitchen after all there are several cupboards cool rooms and fridges all of which are locked and for him that would be too much of a temptation he leaves smu with a grin on his face theyve put me on the farm he declares theyre not worried about me breaking into a pigsty by the way jeff if you ever need to get into the governors office and have a look at your files just let me know am an extra bed has appeared in my room because two of the spurs are temporarily out of service while theyre being fitted for tvs i found out today that prisoners are charged a week for the hire of their tvs and nsc will make an annual profit of on this enterprise at wayland im told it was free enterprise at its best still the point of this entry is to let you know that i will soon be sharing my room with another prisoner pm at mr news request i join him in his office hes just had a call from his opposite number at spring hill who asked if i was aware that if transferred i would have to share a room yes i reply and can they confirm that the principal reason for seeking a transfer is the inconvenience to your family of having a mile round trip to visit you yes i reply mr new nods i anticipated your answers although a decision has not yet been made the first vacancy wouldnt be until november suddenly its crunch time would i rather stay at nsc as the hospital orderly with my own room tv bathroom and fridge or move to spring hill and be nearer my family and friends ill need to discuss the problem with mary pm i return to my room to do a couple of hours writing so far no other occupant has appeared to claim the second bed pm my new roommate arrives accompanied by two friends his name is eamon and he seems pleasant enough i leave him to settle in when i stroll into the hospital clive has a large grin on his face he spent eleven months in that room without ever having to share it for one night i couldnt even manage eleven days day thursday november am breakfast wendy the officer in charge of the kitchen needs three new workers from this mornings labour board but only yesterday you told me that you were overstaffed true she replies hands on hips but that was yesterday and i had to sack three of the blighters this morning why i ask hopefully i knew youd ask she replies and only because youre bound to find out sooner or later ill tell you i set three of them plucking chickens yesterday morning and last night two of the birds went missing i dont know who stole them but in my kitchen i dispense summary justice so all three were sacked am eight new prisoners arrive for induction today including my roommate eamon it seems that he worked in the kitchen at his last prison but on the out is a builder by trade hes due for release in january and wants to work outside during the winter months to toughen himself up sounds logical to me so i recommend that he opts for the farm am eamon gets his preferred job i also find three new kitchen workers for wendy and the labour board is drinking coffee by am i need a new challenge noon lunch i sit next to the new visits orderly who tells me that on the out he was a hairdresser in leicester he charged but while hes in prison hell happily cut my hair once a month for a phonecard another problem solved pm a fax has just been received from spring hill requesting my latest sentence plan which cannot be updated until ive served twentyeight days at nsc sentence plans make up a part of every prisoners record and are an important element when it comes to consideration for parole sentence planning boards are held almost every afternoon and conducted by mr new and mr simpson i am due before the board on november mr new immediately brings it forward a week to november next monday which would be my twentyninth day at nsc and promises to fax the result through to spring hill that afternoon ill be interested to see what excuse theyll come up with next pm mr berlyn deputy governor drops in to grumble about the prison being full for the first time in years and say that im to blame how come i ask because he explains the news of the world described nsc as the cushiest jail in britain so now every prisoner who qualifies for a dcat wants to be sent here its one of the reasons i hope they take you at spring hill he continues then we can pass that dubious accolade on to them by the way he adds dont get your hopes up about an early move because someone up above prison slang for the home office is out to stop you pm john lifer murder arrives in smu accompanied by a very attractive lady whom he introduces as his partner this has me puzzled if john murdered his wife and has been in prison for the past fourteen years how can he have a partner pm i return to my room and write for two hours relieved that eamon doesnt make an appearance im not sure if its because hes with his friends from derby or is excessively considerate this morning he told me he didnt mind my switching the light on at six oclock im in the building trade he explained so im used to getting up at fourthirty i feel i should add that he doesnt smoke doesnt swear and is always well mannered i still havent found out why hes in prison pm i find doug and clive at the hospital heads down poring over the new resettlement directive in preparation for tomorrows facility meeting doug is determined to be the first prisoner out of the blocks and if that should happen then i might become the hospital orderly overnight for the first time i look at the hospital in a different light thinking about what changes i would make day friday november am before i went to sleep last night i studied the latest lords reform bill as set out in the times and telegraph by phil webster and george jones those papers respective political editors when i entered the commons in at the age of twentynine i think i was the first elected mp not to have been eligible for national service a twoyear period of compulsory service in one of the branches of the armed forces which ceased to apply for anyone born after i mention this because having won a byelection in louth lincolnshire i experienced six months of a fagend session of which almost every member had served not only in the armed forces but also in the second world war with half a dozen having done so in the first world war on the back benches generals admirals and air marshalls who could add mc dso and dfc to the letters mp were in abundance at lunch in the members dining room you might sit next to sir fitzroy mclean who was parachuted into yugoslavia to assist tito or airey neave who escaped from colditz in when ted heath became prime minister malcolm rifkind kenneth clarke and norman lamont joined me a new breed of politician who would in time replace the amateurs of the past i use the word amateur with respect and admiration for many of these men had no desire to hold high office considering parliament an extension of the armed forces that allowed them to continue to serve their country when i entered the lords in the house consisted of hereditary peers life peers and working peers i fell into the latter category peter carrington who was foreign secretary under margaret thatcher is an example of an hereditary peer the late yehudi menuhin of a life peer who rarely attended the house why should he and john wakeham was a working peer and my first leader a cabinet minister appointed to the lords to do a job of work a strange way to make up a second chamber you may feel and certainly undemocratic but for all its failings while i sat on the back benches i came to respect the skills dedication and service the country received for such a small outlay on the other side of that undemocratic coin were hereditary peers and even some life peers who never attended the house from one year to the next while others who contributed almost nothing attended every day to ensure they received their daily allowance and expenses am i learn a little more about johns lifer love life over breakfast it seems john met his partner some six years ago when he was ensconced at hillgrove a ccat prison she had driven a couple of johns friends over to visit him at that time john would only have been allowed a visit once a fortnight on learning that a woman he had never seen in his life was sitting in the car park he suggested she should join them for the next few months jan continued to drive johns friends to his fortnightly visit but it wasnt long before she was coming on her own this love affair developed in the most restrictive and unpromising circumstances now john is in a dcat jan can visit him once a week its their intention to get married should he be granted his parole in eighteen months time as you can imagine they still have several obstacles to overcome john is fiftyone and has served twentythree years and jan is fortyeight divorced and with three children by her first marriage at some time between now and next march jan has to tell her three children twentyfour twentytwo and fifteen that she has fallen in love with a murderer and intends to marry him once hes released am my name is bellowed out over the tannoy and i am ordered to report to reception those stentorian tones could only come from sergeant major daff daffodil to the inmates i have several parcels to sign for most of them books kindly sent in by the public i am allowed to take them away only if i promise theyll end up in the library also two tshirts for gym use only he winks and a box of belgian truffles sent by a lady from manchester now the rule on sweets is clear prisoners cannot have them as they may be full of drugs so they are passed on to the children who attend the gym on thursdays for special needs classes explain that one i suggest that not many seven year olds will fully appreciate belgian truffles but perhaps mrs daff might like them theyve been married for forty years no he replies sharply that could be construed as a bribe mr daff suggests theyre put in the raffle for the samaritans ball in boston i agree i have for many years admired the work of the samaritans and in prison they have unquestionably saved countless young lives pm when i return to my room i find eamon preparing to move out and join his friends from derby in the eightroom dormitory so ill be back on my own again i take advantage of the time hes packing his hmp plastic bag to discover why hes in prison it seems that on the saturday night of last years cup final eamon and his friends got drunk at their local pub a friend appeared and told them he had been beaten up by a rival gang and needed some help to teach the bastards a lesson off went eamon and his drunken mates armed with pool cues and anything else they could lay their hands on they chased the rival gang back to their cars in the municipal car park next to the crown court and a fierce battle followed all of which was recorded on cctv five of them were charged with violent disorder and pleaded not guilty one of them a member of derby county football team their solicitor pleabargained for the charge to be downgraded to affray one look at the cctv footage and they quickly changed their plea to guilty they were each given ten months and if theyre granted tagging will be released after only twelve weeks five months minus two months tagging incidentally the gang member who enlisted their help was the first to hear the sirens and escaped moments before the police arrived day saturday november am there isnt a day that goes by when i dont wish i wasnt here i miss my freedom i miss my friends and above all i miss mary and the boys there isnt a day that goes by when i dont curse mr justice potts for what everyone saw as his prejudicial summing up to the jury and his apparent delight at handing out such a draconian sentence there isnt a day that goes by when i dont wonder why the police havent arrested angie peppiatt for embezzlement there isnt a day that goes by when i dont question how i can be guilty of perverting the course of justice while ted francis is not either we are both guilty or both innocent i have been in jail for days and my anger and despair finally surface after a visit by a young man called derek derek knocks quietly on my door and i take a break from writing to deal with his simple request for an autograph on the back of a picture of the girlfriend who has stood by him i ask him about his sentence most prisoners go into great detail even though they know im writing a diary derek is spending three months in jail for stealing from his employers after issuing a personal cheque he knew he hadnt the funds to cover he spent a month in lincoln prison which the old lags tell me is even worse than belmarsh he adds that the magistrates short sharp shock has enabled him to witness a violent beating in the shower the injecting of heroin and language that he had no idea any human being resorted to but he adds before leaving youve been an example to me your good manners your cheeriness and willingness to listen to anyone elses problems have surprised everyone here i cant tell him that i have no choice its all an act i am hopelessly unhappy dejected and broken i smile when i am at my lowest i laugh when i see no humour i help others when i need help myself i am alone if i were to show any sign even for a moment of what im going through i would have to read the details in some tabloid the following day everything i do is only a phone call away from a friendly journalist with an open cheque book i dont know where i have found the strength to maintain this facade and never break down in anyones presence i will manage it even if its only to defeat my enemies who would love to see me crumble i am helped by the hundreds of letters that pour in every week from ordinary decent members of the public i am helped by my friends who remain loyal i am helped by the love and support of mary will and james i have no thoughts of revenge or even any hope of justice but god knows i will not give in day sunday november am im five minutes late for breakfast mr hayes a thoughtful and decent officer takes me to one side and asks if i could be on time in future because otherwise some prisoners will complain that im getting special treatment am doug is out on town leave so that he can visit his family in march and linda hospital matron asks me if ill act as keeper of the pills you need three qualifications for this responsibility nonsmoker never been involved with drugs be able to read and write in a prison of inmates only seven prisoners fulfil all three criteria am i write for two hours pm lunch im on time pm the governing governor mr lewis drops in to see linda glad to catch you he says to me ive had a letter from disgusted bexhill on sea she wants to know why you have a private swimming pool and are driven home in your rolls royce every friday to spend the weekend with your family i have disillusioned her on the first two points and added that you are now working both saturday and sunday in the hospital at a rate of p an hour pm mary visits me its wonderful to see her although she looks drawn and tired she brings me up to date on all my legal problems including details of all the money that disappeared during the period angie peppiatt was my secretary we also discuss whether i should issue a writ against baroness nicholson for her accusation that i stole millions from the kurds and how its possible for ted francis to be innocent when i was found guilty of the same charge once shes completed the file on mrs peppiatt it will be handed over to the police we finally discuss the dilemma as to whether i should remain at nsc and take over as hospital orderly we decide i should still apply for spring hill pm i read the only sunday papers i can lay my hands on the observer and the news of the world one too far to the left for me the other too far to the right pm doug returns from a day out with his family and i hand back my responsibility as keeper of the pills hes convinced that theyre lining me up for the hospital job just as soon as hes granted leave to do outside work which would take him out of the prison five days a week i tell him that both mary and i still feel it would be better if i could transfer to spring hill pm back to my room the communal tv next door is showing some vampire film at full volume amazed by what the body learns to tolerate i finally fall asleep day monday november am as each day passes i tell myself that the stories will dry up and this diary with it well not today because simon has just walked into smu simon works in the officers mess and although i see him every day i have not yet made his acquaintance hes visiting smu to check on an application he submitted to visit his mother in doncaster he has i fear been dealing with an officer ironically known as action man after six weeks and several apps simon has still heard nothing after ive promised to follow this up i casually ask him why hes in prison i abducted my son he replies i perk up ive not come across an abduction before simon pleaded guilty to abducting rescuing in his words his fiveyearold son for fortyseven days he whisked him off to cyprus via france germany yugoslavia and turkey he did so he explains because after hed left his wife he discovered that his son was being physically abused by both his exwife and her new partner a police detective sergeant the judge didnt believe his story and sentenced him to four years as a warning to other fathers not to take the law into their own hands fair enough and indeed i found myself nodding a year later his wifes new partner the detective sergeant was arrested and charged with abh actual bodily harm and received a threeyear sentence for among other things breaking the little boys arm simon immediately appealed and returned to court to face the same judge he pleaded not only extenuating circumstances but added i told you so to which the judge replied it doesnt alter the fact that you broke the law so you will complete your sentence ah i hear you say but he could have reported the man to the police and the social services you try reporting a detective sergeant to the police and simon has files stacked up in his room filled with dozens of complaints to the social services with replies bordering on the ludicrous we have looked into the matter very carefully and have no reason to believe simon had to sell his home to pay the legal bills and is now incarcerated in nsc penniless and with no knowledge of where his only child is my heart goes out to this man would you have done the same thing for your child if the answer is yes then youre a criminal am a call for me over the tannoy to report to reception sergeant major daff is on duty he is happy to release my drugfree radio its a sony threeband sensible plain and workmanlike it will do the job and one only needs to look at the sturdy object to know its been sent by mary pm a quiet afternoon so matthew gives me a lecture on herodotus he is rather pleased with himself because hes come across a passage in book four of the histories that could be the first known reference to sniffing cannabis hemp i reproduce the translation in full and now for the vapourbath on a framework made up of three sticks meeting at the top they stretch pieces of woollen cloth taking care to get the jams as perfect as they can and inside this little tent they place a dish with redhot stones on it they then take some hemp seed enter the tent and throw the seed onto the hot stones it immediately begins to smoke giving off a vapour unsurpassed by any vapour bath one could find in greece the scythians enjoy the experience so much that they howl with pleasure pm mr new and mr simpson interview me for my sentence plan all the boxes are filled in with no history nh for drugs violence past offences drink or mental disorder in the remaining boxes the words low risk are entered for abscond reoffend and bullying the final box has to be filled in by my personnel officer mr new is kind enough to commend my efforts at smu and my relationship with other prisoners the document is then signed by both officers and faxed to spring hill at pm and is acknowledged as received at pm watch this space day tuesday november am write for two hours am there are no new inductees today and therefore no labour board mr new will not be on duty until one oclock so matthew and i have a quiet morning he gives me a lecture on alexander the great noon i phone chris beetles at his gallery his annual illustrators catalogue has arrived in the morning post there is the usual selection of goodies vickie low brabazon scarfe shepard giles and heath robinson however its a new artist who attracts my attention the first edition of the wind in the willows was illustrated by e h shepard and after his death for a short time by heath robinson but a new version has recently been published illustrated with the most delightful watercolours by michael foreman who is one of britains most respected illustrators original shepards are now changing hands for as much as and heath robinsons can fetch so it was a pleasant surprise to find that mr foremans works were around i decide to select one or two for any future grandchildren so in anticipation i turn the pages and begin to choose a dozen or so for mary to consider i have to smile when i come to page a picture of toad in jail being visited by the washerwoman this is not only a must for a future grandchild but should surely be this years christmas card see below pm an inmate called fox asks me if its true that i have a laptop in my room i explain politely to him that i write all my manuscripts by hand and have no idea how to use a computer he looks surprised i later learn from my old roommate eamon that theres a rumour going round that i have my own laptop and a mobile phone envy in prison is every bit as rife as it is on the out pm i receive a visit from david fraud eighteen months he has received a long and fascinating letter from his former padmate alan who was transferred to spring hill a week ago alan confirms that his new abode is far more pleasant than nsc and advises me to join him as quickly as possible he doesnt seem to realize that the decision wont rest with me however there is one revealing sentence an officer reported that theyve been expecting jeffrey for the past week has he decided not to come david feels that they must have agreed to take me and are only waiting for my sentence plan which was faxed to them yesterday incidentally david the recipient of the letter was a schoolmaster in sleaford before he arrived at nsc via belmarsh three of his former pupils are also residents well to be totally accurate two one has just absconded pm doug and i watch the tanks as they roll into kabul while bush and blair try not to look triumphant pm im back in my room undressing when a flash bulb goes off the door to each inmates room has a large glass panel in it covered in wire mesh on the outside is a green curtain to stop casual passersby peering in however during the night prison officers hold back the curtain to check youre in bed and havent absconded i quickly open my door and see an inmate running down the corridor i chase after him but he disappears out of the back door and into the night i return to my room and a few moments later an officer knocks on the door and lets himself in he tells me that they know who it is as several prisoners saw the culprit departing so everyone will know it was by this time tomorrow yet another inmate who has been bribed by the press the last three have been caught lost their dcat status been shipped back to a bcat and had time added to their sentence im told the going rate for a photograph is if they catch him ill let you know if they dont youll have seen it in one of the national papers captioned exclusive archer undressing in his cell day wednesday november am as i walk over to breakfast from the south block i pick up snippets of information about last nights incident it turns out that the photographer was not a prisoner but wilkins a former inmate who was released last friday he was recognized by several inmates all of whom were puzzled as to what he was doing back inside the prison four days after hed been released but here is the tragic aspect of the whole episode wilkins was in prison for driving without a licence and served only twelve weeks of a sixmonth sentence the penalty for entering a prison for illegal purposes carries a maximum sentence of ten years or thats what it proclaims on the board in black and white as you enter nsc and worse you spend the entire term locked up in a bcat as you would be considered a highescape risk the last such charge at nsc was when a father brought in drugs for his son he ended up with a threeyear sentence i look forward to discovering which paper considers this behaviour a service to the public im told that when they catch wilkins part of the bargaining over sentence will be if he is willing to inform the police who put him up to it pm theres a call over the intercom for all officers to report to the gatehouse immediately matthew and i watch through the kitchen window as a dozen officers arrive at different speeds from every direction they surround a television crew who i later learn are bizarrely trying to film a lookalike jeffrey archer holding up one of my books and claiming hes trying to escape mr new tells me he warned them that they were on government property and must leave immediately to which the producer replied you cant treat me like that im with the bbc can the bbc really have sunk to this level day thursday november am im up early because i have to report to the hospital by am to take over my new responsibilities as dougs standin while he goes off on a threeday forklift truckdriving course how this will help a man of fiftythree who runs his own haulage company with a two million pound turnover is beyond me he doesnt seem to care about the irrelevance of it all as long as he gets out of prison for three days i write for two hours am i report to linda at the hospital and witness the morning sick parade a score of prisoners are lined up to collect their medication or to see if they can get off work for the day if its raining or freezing cold the length of the queue doubles most farm workers would rather spend the day in the warm watching tv than picking brussels sprouts or cleaning out the pigsties linda describes them as malingerers and claims she can spot them at thirty paces if i worked on the farm i might well join them bill fraud farm worker has had every disease affliction and germ thats known to man today hes got diarrhoea and asks linda for the day off work he feels sure hell be fine by tomorrow certainly says linda giving him her warmest smile bill smiles back in response but she adds im going to have to put you in the san sanatorium for the day why asks bill looking surprised ill need to take a sample every thirty minutes she explains before i can decide what medication to prescribe bill reluctantly goes into the hospital lies on one of the beds and looks hopefully in the direction of the television screen not a chance linda tells him once linda has sorted out the genuinely ill from the tryingiton brigade im handed four lists of those she has sanctioned to be off work for the day i deliver a copy to the south block unit office the farm office the north block the gatehouse amd education before going to breakfast am its matthews last day at nsc and hes on the paper chase he takes a doublesided printed form from department to department the hospital gym canteen stores and reception to gather signatures authorizing his release tomorrow he starts with mr simpson the probation officer at smu and will end with the principal officer mr new he will then have to hand in this sheet of paper at reception tomorrow morning before he can finally be released its not unknown for a prisoners release paper to disappear overnight which can hold up an inmates departure for several hours ill miss matthew who at the age of twentyfour will be returning to university to complete his phd hes taught me a great deal during the past five weeks ive met over a thousand prisoners since ive been in jail and he is one of a handful who i believe should never have been sent to prison i wish him luck in the future hes a fine young man noon i drop into the hospital to see if sister needs me not at the moment says linda but as were expecting seventeen new arrivals this afternoon please come back around four or when you see the sweat box driving through the front gate hows bill i enquire he lasted about forty minutes she replies dryly but sadly failed to produce a specimen i sent him back to the farm but of course told him to return immediately should the problem arise again pm on returning to smu i find a prisoner sitting in the waiting room visibly shaking his name is moore he tells me that hes been called off work for a meeting with two police officers who are travelling down from derbyshire to interview him hes completed seventeen months of a fiveyear sentence and is anxious to know why they want to see him pm the police havent turned up i go to check on moore to find hes a gibbering wreck pm the two derbyshire police officers arrive they greet me with a smile and dont look at all ferocious i take them up to an interview room on the first floor and offer them a cup of tea using the opportunity to tell them that moore is in a bit of a state they assure me that its only a routine enquiry and he has nothing to be anxious about i return downstairs and pass on this message the shaking stops pm moore departs with a smile and a wave ive never seen a more relieved man pm the seventeen new prisoners arrive in a sweat box via birmingham and nottingham i report to the hospital to check their blood pressure and note their weight and height its not easy to carry out my new responsibilities while all seventeen of them talk at once what jobs are there how much are you paid can i go to the canteen tonight what time are rollcalls which is the best block can i make a phone call pm doug returns from his day on the forklift trucks hes pleased to be doing the course because if he hopes to retain his hgv licence he would still have to take it in a years time the course is costing him but hed be willing to pay that just to be allowed out for three days in fact id pay a lot more he says pm after rollcall i take a bath before going over to the south block to say goodbye to matthew by the time i check in at the hospital at am tomorrow morning he will be a free man i do not envy him because he should never have been sent to prison in the first place day friday november am all seventeen new inmates are waiting in the conservatory for their introductory talk before they sign the pledge on drugs theyre all chatting away with one exception hes sitting in the corner head bowed foot tapping looking anxious this could be for any number of reasons but even though the officers keep a suicide watch during the first fortyeight hours of a prisoners arrival i still report my anxieties to mr new he tells me to bring the prisoner into his office but make it look routine when the man emerges forty minutes later he is smiling it turns out that x is a schedule a conviction which usually means a sexual offence against a minor however x was sentenced to six months for lashing out at his son hell only serve twelve weeks and the fact that hes in a dcat prison shows there is no previous history of violence however if word got out that hes schedule a other inmates would assume hes a paedophile mr new has advised the prisoner to say if asked what hes in for that he took a swipe at a guy who tried to jump a taxi queue as hes only serving twelve weeks its just believable am storr marches into the building waving a complaint form yesterday after returning from a town visit he failed a breathalyser test yes you can be breathalysed in prison without having driven in fact walking is quite enough storr protested that he never drinks even on the out and the real culprit is a bottle of mouthwash storr is sent back to the north block to retrieve the offending bottle which has about an inch of red liquid left in the bottom the label lists alcohol as one of several ingredients after some discussion mr new decides storr will be retested tomorrow morning if the test proves negative his explanation will be accepted mr new banned all mouthwashes from the canteen following a similar incident a year ago as storr purchased the bottle at his last prison mr new is issuing a new directive that any new prisoners arriving at nsc with mouthwash will have the bottles confiscated he will then be subjected to regular random tests and should one of them prove positive he will be shipped back to his ccat storr accepts this judgment and leaves looking pleased with himself pm i ask mr new if there is any progress on my transfer to spring hill he shakes his head pm i report back to the hospital and carry out three more urine tests on the inductees we didnt get round to yesterday measure their blood pressure and record their weight among them is a prisoner called blossom who is returning to nsc for the third time in as many years hes as good as gold says linda a gipsy who once convicted never puts a foot wrong hes always released as a model prisoner after serving half his sentence but once hes left us hes usually back within a year she adds pm television news footage reveals kabul as it had been under the rule of the taliban amongst the buildings filmed is kabul jail which makes nsc look like the ritz twenty men would have occupied my room with only three urinestained ragged mattresses between them i sleep soundly day saturday november anyone whos incarcerated wants their sentence to pass as quickly as possible if youre fortunate enough to have an interesting job as i have at smu that certainly helps kill monday to friday that just leaves the other problem the weekend once youve reached your fled and can work outside the prison have a town visit every week and a week out every month im told the months fly by but should i fail to win my appeal against length of sentence none of this will kick in until july next year another eight months so boredom will become my greatest challenge i can write but not for every hour of every day with luck theres a rugby match to watch on saturday afternoon and a visitor to look forward to seeing on sunday so for the record saturday am write this diary for two hours am breakfast am read the times or any other paper available am work on the sixth rewrite of sons of fortune noon lunch pm watch new zealand beat ireland on bbc pm watch wales beat tonga on bbc pm watch the highlights of englands recordbreaking win of against romania on itv pm continue to work on sons of fortune and run out of paper my fault pm sign in for rollcall to prove i havent absconded or died of boredom pm join doug in the hospital and watch a danny de vitobette midler film followed by the news pm return to my room go to bed and despite the noise of match of the day coming from the tv room next door fall asleep day sunday november am after five weeks at nsc you must be as familiar with my daily routine as i am so as from today i will refer only to highlights or unusual incidents that i think might interest you pm you will recall that im allowed one visit a week and my visitors today are alan and della pascoe i first met alan when he was an england schoolboy and even the casual observer realized that he was destined to be a star he had a decade at the highest level and if that time hadnt clashed with al moses the greatest m hurdler in history alan would have undoubtedly won two olympic gold medals rather than two silvers we only ran against each other once in our careers he was seventeen and i was twentysix i prefer not to dwell on the result although i had the privilege of watching della run for her country commonwealth gold medalist and world record holder we didnt meet until she married alan and our families have been close ever since they remain the sort of friends who dont run round the track in the opposite direction when youve been disqualified day monday november am the noise of three heavy tractors harvesting acres and acres of brussels sprouts wakes me if im up every day by fivethirty what time must the farm labourers rise to be on their tractor seats even before i stir am matthew as you will remember was released last friday and has been replaced in the smu by carl carl is softly spoken and well mannered hes the lead singer in the prisons rock band and has the striking good looks required for someone who aspires to that calling around five foot eleven slim with wavy fair hair he tells me that he has a fifteenyearold daughter born when he was twenty hes not married so he must be in his midthirties carl arrives at eighttwenty which is a good start and as i run through our daily duties he makes notes monday is usually quiet no inductions or labour board so im able to brief him fully on all personnel resident in the building and their responsibilities he is a quick study and also has all the women in the building coming into the kitchen on the flimsiest of excuses in a week hell have everything mastered and ill be redundant now of course you will want to know why this cross between robbie williams and richard branson is in prison simple answer fraud carl took advances on property that he didnt own or even properly represent a more interesting aspect of carls case is that his codefendant pleaded not guilty while on the advice of his barrister carl pleaded guilty but theres still another twist to come because carl had to wait for the outcome of his codefendants trial before he could be sentenced he was released on bail for nine months and during that time did a runner he disappeared off to barcelona found himself a job and tried to settle down however after only a few weeks he decided he had to come back to england and in his words face the music carl was a little surprised not to be arrested when he landed at heathrow he spent the weekend with a friend in nottingham and then handed himself in to the nearest police station the policeman at the desk was so astonished that he didnt quite know what to do with him carl was charged later that day and after spending a night in custody was sentenced the following morning to three years his codefendant also received three years his barrister says he would only have got two years if he hadnt broken bail and disappeared off to barcelona carl is a model prisoner so he will only serve sixteen months half his sentence minus two months with a tag pm mr new phones spring hill to enquire about my transfer but as theres no reply from karens office hell try again tomorrow if i were back in my office id try again at pm pm and pm but not in prison tomorrow will be just fine after all im not going anywhere pm david murder arrives with all my clothes neatly laundered lifers have their own washing machine and iron jeeves of pont street would be proud of him i hand over three mars bars and my debt is paid pm i need to buy a plug from the canteen p because i keep leaving mine in the washbasin ive lost four in the last four weeks when i get to the front of the queue theyre sold out however doug tells me he has a drawer full of plugs of course he does day tuesday november many aspects of prison life are unbearable boredom confinement missing family and friends all of these might fade in time but the two things i will never forget after im released will be the noise and the bad language when i returned to my room at pm last night the tv room next door was packed with screaming hooligans the volume for a the repeat of the world heavyweight title fight between lennox lewis and hasim rahman was so high that it reminded me of being back at belmarsh when reggae music was blaring out from the adjacent cell i was delighted to learn that lennox lewis had retained his title but didnt need to hear every word the commentator said or the accompanying cheers screams and insults from a highly partisan crowd in the end i gave up went next door and asked if the volume could be turned down a little i was greeted with a universal chorus of fuck off am sixteen new inductees turn up for labour board all clutching their red folders the message has spread if you dont return your folders you dont get a job and therefore no wages because the prison is so full at the moment most of the good jobs hospital smu library education stores officers mess are filled leaving only kitchen cleaners and the dreaded farm among the new intake is a phd and an army officer i fix it so that the phd who only has another five weeks to serve will work in the stores and the army officer will then take over from him only one of the new intake hasnt a clue what he wants to do so he inevitably ends up on the farm am i have already described the paper chase to you so imagine my surprise when among the three prisoners to turn up this morning clutching his release papers is potts do you remember potts solicitor didnt turn up took an overdose well hes fully recovered and went back to court for his appeal however he was half an hour late and the judge refused to hear his case despite the fact that it was the prison services fault that he wasnt on time here we are two weeks later and hes off tomorrow even though he wasnt due for release until the middle of next year as we are unable to have a lengthy conversation at smu i agree to visit him tonight and find out what caused this sudden reversal pm the governor of spring hill mr payne calls to have a private chat with mr new hes concerned about the attendant publicity should he agree to my transfer mr new does everything he can to allay mr paynes anxieties pointing out that once the tabloids had got their photograph the press havent been seen since but mr payne points out that it didnt stop a series of stories appearing from insiders and released prisoners which although pure fantasy doesnt help mr new tells him that i have settled in well shared a room with another inmate and am a model prisoner mr payne says hell make a decision fairly quickly i am not optimistic pm i have been invited to attend a meeting of the samaritans from boston and the listeners prisoners they meet about once a month in the hospital to exchange views and ideas they only need me to sign some books for their christmas bazaar one of the ladies asks me if she can bring in some more books for signing from the red cross bookshop of course i tell her pm theres a cowboy film on tv so the noise is bearable that is until the final shootout begins day wednesday november am the mystery of pottss early release has been solved a clerical error resulted in the judge thinking the case should be heard at oclock while potts was able to produce a piece of paper that requested his attendance in court at am the judge subsequently agreed to hear the appeal immediately and having considered the facts halved pottss sentence the governor called him out of work at the kitchen to pass on the news that he would be released this morning the first really happy prisoner ive seen in months am twelve new inductees due today and as always if you look carefully through the list youll find a story today its cormack he was released just over six weeks ago on a tag hdc and is back but only for eleven days strict rules are applied when you are granted an hdc you are released two months early with a tag placed around your ankle you supply an address at which you will reside during those two months you must have a home phone you will be confined to that abode during certain hours usually between seven in the evening and seven the following morning you also agree in writing not to take drugs or drink cormack is an unusual case because he didnt break any of these rules but yesterday morning he turned up at the local police station asking to be taken back into custody for the last eleven days because he was no longer welcome at the house he had designated for tagging wise man said mr simpson the probation officer who recommended his early release he kept to the letter of the law and wont suffer as a consequence if hed attempted to spend the last eleven days somewhere else he would have been arrested and returned to closed conditions wise man indeed noon leon the phd joins me for lunch hes the new orderly in stores which entitles him to eat early he thanks me for helping him to secure the job i discover over lunch that his doctorate is in meteorology he tells me that there are not many job opportunities in his field so once hes released hell be looking for a teaching position not easy when you have a prison record leon was sentenced to six months for driving without a licence so will serve only twelve weeks he tells me that this is not his biggest problem hes engaged to a girl who has just left birmingham university with a firstclass honours degree and like him wants to be a teacher so far so good but leon is currently facing racial prejudice in reverse she is a highclass brahmin and even before leon ended up in jail her parents didnt consider he was good enough for their daughter he explains that it is necessary to meet the father on three separate occasions before a daughters hand can be granted in wedlock and following that you still have to meet the mother all these ceremonies are conducted formally before he was sentenced leon had managed only one meeting with the father now he is being refused a second or third meeting and the mother is adamant that she will never allow him to enter the family home does his fiancée defy her parents and marry the man she loves or does she obey her father and break off all contact seven of the twelve weeks have already passed but leon points out that its not been easy to stay in touch while youre only allowed one visit a week and two phonecards pm mr berlyn deputy governor drops into smu to ask me if ive invited any outsiders to come and hear my talk tomorrow night to be honest id forgotten that id agreed to the librarians request to give a talk on writing a bestseller i tell mr berlyn that i havent invited anyone from inside or outside the prison he tells me that after reading about the event in the local paper members of the public have been calling in all day asking if they can attend can they i ask innocently he doesnt bother to reply day thursday november am the problem of whether i should remain at nsc and become hospital orderly or transfer to spring hill has come to a head doug vat fraud and current hospital orderly has been told by mr berlyn that if he applies for a job at exotic foods in boston who currently employ clive local council fraud and backgammon tutor he would be granted the status of outside worker which would take him out of the prison six days a week even allowing him to use his own car to go back and forth to work if doug is offered the job then i will only do one more week as smu orderly before passing on my responsibilities to carl i would then have to spend a week being trained by doug in the hospital routines so that i could take over the following monday am eight new inductees today and all seem relieved to be in an open prison until it comes to job allocation once again most prisoners end up on the farm resulting in a lot of glum faces as they leave the building few of them want to spend their day with pigs sheep and brussels sprouts remembering the temperature on the fens at this time of year is often below zero one of the prisoners a west indian called wesley used to warmer climes is so angry that he asks to be sent back to ashwell his old ccat prison he says hed be a lot happier locked up all day with a wall to protect him from the wind mr berlyn assures him that if he still feels that way in a months time hell happily send him back pm early supper is as i have explained one of the orderlies privileges so i was surprised to see a table occupied by six inmates id never seen before john lifer senior kitchen orderly tells me that theyre all muslims and as ramadan has just begun they can only eat between the hours of sunset and sunrise which means they cannot have breakfast or lunch with the other prisoners that doesnt explain why theyre having dinner on their own because its pitch black by five oclock on a november evening and ah says john good point but you see the large tray stacked with packets of milk and cornflakes thats tomorrows breakfast which theyll take back tonight and have in their rooms around five tomorrow morning if the other prisoners find out about this when they still have to come down to the dining room whatever the weather can you imagine how many complaints there would be or conversions to allah and the muslim faith i suggest pm i give my talk in the chapel on writing a bestseller the audience of twentysix is made up of prisoners and staff there are five ladies in the front row i do not recognize seventeen prisoners and four members of staff including mr berlyn mr gough and ms hampton the librarian i enjoyed delivering a speech for the first time in three months and although ive tackled the subject on numerous occasions in the past it felt quite fresh after such a long layoff and the questions were among the most searching i remember two pounds was added to my canteen account pm i call mary and foolishly leave my phonecard in the slot when i return three minutes later its disappeared lets face it i am in prison pm i pick up my letters from the unit office thirtytwo today including one from winston churchill enclosing a book called the duel which covers the eightyday struggle between his grandfather and hitler in among the other letters nearly all from members of the public is one from jimmy you may recall jimmy if youve read volume two of these diaries purgatory he was the goodlooking captain of football who had a threeyear sentence for selling cannabis hes been out for a month and has a job working on a building site its long hours and well paid but he admits despite all the sport and daily gym visits while he was in prison he had become soft after eighteen months of incarceration hes only just beginning to get back into the work ethic he assures me that he will never sell drugs again and as he did not take them in the first place he doesnt intend to start now i want to believe him he claims to have sorted out his love life hes living with the sexy one and has ditched the intellectual one as i now have an address and telephone number i will give him a call over the weekend pm after rollcall doug and i go through our strategy for a smooth changeover of jobs however if our plan is to work he suggests we must make the officers on the labour board think that its their idea day friday november am john murder senior kitchen orderly tells me over breakfast that two prisoners absconded last night he reminds me of an incident a couple of weeks ago when wendy sacked both of them from the kitchen for stealing chickens a few days later she gave them a reprieve only to sack them again the following day for stealing tins of tuna not to eat but to trade for cannabis they were then put on the farm where its quite hard to steal anything the pigs are too heavy and the brussels sprouts are not a trading commodity however last night the two prisoners were caught smoking cannabis in their room and placed on report they should have been up in front of the governor this morning its just possible that they might have got away with a warning but its more likely they would have been shipped back to the dreaded lincoln prison to sample all its victorian facilities they absconded before any decision could be taken pm i am writing in my room when carl knocks on the door the red cross and kpmg have made a joint statement following baroness nicholsons demand for an enquiry into what happened to the money raised for the kurds its the lead item on the midday news and i am delighted to have my name cleared pm i call alison at the office to find that mary is at the house of lords attending an energy resources meeting alison runs through the radio and television interview requests received by mary but shes decided only to issue this brief press statement press release lord archer and the simple truth campaign my family and i are delighted but not surprised that kpmgs investigation into the simple truth campaign spearheaded by jeffrey in has confirmed that no funds were misappropriated by him or anyone else we have known this from the outset we are very proud of the work jeffrey has done for kurdish relief the british red cross and many other good causes over the years we hope that baroness nicholson whose allegations have wasted much time and caused much unjustified distress will accept kpmgs findings mary archer pm lady thatcher has come out saying shes not surprised by the outcome of the enquiry which has dropped to the second item on the news following the death at the age of ninetytwo of dame mary whitehouse pm several of the officers are kind enough to comment on the outcome of the enquiry but ive also fallen to second item with them it seems that the two prisoners who absconded last night marley and tom were picked up early this morning by the police only six miles from the prison they were arrested charged and transferred to lincoln prison they will each have fortytwo days added to their sentence and will never be allowed to apply for a dcat status again as they are now categorized as an escape risk pm slipped to third item on live at five but as i have been exonerated its clearly not news if i had embezzled the million or any part of it i would have remained the lead item for a couple of days and the prison would have been swarming with photographers waiting for my transfer to lincoln not one photographer in sight pm a passing mention of the red cross statement on the ten oclock news i can see i shall have to abscond if i hope to make the headlines again pm irony eamon my former roommate is now able to move in with his friend shaun they have been offered the room vacated by the two men who absconded day saturday november am a torch is flashed in my eyes and i wake to see an officer checking if im in bed asleep and have not absconded im no longer asleep am i oversleep and only start writing just after seven am the broadsheets all report the findings of the kpmg report several point out that none of this would have arisen if baroness nicholson a former tory mp turned liberal peer hadnt made her complaint to sir john stevens in the first place i call mary to discuss our next move but theres no reply pm i have a visit today from doreen and henry miller doreen is a frontbench spokesman in the lords having previously been a minister under john major she brings me up to date with news of the upper house and tells me that the latest lords reform bill is detested on both sides of the chamber the bill ignores john wakehams excellent royal commission report and doesnt placate the labour party because not a large enough percentage of peers will be elected and doesnt placate the tory party because it removes all the remaining hereditary peers it cannot doreen assures me reach the statute book in its present form because it will meet with so much opposition in both houses the government dropped the bill in march when doreen and henry leave i dont know where the ninety minutes went pm i call mary but the phone just rings and rings pm watch england beat south africa and despite the irish hiccup begin to believe we might be the best rugby team in the world if im let out in time i will travel to australia to see the next world rugby cup pm i call mary still no reply pm after checking in for rollcall i join doug at the hospital to find four officers in the waiting room one of them mr harding is spattered with blood mr hocking the chief security officer is taking a photograph of him it turns out that mr hocking acting on a tipoff was informed that two inmates had disappeared into boston to pick up some booze so he and three other officers were lying in wait for them however when they were spotted returning the first prisoner grabbed mr hardings heavy torch and hit him over the head allowing his mate enough time to escape the first prisoner was wrestled to the ground and handcuffed and is now locked up in the segregation block the second has still to reappear although they know which prisoner it is even a cub reporter would realize theres an ongoing story here day sunday november am phone mary in cambridge no reply try london and only get the answering machine report to linda at the hospital dougs away on a town leave am to pm so im temporary keeper of the pills am during lunch i discover from one of the gym orderlies that they caught the second inmate who was trying to bring drink back into the prison hell be shipped out to nottingham this afternoon selfabuse is often one of the reasons they move offenders out so quickly its not unknown for a prisoner who is kept in lockup overnight to cut his wrists or even break an arm and then blame it on the officer who charged him the prisoner can then claim he was attacked first which means that he cant be moved until there has been a full enquiry mr hocking took several photographs of both prisoners which will make that course of action a little more difficult to explain noon the morning papers are predicting that ill soon be moved to spring hill so i can be nearer my family one or two of them even suggest that i should never have been sent to wayland or nsc in the first place simply on an allegation made by ms nicholson pm after the news i call mary again but theres still no reply day monday november am one of my duties at smu is the distribution of bin liners at eightthirty every morning two prisoners alf and rod check in for work and take away a bin liner each this morning alf demands ten i will allow you a few seconds to fathom out why because i couldnt i make a weekly order for provisions on a friday which is delivered on monday and always includes ten bin liners so alf is about to wipe out my entire stock in one day i cant believe hes trading them and they are far too big for the small wastepaper baskets in his room so i give in and ask why the sudden demand alf tells me that the directorgeneral of the prison service martin narey is visiting nsc on wednesday and the governor wants the place smartened up for his inspection fair enough however if mr narey is halfintelligent it wont take him long to realize that nsc is a neglected dump and short of money if they show him the north or south block hell wonder if we have any cleaners as he holds his nose and steps gingerly through the rubbish the visits room is a disgrace and extracurricular activities almost nonexistent however if he is only shown the canteen gym farm hospital and smu he will leave with a favourable impression im told the real purpose for mr nareys visit is to discuss how this prison will prepare for resettlement status once the new governor takes over in january am mr belford a south block officer pops in for a coffee he tells me that the inmate who photographed me in my room failed to sell the one picture he managed to snap because the negative came out so poorly am todays new inductees from nottingham include a pupil barrister abh a taxi driver overcharging and a farm labourer theft from his employer they all end up on the farm because the prison is overcrowded and there are no other jobs available pm canteen im in credit i earn a week and can supplement that with of my own money i purchase two phonecards three bottles of evian a packet of gillette razor blades a rollon deodorant and a toothbrush which cleans out my account im not in desperate need of all these items but its my way of making sure i cant buy any more chocolate as i need to lose the half stone ive put on since arriving at nsc pm i phone james at work he tells me that mary has been on the move for the past few days oundle london and cambridge and then back to london this afternoon i never phone mary on her mobile because my twopound phone card is gobbled up in moments i join doug in the hospital he is anticipating an interview with exotic foods on wednesday or thursday and hopes to begin work next monday a week earlier than originally planned he has already spoken to mr belford about a room on the south block in the nosmoking spur and to mr berlyn about his travel arrangements to boston however there is a fly in the ointment namely linda who feels doug should train his successor for a week before he leaves pm i call chris beetles gallery and wish chris luck for the opening of the illustrators show mary is hoping to drop in and see the picture ive selected for this years christmas card i ask him to pass on my love and tell her ill ring cambridge tomorrow evening for the first time in thirtyfive years i havent spoken to my wife in five days dont forget she cant call me day tuesday november am one incident of huge significance took place today in fact its a short story in its own right however as i write i dont yet know the ending but to begin halfway through do you recall leon the phd who joined us about a week ago he wants to marry an indian girl of high caste but her father and mother refuse to entertain the idea and that was before he was sent to prison driving without a licence six months well he reappeared at smu at three oclock this afternoon in what can only be described as an agitated state although wed had ten new inductees and a labour board this morning it was turning out to be a quiet afternoon i sat leon down in the kitchen while carl made him a cup of tea he was desperate to discover if he was going to be granted his hdc and be released early on a tag the officer who deals with hdc was in her office so i went upstairs to ask if she would see him ten minutes later leon reappears and says that a decision will be made tomorrow morning as to whether he can be released early well thats another problem solved says carl no it isnt says leon because if they dont grant my tag it will be a disaster leon doesnt strike me as the sort of man who would use the world disaster lightly so i enquire why he then briefs us on the latest complication in his love life his girlfriends parents have found out that she plans to marry leon as soon as hes released from prison on december shes even booked the register office she told him over the phone last night that her parents have not only forbidden the match but three men who she has never met have recently been selected as possible husbands and they will be flying in from india at the weekend she must then select one of them before she and her intended bridegroom fly back to calcutta to be married on december i now fully understand leons desperation i go in search of mr downs a senior officer who is a shrewd and caring man i find him in the officers room going over tomorrows itinerary for the directorgenerals visit i brief mr downs and he agrees to see leon immediately after their meeting leon tells us that mr downs was most sympathetic and will report his worries direct to the governor he has asked to see leon again at eight oclock tomorrow morning one hour before the board meet to decide if he will be granted a tag i had assumed that there would be nothing more to tell you until the outcome of that meeting however pm i finally catch up with mary and forty minutes later have used up both my phonecards i go over to the hospital to have a bath but before doing so tell doug about leon i fail to reach the bathroom because he tells me he can remember a case where special dispensation was granted to allow an inmate to be married in the prison chapel why dont you ask the vicar about it he suggests because by then it will be too late i tell doug reminding him of the timetable of the board meeting at nine oclock tomorrow morning and the three gentlemen from india arriving in sheffield over the weekend but the rev derek johnson is over at the chapel right now says doug its the prison clergys monthly meeting i leave doug and walk quickly over to the chapel the orderly john ostrich fraud tells me that the vicar has just left but if i run to the gate i might still catch him at sixtyone im past running fast but i do jog and hope that as the vicar is even older than i am ill make it before hes driven off when i arrive at the gate his car is at the barrier waiting to be let out i wave frantically he parks the car and joins me in the gatehouse where i tell him the whole story derek listens with immense sympathy and says that he can in certain circumstances marry the couple in the prison chapel and he feels confident that the governor would agree given the circumstances he also adds that if the young lady needed to be put up overnight he and mrs johnson could supply a room for her i thank the vicar and return to the north block in search of leon i find him in his room and impart my latest piece of news hes delighted and tells me that hes spoken to his fiancée again and shes already arranged for the wedding to be held in a local register office as long as hes released early if he isnt we have at least come up with an alternative solution leon is thanking me profusely when i hear my name over the tannoy archer to report to the south block unit office immediately i leave leon to jog over to the south block and arrive at the unit office at one minute to nine i had for the first time forgotten to check in for my eightfifteen rollcall if id arrived at one minute past nine i would have been put on report and have lost my chance of being enhanced for another eight weeks mr belford the duty officer who knows nothing of my nocturnal efforts bursts out laughing i was so much looking forward to putting you on report jeffrey he says but i was pretty sure you would come up with a good excuse as to what you were doing at eightfifteen i was with the vicar i tell him day wednesday november am leon is sitting in the waiting room at smu ready for his hdc ajudication with mr berlyn deputy governor and mr simpson resident probation officer leon called his fiancée again last night the three suitors have arrived from india and once sunita has made her choice and if she doesnt her parents will decide for her she will then be flown back to india to meet the mans parents the couple will then return to england to prepare for a wedding on december the day before leon will be released sunitas plan is to take only hand luggage on the flight so that when she returns she will walk straight through customs while her parents wait to pick up their luggage from the baggage hall leons brother will be waiting in the arrivals hall and drive her straight to birmingham where she and leon will be married later that day if the board grants leon his tagging he will leave nsc at eight oclock on the saturday and drive straight to birmingham and they will be man and wife before the family can work out where shes disappeared everything is riding on the result of leons interview with the board in a few minutes time mr berlyn calls for leon at teneleven and i escort him up to the interview room carl and i run around the kitchen pretending to be busy smu is on full alert because martin narey the directorgeneral arrived a few minutes ago am leon appears almost in tears the board have turned down his application i fear he may abscond tonight and take the law into his own hands am the rev derek johnson drops in to tell us that hes met with the governor who does not have the authority to sanction a wedding in the chapel a prisoner must have at least nine months to serve before he can apply for such a privilege he adds that no one has ever come across such an unusual set of circumstances leon now cant do anything until seven oclock this evening when hes arranged to phone his fiancée on her mobile before he leaves us he adds two more pieces of information first his father an extremely wealthy man has offered a dowry of to sunitas family leons mother is a brahmini but because his father is irish their son is unacceptable one can only wonder how much the three suitors from india are offering as a dowry for this girl they have yet to meet second sunitas sister was subjected to the same drama two years ago and is now going through a messy divorce carl and i agree to meet in leons room at pm and plan his next move am i leave for lunch a few minutes before the directorgeneral is due to arrive at smu by the time ive finished my cauliflower cheese and gone back to the south block to make a couple of phone calls mr narey has moved on to visit the lifers quarters i return to work at one oclock pm i drop in to see doug who confirms that exotic foods have agreed to interview him on friday morning and he is hoping to begin work with them on monday week so i could become hospital orderly in two weeks time pm leon opens the door of his room to greet us with a warm smile sunita has escaped from sheffield and has driven down to portsmouth to stay with his brother and sisterinlaw she has purchased a new phone as she is worried that her parents will hire a detective to trace her through the mobile leon bought for her leon removes a thick bundle of letters from his shelf she writes twice a day he says i am delighted by the news but suggest to carl after weve left that it wont take a particularly bright private detective to work out sunita might be staying with leons brother i have a feeling this saga is not yet over day thursday november i have mentioned the worthwhile role played by the samaritans who train selected prisoners as listeners at nsc they have taken this trust one stage further and set aside a room where a preprogrammed mobile phone has been provided for inmates who need to call the samaritans this service has become very popular as more and more prisoners claim to be in need of succour from the samaritans so much so that mr new recently became suspicious after one particularly long call which was interspersed with laughter he confiscated the phone and quickly discovered what the inmates had been up to they had been removing the sim card from inside the phone and replacing it with one of their own that had been smuggled in as of today there will no longer be a dedicated room for the samaritans or a mobile phone am this will be my last labour board if i am to join doug in the hospital next week i therefore suggest to carl that he should take charge as if i wasnt there during the rest of the morning whenever a prisoner calls in with some problem carl handles it my only worry is that as carl has another fifteen months to serve before hell be eligible for a tag he may become bored long before his sentence is up pm mr new calls spring hill to ask mr payne why my transfer is taking so long hes told that spring hill is about to face a public enquiry as a consequence of something that happened before he became governor mr payne fears that the press will be swarming all over the place and although he is quite willing to have me he cant let me know his decision for at least another couple of weeks i press mr new for the details of what could possibly cause so much public interest but he refuses to discuss it i wonder if its simply a ploy to keep me from being transferred no suggestion of a scandal at spring hill appeared in the national press during the next twelve months pm i visit leon in the north block he has just come off the phone to his fiancée still safely ensconced in portsmouth with leons brother sunitas three indian suitors have returned home accompanied by her mother leaving her father in bradford sunita has rung her father who has agreed to meet leon but he still doesnt know that leon is in jail and wont be released for another three weeks day friday november am the best laid plans of mice and convicts i am making tea for mr simpson at smu when the duty officer asks me to report to the hospital for a suicide watch doug has gone to boston for his exotic foods interview so they are short of an orderly suicide watch is quite common in prison and this is the second ive covered in three weeks linda and gail have to judge whether the prisoner is genuinely considering taking his own life or simply looking for tea and sympathy and a chance to sit and watch television i turn up at the hospital a few minutes later to find my charge is a man of about fortyfive squat thick set covered in tattoos with several teeth missing david is serving a sixyear sentence for gbh what puzzles me is that he is due to be released on january so he only has a few more weeks of his sentence to complete all im expected to do is to keep an eye on him while gail gets on with her other duties which today include taking care of a prisoner who was injured after being thrown through a window at his previous jail davids first request is for a glass of water which is no problem he then disappears into the lavatory and doesnt reappear again for some time when he requests another glass of water no sooner has he gulped that down than the vicar arrives he sits down next to david and asks if he can help i ask david if he wants me to leave no he says but he would like another glass of water he then tells the vicar about the demons that visit him during the night insisting that he must commit more crimes and as he wants to go straight he doesnt know what to do are you a practising member of any faith asks the reverend yeah replies david i believe in god and life after death but ive never been sure which religion would be best for me a long and thoughtful discussion follows after which david decides hes church of england the only thing of interest that comes out of the talk is that david wants to return to nottingham jail because he feels safer from the demons there and more importantly they have a fulltime psychiatrist who understands his problem this also puzzles me we have our own psychiatrist val who is on duty at smu this morning why would anyone want to leave nsc to return to a hellhole like nottingham once the vicar has left david disappears back into the lavatory and after another long period of time returns and requests another glass of water gail pops her head round the door to inform david that the governor has decided he can return to nottingham so he should go back to his room and pack his belongings david looks happy for the first time he drains the glass of water and gets up to leave are you also puzzled noon over lunch dave lifer who after eighteen years has seen it all tells me what david was really up to last night david was rumoured to be high on heroin and feared having to take an mdt today had he failed that test he would have had twentyeight days added to his sentence and then been sent back to nottingham so we were treated to his little performance with the demons drinking gallons of water can flush heroin out of the system in twentyfour hours and although davids still off to nottingham he avoided the added twentyeight days im so dim i should have spotted it pm mr lewis the governing governor has received a letter from the shadow home secretary sir brian mawhinney requesting to visit me pm disaster doug returns from his interview with exotic foods and tells me that they dont need him to start work until the middle of january as he will be eligible for resettlement in february and able to return to work with his own company why should he bother so hes decided to stay on as hospital orderly for the next couple of months my only hope now is the governor of spring hill day saturday december am i lie awake for hours plotting although im currently revising the sixth draft of sons of fortune ive come up with a new idea for the ending which will require some medical research i will have to seek advice from dr walling am its just been officially announced that mr lewis will retire as governing governor on january i go over to the unit office and pick up a labour board change of job application form if im not going to be hospital orderly ive decided to apply for his job see opposite noon doug tells me that hes going to try another ploy to get outside work he has a friend in march who runs a small haulage company three lorries who will offer him a job as a driver the only problem is that he doesnt work out of boston which is one of the current specifications for anyone who wishes to take up outside employment however dougs wife wendy will meet the potential employer today and get him to send a fax offering doug a job of driving loads from boston back to march we will have to wait and see if mr berlyn will sanction this i refuse to get excited pm i walk down to the football field and watch nsc play witherton we lose so theres not a lot more to report other than it was very cold standing on the touch line the wind was blowing in off the next landmass to the east which happens to be russia pm i sit in my room reading this week an excellent journal if you want an overall view of the weeks events it gives me a chance to bring myself up to date with the situation in afghanistan america and even nsc under the heading a bad week it seems that a jeffrey archer lookalike is complaining about being regularly stopped by the police to make sure i havent escaped its most unfair he protests its ruined my life the paper felt his protests would have been more convincing if he hadnt travelled down to nsc accompanied by a tabloid to have his photograph taken outside the prison pm i visit leon in his room on the north block his fiancée has told her father that he is in norway on business and wont be returning to england until december the day hes released from prison day sunday december am leons fiancée is visiting him today and theyll use the ninety minutes to plan their wedding am i join doug at the hospital to read the morning papers the people devote half a page to telling their readers that i am distraught because a prisoner has stolen my diary and ill have to start again i wouldnt be distraught after days and over words id be suicidal pm doug has just come off the phone with his wife and tells me that his friend is going to place an advertisement in the boston target this wednesday stating that he needs a driver to transport goods from boston to march doug will apply for the job and a fax will then be sent to mr berlyn the same day offering doug an interview if mr berlyn agrees doug will be offered the position the following day day monday december am mr new comes in cursing it seems the prison is overcrowded and there are applicants from nottingham lincoln wayland birmingham and leicester who will have to be turned away because every bed is occupied apparently its all my fault this would not be a problem for spring hill because they always have a long waiting list and can be very selective at nsc it now means that if any inmate even bends the rules hell be sent back to the prison he came from as three inmates discovered to their cost last week this was not the case when there were dozens of empty beds am i see leon walking back from the gatehouse to the stores where he works and leave the office to have a word with him yesterdays visit went well but i have a feeling he adds theres something she isnt telling me i press him as to what this might be but he says he doesnt know or has he become wary about how much of his story will appear in this diary he then asks me to change all the names i agree and have done so pm doug gives me some good news mrs tempest principal officer in charge of resettlement has assured him that if he gets an interview with another haulage company she will accompany him assuming they fulfil all the usual police and prison criteria if they then offer him a job she will recommend he starts immediately and by that she means next monday its becoming clear to me that there are several officers not all who are determined that nsc will be given resettlement status and not just remain a dcat open prison should the home office agree to this then several of the inmates will be allowed out during the day on csv work and eventually progress to fulltime jobs its clear that doug is a test case because hes an obvious candidate for outside work and if they can get him started the floodgates might well open and this prisons future would no longer be in doubt so suddenly my fortunes could be reversed once again i envy the reader who can simply turn the pages to discover what happens next in my life pm mr simpson senior probation officer has completed his interviews with the three inmates who are on sentence planning he comes down to the kitchen for a glass of water over the past six weeks ive come to know graham simpson quite well despite the fact that hes fairly reserved i suppose it goes with the territory he is a consummate professional and wouldnt dream of discussing another prisoner however good or bad their record but he will answer general questions on the penal system and after thirty years in the profession he has views that are worth listening to i suspect that the majority of people reading this diary would in the case of lifers lock them up and throw away the key and in some cases hang them however all murderers are sentenced to ninetynine years but the judge will then set a tariff that can range from eight years to life at nsc we have an inmate who is serving his thirtysecond year in jail there are over prisoners in the uk doing life sentences of whom only a tiny percentage ever reach a dcat open prison there are twentytwo lifers currently at nsc after being sentenced they begin their life in an acat and progress through to b and c and finally arrive at a dcat with the expectation of release at nsc of the twentytwo resident lifers these tariffs are set from twelve years to her majestys pleasure and mr simpson confirms that although some will become eligible for release they will never make it the home office simply wont take the risk mr simpson explains that its his responsibility to assess which of these prisoners should be considered for release but he will always err on the side of caution because however many successes you have on the out it only takes one failure to hit the front pages mr simpson admits to one such failure a man with no previous convictions who had until murdering his unfaithful wife led a perfectly normal existence he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a tariff of twelve years once in prison his model behaviour saw him progress quickly by lifers standards from a to b to c to nsc in under eight years while at nsc his record remained unblemished until he fell in love with a member of staff who had to resign her position and look for another job after twelve years he was released and they were married shortly afterwards the man found a good job and settled down into the community three years later on the anniversary of his first wifes murder he killed his new spouse and then took his own life mr simpson sighs there was nothing to suggest this would occur and if hed not been released no lifer ever would be the majority will never be a danger to the public as most murders are oneoff crimes and firsttime offences per cent of those released never commit another crime it is possible for a lifer to be released after eight years but the vast majority serve over twenty and some never leave prison other than in a coffin day tuesday december am mr clarke has been sacked and put on outside duties while carl has been sent back to the south block and all because of a dishonest prison officer ill explain mr clarke is the cleaner at smu and because hes sixtyseven years old he only works mornings it keeps him out of the cold and gives him something to do rather than sit around in his room all day you will all know from past reports that he carried out the job with a great deal of pride carl whom ive been training to take over from me will now only return to smu when and if i become the hospital orderly and why an officer has been talking to the press to supplement his income and among the things hes told them is that i have my own cleaner and a personal assistant the governor has found it necessary to suspend the two jobs while an enquiry takes place mr new is livid not so much about carl but because mr clarke has suffered as a direct result of an officers unprofessional conduct the detailed information given to the press has enabled the investigation to narrow the suspects down to two officers the guessing game in the prison is which two unfair because it allows prisoners to put any officer they dont like in the frame am labour board carl is officially demoted to cleaner but assured by mr berlyn that when my job becomes available he will take over mr clarke is now sweeping up leaves in the yard remember its december noon over lunch doug tells me that mrs tempest has suggested that his prospective employer come to the prison where his credentials will be carefully checked and hell be questioned as to the job description which entails driving a lorry from boston to birmingham to march and back every day if all goes to plan doug will be able to begin work on monday morning ill go to the hospital as orderly carl will move back into smu and if the prison shows an ounce of common sense mr clarke will be reinstated as parttime cleaner pm i spend the afternoon at smu on my own there are three prisoners up in front of the sentence planning board and another who needs advice on hdc tagging as he can neither read nor write i fill in all the forms for him mr new arrives looking frustrated another crisis has arisen over prison beds twelve of the rooms on the south block have no doors he gives an order that they must be fitted immediately which in prison terms means next monday at the earliest pm im called over the tannoy to report to reception it can only be mr daff i arrive in front of the regimental sergeant major to find hes on his own mr daff tells me that he has decided to take early retirement because he doesnt like all the changes that are taking place in the prison service far too fuckin soft he mutters under his breath he adds that because im to be the next hospital orderly ill be allowed some of my personal belongings he opens my box and lets me remove a tracksuit a blanket two pillowcases a tablecloth and a dictionary he fills in the necessary pink form and i sign for them he then winks as he places them all in a black plastic bin liner i depart with my swag pm i leave the hospital return to my room and settle down to read the diving bell and the butterfly which has been recommended by my son william day wednesday december am the punishment should fit the crime according to mr w s gilbert and i have no quarrel with that however shouldnt all inmates be treated equally whatever prison they are incarcerated which brings me onto the subject of wages the practice at nsc is just plain stupid and more important unfair because it discriminates in such a way as to be inexplicable to anyone i have only become fully aware of the disparity because of my twiceweekly contact with the labour board who not only arbitrarily allocate the jobs but also decide on the wages for example as orderly to the sentence management unit i am paid a week the library orderlies receive the gym orderlies reception orderlies education orderlies and the chapel orderly however a farm worker who starts at eight in the morning and is out in the cold all day gets and a cleaner whereas the prison barber who only works from six to eight every evening gets a week its no different in any other prison but no one seems to give a damn seven prisoners come through reception today two of them have been sent to nsc with only eleven and nine days left to serve why when moving to a new prison is a disorientating frightening and unpleasant experience because the last prison pays the expense of discharging a prisoner why not appoint to the prison board carefully selected prisoners who could tell the home office one or two home truths here at nsc there are two inmates with phds seven with bas and several with professional qualifications all of whom are as bright as any officer ive met with the exception of mr gough who is happy to discus sisley vanburgh and john quincy adams rather than the latest prison regulations pm carl takes over from me at smu because i have a theatre visit by that i mean that the two people who are coming to see me today are the theatre director david gilmore and the producer lee menzies david gilmore daisy pulls it off is just back from australia where hes been directing grease and lee is about to put on the island at the old vic currently im an investor angel with both of them grease which is on tour in the uk has already not only returned my capital investment but also shown a per cent profit this is not the norm its more often the other way round i have per cent of the island which hasnt yet opened david ian who had to cancel his visit at the last minute has several shows in production in which i have a share the king and i london and tour chicago tour grease tour and hes now talking about a production of the successful broadway musical the producers once david and lee have brought me up to date on everything thats happening in the theatre world we turn to a subject on which i feel they will be able to advise me mr daff shouts out in his best sergeant major voice that its time for visitors to leave where did the time go pm doug tells me that his wife visited him today she confirmed that he will be offered the haulage job and therefore i can become hospital orderly next week im going to have to decide which course to take should spring hill offer me a transfer pm life may be awful but after watching the ten oclock news and seeing the conditions in the greek jail where theyve locked up eleven british plane spotters i count my blessings day thursday december pm after a day of no murders no escapes no one shipped out i meet up with doug for supper we sit at a corner table and he brings me up to date on his interview for a job having applied to the advertisement in the boston target doug was interviewed in the presence of ms tempest he was offered the job and begins work on monday as a lorry driver he will ferry a load of steel coils from boston to birmingham to march before returning to boston he must then report back to the prison by seven oclock the job will be for six days a week and hell be paid an hour just to recap doug is doing a fourandahalfyear sentence for avoiding paying vat on imported goods to the value of several millions hes entitled after serving a quarter of his sentence if hes been a model prisoner and he has to seek outside employment this is all part of the resettlement programme enjoyed only by prisoners who have reached dcat status it works out well for everyone nsc is getting prisoners out to work and in doug they have someone who wont be a problem or break any rules although he has a psv licence he hasnt driven a lorry for several years and says it will be like starting all over again still its better than being cooped up inside a prison all day day friday december am im asked to report to sister in the hospital for an interview as i walk across from smu i have a moments anxiety as i wonder if linda is considering someone else for hospital orderly these fears are assuaged by her opening comment when she says how delighted she is that i will be joining her lindas only worry is that i am keeping a diary she stresses the confidentiality of prisoners medical records i agree to abide by this without reservation am mr new confirms that mr clarke theft has been reinstated as smu cleaner what a difference that will make carl can now concentrate on the real job of assisting the officers and prisoners and not have to worry whether the dustbins have been emptied pm do you recall the two prisoners who were caught returning from boston laden with alcohol one attacked an officer with a torch so his friends could escape the escapee who managed to slip back to his room and thanks to a change of clothes supplied by a friend got away with it because it wasnt possible to prove hed ever been absent today the same prisoner was found to have a rollon deodorant in his room not sold at the canteen he was shipped out to a bcat in liverpool this afternoon pm i spend an hour signing toad christmas cards pm doug is having second thoughts about giving up his job the thought of driving eight hours a day for six days a week isnt looking quite so attractive pm i return to my room and finish the diving bell and the butterfly by the late jean dominique bauby it is as my son suggested quite brilliant the author had a massive stroke and was left paralysed and speechless only able to move one eyelid and with that eyelid he mastered a letter code and dictated the book makes my problems seem pretty insignificant day saturday december am normally the weekends are a bore but after a couple of hours editing sons of fortune i start moving my few worldly goods across to the hospital although im not moving in officially until tomorrow doug allows me to store some possessions under one of the hospital beds pm among todays letters are ones from rosemary leach and stephanie cole in reply to my fan mail following their performances in back home miss leach in a handwritten letter fears she may have overacted as the new in thing is blandness and understatement miss cole thought her own performance was a little too sentimental i admire them for being so critical of themselves i receive seventytwo christmas cards today which lifts my spirits greatly the officers have begun a book on how many cards ill receive from the public mr hart is down for mr new and mr downs i select three to be put on the ledge by my bed a landscape by that magnificent scottish artist joseph farqueson a giles cartoon of grandma and a bellini painting of the virgin mother pm highlight of my day is a visit from mary james and alison who between them bring me up to date on all matters personal office and legal william returns from america next week and along with mary and james will come to see me on christmas eve mary will then fly off to kenya and attend my nephews wedding mary and i have always wanted to go on safari and see the big cats not this year day sunday december am doug has an away day with his family in march so i spend the morning covering for him at the hospital pm a visit from two conservative front bench spokesmen patrick mcloughlin mp the partys deputy chief whip in the commons and simon burns mp the number two under liam fox who covers the health portfolio theyve been loyal friends over many years i canvassed for both of them before they entered the house patrick in a famous byelection after matthew parris left the commons which he won by votes and simon who took over norman st john stevass seat in chelmsford west where the liberals had lowered normans majority from in to in if you felt the conservatives might not be returned to power for fifteen years would you look for another job i ask no they both reply in unison in any case simon adds im not qualified to do anything else patrick nods his agreement im not sure if hes agreeing that simon couldnt do anything else or that he falls into the same category we have a frank discussion about ids both are pleased that he has managed to downgrade the debate on europe within the party and concentrate on the health service education and the social services they accept that blair is having a good war afghanistan and although the disagreements with brown are real the british people dont seem to be that interested patrick feels that we could be back in power the election after next simon is not so optimistic but he adds if brown takes over from blair we could win the next election what if someone takes over from ids i ask neither replies when they leave i realize how much i miss the house and all things political pm this is my last night on the south block despite a football match blaring from next door i sleep soundly day monday december am i wake early so write for a couple of hours am pack up my final bits and pieces and go across to the hospital to join doug whos carrying out the same exercise in reverse am i will describe my new daily routine before i tell you anything about my work at the hospital am rise write until am am bath and

minister to patients until around tenthirty depending on number am sick parade until noon collecting pills etc lunch pm phone alison at the office pm write pm prisoners arrive from birmingham leicester wayland lincoln or bedford all ccats to join us at nsc they first go to reception to register after that their next port of call is the hospital where sister signs them in and checks their medical records you rarely get transferred to another prison if youre ill i check their blood pressure their urine sample for diabetes not drugs that is carried out in a separate building later their height and weight and pass this information onto sister so that it can be checked against their medical records pm sick parade linda who began work at am leaves at pm pm supper if anyone falls ill at night the duty officer can open up the surgery and dispense medication although most are told they can wait until sick parade the following day if its serious theyre taken off to pilgrim hospital in boston by taxi which is fifteen minutes away pm write for a couple of hours pm call mary andor james and will pm read or watch television tonight catherine the great im joined by doug and clive im allowed to have two other inmates in the hospital between and pm pm after watching the news i settle down in a bed five inches wider than the one in my room on the south block and fall into a deep sleep it is as is suggested by the title of this book compared with belmarsh and wayland heaven day tuesday december am i am just about getting the hang of my daily routine its far more demanding than the work i carried out at smu i hope that linda will be willing to teach me first aid and more importantly give me a greater insight into the drugs problem in prisons am im standing by the door waiting for linda to arrive i prepare her a coffee one sweetener and a teaspoonful of milk in her pig mug the five doctors all have their own mugs linda has worked in the prison service for over ten years she has three grownup children two sons and a daughter she was married to a nurse tutor terry who tragically died of skin cancer a couple of years ago at the age of fiftythree she works long hours and the prisoners look on her much as i viewed my prepschool matron a combination of mother nurse and confidante she has no time for shirkers but couldnt be more sympathetic if you are genuinely ill am after sick parade i carry out my rounds to the different parts of the prison to let staff know who will be off work today before going to breakfast i ask john lifer what meat is in the sausage its always beef he replies because there are so many muslims in prisons nowadays they never serve pork sausages am the hospital has a visit from a man called alan whos come to conduct a course on drug and alcohol abuse he moves from prison to prison advising and helping anyone who seeks his counsel there are such officers posted around the country paid for by the taxpayer out of the nhs and the home office budgets alan is saddened by how few prisoners take advantage of the service he offers in bradford alone he estimates that per cent of inmates below the age of thirty are on drugs and another per cent are addicted to alcohol he shows me the reams of home office forms to be filled in every time he sees a prisoner by the end of the morning only two inmates out of have bothered to turn up and see him am i have a special visit from sir brian mawhinney mp an old friend whose constituency is about twenty miles south of nsc as a former cabinet minister and shadow home secretary he has many questions about prisons and as i have not entered the palace of westminster for the past six months there are questions im equally keen for him to answer brian stays for an hour and after we stop going over past triumphs we discuss present disasters he fears that the simon burns scenario is realistic a long time in the wilderness for the conservatives but events dear boy events are still our biggest hope brian runs over time and i miss lunch no complaints pm mr hart passes on a message from my solicitors that my appeal papers have not been lodged at court panic i passed them over to the security officer six weeks ago mr hart calls mr hocking who confirms that they were sent out on october whos to blame pm canteen now that im enhanced i have an extra of my own money added to my account each week with my hospital orderly pay of it adds up to a week so i can now enjoy cussons soap sr toothpaste head and shoulders shampoo and even the occasional packet of mcvities chocolate biscuits pm i attend a rock concert tonight performed by the cons and pros the standard is high particularly gordon gbh on the guitar who sadly for the band will be released tomorrow pm doug returns from his second day at work he has driven to birmingham and northampton in one day he is exhausted and fed up with his roommate who leaves the radio on all night im in bed asleep by tenthirty you will discover the relevance of this tomorrow day wednesday december am the night security officer opens my door and shines his torch in my eyes i dont get back to sleep for over an hour am he does it again so i get up and start writing am on my journey around the prison this morning handing out offwork slips i have to drop into the farm its freezing and a lot of the inmates are claiming to have colds i bump into the farm manager mr donnelly a charming man who i came to know from my days at the smu when he sat on the labour board he introduces me to blossom a beautiful creature blossom weighs in at twentysix stone and has a broken nose and four stubby fat hairy legs she is lucky to be alive blossom is the prisoners favourite pig so when her turn came for slaughter the inmates hid her in a haystack when mr donnelly was unable to find blossom that morning she was granted a weeks reprieve blossom reappeared the next day but mysteriously disappeared again when the lorry turned up the following week once again mr donnelly searched for her and once again he failed to find her the inmates knew that it couldnt be long before blossoms hiding place was discovered so they put in an application to the governor to buy her so that she could spend the rest of her days at nsc in peace mr donnelly was so moved by the prisoners concern that he lifted the death penalty and allowed blossom to retire the happy pet now roams around the farm behaving literally like a pig in clover see below blossom and his friend blossom am on my way back to the hospital after breakfast i sense something different and realize that peter lifer arson is not on the road sweeping the leaves as he does every morning a security officer explains that peter is out on a town leave in boston the first occasion hes left prison in thirtyone years ill try to have a word with him as soon as he returns so that i can capture his first impressions of freedom am the new inductees report to the doctor for their medical checkup i now feel im settling into a routine as hospital orderly noon call mary to assure her that the courts have now located my papers and to wish her luck with our christmas party tomorrow night she will also be attending denis and margaret thatchers fiftieth wedding anniversary at the east india club earlier in the evening she promises to call me and let me know how they both went no i remind her i can only call you pm an announcement over the tannoy instructs me to report to reception i arrive to be told by sergeant major daff that i have been sent two christmas cakes one from mrs gerald scarfe better known as jane asher with a card from which i reproduce only the final sentence im baking you a cake for christmas with a hacksaw and file inside see you soon love jane and one from a ladies group in middleton as no prisoner is allowed to receive any foodstuffs in case they contain alcohol or drugs mr daff agrees that one can go to the local retirement home and the other to the special needs children so its all right for the children to be stoned out of their minds and the oldage pensioners to be drugged up to the eyeballs but not me its home office regulations explains mr daff pm i spot peter lifer arson coming up the drive he looks in a bit of a daze so i invite him to join me in the hospital for coffee and biscuits we chat for nearly an hour the biggest shock for peter on leaving prison for the first time in over thirty years was the number of coffin dodgers old people that were on the streets of boston doing their christmas shopping in the life expectancy for a man was sixtyeight years and for a woman seventythree its now seventysix and eightyone respectively peter also considered many of the young women dressed very tarty but he did admit that he couldnt stop staring at them peter who is six foot four inches tall and weighs eighteen stone was surprised that he no longer stands out in a crowd as he would have done thirtyone years ago when he visited safeways supermarket it was the first time hed seen a trolley in the past he had only been served at a counter and used a shopping basket and as for money he knows of course about decimalization but when he last purchased something from a shop there were pennies in a pound halfcrowns ten shilling notes and the guinea was still of blessed memory peter was totally baffled by pelican crossings and was frightened to walk across one however the experience he most disliked was having to use a changing room to try on clothes behind a curtain while members of the public walked past him particularly female assistants who didnt mind drawing back the curtain to see how he was getting on he was amazed that he could try on a shirt and then not have to purchase it i suspect that the process of rehabilitation accompanied town visits six in all unaccompanied town visits weekend home visits week visits csv work followed by a job in the community will take him at least another three to four years by which time peter will qualify for his oldage pension i can only wonder if he will ever rejoin the real world and not simply be moved from one institution to another pm i listen to the ten oclock news roy whiting has been given life imprisonment for the murder of sarah payne once the sentence has been passed we discover that whiting had already been convicted some years ago for abducting a child and sexually abusing a minor his sentence on that occasion four years day thursday december am orderlies are the prisons school prefects theyre given their jobs because they can be trusted in return theyre expected to work for these privileges such as eating together in a small group and in my case having a single room with a television there are over a dozen orderlies in all yesterday both reception orderlies were sacked leaving two much soughtafter vacancies martin the senior of the two reception orderlies was due to be discharged this morning two months early on tag hcd the only restriction was that he must remain in his place of residence between the hours of pm and am martin had already completed the paper chase which had to be carried out the day before release unfortunately before departing this morning he decided to take with him a brandnew prisonissue denim top and jeans and several shirts a blue and white striped prison shirt apparently sells at around a hundred pounds on the outside especially if it has the letters nsc on the pocket when the theft was discovered he was immediately sacked and more sadly so was the other orderly barry whose only crime was that he wouldnt grass on martin its rough justice when the only way to keep your job is to grass on your mate when you know what the consequences will be for that person not to mention how the other inmates will treat you in the future we will find out the punishment tomorrow when both men will be up in front of the governor pm i am disappointed to receive a letter from william payne the governor of spring hill turning down my application for transfer his reasons for rejecting me are shown in his letter reproduced here see opposite i feel i should point out that the last five inmates from nsc who have applied to spring hill have all been accepted its not worth appealing because ive long given up expecting any justice whenever the home office is involved pm six new inductees four on short sentences ranging from three weeks to nine months and two lifers who for the past sixteen years have been banged up for twentytwo hours a day they are walking around the perimeters of the prison no walls in a daze and cant understand why theyre not being ordered back to their cells linda tells me that lifers often report at the end of the first week with footsores and colds and take far longer to adapt to open conditions one of the shorttermers from nottingham whos been placed in the nosmoking spur on the south block that has mostly more mature csv workers who only return to the prison at night tells me with a wry smile that he couldnt sleep last night because it was so quiet pm a visit from mr hocking im no longer to dispose of personal papers letters envelopes or notes in the dustbin outside the hospital as a prisoner was caught rifling through the contents last night in future i must hand them to a security officer who will shred them nsc does not want to repeat the belmarsh debacle where an officer stole a chapter of my book and tried to sell it to the sun pm i sit in my palace and hold court with doug clive and carl or at least thats how it feels after belmarsh and wayland in london mary is hosting our christmas party day friday december am today is judgment day three prisoners are up in front of the governor inmates take a morbid interest in the outcome of any adjudication as its a yardstick for discovering what they can hope to get away with martin the reception orderly who pleaded guilty to attempting to steal prison clothes on the day he was due to be released has his tagging privileges removed and seven days added to his sentence so for the sake of a pair of jeans and a few prison shirts martin will remain at nsc until a couple of weeks before easter rather than spending christmas at home with his wife and family added to this the sixtyseven days will not be spent in the warmth of reception as an orderly but on the farm in the deep midwinter cleaning out the pig pens barry is next up his crime was not grassing on martin although martin stated clearly at the adjudication that barry was not party to the offence he also loses his orderly job and returns to the farm as a shepherd for the governor to expect him to grass on his friend i even doubt if they were friends seems to me a little rough finding competent replacements will not be easy the rumour is that peter lifer just had his first day out after thirtyone years has been offered the job as the next step in his rehabilitation peter tells me that he doesnt want to be an orderly and is happy to continue sweeping up leaves the third prisoner in front of the governor this morning is ali a man serving three months for theft ali has refused to work on the farm and locked himself in his room for this act of defiance he has four days added to his sentence this may not sound excessive and in normal circumstances i dont think he could complain as its the statutory sentence for refusing to work however the four days are christmas eve christmas day boxing day and december ali arrives in the hospital moments after the adjudication and bursts into tears the governor decides that i should be punished as well because linda puts me in charge of him its tenforty and the governor wants ali back on the farm by this afternoon fortunately england are playing india its the second day of the test and ali knows his cricket we settle down in the hospital ward to watch the final session of the day sachin tendulkar is at the crease so ali stops crying by lunchtime end of play in madras tendulkar has scored and alis tears have turned to smiles hes back on the farm at one oclock pm seven new prisoners in from nottingham today and as we only released three this morning our numbers reach our capacity is the weekly turnover at nsc is about per cent and im told it always peaks at this time of year im also informed by one of the lifers that there are more absconders over christmas many of whom give themselves up on boxing day evening the governors attitude is simple if they return to the gate and apologize they have twentyeight days added to their sentence if they wait until theyre picked up by the police then in addition to the added twentyeight days theyre shipped out to a bcat the following morning pm linda asks me to take two blood samples down to the gate so they can be sent to pilgrim hospital on the threehundredyard walk i become distracted by a new idea for how the twins discover their identity in sons of fortune when i arrive at the gate the blood samples are no longer in the plastic packet and must have fallen out en route i run for the first time in weeks i dont want to lose my job and end up working on the farm i see jim gym orderly running towards me hes found the samples on the side of the path i thank him between puffs hes saved me from my first reportable offence actually i think i should confess at this stage that some weeks ago i picked up a penny from the path and have kept the tiny coin in my jeans pocket feeling a slight defiance in possessing cash i put the samples back in their plastic packet and hand them in at the gate incidentally the other gym orderly bell is also the nsc goalkeeper he used to be at spring hill but asked for a transfer to be nearer his wife nsc needed a goalkeeper so the transfer only took four days thanks to this little piece of subterfuge were now on a winning streak however i have to report that the goalkeepers wife has run off with his best friend which may account for bell being sent off last week we lost day saturday december am i now have to work seven days a week as theres a surgery on saturday and sunday its a small price to pay for all the other privileges of being hospital orderly not many patients today eleven in all but then theres no work to skive off on a saturday morning sister leaves at tenthirty and i have the rest of the day to myself unless theres an emergency am spend a couple of hours editing sons of fortune and only take breaks for lunch and later to watch the prison football match pm the football manager and coach is a senior officer called mr masters hes proud of his team but when it comes to abusing the referee hes as bad as any other football fan today hes linesman and should be supporting the ref not to mention the other linesman but both receive a tirade of abuse as mr masters feels able to give his opinion on an offside decision even though hes a hundred yards away from the offence and the linesman on the other side of the pitch is standing opposite the offending player to be fair his enthusiasm rubs off on the rest of the team and we win a scrappy game day sunday december am only five inmates turn up for early morning surgery linda explains that although the prison has a photographic club woodwork shop library gym and chapel a lot of the prisoners spend the weekend in bed rising only to eat or watch a football match on tv it seems such a waste of their lives pm my visitors today are malcolm and edith rifkind malcolm and i entered the house around the same time and have remained friends ever since malcolm is one of those rare animals in politics who has few enemies he was secretary of state for defence and foreign secretary under john major and i cant help reflecting how no profession other than politics happily divests itself of its most able people when they are at their peak its the equivalent of dropping beckham or wilkinson at the age of twentyfive still thats the prerogative of the electorate and one of the few disadvantages of living in a democracy malcolm and his wife edith want to know all about prison life while i wish to hear all the latest gossip from westminster malcolm makes one political comment that will remain fixed in my memory if in the electorate had offered us a contract for eighteen years we would have happily signed it so we cant complain if we now have to spend a few years in the wilderness he and edith have travelled up from london to see me and they will now drive on to edinburgh i cannot emphasize often enough how much i appreciate the kindness of friends pm mr baker drops in for coffee and a chat the officers mess is closed over the weekend so the hospital is the natural pit stop he tells me that one prisoner has absconded while another on returning from his town visit was so drunk that he had to be helped out of his wifes car that will be his last town visit for several months and heres the rub it was his first day out of prison for six years day monday december am papa to hotel papa to hotel how do you read me this is po news call sign to linda and im bound to say that the hospital is the nearest im going to get to a hotel while i remain incarcerated in one of her majestys establishments its a freezing morning in this flat open part of lincolnshire so theres a long queue for the doctor first in line are those on the paper chase due for release tomorrow the second group comprises those facing adjudication one caught injecting heroin a second in possession of money and finally the inmate who came back drunk last night the doctor declares all three fit and can see no medical reason that might be used as mitigating circumstances in their defence the heroin addict is subsequently transferred back to lincoln the prisoner found with in his room claims that he just forgot to hand it in when he returned from a town visit so ends up with seven days added the drunk gets twentyone days added to his sentence and no further town visits until further notice he is also warned that next time its back to a bcat those in the third group by far the largest are either genuinely ill or dont feel like working on the farm at belowzero temperatures most are told to return to work immediately or they will be put on report and come up in front of the governor pm i phone mary who has some interesting news i feel i should point out that mr justice potts claimed at the end of my trial that this is as serious an offence of perjury as i have had experience of and as i have been able to find in the books a reader in law at the university of buckingham has been checking sentencing for those convicted of perjury she has discovered that in the period people were charged with this offence in the united kingdom of the convicted just under received no custodial sentence at all while in the case of the sentence was eighteen months or less only four people were given a fouryear sentence upheld on appeal one of these framed an innocent man who served thirtyone months of a seventeen year sentence for a crime he did not commit the second stood trial twice for a murder of which he was acquitted but was later convicted of perjury during those trials the other two were for false declarations related to marriage as part of a largescale immigration racket pm theres a knock on my door and as the hospital is out of bounds after six oclock unless its an emergency i assume its an officer it isnt its a jolly west indian called wright hes always cheerful and never complains about anything except the weather hi jeff i think ive broken my finger i study his hand as if i had more than a firstaid badge from my days as a boy scout in the s i suggest we visit his unit officer mr cole is unsympathetic but finally agrees wright should be taken to the pilgrim hospital wright reports back an hour later with his finger in a splint by the way i ask how did you break your finger slammed it in a door didnt i strange i say because i think ive just seen the door walking around and its got a black eye day tuesday december am in my mailbag is a registered letter from the court of appeal i print it in full see overleaf the prison authorities or the courts seem to have been dilatory as my appeal may be put off until february rather than held in december the experts on the subject of appeals and by that i mean my fellow inmates tell me that the usual period of time between receiving the above letter and learning the date of ones appeal is around three weeks its then another ten days before the appeal itself among my other letters is one from dame edna enquiring about the dress code when she visits nsc noon brian attempt to defraud an ostrich company thanks me for a box of new paperbacks that have arrived at the red cross office in boston sent by my publisher pm my new job as hospital orderly means ive had to adjust my writing regime i now write between the hours of and am and pm and and pm during the weekends i can fit in an extra hour each day which means im currently managing about thirtyseven hours of writing a week pm i visit the canteen to purchase soap razor blades chocolate evian and phonecards otherwise ill be dirty unshaven unfed and unwatered over christmas not to mention uncontactable the officer on duty checks my balance and finds im only in credit help day wednesday december am archer to report to reception immediately archer to report to reception immediately now mr daff has retired im not allowed the same amount of latitude as in the past ive received five parcels today the first is a book by iris murdoch the sea the sea kindly sent in by a lady from dumfries as i read it some years ago when ms murdoch won the booker prize i donate it to the library the second is a silver bottle opener not much use to an inmate as were not allowed to drink but a kind gesture nevertheless i ask if i can give it to linda no but it can be put in the oldage pensioners raffle the third is a parker pen can i give it to linda no but it can be put in the oldage pensioners raffle the fourth is a teddy bear from dorset i dont bother to ask i just agree to donate it to the oldage pensioners raffle the fifth is a large tube which when opened reveals fifteen posters from the chris beetles gallery which ive been eagerly awaiting for over a week i explain that its a gift to the hospital so theres no point in putting it in store for me because the hospital will get it just as soon as i am released this time they agree to let me take it away result one out of five pm i happily spend a couple of hours assisted by carl and a box of blutack fixing prints by albert goodwin ronald searle heath robinson emmett geraldine girvan paul riley and ray ellis to the hospital walls with over christmas cards littered around the beds the ward has been transformed into an art gallery see opposite pm i return to the canteen im only in credit whereas i calculate i should have around its the nearest i get to losing my temper and its only when the officer in charge says hes been trying to get the system changed for the past year that i calm down remembering that its not his fault he makes a note of the discrepancy on the computer i thank him and return to the hospital i have no reason to complain ive got the best job in the prison and the best room and am allowed to write five hours a day shut up archer pm i attend the carol service at sixthirty where i read one of the lessons luke verses eight to twenty as i dislike the modern text the vicar has allowed me to read from the king james version the chapel is packed long before the service is due to begin and the organ is played with great verve and considerable improvisation by brian ostrich fraud the vicars wife three officers and four inmates read the lessons i follow mr new and mr hughes follows me we all enjoy a relaxed service of carols and lessons and afterwards there is the added bonus of mince pies and coffee which might explain the large turnout after the service brian introduces me to maria whos in charge of the red cross shop in boston she has brought along my box of paperbacks and asks if i would be willing to sign them i happily agree day thursday december am record numbers report sick with near freezing conditions outside am the last inmate to see the doctor is a patient called robinson hes shaking and trying in vain to keep warm ive been in prison long enough now to spot a heroin addict at thirty paces while he waits for his appointment robinson confides that hes desperately trying to kick the habit and has put himself on a compulsory urine test every morning hes thirtytwo years old and has been in and out of prison for the past fourteen years im lucky to be alive he says after i got nicked this time i took the rap and let me mate get off in exchange for a promise hed send me ten quid a week while im inside the friend died a few weeks later after injecting himself from a contaminated batch of heroin if the deal had been the other way round robinson suggests id be the dead man pm over lunch i discuss the drug problem in prisons with the two gym orderlies both of whom abhor the habit i am shocked can i still be shocked when jim burglary antiques only tells me that per cent of the inmates at nsc are on heroin but more depressing still when jim was here eight years ago for a previous offence he says only a handful of the inmates were on drugs what will it be like in ten years time pm as i walk back from lunch i see brian and john the csv red cross workers heading towards me theyve both been taken off the job and confined to the prison while an enquiry is being conducted maria who runs the red cross shop in boston has been accused of smuggling contraband twelve paperbacks into the prison apparently she should have informed the gate staff of her request to have the books autographed by me brian tells me they left her in tears and i am bound to say that what started out as a simple goodwill gesture has ended in turmoil the red cross have been removed as participants in the csv scheme and brian and john have lost their jobs i resolve to find out if there is more to it prison has taught me not to automatically take something on trust and if there isnt to try to right this injustice pm carl suggests we watch midnight express a sure way of reminding ourselves just how lucky we all are and to think turkey wants to be a full member of the european union day friday december am dr walling is on duty today hes full of good cheer and brings christmas presents for linda and myself linda gets a box of ferrero rocher chocolates and he presents me with a bottle of scotch linda quickly grabs the bottle explaining that its against prison rules to offer prisoners alcohol if id been caught with a bottle of whisky actually i dont drink spirits i would have lost my job and possibly have been sent to a bcat with added days dr walling looks suitably embarrassed pm simon abduction of his son mess orderly drops in to deliver lindas sandwich lunch while i make her a coffee simon tells me hes moving room today his roommate a married man with two children asked him last night if hed ever considered being bisexual simon tells me that he jumped out of bed got dressed left the room and demanded to be moved as he didnt want to be locked up with in his words a raving faggot pm i watch great artists on bbc the subject is breughel and all the little breughels pm fall asleep in my chair exhausted it must be the combination of writing and hospital duties cant complain though as the days are passing far more quickly day saturday december am prison life is like a game of cricket every day you discover a new way of getting out the doctor has to pass as fit this morning an inmate by the name of hal cat burglar six months before he goes up in front of the governor last night hal left the prison and walked into boston he dropped into one of the local pubs had a pint and then purchased a bottle of vodka a bottle of rum and a sixpack of fosters hal didnt feel like walking the six miles back so he decided to thumb a lift to the prison mr blackman one of our younger officers obliged and happily escorted hal back confiscated the contraband and booked him into the segregation block hal was due to be released in january but i fear its now looking more like february it turns out that he also suggested to mr blackman that if he dropped him off half a mile from the prison he could keep the bounty nice try hal among the other inmates who will appear in front of the governor this morning is simon abducting his son but only for a warning it appears hes been telling anyone who will listen that his cellmate is a raving faggot the governor will order him to stop using such inflammatory language otherwise he will lose his job as mess orderly i chat to the cat burglar as he waits to see the doctor hal says he doesnt care that much what the governor decides his partner has left him his mother wont speak to him and he hasnt seen his father in years when he gets out he doesnt have anywhere to stay overnight and only has to his name he says he needs a job that will earn him enough money to ensure that he doesnt have to revert to stealing again i ask him how much is enough two hundred quid he replies then id have a chance of finding some digs and getting a job am mr lewis drops into the hospital to wish linda a happy christmas while im making him a coffee he complains that ive thrown away the hospital ashtray so he cant enjoy a cigar i reluctantly supply an old saucer he tells me that he was surprised by the spring hill decision and looking round the hospital says pointedly if they suggest hollesley bay dont even consider it pm mary and william turn up almost an hour late for their visit because of the snow and ice that caused long holdups on the a my time with them is cut down to forty minutes its marys birthday and shes wearing the emerald that sergio purchased for me from the green mountains after he returned to columbia see volume ii wayland purgatory i wanted to also give her the pot i made at wayland but they told me it shattered in the kiln we chat about her forthcoming trip to kenya for her nephews wedding shell be away for the first ten days of january but as my appeal wont be heard until midfebruary this isnt a problem she hopes to see sir sidney kentridge and godfrey barker before she leaves if godfrey signs an affidavit confirming that mr justice potts discussed me adversely at a dinner party they both attended a year before my arrest i could be out of here in a few weeks time will isnt optimistic he feels godfrey will feel compromised because his wife works for the parole board as godfrey has sent me a christmas card i can only hope wills wrong surely justice and truth matter to such a man we shall soon find out day sunday december am the sunday telegraph reports that ive written a word novel entitled sons of fortune during the short time ive been in prison it might seem short to them but its been days for me i actually wrote the first three drafts of the novel before my conviction i had planned to drive from boston connecticut to newhaven via hartford where the book is set and research the final points before mr justice potts intervened i ended up spending the month of august not in the us but in belmarsh writing the first diary am five inmates names are called over the tannoy they are told to report to the doctor which means theyve been charged and will later be up in front of the governor for adjudication two for smoking cannabis one for being drunk one for secreting in a cigarette tin and finally hal who you will recall thumbed a lift back from boston while in possession of a bottle of vodka a bottle of rum and a sixpack of fosters hal did point out to me that its a twelvemile round trip to boston and back to nsc and it was degrees below zero i dont think the governor will consider these to be mitigating circumstances hal loses all privileges and has twentyone days added to his sentence am the governor mr lewis who has only a few days to go before retirement pops into the hospital to check on the end of year audit or was it just to enjoy a cup of coffee with linda and a cigar during his morning break as hes leaving i ask him to tell me a story what about my memoirs he protests but then recounts an anecdote from his time as governor of oxford prison two brothers were charged with a burglary but the elder did not feel his younger brother would be able to cope with a spell in jail so he took the rap and was sentenced to six months as it turned out the younger brother couldnt cope with being on the out without his elder brother so he stole a ladder climbed over the prison wall and broke into jail no one was any the wiser until rollcall that night when the duty officer reported that they had one more prisoner than was on the manifest the younger brother was arrested and charged with breaking into a prison he got three months and ended up sharing a cell with his brother mr lewis went on to tell me about two prisoners who escaped from oxford crown court while handcuffed to each other they ran down the street pursued by the police but when they came to a zebra crossing one decided to cross the road while the other kept on going the handcuffs that bound them together collided with the belisha beacon at full speed and they swung round and knocked each other out day christmas eve today is a nightmare for security first there are the truly stupid inmates who abscond sometime during the morning and then return to the prison on boxing day evening if they are also drunk they are allowed to sleep it off with twentyeight days added to their sentence second are the group who slip out to boston and arrive back with provisions and food as long as they remain in their rooms and cause no trouble the officers turn a blind eye should they cause any trouble they also get twentyeight days this is known as nelson time and occurs only at christmas it must seem madness to you but when you have inmates and only officers on duty its no more than common sense why arent there more officers on duty because the service is understaffed and underpaid the average prison officer is paid a year and this years pay rise was per cent why not send the offenders back to a closed prison because they are all already overcrowded in britain and if you did the dcats would be empty then cut down on dcats if you did that you would never rehabilitate anyone prisoners in a dcat used to be released at am with the exception of lifers on christmas eve and had to return to prison before pm on boxing day but michael howard put a stop to that when he became home secretary this little break was more for the staff than the prisoners am dave murder is among the walking wounded and comes to surgery doubled up with stomach cramps sister gives him painkillers that contain certain opiates she then has to make out a separate form which i take across to security because if dave were to have an mdt he would show up positive sister is especially vigilant in these cases looking out for those prisoners who fake the pain in order to get the drugs especially when they know theyre about to be tested for heroin in daves case there is no doubt that hes in real pain and any case hes been a model prisoner since the day he arrived at nsc hes desperate to impress the parole board and be released as soon as possible hes already served twentyone years and his wife says she cant wait much longer am despite its being christmas eve one inmate will not be able to avoid a nicking because he has pushed his luck a little too far during an mdt he attempted to exchange a tube of someone elses urine for his while he was in the loo it turns out that he got this drugfree sample from another prisoner in exchange for a mars bar am sue from accounts drops into the hospital to tell me that my private money has run out and thats why my canteen account only showed in credit had she let me know a week ago i could have asked mary to top it up however sue explains that she is not allowed to let a prisoner know that his money is running low and can only inform him if he asks directly for his account balance the reason is that most inmates are penniless and dont need to be continually reminded of that fact fair enough pm doug returns from the canteen laden with goodies and tells me that an inmate has just been nicked for ordering a taxi to take him on a round trip to boston the cab company phoned the prison so two officers were waiting when the inmate returned he was caught in possession of fortyeight cans of lager and one bottle each of whisky vodka and brandy he also had six packets of fish and chips a melon a carton of strawberries a pot of cream and a box of jellied eels the prisoner begged to be placed in the segregation cell overnight in case the inmates who had lost their christmas cheer thought hed sold the goodies to someone else the duty officer duly obliged but hell still be up in front of the governor on boxing day day christmas day christmas day for those who are incarcerated can be summed up in one word dreadful i have learned during the last days as a prisoner how perverse reality is i go to work today as every other day and am grateful for something to do at the seventhirty surgery only six prisoners report for sick parade you have to be really ill to get up at am on christmas morning and troop across to the hospital when the temperature on the east coast is minus two degrees at eightfifteen i go to breakfast and even though its eggs bacon and sausage served by the officers mr hocking mr camplin mr baker and mr gough only around forty of the two hundred inmates bother to turn up on returning to the hospital linda and i unload bags of food from her car so i can hold a tea party for my friends this afternoon she also gives me a present which is wrapped in christmas paper i open it very slowly trying to anticipate what it might be inside a neat little box is a china mug with a black cat grinning at me now i have my own mug and will no longer have to decide between a campbells soup giveaway and a plain white object with a chip when i have my morning bovril am linda leaves me in charge of the hospital while she attends the governors christmas party frankly if over half the prisoners werent still in bed asleep i could arrange for them all to abscond when the tabloids claim i have privileges that the other prisoners do not have in one respect they are right i am lucky to be able to carry on with the job i do on the outside while everyone else tries to kill time i settle down to write for a couple of hours noon lunch is excellent and once again served by the officers and shared with a half dozen oldage pensioners from the local village tomato soup followed by turkey chipolatas roast potatoes and stuffing with as much gravy as will go on the plate i dont allow myself the christmas pudding several officers have kindly commented on the fact that im putting on weight nine pounds in nine weeks after lunch i walk over to the south block and phone mary and the boys all things considered they sound pretty cheerful but i cant hide the fact that i miss them my wife is fiftyseven my boys twentynine and twentyseven and today im surrounded by men sitting in their rooms staring at photographs of young children anywhere from six months to fifteen years old yes they deserve to be incarcerated if they committed a crime but we should remember it is christmas day and its not their families who are guilty as i walk back through the block i notice that those not in the tv room or on the phone are just lying on their beds willing the day to pass i have so much food in my fridge that i invite a dozen inmates over to join me in the hospital they all turn up without exception we watch the great escape somewhat ironic and enjoy lindas feast pork pies crisps sausage rolls shortbread biscuits kitkats and most popular of all with my fellow inmates a chunk of my cheddar cheese this is accompanied not by krug but a choice of lemonade evian water tea coffee or ribena they laugh they chat they watch the film and when they leave david fraud schoolmaster pays me a compliment i have never received at any of my champagne and shepherds pie parties thank you for getting rid of the afternoon so pleasantly day boxing day am for those prisoners who do not return to work boxing day is almost worse than christmas day very few inmates attend surgery this morning and certainly none of them have any illness worth reporting am over breakfast i learn another terrible consequence of the drug culture in prisons jim antiques only the gym orderly tells me that some inmates who are addicted to heroin often die within a few months of leaving prison the reason the heroin they take in jail is always weaker because the dealers add other substances such as caster sugar talc or flour so when they are released they are immediately exposed to a purer substance which the body can no longer tolerate result they end up dying of an overdose am the governor drops in to see linda and gives me a christmas present and a birthday present for mary neither of which hes allowed to do as it could compromise him should i ever come up in front of him on report however as its only a few days before he retires i suppose he feels this is unlikely it turns out that the governor is a collector of farthings and he gives mary a farthing dated and i receive one dated our respective years of birth i am touched he also brings in three volumes of the worlds greatest paintings selected masterpieces published in and edited by t leman hare for me to read over christmas he understands what turns me on the three volumes are fascinating at several levels not least because of the one hundred pictures almost all of them would be in an equivalent compilation circa the paintings include da vincis mona lisa bellinis portrait of the doge lorendano rembrandts mother landseers shoeing the bay mare wonderful and yeames when did you last see your father however in this volume there is no mention of the impressionists no examples of monet manet van gogh or even cézanne velasquez is described as the greatest spanish painter of all time with murillo in second place i wonder if professor hare had even heard of picasso in and where he would place him in the lexicon of spanish artists in there are only two artists i have never come across before john macwhiter and millet not jeanfrancois millet but an american francis david millet on the out i visit tate britain regularlyi live opposite on the other side of the river but i dont remember seeing either macwhiters june in the austrian tyrol magnificent or millets between two fires i hope sir nicholas serota has them on display because tate britain will be among the first places i visit once im released in his foreword professor hare writes something that in my opinion is even more relevant today than it was in there is so much nonsense spoken and written about art today that the average man is naturally inclined to be shy of the whole subject and suspicious of those who practise the arts he thinks if this mass of contradiction and confusing jargon is the result of the love of art he had better do without art altogether there is no mystery about art but there is mystification without end evolved by certain critics who love to pose as superior persons such writers put forward the theory that the enjoyment of fine arts is reserved for a select and exclusive minority meaning of course themselves and their disciples no greater error could be propounded than this which is a comparatively modern fallacy and one which is so dangerous that if persisted it must in time bring into contempt everything and everyone connected with art no comment pm linda shuts up shop for the day and goes home for a wellearned rest she has been on duty for the past nineteen days without a break pm i confess that by prison standards i am in heaven but i feel i ought to let you know im still desperate to get back to earth day thursday december am governor lewis has received a call from sir brian mawhinney and although he cant divulge any details he suspects the shadow home secretary will be in touch with mary who in turn will brief me mystery the governor sips his tea as im leaving shortly im going to tell you a story about a present member of staff who must remain anonymous the officer concerned had a day off and in the evening he and his wife went to their local for a drink when they left the pub later the officer saw a man trying to get his car started but it sounded as if the battery was flat the officer asked if he could help by giving a push the driver said thank you and the officer pushed him out of the car park the ignition caught and the driver gave a toot of thanks as he disappeared over the horizon when the officer concerned returned to work the following morning he learned that one of the inmates had absconded the prisoner had even managed to steal a car from a local pub with the help of an obliging member of the public who had given him a push start it cant be true i protest surely he recognized the prisoner to be fair there are over two hundred inmates at nsc and the turnover is often twenty to thirty a week youd think so replied the governor especially as the inmate was the only west indian on the camp in belmarsh around per cent of the inmates were black in wayland per cent and currently at nsc we have four black prisoners out of im not sure what this proves possibly there might be more black prisoners involved in violent crime than in fraud he laughs the officer concerned might have even lived it down if it werent for the fact that neither the prisoner nor the stolen car has been seen since day friday december am whenever theres a serious injury in prison the immediate question always asked is was another prisoner involved so when linda and i are called over to the north block to check on an inmate who is thought to have broken his leg after slipping on the floor lindas first question is who pushed him by the time we arrive the duty officers mr hughes and mr jones are present and they are satisfied ron has had a genuine accident however there are several touches of irony in this particular case the inmate involved is serving a sixweek sentence and is due to be released next thursday last year he broke his left leg in a motorbike accident this time he has managed to break his right leg and several of the pins in his left have been dislodged linda confirms that an officer must accompany him to hospital although how hed abscond with two broken legs is beyond me and why would he want to try six days before hes due to be released however regulations are regulations normally you cant be released from prison unless you have been given a clean bill of health by the duty doctor and in rons case it will be at least six weeks before the plaster comes off well let him go linda says but only if a family member picks him up next thursday and also agrees to take responsibility for him and if no one does i ask then hell stay here until hes fully recovered day saturday december pm mary william and james visit me we talk mainly of the legal issues surrounding my trial and appeal the topic of conversation then turns to baroness nicholson mary has written to her asking for an apology mary is off to kenya with her sister janet on monday a journey she has wanted to make for some years because of her love of cats whatever their size what happened to our ninety minutes together pm im in my final writing session for the day when theres a knock on the door this usually means that a prisoner has a headache and needs some paracetamol which i am allowed to dispense as long as the inmate has a note from the duty officer if its something more serious then his unit officer has to be consulted i open my door and smile up at an inmate who looks pretty healthy to me have you got any condoms jeff he asks no i tell him aware that linda keeps a supply for prisoners going on weekend leave or just about to be released but even then she only gives them out very sparingly if you report to surgery at seventhirty tomorrow morning linda will itll be too late by then he says i look surprised its just that my sister visited me this afternoon and she hasnt got enough money to get home a few of the lads are willing to pay her ten quid for a blow job which usually ends up with them going the whole way and ending up paying twenty all of which begs several questions when possession of money in a prison is illegal is this an indoor or outdoor activity its minus two degrees outside and is she really his sister sorry i cant help is my only response and after he has disappeared into the night i try hard to concentrate on my writing day sunday december am the security officer on duty today enjoys his job but never feels fulfilled until hes put someone on a charge mr vessey rushes into surgery to see sister during the night hes found fourteen empty bottles of vodka at the bottom of the skip by the entrance to the prison a whispered conversation ensues not that it takes a lot of imagination to realize that hes asking if any inmates checked into surgery this morning a little worse for wear moments later he rushes off to the south block in fact very few inmates were on sick parade this morning as most of them are sleeping in or sleeping it off and the ones that appeared were genuinely ill he will be disappointed am during the morning we have visits from mr lewis and mr berlyn the new deputy governor who join linda for coffee mr hocking is the next to arrive with the news that five inmates have failed the breathalyser test two of them are csv workers who could lose all their privileges for example they could be put back to work on the farm for the rest of their sentence an inmate who completes a quarter of his sentence and proves to be a model prisoner is eligible for outside work first he must complete two town visits without incident the next step is to apply for community service volunteers work csv perhaps in an old peoples home or an oxfam shop once hes completed a month of csv without incident he can move on to a wageearning job making perhaps a week this gives a prisoner the chance to send money back to his wife or partner and to build up some savings to fall back on once released mr hocking tells me he doubts if the punishment will be that draconian but the warning will be clear for the future why would anyone risk losing so much for a couple of vodkas noon linda leaves at midday so i spend four of the next six hours editing belmarsh volume one of these diaries pm during the evening i read here is new york by e b white which will gave me for christmas one paragraph towards the end of the essay is eerily prophetic the subtlest change in new york is something people dont speak much about but that is in everyones mind the city for the first time in its long history is destructible a single flight of planes no bigger than a wedge of geese can quickly end this island fantasy burn the towers crumble the bridges turn the underground passages into lethal chambers cremate the millions the intimation of mortality is part of new york now in the sound of jets overhead in the black headlines of the latest edition this was written in and the author died in day new years eye am four new prisoners arrive at the hospital from nottingham looking lost and a little disorientated im surprised that group has deposited them before lunch as they dont usually arrive until around four in the afternoon its new years eve explains linda theyll all want to be home by four noon linda checks her books and tells me that nsc had a turnover of just over a thousand prisoners during so after eleven weeks im already something of an old lag pm mary and i usually invite eight guest to dinner at the old vicarage on new years eve this year ill have to settle for a kitkat a glass of ribena and hope that doug and clive are able to join me day new years day am the camp is silent so i begin to go over volume one of these diaries reading through those early days when i was so distressed i cant believe how much i have made myself forget and this has become even more pronounced since my appointment as hospital orderly where i have everything except freedom and the daily company of my wife family and friends a punishment in itself but not purgatory and certainly not hell am mr new drops into the hospital to say his farewells he leaves nsc tonight and will on january change his uniform for a suit when he becomes a governor at norwich prison hes taught me a great deal about good and evil during the past three months pm i miss my wife i miss my family and i miss my friends the biggest enemy i have to contend with is boredom and its a killer for many prisoners its the time when they first experiment with drugs to begin with drugs are offered by the dealers for nothing and when they demand more in exchange for a phonecard and an ounce of tobacco or cash and finally when theyre hooked theyll give anything for a fix including their life tonight the lincolnshire constabulary informed sister that a former prisoner called cole who left nsc six weeks ago has been found under a hedge in a quiet country lane he died from an overdose happy new year day wednesday january am i continue to edit a prison diary volume one belmarsh hell am mr berlyn drops in to tell me that he already has plans for my csv work should my sentence be reduced and this even before the date of my appeal is known he wants me to work in an oldage pensioners home as it will be out of sight of the press he also feels i would benefit from the experience i had hoped to work in the red cross shop in boston but mr berlyn has discounted that option after maria brought in without permission some books for me to sign before christmas to raise money for their afghanistan appeal the rev derek johnson the prison chaplain has been to see him to plead their case explaining that he is in the forgiveness and rehabilitation business mr berlyns immediate retort was im in the punishment and retribution business he must have meant of prisoners i cant believe he wishes to punish a hardworking decent woman trying to run a red cross shop pm linda looks very tired shes worked twentyone of the last twentyfour days she tells me that shes going to apply for a job in boston my only selfish thought is that i hope she doesnt leave before i do pm doug turns up at the hospital for his nightly bath and to watch television hes now settled into his job as a driver which keeps him out of the prison between the hours of am and pm i wonder if for prisoners like doug it wouldnt be better to rethink the tagging system so he could give up his bed for a more worthy candidate day thursday january am morning surgery is packed with inmates who want to sign up for acupuncture you must report to hospital between and am in order to be booked in for an eleven oclock appointment linda and gail are both fully qualified and on the out acupuncture could cost up to a session to an inmate its free of charge as are all prescriptions the purpose of acupuncture in prison is twofold to release stress and to wean you off smoking linda and gail have had several worthwhile results in the past one inmate has dropped from sixty cigarettes a day to three after only a month on the course other prisoners who are suffering from stress rely on it and any prisoner who turns up for a second session can be described as serious however back to the present eight inmates suspiciously arrive in a group and sign up for the eleven oclock session they all by coincidence reside in the south block and work on the farm which means that theyll miss most of the mornings work and still be fully paid at eight oclock linda calls mr donnelly on the farm to let him know that the mornings acupuncture session is so oversubscribed two regular applicants one from education and one unemployed so shell take the eight from the farm at four oclock this afternoon this means that theyll have to complete their days work before reporting to the hospital it will be interesting to see how many of them turn up am young ron both legs broken hobbles in to see the doctor hes on the paper chase and has to be cleared as fit and free of any problems before he can be released at am tomorrow after the hospital he still has to visit the gym stores smu education unit office and reception how will they go about signing out a man with two broken legs as fit to face the world linda comes to the rescue phones each department and then signs on their behalf problem solved am when dr walling has finished ministering to his patients he joins me in the ward we discuss the drug problem in boston sleepy boston population of around recently dr wallings car was broken into all the usual things were stolen radio tapes briefcase but he was devastated by the loss of a box of photographic slides that he has built up over a period of thirty years because he hadnt duplicated them they were irreplaceable and the theft took place only days before he was due to deliver a series of lectures in america assuming that it was a drugrelated theft cash needed for a quick fix dr walling visited the houses of bostons three established drug barons he left a note saying that he needed the slides urgently and would pay a reward of if they were returned the slides turned up the following day the true significance of this tale is that a leading doctor knows who the towns drug barons are and yet the police seem powerless to put such men behind bars dr walling explains that its the old problem of mr big never getting his hands dirty he arranges for the drugs to be smuggled into the country before being sold to a dealer mr big also employs runners to distribute the drugs free of charge mainly to children as they leave school unaccompanied so that long before they reach university or take a job theyre hooked and that i repeat is in boston not chelsea or brixton what will britain be like in ten years time twenty years thirty if the police estimate that per cent of all crime today is drugrelated pm no one from the farm turns up for acupuncture pm carl rushes in breathless to say a prisoner has collapsed on the south block linda went home two hours ago so i run out of the hospital to find mr belford and mr harman a few yards ahead of me when we arrive at the prisoners door we find the inmate gasping for breath i recognize him immediately from his visit to dr walling this morning i feel helpless as he lies doubledup clutching his stomach but fortunately an ambulance arrives within minutes a paramedic places a mask over the inmates face and then asks him some routine questions all of which i am able to answer on his behalf name off doctor last visit to surgery nature of complaint and medication given im also able to tell them his blood pressure they rush him to the pilgrim hospital and as he failed his recent risk assessment mr harman has to travel with him as mr harman is now off the manifest we are probably down to five officers on duty tonight to watch over prisoners day friday january i finish editing belmarsh and post it back to my publishers am i leave the hospital to carry out my morning rounds this has three purposes first to let each department head know which inmates are off work second in case of a fire to identify who is where and third if someone fails to show up for rollcall to check if theyve absconded en route to the farm i bump into blossom who had one of the pigs named after him see photo page blossom is a traveller or a gipsy as we used to describe them before it became politically incorrect blossom tells me that hes just dug a lamb out of the ice it seems it got its hindquarters stuck in some mud which froze overnight so the poor animal couldnt move youve saved the animals life i tell blossom no he says hes going to be slaughtered today so hell soon be on the menu as frozen cutlets noon i pick up my post from the south block although most of the messages continue along the same theme one sent from a frank and lurline in wynnum australia is worthy of a mention if only because of the envelope it was addressed thus lord jeffrey archer jailed for telling a fib somewhere in england it is dated christmas day and has taken only nine days to reach me in deepest lincolnshire pm the main administration block has been sealed off gail tells me that she cant get into the building to carry out any paperwork and she doesnt know why this is only interesting because its an area that is offlimits to inmates over the past few months money and valuables have gone missing mr berlyn is determined to catch the culprit it turns out to be a fruitless exercise because despite a thorough search the that was stolen from someones purse doesnt materialize mr hocking the security officer in charge of the operation found the whole exercise distasteful as it involved investigating his colleagues i have a feeling he knows who the guilty party is but certainly isnt going to tell me my deep throat a prisoner of long standing tells me the name of the suspect for those readers with the mind of a detective she doesnt get a mention in this diary day saturday january am a prisoner from the south block checks into surgery with a groin injury linda is sufficiently worried about his condition to have him taken to the local hospital without delay meanwhile she dresses his wounds and gives him some painkillers he never once says please or thank you this attitude would be true of over half the inmates and nearer per cent of those under thirty although its a generalization i have become aware that those without manners are also the work shy amongst the prison population pm among the thousands of letters ive received since ive been incarcerated several are from charities that continue to ask for donations signed books and memorabilia and occasionally for a doodle drawing poem or even a painting despite my lifelong love of art the good lord decided to place a pen in my hand not a paintbrush but i found an alternative when i came across darren an education orderly darren has already designed several imaginative posters and signs for the hospital the latest charity request is that i should produce a sunflower in any medium i came up with an idea which darren produces see overleaf day sunday january am as its twelfth night i spend a couple of hours taking down my christmas cards and packing them up so i can hand them over to will when he visits me this afternoon am linda tells me that a nurse at the pilgrim hospital phoned urgently about the prisoner with the groin injury an officer is dispatched immediately to keep an eye on him until hes safely back in his room at nsc not a bad idea to get yourself transferred to the local hospital if you plan to escape but its not that bright to ask a nurse where the exits are pm will visits me accompanied by my christmas present neither he nor james have heard a word from their mother since she landed in kenya will reassures me by suggesting shes either having a good time or shes been eaten by a lion pm doug arrives at the hospital with the news that five prisoners who were out on a town leave have failed to return as none of them are murderers only the local police will be alerted if a murderer absconds the home office has to brief the national press within twentyfour hours day monday january north sea camp has been told to increase its bed space now that almost every room has a tv set the large television rooms can be converted into three dormitories giving the prison another thirteen beds i dont think this will go a long way to solving the problem of overcrowding in prisons am when mr berlyn drops into the hospital linda tells him that shes applying for a job at the coroners office in boston he assures me later that he doesnt believe shell ever leave he seems surprised and frowns when i tell him that shes already completed an application form he then reveals that of the five prisoners who failed to check back in by seven the previous evening two turned up late and will be in front of the governor this morning two were caught drunk in an amusement arcade in skegness and have already been shipped out to lincoln where theyll complete their sentence with a further twentyeight days added and one is still on the run it cant be worth it i declare when discussing the absconders with jim antiques only over lunch it may not be worth it for you jeffrey but we dont know their domestic situation has the wife run away with his best mate are the children ok are they all being turfed out of their home are they i agree with jim i cant begin to imagine such problems day tuesday january am hm prison service race relations policy statement the prison service is committed to racial equality improper discrimination on the basis of colour race nationality ethnic or national origins or religion is unacceptable as is any racially abusive or insulting language or behaviour on the part of any member of staff prisoner or visitor and neither will be tolerated interesting grammatical error this statement is publicly displayed in every prison in england and i must admit that i have never witnessed an officer showing any racial prejudice at any time on the contrary i have witnessed several prisoners play the race card to their advantage youre only saying that because im black youre picking on me because im a muslim unfortunately ive not seen a black or asian officer at either wayland or north sea camp otherwise i might have tried youre only picking on me because im white can you name one country on earth that has a race relations policy to protect the whites certainly not zimbabwe which is in the headlines again today i mention this only because a circular was sent to all departments today which clearly shows how seriously the prison service takes minority rights noon mr belford drops into the hospital and reports a conversation he heard between two elderly ladies standing at a bus stop in boston first lady did you see jeffrey archer in the pub last night second lady no i thought he was in jail first lady no hes down at our local almost every night drinking pint after pint before hes driven back to the prison by his chauffeur in a rolls royce second lady its a disgrace the officer pointed out to the ladies that i have never once left the nsc since the day i arrived and i dont drink thats what you think came back the immediate reply day wednesday january am i wake and consider the future everything rests on the result of my appeal i currently have a fouryear sentence in present circumstances assuming i remain a model prisoner ill serve two subject to my parole board report being positive which means i will be released on july however i am appealing against sentence and conviction and if my conviction is overturned then ill be released the same day if not all will depend on my sentence being reduced if the three appeal judges were to lower my sentence from four years to three i would no longer be subject to the parole board and would be eligible for automatic release in eighteen months if my record remains unblemished i will be released on a tag two months before that after sixteen months on november ten months time if the appeal court judges reduce my sentence to two years i will be released on may which is only another four months if my sentence is reduced to the common length for perjury ie eighteen months i will be released on march in six weeks time perhaps now you can understand why i am so anxious about my appeal and wait daily to hear from the courts when i will appear before them am a trainee nurse joins us simon will spend three weeks at nsc on secondment from the pilgrim hospital he will quickly discover that prisoners are treated far better than the general public at seven you can pick up your paracetamol aspirins lozenges mouthwash and prescribed medication at nine you can see the doctor and you never have to wait for more than twenty minutes at eleven if you are stressed or want to give up smoking or come off drugs you can attend an acupuncture course at twelve you can come back and get some more medication at twothirty you can attend a talk on giving up smoking nicotine patches are handed out when the talk is over at fourthirty you can come back for more medication after pm the orderly can supply aspirin or paracetamol to any prisoner who has a slip from an officer if you are seriously ill an ambulance will have you tucked up in the pilgrim hospital within the hour in any one day a determined prisoner can spend hundreds of pounds of taxpayers money whereas in truth i doubt if per cent of them would visit a doctor on the out and certainly wouldnt go to a chemist if it meant parting with a penny of their own cash so what our new intern will learn is that if you are ill its better to be in prison than an infirm oldage pensioner or a sick child day thursday january pm although the fire alarm is tested every day at one oclock today it sounds for a second time at onefifteen security are carrying out a fullscale fire drill all staff prison officers and inmates have to report to the farmyard where we line up in separate pens i go to the one marked hospital and join linda gail and simon on my left is north block one on my right the lifers unit a score of murderers gathered together everyone from the governor to the most recently arrived inmate is on parade we wait to be checked off by mr hocking the senior security officer its the first time ive seen the whole community in one place and it highlights how disproportionate the numbers of staff are to prisoners this is fine in a dcat where everything is based on trust but would be impossible in closed conditions if you had a fire drill in an a or bcat you could only hope to carry it out spur by spur in a ccat perhaps block by block unless you wanted a riot on your hands or a mass escape pm two hundred and eleven prisoners and thirtyeight staff including clerical return to work pm i watch raiders of the lost ark the last time i saw this film was with my two sons will was then nine and james seven it was produced by one of my oldest friends frank marshall frank flew from la to london to appear in my trial to deny a statement by angie peppiatt that i had been in rome with a mistress when in fact i had been with frank attending the world athletics championships not that i think mr justice potts gave a damn as by then he had already made up his mind that i was guilty day friday january am id like to bring you up to date on a couple of matters you may wish to have resolved six prisoners have absconded in the past ten days and i have already accounted for five of them but not mcgeekin mcgeekin had a town visit which allowed him to leave the prison at eight in the morning as long as he reported back to the gate by seven the same night he did not return so the matter was placed in police hands hes already back in custody the gate officer was informed by the local desk sergeant hed reported to his nearest police station and told them he wanted to be sent back to hmp wayland in norfolk rather than return to north sea camp its not uncommon for an inmate to want to return to the more regulated life of a closed prison some will even tell you they feel safer with a wall around them lifers in particular often find the regime of an open prison impossible to come to terms with after fifteen years of being banged up often for twentytwo hours a day they just cant handle so much freedom within hours of arriving they will apply to be sent back but are told to give it a month and if they then still feel the same way to put in a transfer application frankly theyd have to drag me back to wayland and id abscond rather than return to belmarsh day saturday january am the hospital bath plug has been stolen which is a bit of a mystery because its the only bath in the prison available to inmates so the plug cant be of much use to anyone else however i have a reserve one which makes me king because i am now controller of the bath plug i will still have to make an application for a new one which will mean filling in three forms and probably waiting three months pm the camp is playing football against the local league leaders when our team runs out onto the pitch i hardly recognize any of them mr masters gym officer and coach points out that the rapid turnover of inmates has meant hes put fiftyfour players on the pitch since the opening match of the season thats something even man united couldnt handle added to this is the fact that our star goalkeeper bell has been suspended for one match after using foul and abusive language when the referee awarded a penalty to the opposition he was a little unlucky that an fa official was assessing the referee that afternoon and therefore the ref couldnt pretend not to have heard bell indeed they could have heard get some glasses you fuckin muppet in the centre of boston our reserve goalkeeper is carl fraud the smu orderly who took over from me and comes over most evenings to watch tv in the hospital he gamely agreed to stand in for the one fixture while bell watches from the sidelines i felt it nothing less than my duty to turn up and support the team in such dire circumstances i left at half time when we were trailing just after our prison reporter major willis stabbed his wife with a kitchen knife two years told me that the boston standard had given him so little space to report the match that he would only be able to list the names of the scorers i was also amused by his chivvying from the touchline well played harry good tackle david and super shot reg as if he were a house master addressing the rd xi of a minor public school pm i join carl for supper but he doesnt look too happy what was the final score i ask we had a better second half he offers so what was the final score i repeat the only man who has a big smile on his face is the suspended bell whose position as first choice goalkeeper remains secure day sunday january am once linda has closed the surgery for the morning i settle down to read the sunday times the lead story is about prince harry and the revelation in the news of the world that hes tried marijuana and has also been involved in heavy drinking despite the fact that hes still under age some of us are old enough to remember the shocking revelation that prince charles was caught drinking cherry brandy when he was still at gordonstoun pm my visitors this week are stephan shakespeare my former chief of staff for the london mayoral campaign robert halfon senior adviser to oliver letwin mp the shadow home secretary and my son will the general view is that ids is doing better than expected i warn them that if the inmates and the prison staff are anything to go by most people simply dont know who he is will tells me that he wont be returning to the states until after the appeal he also reports that godfrey barker has had a change of heart and is no longer willing to help and may even leave the country rather than be forced to give evidence about the dinner party conversation that took place with mr justice potts his wife anne has said she will divorce him if he does mr and mrs barker are now separated mrs barker stood down from the parole board in september pm a lifer has absconded he was out on an unaccompanied town visit and didnt return for checkin by pm if hes still absent in twentyfour hours time the home office will release the name and his record to the press when a young hooligan escapes it rarely makes even the local paper but the public has a right to know if a murderer is on the loose doug fills me in on the background it seems that the inmate failed an mdt heroin a few weeks ago and was moved out of the lifers unit back onto the north block the result of his latest test last week is also expected to be positive as this will be a second offence he would automatically be transferred back to a bcat and have at least another eighteen months added to his sentence this is a man who began with a twelveyear tariff and has already served seventeen years if hed been a model prisoner he could have been released five years ago day monday january am when the doctor arrives each morning he first signs the discharge papers of any prisoner due to be released he then signs applications for a fiveday leave showing a clean bill of health his next task is to see all the new prisoners who have just arrived from another jail finally the doctor handles nickings prisoners who have been put on a charge and again must be passed fit both mentally and physically before punishment can be administered once all these inmates have been dealt with the doctor moves onto the genuinely sick today we have three nickings two are commonplace but the third even took the governor by surprise the first was for swearing at an officer and that has to be pretty extreme for the prisoner to end up in front of the governor the second was an inmate found to have in his room the first ended up with four days added to his sentence the second seven days but the third all prisoners out on town leave have to report back to the gate sober before pm this particular inmate was a few minutes late and was to quote the gate officer legless out there you can be breathalysed if youre driving in here we are when were walking when charged with being drunk the prisoner claimed that hed swallowed half a bottle of mouthwash thirty minutes before returning to the prison it is true that a bottle of mouthwash contains alcohol and it will register on the breathalyser at per cent the trouble was that the breathalyser was showing per cent next they checked his medical records and as the prisoner had not visited the surgery for over a month and never requested a mouthwash he was asked to explain why he suddenly drank half a bottle because i was giving my partner a blow job he replied when the officer recovered from this revelation he thumbed through the rule book and came up with a winner did you sign the trust agreement for prisoners who are on a town visit he asked innocently yes came back the immediate reply and who did you select as the person who would be responsible for you at all times my mother the prisoner replied and did your mother witness the action you have just described the inmate paused for a moment pleaded guilty and had twentyeight days added to his sentence am linda leaves the hospital and walks across to reception where two prisoners have just been taken from their rooms without warning as they are to be shipped out to lincoln bcat they have both failed an mdt and came up positive for heroin prisoners are never given any warning they are on the move in case they decide to abscond rather than be transferred back to closed conditions day tuesday january am the derby five are on the paper chase and each of them comes to the hospital to say goodbye eamon who shared a room with me for a short time is particularly friendly and says he hopes we will meet again i nod pm over supper i sit next to john murder who makes an interesting point about chris murder who is still on the run if hes managed to escape to certain european countries sweden portugal or italy whose governments do not approve of our tariff system for lifers its possible that the authorities in that country may turn a blind eye especially after the home office announced today that they did not consider chris to be a danger to the public pm im going over todays script when an inmate staggers into the hospital hes sweating profusely and badly out of breath i take his blood pressure and immediately brief the unit officer but not until ive taken my own to check the machine is not faulty mr downs who replaced mr new as po is on duty and i tell him that gail has been keeping an eye on this patient for the past four days and told me that if the monitor went over again he was to be taken straight to pilgrim hospital for a full checkup its not quite that easy explains mr downs ive only got five officers on duty tonight and this inmate hasnt been risk assessed so one of us would have to accompany him mr downs sighs phones for a taxi and instructs an officer to travel with the inmate to pilgrim hospital cost that means tonight we have prisoners being guarded by four officers one of them a young woman whos recently joined the service good night day wednesday january am martin the inmate who lost two months for attempting to steal some prison clothes on the morning he was due to be released has had another twentyfive days added to his sentence this time for being caught with marijuana in his room he was originally due to leave nsc on december and now he wont be released until march at this rate i might even get out before him its not uncommon for inmates to end up serving a longer period than their original sentence however it will take martin a number of knock backs before he can beat a prisoner in wayland a prison diary volume ii who started with a threeyear sentence for possession of heroin and is still a resident of that establishment eight years later pm among the new inductees are a policeman and a man who was sentenced to five years for attempting to kill his motherinlaw the rest are in for the usual tariff burglary driving offences drugs drugs and drugs still i sense one or two stories among this lot pm i have a visit from keith class b drugs which is a bit of a surprise as he was on the paper chase last monday and should have been discharged yesterday i cant believe hes committed another crime in the last twentyfour hours no it turns out that the parole board having informed the prison that he could be released on monday have now told him he must wait until one or two more pieces of paper are signed why couldnt they tell him that last monday rather than unnecessarily raise his hopes i tell keith about a prisoner who was transferred from leicester yesterday and is being returned to that prison today the authorities forgot to send all his parole details the man travelled to nsc in a sweat box spent the night here and now has to go back to leicester prison by the way we expect him to return to nsc next week this bureaucratic incompetence will be paid for out of taxpayers money day thursday january after a month of being hospital orderly i have my work schedule mastered am write first draft of previous days events am draw curtains make bed put on kettle shave bathe and dress prepare lists and make coffee for linda dash of milk one sweetener am surgery usually twenty to thirty inmates who collect prescriptions or need to make an appointment to see the doctor at nine am deliver slips for absentees from work to the farm the works stores mess education department north and south blocks and the gate am breakfast in the dining room am doctors surgery am acupuncture usually three or four inmates am read this mornings draft of this diary am wake up patients having acupuncture linda removes needles noon lunch pm phone alison at the penthouse and collect my mail from south unit office pm continue second draft of yesterdays work pm check in arrivals from other prisons give short introductory talk then take their blood pressure and weight and carry out diabetes test urine pm evening surgery those inmates who ordered prescriptions this morning can pick them up as theyll have been collected from a chemist in boston during the afternoon pm linda leaves for the day pm supper pm final writing session totalling nearly six hours in all pm unlock the end room for use by outside personnel eg listeners jehovahs witnesses drug and alcohol counselling sessions and prison committees pm read through the days mail make annotated notes and post to alison pm doug and carl join me for a coffee to chat or watch a film on tv pm read until i feel sleepy the hospital orderly has the longest and most irregular hours of any prisoner its seven days a week on saturday and sunday after linda and gail have left i sweep the hospital ward lobby lavatory and bathroom before mopping throughout although i cant remember when i last did any domestic chores i find the work therapeutic i wouldnt however go so far as saying i enjoy it i then check my supplies and restock the cupboards if im short of anything i make out an order form for the stores memo pads lavatory paper and today for a new vacuum cleaner the old one has finally given up some prisoners tell me that they would rather work in the kitchen or the officers mess because they get more food id rather be in the hospital and have a bath and a good nights sleep day friday january am the night security guard has just walked in and tells me with a smile that i can abscond i put my pen down and ask why weve got one too many on the manifest how did that happen i ask a lad who was released yesterday arrived home and no one wanted him so he crept back in last night and dossed down in his old room so what did you do i ask marched him back to the gate and threw him out for a second time i feel sorry for a man who has nowhere to go and can only wonder how long it will be before he reoffends am i bump into keith knowingly concerned with a class b drug on his way back from breakfast he must still be waiting for his missing papers to be signed before they can release him you might be as i was puzzled by what his charge means keith ran a small transport company and one of his lorries had been fitted with spare fuel tanks when the driver came through customs the spare fuel tanks were found to contain kilos of marijuana keith was sentenced to nine years whenever a judge passes a sentence on drugs theres a tariff according to the class of the drug a b or c also relevant is whether you are considered to be in possession of or a supplier and the amount involved drugs classification class a heroin ecstasy cocaine opiates class b cannabis marijuana now class c amphetamines class c anabolic steroids keratin amyl nitrite poppers heres a rough guide to the maximum penalties class a possession seven years supplier life fine or both fine or both class b possession five years supplier fourteen years class c possession two years supplier five years many of the inmates feel unjustly treated when sentences can vary so much from court to court and as over per cent of prisoners are in on drugrelated charges comparisons are made all the time a few admit to having got off lightly while most feel hard done by pm the man who was sentenced to five years for attempting to murder his motherinlaw turns out to be another unusual case this particular inmate hit his motherinlaw when she refused to allow him access to visit his children she collapsed and was taken to hospital as she didnt die and the police didnt have proof that he intended to murder her the charge was dropped to aggravated burglary and he was sentenced to five years it would take a trained legal mind to understand how the second charge came about the prisoner explains that when he went in search of his children he entered his motherinlaws house when she had not invited him in and this offence is aggravated burglary day saturday january pm i was hoping to see mary will and james today but the authorities have decreed that ive used up all my visits for this month and therefore cant see them until the beginning of february pm this weeks football match has also been cancelled so once again i come face to face with the prisoners biggest enemy boredom day sunday january am mr hart an oldfashioned socialist visits the hospital to tell me that theres a doublepage spread about me in the news of the world it seems that eamon one of the derby five is the latest former inmate to take his thirty pieces of silver and tell the world what its like to share a room with jeff i am surprised how many prisoners visit me today to tell me what they think of eamon strange phrases like broken the code not the done thing come from men who are in for murder and gbh after belmarsh fletch tony del boy and billy said nothing while darren jimmy jules and sketch from wayland also kept their counsel here at nsc i trust doug carl jim clive and matthew and they would have stories to tell pm ive started a prison tea club as i love to entertain whatever the circumstances admittedly it would have been impossible at belmarsh or wayland but as i now reside in the hospital i am even able to send out invitations membership is confined to those over the age of forty my guests are invited to attend club hospital on sunday between the hours of pm and pm they will be served tea coffee biscuits and scones supplied by linda the current membership is around a dozen and includes david fraud schoolmaster john fraud accountant john fraud businessman keith knowingly in possession of drugs brian ostrich farm and chapel organist doug importing cigarettes the major stabbed his wife the captain theft drummed out of the regiment malcolm fraud and carl fraud the talk is not of prison life but whats going on in the outside world whether the ira should be given rooms in parliament whether bin laden is dead or alive the state of the nhs and the latest from the test match in india all of my guests keep to the club rules they remove their shoes and put on slippers as they enter the hospital and no smoking or swearing is tolerated two of them will be leaving us next week keith will have served five years and brian nearly three we raise a cup to them and wish them luck carl and david stay behind to help me with the washingup day monday january am im becoming aware of the hospital regulars five prisoners who turn up every morning between and am to collect their medication i couldnt work out why these five need the same medication for something most of us would recover from in a few days sister has her suspicions but if a prisoner complains of toothache muscle sprain or arthritis they are entitled to medications that are opiate based for example codeine cocodamol or dextropropoxyphene these will show up as positive on any drugs test and if a prisoner has been on them every day for a month they can then claim its my medication guv however if an inmate tests positive for heroin the hospital will take a blood sample and seek medical advice as to whether his daily medication would have registered that high several prisoners have discovered that such an element of doubt often works in their favour doug tells me that some addicts return to their rooms flush the pills down the lavatory and then take their daily dose of heroin am a lifer called bob twelve years murder is due to appear in front of the parole board next week hes coming to the end of his tariff and the home office usually recommends that the prisoner serves at least another two years before they will consider release this decision has recently been taken out of the hands of the home office and passed to the parole board bob received a letter from the board this morning informing him he will be released next thursday try to imagine serving twelve years think what age you were twelve years ago and now assume that you will have to do another two years but then youre told you will be released on thursday the man is walking around in a daze not least because he fell off a ladder yesterday and now has his ankle in a cast what a way to start your reentry back to earth may tuesday january am andrew pierce of the times has got hold of the story that libby purves will be interviewing mary tomorrow the bbc must have leaked it but i cant complain because the piece reads well even if mr pierce is under the illusion that nsc is in cambridgeshire i only wish it were pm among my afternoon post is a valentines card which is a bit like getting a christmas card in november one proposal of marriage one offer of a film part field marshall haig a request to front a twelvepart television series and an invitation to give an afterdinner speech in sydney next september do they know something i dont pm an officer drops in from his night rounds for a coffee he tells me an alarming story about an event that took place at his last prison its universally accepted among prisoners that if one particular officer has got it in for you theres nothing you can do about it you can go through the complaints procedure but even if youre in the right officers will always back each other up if a colleague is in trouble i could fill a book with such instances i have experienced this myself at such a petty level that i have not considered the incident worth recording on that occasion the governor personally apologized but still advised me not to put in a complaint however back to a prisoner from the north block who did have the temerity to put in a written complaint about a particular officer on this occasion i can only agree with the prisoner that the officer concerned is a bully nevertheless after a lengthy enquiry everything in prison is lengthy the officer was cleared of any misdemeanour but that didnt stop him seeking revenge the inmate in question was serving a fiveyear sentence and at the time he entered prison was having an affair that his wife didnt know about and to add to the complication the affair was with another man the prisoner would have a visit from one of them each fortnight while writing to both of them during the week the rule in closed prisons is that you leave your letters unsealed in the unit office so they can be read by the duty officer to check if youre still involved in any criminal activity or asking for drugs to be sent in when the prisoner left his two letters in the unit office the officer on duty was the same man he had made a complaint about to the governor the officer read both the love letters and yes youve guessed it switched them and sealed the envelopes and with it the fate of the prisoner how do i know this to be true because the officer involved has just told me and is happy to tell anyone he considers a threat day wednesday january am mary is on midweek with libby purves pm i call mary shes off to lunch with ken howard ra and other artistic luminaries pm my visitors today are michael portillo and alan jones australias john humphreys i must first make my position clear on michaels leadership bid i would have wanted him to follow john major as leader of the party i would also have voted for him to follow william hague though i would have been torn if malcolm rifkind had won back his edinburgh seat it is a robust visit and it serves to remind me how much i miss the cut and thrust of westminster stuck as i am in the coldest and most remote corner of lincolnshire michael tells us about one or two changes he would have made had he been elected leader we need our own clause he suggests which tony blair so brilliantly turned into an important issue despite it being of no real significance michael also feels that the partys parliamentary candidates should be selected from the centre taking power away from the constituencies it also worries him how few women and member of minority groups end up on the conservative benches he points out that at the last election the party only added one new woman to its ranks at a time when the labour party have over fifty not much of an advertisement for the new allinclusive modern party he adds but how would you have handled the european issue ask alan michael is about to reply when that redhot socialist local labour councillor officer hart tells us that our time is up politics is not so overburdened with talent that the conservatives can survive without portillo rifkind hague clarke and redwood all playing important roles especially while were in opposition when the two men left i was buzzing an hour later i wanted to abscond pm i call mary she has just left the chambers of julian malins qc and is going to dinner with leo rothschild day friday january am im called out of breakfast over the tannoy and instructed to return to the hospital immediately five new prisoners came in last night after gail had gone home she needs all the preliminaries carried out heart rate weight height before dr walling arrives at nine one of the new intake announces with considerable pride that although this is his fifth offence its his first visit to nsc am once surgery is over dr walling joins me for a coffee on the ward one of them was a nightmare he says as if i wasnt one of them he doesnt tell me which of the twenty patients he was referring to and i dont enquire however his next sentence did take me by surprise i needed to take a blood sample and couldnt find a vein in his arms or legs so i ended up injecting his penis hes not even half your age jeffrey but youll outlive him pm the new vacuum cleaner has arrived this is a big event in my life pm i call mary at grantchester she has several pieces of news brian mawhinney has received a reply to his letter to sir john stevens the commissioner of the metropolitan police asking why i lost my dcat and was sent to wayland a report on the circumstances surrounding that decision has been requested and will be forwarded to brian as soon as the commissioner receives it marys next piece of news is devastating back in julian mallins had kindly sent a note he had retained in his files see overleaf sent to him by geoffrey shaw junior to michael hill for the defence in the libel trial in the note shaw asks julian for my two diaries for an a diary and an economist diary in case michael asks to look at them julian passed the diaries to shaw and hill for inspection and told mary he is pretty sure that they would have gone through them thoroughly and clearly found nothing worthy of comment in them since they were not an issue in the libel trial julian added that it would be absolute rubbish to suggest that the stars lawyers could not have examined these two diaries which angela peppiatt had claimed in the criminal trial were almost entirely blank in court for other entries later julian wrote to mary english law in was not an ass if it had been michael hills suggestion that the alibi evidence was all true except for the date neither lord archer in the witness box nor the judge still less lord alexander nor i could have objected to michael hill going through the rest of the diary to find the same dinner date with the same companion at the same restaurant but on another date none of us had known anything of peppiatts pocket diary for in which she noted both her own and my engagements kept as her own property for over ten years but produced in court as my true diary for that year mary also tells me that she has written to godfrey barker about his earlier reference to dining with mr justice potts some time before the trial when the judge might have made disparaging remarks about me she now fears godfrey will disappear the moment the date of the appeal is announced day saturday january am i weigh myself yuk im fourteen stone two pounds yuk i lost eleven pounds during my three weeks at belmarsh falling to twelve stone seven pounds at wayland i put that eleven pounds back on in ten weeks despite being in the gym every day at nsc the food is better but because of my job i dont have time to go to the gym poor excuse on monday i must stop eating chocolate and return to the gym i am determined to leave the prison whenever around twelve stone eight pounds pm i have a visit from an inmate who was sentenced to three months which means hell serve around five or six weeks his crime the theft of while in a position of trust he was a policeman i am not going into much detail about his crime as im more interested in the problems a police officer faces when being sent to jail hes remarkably frank on his arrival he was placed in the north block and within minutes recognized a drug dealer hed arrested in the past he reported this to mr hughes the unit officer and was immediately placed in segregation overnight the duty governor had to make a decision the following morning as to which one to ship out he chose the drug dealer as he had recently proved positive for an mdt the policeman was put back on the north block given a job in the kitchen and told to keep his head down that was a week ago so far no one else has recognized him but he still has two weeks to serve incidentally he was originally charged with stealing which by the time the case came to court had dwindled to however that was three years ago and during that time he was suspended on full pay a little over the police and prison service dont seem to care how much taxpayers money they spend if either service were a private company they would be declared bankrupt within a year im not suggesting he shouldnt have been charged but i am saying it ought not to have cost over and taken three years to discover if hed stolen pm i stand in the drizzle watching the prison football team do a little better than last week however one of our best strikers jeannoel is called off when mr masters our coach receives a call over the intercom to say that jeannoel has a young lady waiting for him in the visits hall he runs off the pitch quickly showers and changes and joins his girlfriend at the time we are in the lead we lose pm at tea i felt i had to chastise jeannoel for getting his priorities wrong and letting the team down after all surely the match was more important than seeing his girlfriend and in any case how could he forget that she was coming he laughed and explained that theyd had a row during the week and she told him she wouldnt be turning up she did and we lost pm another pile of letters awaits me in the hospital including a long handwritten missive from john major who among other things mentions that hes heard that im writing a prison diary he suggests that reporting the facts will be both interesting and informative but he also wants to hear about my personal feelings on the issues and the people involved he adds that hes not surprised that the public have been so supportive he says he got far more sympathy and backing when he lost an election than when he won one day sunday january pm the members of club hospital meet for tea and biscuits however as brian ostrich farm keith knowingly etc and john fraud were released this week and david fraud and malcolm fraud are on town leave our little band of miscreants has dwindled to five we discuss whether we should ask anyone else to join the club as if we were all attending a conservative committee meeting and lets face it the conservative party seem to be suffering from a similar problem some of them have been released and several more are on temporary leave but just like prison one must wonder just how many will in time return pm i spend a quiet evening reading and bringing the diary up to date day monday january am the duty night officer wakes me and asks for an ice pack i take one out of the fridge and ask if he needs any help no he says without explanation and dashes off am the same officer wakes me again when he returns accompanied by a prisoner called davis who has a large swelling on his forehead and cuts over his face mr hayes explains that the inmate has been in a fight and the window in his door has shattered leaving glass all over the floor the prisoner cant remain in his room because if he were to be injured by a piece of broken glass he could sue the prison service for negligence can you believe it while we make up his bed davis tells me that the other prisoner involved in the fight was his cellmate smith one of eleven smiths currently at nsc who has now been moved to the south block they have shared a pad for eight months a sort of forced marriage smith who works in education often needs to borrow cigarettes davis got sick of this and refused to hand over his tobacco so smith took a swipe at him davis claims he didnt retaliate as hed recently been up on a charge of taking marijuana and didnt need to be nicked again once smith had calmed down davis decided to leave the room as he opened the door smith picked up a table leg that had broken off during the fight and took a swipe at davis hence the shattered glass and the cuts and bruises it doesnt add up and i feel sure davis will have refined his story by the time he comes up in front of the governor mind you id like to hear smiths version of what took place am both prisoners involved in last nights fracas have to be passed as fit before they come up for adjudication at ten oclock they sit chatting to each other like bosom buddies in the corner of the waiting room noon over lunch i learn that the two fighting inmates have both had a fortnights wages deducted from their pay packets to cover the damage they caused to the furniture and the broken window in their room they also have had seven days added to their sentence this is significant for smith because he was due to be released in two weeks time im told the reason they didnt get a tougher punishment was because both apologized to the governor and then to each other they left almost holding hands pm i go off to the canteen to buy some oxo cubes evian water two phonecards and a tin of princes ham no chocolate mr blackman the officer on duty asks me if i want a valentine card and produces a large selection for me to consider they are all about a foot high in size and contain some of the worst rhyming couplets i have ever come across more interesting is that there are just as many cards for men as for women i obviously dont mask my surprise because mr blackman sighs and says if i didnt supply them in equal numbers id be accused of discrimination day tuesday january am ten new prisoners who arrived from leicester last night are waiting to see the doctor while they sit around one of them boasts that he can always beat any drugs test even fool the breathalyser although lee is well aware im writing a diary hes still quite willing to reveal his secrets lee is in his midtwenties good looking and well built however after one look at the inside of his arm theres no doubt that hes on drugs and heaven knows what state hell be in in ten years time how can you beat an mdt i ask easy he says and produces a tiny bar of soap from his jeans pocket the kind you find in the washbasin of any small hotel he breaks the soap in half puts it in his mouth and begins to suck it as if it were a hardboiled sweet what difference does that make i enquire if im tested in the next few hours my urine sample will be so cloudy that they wont be able to charge me and theyre not allowed to test me again for another twentyeight days by then i will have had enough time to wash everything out of my system i can even go on taking heroin up until the twentyfourth day its only cannabis that takes a month to clear out of the blood stream but that cant apply to the breathalyser no he says laughing but ive got two ways of beating the breathalyser he produces three pennies from another pocket and begins to suck them after a few moments he removes them and claims that the copper neutralizes the alcohol and it therefore wont register but what happens if the police dont give you enough time to put the coins in your mouth i can still beat them says lee using my special breathing technique every prisoner in the waiting room is now hanging on his every word and when the next patient is called in to see the doctor he doesnt move for fear of missing the final instalment when the police hand you the machine to blow into lee continues aware of his captive audience you pump out your chest but you dont take a deep breath for the next four seconds you blow in very little air until the machine registers orange you hand back the machine and gasp as if youve given everything youll get away with it because green is negative and orange is still clear its only the red you have to worry about and they cant charge you once youve registered orange and he goes on if your eyes are blurred or vacant i also have a way of getting over that problem theres a product you can buy over the counter from any chemist called z which was developed for clubbers to stop their eyes getting irritated by smoke a combination of the copper careful breathing and z and youll never be charged am one of the inmates has been put on suicide watch hes a lad of twentyone five foot five seven and a half stone and terrified of his own shadow hes in for driving while disqualified and will be released in two weeks time he turns up at eleven to collect two new sheets and hands over two in a plastic bag because he wet them last night while i go off to the cupboard to collect new sheets he walks around in small circles muttering to himself gail cant be sure if its all an act because hes currently working on the farm and some prisoners will go to any lengths to get themselves off that detail in fact when he learns that he will be granted a change of job he smiles for the first time however gail cant afford to take any risks so she writes out a detailed report for the unit officer suicide watch in this particular case means that an officer mr jones will have to check on the inmate every hour until all concerned are confident he is back to normal this usually takes two to three days ill keep you informed pm doug has the flu and carl is at singing practice with the cons and pros so im on my own for the evening i read a paper on the effects of heroin on children written by dr simon wills i never imagined that dr wills would replace freddie forsyth as my bedtime reading day wednesday january am two new inductees arrive from nottingham acat a young man serving four months for a driving offence tells me that on his block at nottingham they had three suicides in three weeks and all of them prisoners who had not yet been convicted the other inmate nods and tells me that he was made to share a cell with a man who was injecting himself with vinegar because he couldnt afford heroin day thursday january am mr lewis drops in to see linda as its his last official day as governor hes handed in his keys handcuffs whistle torch identity card and everything else that denoted his position of authority an experience he obviously didnt enjoy he jokes about suddenly becoming aware of afternoon television and endless advertisements for comfortable chairs that move with the press of a button beds that change shape when you turn over and baths that you can easily get out of mr lewis smiles says goodbye and we shake hands i suspect that we will never meet again as we both head towards the world of zimmer frames am mr mcquity the national health inspector pays a visit to nsc and leaves linda in no doubt that hes well satisfied with the way she is running the prison hospital pm the press is full of stories about the problems the prison service is facing because of overcrowding there are currently a maximum of bed spaces and just over of them are taken up the home secretary david blunkett has the choice of releasing people early or building more prisons hes just announced that tagging will be extended from two months to three with effect from april this would get me out three months early if on appeal my sentence is lowered by even a day pm among this afternoons inductees is a prisoner from lincoln who has only three weeks left to serve he hasnt stopped complaining since the moment he arrived hes demanding a single room with a tv and a bedboard because he suffers from a bad back all prisoners start life at nsc in a double room and there are several inmates who have been around for some months and still dont have a tv and as for the bedboard all four are out at the moment within an hour of leaving the hospital the inmate was discovered lying on his back in the car park next to the governors car when mr leighton was called to deal with the problem he said he could see no reason why the prisoner shouldnt sleep in the car park and drove away the inmate returned to his allocated room within the hour hes been no trouble since day friday february am among those on the paper chase today is a young man who has not yet celebrated his thirtieth birthday but has been to jail eighteen times hes a smalltime burglar who has and this is the important point no fear of prison for him its a temporary inconvenience in his chosen career because he has no record of violence or involvement with drugs hes rarely sentenced to more than six months he spends a few days in an acat before being transferred to a dcat open prison nsc provides him with three meals a day a room and the company of fellow professionals when he leaves he will go on stealing until he is caught again he will then be arrested sentenced and return to nsc the nearest dcat to his home in boston he was very distressed to learn last year that the home office was considering closing the prison he earns between fifty and a hundred thousand a year no taxes according to how many months he spends on the out in any particular year mr hocking head of security tells me that this young man has a long way to go before he can beat greville the cat burglar who left nsc last year at the age of sixtythree declaring he now had enough to retire on during a fulltime career of crime greville was sentenced on thirtyone occasions not a record and preferred nsc where he was always appointed as reception orderly within days of checking back in so professional was he at his chosen occupation that if there was a burglary in his area with absolutely no trace of entry fingerprints or any other clues the local police immediately paid a visit to grevilles home greville has since retired to a seaside bungalow to live off his profits and tend his garden and thereby hangs another tale which mr hocking swears is true greville was the prime suspect when some valuable coins went missing from a local museum a few days later the police received an anonymous tipoff reporting that greville had been seen burying something in the garden a team of police arrived within the hour and started digging they were there for five days but found nothing greville later wrote and thanked the chief constable for the excellent job his men had done in turning over his soil particularly for the way theyd left everything so neat and tidy pm i have my hair cut by the excellent prison barber gary half a phonecard i want to look smart for my visitors on sunday pm friday is kit change day for every inmate the hospital has its own allocated time because we require twenty new towels six sheets twelve pillowcases and several different items of cleaning equipment every week while the chief orderly mark armed robbery ten years selects a better class of towel for the hospital he tells me about an inmate who has just come in for his weekly change of clothes this particular prisoner works on the farm and never takes his clothes off from one week to the next not even when he goes to bed he has a double room to himself because surprise surprise no one is willing to share a pad with him mark wonders if he does it just to make sure he ends up with a single room i find it hard to believe anyone would be willing to suffer that amount of discomfort just to ensure they were left alone before you ask because i did the prison service cannot force him to wash or shave it would violate his human rights day saturday february am mr berlyn drops by hes agreed to lindas suggestion that a drug specialist visit the prison to give me an insight into the problems currently faced by young children in schools but mr berlyn goes one step further and tells me about an officer from stocken prison who regularly visits schools in east anglia to tell schoolchildren why they wouldnt want to end up in prison and it may be possible for me once ive passed my fled to accompany him and learn about drugs firsthand if my sentence is cut i would be allowed to visit schools immediately rather than going through the whole learning process after my appeal am sister is just about to close surgery when a very depressedlooking inmate hobbles in ive caught the crabs he says his hand cupped around the top of his trousers sister unlocks the door to the surgery and lets him in he looks anxious and linda appears concerned he slowly unzips his jeans in obvious pain and places his hands inside linda and i stare as he slowly uncups his hands to reveal two small live crabs which he passes across to linda she recoils while i burst out laughing aware that we will be the butt of prison humour for some weeks to come oh my god says linda as she stares down at his unzipped jeans i dont like the look of that i think ill have to take a blood sample the inmate rushes out of the door his jeans falling around his knees honour restored except that he has the last laugh because its the hospital orderly me who ends up taking the two crabs back down to the sea pm an inmate was caught in the visitors car park in possession of two grammes of heroin on the outside two grammes of heroin have a street value of inside prison each gramme will be converted into ten points and each point will be made into three sales each sale will be onethird heroin and twothirds crushed paracetamol which can be picked up any day from the hospital by a prisoner simply claiming to have a headache each sale is worth so the dealer ends up with for two grammes almost four times the market price some dealers are happy to remain in prison because they can make more money inside than they do on the out the inmate concerned claims a man who was visiting another prisoner handed him a packet in the car park the head of security is aware who the visitor was but cant charge him because he wasnt caught in the act he also knows which prisoner the heroin was destined for but hes also in the clear because he never received it day sunday february am i rise early and write for two hours pm my visitors today are my son will and chris beetles will takes me through the preparations for my appeal on sentence which are almost complete as both pieces of research on perjury and an attempt to pervert the course of justice show that eighteen months would historically be a high tariff for a first offender chris brings me up to date on everything thats happening in the art world pm at club hospitals sunday afternoon tea party david fraud schoolmaster reveals that brian ostrich farm fraud and john fraud are both having trouble since being released brian is waking in the middle of the night sweating because hes frightened he wont make it back in time for the pm checkin and john is stressed because he hasnt been able to find a job pm once the club members have left i settle down to make myself some supper in a large soup bowl a gift from william i place the contents of a tin of princes ham two packets of walkers crisps and an oxo cube hot water is then poured on top what a combination i eat while reading street drugs by andrew tyler which is my set text for the week the food is wonderful the book harrowing day monday february am a young lad from the north block who only has two weeks to serve of a threemonth sentence has been found in his room with his head in a noose made from a sheet hanging from the end of his bed the slightly built lad who must be about twentyone reminds me of the boy having sand kicked into his face in those charles atlas advertisements i saw when i was a child he is taken to the hospital to be interviewed by mr berlyn dr harris and sister behind closed doors hes certain to be placed on red suicide watch with an officer checking on him every thirty minutes mr berlyn tells me that theyve never had a suicide at nsc because if a prisoner is that desperate he usually absconds the real problem arises in closed prisons from which there is no escape there were seventythree suicides in prisons last year and not one of them was at a dcat just as mr berlyn leaves the lad who wets his bed reappears with a black bag containing two more sheets i supply him with two clean sheets and he leaves looking even more helpless than the suicide case youd never think this was a mens prison pm i watch four videos on the subject of heroin im slowly gaining more knowledge about drugs through reading videos and my daytoday work as hospital orderly but i still have no firsthand experience i go over to see david in the carat counselling assessment referral advice throughcare office he is willing to let me attend one of his drug counselling sessions as long as the other participants agree because ill be the only one who isnt currently and never has been an addict pm i attend the drug rehab discussion in the carat office david asks the five other inmates if any of them object to my presence they all seem pleased that ive taken the trouble to attend david opens the discussion by asking if they feel that once they are released theyll be able to resist going back on drugs and in particular heroin one of them is adamant that he will never touch a drug again his relationship with those he loves has been ruined and he wonders if anyone will ever be willing to employ him he tells the group that he had reached the stage where he would steal from anyone including his own family to make sure he got his fix and just before he was arrested he needed four fixes a day to satisfy his addiction the next participant says that his only thought on waking was how to get his first fix once hed begged borrowed or stolen the needed hed go in search of a dealer as soon as hed got his half gramme of heroin hed run back to his house and often with his wife and two children in the next room he would place the powder in a large tablespoon to which he would add water and the juice from any citrus fruit he would then stir the mixture until he had a thick brown liquid which he would pour onto a piece of aluminium foil and then warm it with a match he would then sniff it up through a straw one of the inmates butts in and adds that he preferred to smoke it however all of them agree that the biggest kick came when you injected it the lad from scarborough then lifts the sleeve of his denim jacket and his trouser leg and declares that gets difficult when there are no veins left to inject the one who so far hasnt said a word chips in for the first time he tells us that hes been off heroin for five weeks and still cant sleep and what makes it worse is that his roommate snores all through the night the dealer jumps in youll start getting to sleep after about eight weeks and then it gets better and better each day until youre back to normal i ask what he means by that once youre an addict you dont need a fix to make you feel good you need one just so you can return to normal thats when you become a smack head in between fixes you start shaking and the worse you are the more desperate you become to return to normal and jeff he adds if youre planning to talk about the problem in schools you should start with the eleven year olds because by fourteen its too late in scarborough goodlooking wellbroughtup welleducated fourteenyearold girls approach me all the time for their daily fix the last person to participate is another dealer who claims he only dealt because the profits allowed him to finance his own drug addiction from eight in the morning to ten at night his mobile would ring with a nonstop flow of requests from customers he assures me that hes never needed to solicit anyone he tells the groups that hes been off heroin for nearly seven months and will never deal in or take drugs again i dont feel that confident after he adds that he can earn a day as a seller he ends the session with a statement that takes me but no one else in the room by surprise nearly all my friends are in jail or dead hes thirtyone years old day tuesday february am i put my pen down after a couple of hours of writing to switch on the today programme britain is in the middle of a rail strike theres no station at north sea camp am two of the inmates who attended last nights drugs counselling meeting are up on a nicking once the doctor has pronounced them fit they will attend an adjudication chaired by governor leighton one of them tested positive for cannabis on his latest mdt and adds ruefully that he expects to be shipped out to a bcat prison later today now i know why he hardly spoke at yesterdays meeting he also looks as if he didnt sleep last night pm the newspapers are full of stories about david blunketts proposed prison reforms which seem no more than common sense anyone with a noncustodial sentence for a nonviolent first offence will be placed on immediate tagging with weekend custody and possibly having to report to a police station every evening for lesser offences they would be tagged immediately with a curfew of pm to am a second offence and they would be sent to prison as of february the prison population stood at and the prediction is that already overcrowded prisons will be under additional pressure following lord chief justice woolfs recent pronouncement on mobile phone muggers pm three more manuscripts arrive in the post today with letters asking if i could critique them four publishers have turned one down another says his wife who is his sternest critic thinks its first class and the final one seeks my advice on vanity publishers socalled vanity publishers are only too happy to publish your book if along with the script you enclose a cheque for pm one of todays inductees is a mr t blair he has been sentenced to six months for disturbing the peace but with remission and tagging expects to be released after only eight weeks the other mr t blair looks set to serve at least eight years pm i still marvel at what prisoners will have the nerve to ask sister for today one inmate has demanded a bottle of aftershave because he has a skin problem im about to burst out laughing when linda hands him a bottle and he leaves without another word why cant he buy one in the canteen i ask you cant buy aftershave in the canteen linda reminds me it contains alcohol and several inmates would happily drink it but youve just given nonalcoholic aftershave supplied especially for prison hospitals on your day of release linda reminds me any prisoner can demand a free needle to inject himself with heroin as well as a packet of condoms day wednesday february am i cant believe how stupid some people can be on monday i attended a carat meeting where one of the participants told everyone present that he had given up drugs on tuesday the same man comes up in front of the governor for failing an mdt for cannabis seven days were added to his sentence and he told me he considered himself lucky not to be shipped out last night the same man was caught on his way back from boston in possession of a plastic bag full of drugs that included cannabis and heroin he was locked up in the segregation cell overnight and will be shipped out this morning to a bcat with a further twentyone days added to his sentence his stupidity is not the only aspect of this incident worth considering if hed been caught with such an assignment of drugs on the out he would have been sentenced to at least seven years but as his sentence is already fourteen he gets away with twentyone days added its just another pointer to the drugs problem this country is currently facing am mary has a piece in peterborough that she came across on the web it makes me laugh so much its simply better to reproduce it rather than attempt any precis see below woman of substance lady archers sense of humour is alive and well the fragrant chemist has just submitted a hazardous materials data sheet to the chemistry at cambridge newsletter element woman symbol wo discoverer adam atomic mass accepted as kg but known to vary from kg to kg occurrence found in large quantities in

cleaning agent hazards highly dangerous except in experienced hands illegal to possess more than one although several can be maintained at different locations as long as specimens do not come into direct contact with each other the telegraph also publishes the results of a poll on mr blunketts recent pronouncements that nonviolent firstoffence prisoners should be able where possible to continue their work while reporting into jails in the evenings and at weekends per cent say keep them locked up while only per cent feel the home secretary is right to consider legislation along these more realistic lines i must confess that before id been to prison i would have been among the per cent pm i phone mary who tells me before i can get beyond hello that baroness nicholson has finally issued a statement in which she offers a grudging apology see below baroness nicholson wishes to make it quite clear that at no time did she intend to suggest that lord archer had personally misappropriated money raised by the simple truth appeal indeed it had not occurred to her to think that it might have been possible for lord archer to gain access to funds raised by the british red cross if tho inference was drawn that she was accusing lord archer of having stolen simple truth money from the british red cross she regrets the misunderstanding and regrets any upset that may have been caused to lord archers family day thursday february am mr berlyn strides in at a brisk pace after a few minutes ensconced with sister in her office he emerges to tell me that the home office has issued an overcrowding draft as all the prisons in the north of england are fully occupied result we will be getting ten new inmates today and will be surplus to our manifest of here at nsc we are already seeing those overcrowding statistics translated into reality mr berlyn has directed that two inmates will have to be billeted in the hospital overnight i fear i will be experiencing a lot of this during the next few weeks and i may without warning have to share heaven with some other sinners however as six inmates are being released tomorrow this might be only temporary pm linda and gail charge out of the hospital carrying an oxygen cylinder and two firstaid boxes all im told is that a staff member has fallen off a ladder on the intercom its announced that all security officers must report to the south block immediately its like being back in an acat where this was a daily occurrence prisoners tell me that in nottingham ambulances were more common than black marias a few minutes later linda and gail return with a shavenheaded officer covered in blood it seems that he leaned back while climbing a ladder and overbalanced landing on the concrete below no prisoner was involved i quickly discover that a small head wound can spurt so much blood that it appears far worse than it is when linda has finished cleaning up her patient and ive given him a cup of tea only the english hes smiling and making light of the whole episode but linda still wants to dispatch him to the pilgrim hospital for stitches to the scalp wound and both she as hospital sister and mr hocking head of security have to fill in countless forms showing that no prisoner was responsible pm i read another chapter of street drugs this time to learn more about crack cocaine its properties and its consequences its quite difficult not to accept the argument that some young people having experimented with one drug and got a kick out of it might wish to progress to another simply to discover if the sensation is even more exciting pm only one of the extra two inmates allocated to spend the night in the hospital appears at my door a blanket and sheet under his arm it seems they found a bed for the other arrival hes very quiet despite the fact that hes being released tomorrow he slips into bed and simply says goodnight jeff am i that frightening day friday february am what do you think youre doing you fucking dickhead im about to explain to my overnight companion that i write for a couple of hours every morning but when i turn to face him i realize hes still fast asleep its the first occasion someones sworn in front of me for a long time even in their sleep and it brings back memories of belmarsh and wayland i continue writing until seven when i have to wake him morning jeff he says by the time i emerged from the bathroom hes disappeared his sheets and pillowcases folded neatly at the end of the bed by now hell be in reception signing his discharge papers and by eightthirty will be on his way a free man the prison is entitled to keep you until midnight on the day of your release but youre usually off the premises by nine oclock pm our two new inductees today are somewhat unusual and not just because theyre both lifers we now have lifers out of occupants the first one tells me that hes been in jail for twentythree years and hes only thirtynine the second one limps into the hospital and spends a considerable time with sister behind closed doors later when i take his blood pressure and check his weight he tells me that hes already served fourteen years and two years ago he contracted encephalitis once ive filled in his chart and handed it to linda i look up encephalitis in the medical dictionary poor fellow life imprisonment he may deserve encephalitis he does not day saturday february pm mary and james visit me today and its far from being a social event mary even has a written agenda i do adore her on the domestic front she has purchased a small victorian mirror for the hall and seeks my approval she goes on to tell me that baroness nicholson has written saying that she wants to end the feud claiming that she never intended anyone to think that i had misappropriated any funds in the first place in which case how did i end up in a cell three paces by five banged up for fourteen hours a day at wayland if the police and prison service misunderstood her baroness nicholson wrote to sir john stevens commissioner of the metropolitan police in july demanding an investigation into the involvement of jeffrey archer in funds raised and spent through the simple truth appeal this precipitated not only a police enquiry but a lengthy and expensive investigation by kpmg on behalf of the red cross baroness nicholsons insinuation that i had stolen money from the appeal was irresponsible and wholly without foundation and on january the police closed their enquiry in view of the lack of any evidence from the informant as for the prejudice of mr justice potts it remains to be seen whether godfrey barker is still willing to make a witness statement he has confirmed on many occasions in the presence of several witnesses that potts at a dinner party he and his wife attended railed against me for some considerable time pm when my name is called over the tannoy to report to reception i assume that james has left something for me at the gate ive been expecting a dozen west wing tapes that will first have to go to the library before i can take them out my gift turns out to be eight tapes twelve cds and three dvds not from james but from an anonymous member of the public so i cant even write to thank them someone else has sent seven books of firstclass stamps and a packet of stamped envelopes after hearing how many letters im receiving every day mr garley the duty officer explains that i cant have the stamps could be exchanged for drugs but i can have the stamped envelopes prison logic shouldnt the rule be universal to all prisons at belmarsh a category a prison stamps are permitted i make no comment its not mr garleys fault and he cant do anything about it day sunday february am gail is angry shes recently bought a smart new dark green peugeot which she parks outside the hospital yesterday one of the prisoners put matchsticks in her locks so that when she tried to open the door she pushed the matchstick further in and jammed the lock pm club hospital meets for tea and biscuits one of our new members who has only been with us for a month will be released tomorrow he was charged with road rage and sentenced to three months he will have spent six weeks in prison ive watched him carefully at our gettogethers and as he goes about his business around the prison he is well educated well mannered and looks quite incapable of swatting a fly he tells the group that he stopped his car to go to the aid of a woman who was being attacked but for his troubles got punched to the ground by what turned out to be her boyfriend the two of them then drove off he returned home but was later arrested for road rage as the woman bore witness that he attacked her had he gone to the police station first and reported them for assault the other man would now be in jail not him he has lost his job with the pharmaceutical company hes been with for twentyone years and is worried about getting another one now he has a criminal record his wife has stuck by him and she hopes that one of his old firms rivals will want to take advantage of his expertise he later wrote to tell me that his old firm took him back the day he was released and treated the six weeks absence as holiday on full pay this brings me onto the subject of wives of the seven married club members present today two of their wives have had to sell their homes and move to smaller houses in another area two have had to go out to work full time while trying to bring up children three in one case two in the other and the other two have received divorce petitions while in jail im the seventh i make no excuse for the crimes committed but i feel it bears repeating that its often the wives who suffer even more than the husbands for them there is no rehabilitation programme day monday february am one of the prisoners waiting to be seen by dr walling this morning is a regular attendee today he somehow managed to get a nail stuck in his head it only grazed the surface of his skull but produced a lot of blood once gail has cleaned and bandaged him up he asks could i have rust on the brain pm the prison is jampacked at lock up last night two inmates have been released this morning and three new prisoners arrived this afternoon from leicester they couldnt be more different one is eighteen and serving a sixweek sentence for a roadtraffic offence he has only two more weeks to serve before taking up a place at leicester university in september to read mathematics the second is around twentyfour he is doing six months for punching someone in a pub he requests counselling for his drink problem drink is considered by the prison authorities to be just as much a drug as cannabis or heroin the third is serving six years for gbh a year of which he spent in belmarsh pm i attend the weekly carat meeting but one of the prisoners objects to my presence so i leave immediately the drugs counsellor tells me later that because ive never been an addict myself and am writing a diary he doesnt feel free to express himself while im there fair enough i settle down to read the latest booklet on the subject of addiction is your child on drugs no thank god however its a fascinating read it is not uncommon for a child to start smoking at seven eleven is the norm so its no surprise that some children are hooked on heroin by the age of fourteen day tuesday february am we have a full surgery this morning three for release two for a weeks temporary release and eleven with imagined or real illnesses dr allwood a thorough and conscientious man always takes his time in fact after forty minutes one of the inmates in the waiting room complains about how long hes taking gail leaps out of the surgery and tells the prisoner that her husband visited his gp last week and had to sit around for three hours and that was after having to wait a week before he could make an appointment the inmate snarls chris a lifer murdered his wife rolls up his sleeve and shows me a faded scar on the inside of his arm i did that he says thrusting it under the gaze of the complaining prisoner who looks surprised yeah he continues stabbed in the middle of the night by my padmate wasnt i and when i pressed the emergency button no screws came to help me because i was on the top floor chris now has the full attention of the rest of the surgery no doctor at gartree to come to my aid so i sewed it up myself i look at his faded scar in disbelief but gail nods to confirm shes seen many examples of amateur stitching over the years just a needle and thread was all i needed he adds am mr berlyn marches into the hospital and says he needs an urgent word with me we go into the ward he has been in touch with mr le sage at hmp stocken about my accompanying him when he gives his talk to schools on the problems of young people becoming involved in drugs and ending up in prison the good news is that mr le sage is looking for a new prisoner to assist him and has agreed to travel up to nsc next monday to talk about the possibility of my working alongside him this is the best news ive had since being appointed hospital orderly escaping the confines of nsc visiting schools and feeling im doing something worthwhile must be the next step on this particular journey i thank mr berlyn and once again have something to look forward to next monday pm only two new inductees today because the prison is full when i check my board i note one of them is called blackburn we already have a blackburn i tell the young lad sitting in front of me yeah thats my dad he says he was my codefendant i smell a story youll never believe what were in for jeff he adds i remain silent we were caught stealing lion bars and got three and a half years that sounds a bit rough i venture foolishly yeah well i have to admit jeff it was fortysix tons of em with a street value of nearly two hundred grand but how do you fence chocolate bars he laughs we already had a buyer at what price forty grand so how did you get caught one of the night watchmen who was part of our team grassed us up didnt he why he was up for a minor charge of burglary and did a deal with the scum did he get off yeah they dropped the charge didnt they but nicked him for somethin else a couple of months later and then they banged him up in the scrubs with my father pm mr hocking drops in to say that hes pleased i might be going out to assist a prison officer with his drugs talk hes already informed the governor that i am not considered a security risk hes only been with me a couple of minutes when his radio intercom asks him to report back to the security office immediately weve had another one are the only words i clearly hear i look suitably inquisitive weve got a serial informer he explains he writes every day telling us who the drug dealers are and where well find the next drop so far hes been on the button every time do you know who the informer is i ask no idea dont want to know he replies all i can tell you is that the handwriting is the same every time day wednesday february am i dreamed last night about a lovely man called john bromley brommers to his friends who died of cancer a few days ago i had the privilege of working with him you didnt work for john even though he was the head of itvs sport he had an amazing gift of making even the tea lady feel part of the team if you had a love of sport good humour fine wine and beautiful women he was quite simply the best company a man could ask for i predict that his memorial service will be as well attended as any prime ministers i only hope im out in time to be there am a beautiful black labrador called bessie saunters into the hospital accompanied by two officers from the drug squad i am told to wait in the lobby while bessie goes about her work through the closed door i can hear her padding around sniffing for drugs among my personal possessions if bessie can read shell find several books pamphlets and papers on drugs but until you can fail an mdt for ribena bovril or evian not much else the other prisoners sitting in the lobby waiting to see the doctor cant mask their surprise a few moments later the door is opened and bessie reappears and as she passes by ignores me a good sign because if bessie starts to sniff you youre in trouble if she licks you youll be up on a charge i ought to be pleased but when i return to the ward bessies pawprints are everywhere and i scrubbed the floor only yesterday am mr hocking explains that the drug search had a purpose they are about to make a big swoop following another tipoff and he wanted the other inmates to see that i was not exempt from being searched by now everyone in the prison will know and some might even wonder if im about to be shipped out i suspect the real search will take place later today pm i have a legal visit from my solicitors tony morton hooper and lord mishcon now aged eightyfour its kind of him to endure the sevenhour round trip we spend the next two hours preparing for the upcoming appeal not that a date has yet been fixed pm doug tells me that we are to have a new governing governor called mr beaumont as he was governor of leicester prison there will be a lot of inmates who can brief us about him day thursday february am i no longer have breakfast in the main hall because linda supplies me with a box of cornflakes once a week and a half pint of milk every day today she added a new luxury a banana am one of the prisoners in surgery this morning needs a weekend leave form signed by the doctor to show he is fit to be out of prison yesterday his leave was revoked because he drew out a large sum of money from his canteen account leaving a balance of only you cannot take weekend leave unless you have at least in your account it is assumed that if you empty your account then youre probably going to abscond this seems unlikely in this case as the prisoner has only two weeks of his sentence left mr berlyn shows some common sense allows the prisoner to put p back into the account and signs his weekend leave pass noon lunch in the canteen potato bake and cabbage followed by sponge cake covered and i mean covered in custard i never eat the second course but take it because carl can always eat two portions pm dr harris is on duty and his first responsibility is to sign the discharge papers for eight prisoners who will be released tomorrow all of them have been granted tagging status which allows them to leave two months early as long as they remain in their homes between the hours of pm and am these hours can be flexible if it affects their job when i first arrived at nsc and worked as the orderly in the sentence management unit the tagging board of mr berlyn and mr simpson used to agree to about per cent of those eligible for this privilege now all eight are granted on the same day caused by the problem of overcrowding including a twentythreeyearold whos already been to prison four times lee admits that he was shocked when the board granted him tagging status as his offence was punching someone on the nose in a pub brawl and in any case he looks upon prison as a way of life in fact his last comment to linda before leaving us was see you towards the end of the year if not before he turns to me and adds lets hope youre out by then jeff pm i sweep out the ward and mop the floor on alternate days i vacuum lindas little office removing bessies paw prints all very therapeutic pm i call mary she thanks me for the flowers that i asked alison to send her yesterday she then brings me up to date on angie peppiatt and mr justice potts pm i collect my post eleven valentine cards which i display in the ward for all to see plus several letters including one from john major and another from billy connolly many years ago when john was chancellor of the exchequer i asked him to open the extension to our new folly at the old vicarage at our annual summer party john described the building as marys second folly billy spoke next and immediately closed it day friday february am ive only just worked out why its the same five inmates who appear at the front of the queue every morning for medication linda as hospital sister will only allow them one days supply of drugs whereas in a surgery on the out she would prescribe enough for a week and in some cases even a month why you may ask a if a prisoner were given a months supply he might well take it all on one day b he could also trade his medication for other drugs the analgesic the inmates most commonly ask for is kapake which is a mixture of paracetamol and codeine the reason is that codeine will show up in mdt as an opiate and thus disguise illegal opiates the user can then protest but im taking kapake which the doctor prescribed prison doctors are now trying to limit the use of kapake and diazepam when a prisoner has a record of taking drugs c they could be lost or stolen result we have a long queue every morning for one days supply of medication so they will all be back tomorrow am mr beaumont the new governor has hit the ground running hes demanded that his office be repainted and all the furniture be replaced and it all has to be completed by the time he gets back from a visit to the home office tomorrow am mr vessey a security officer marches into the hospital his appearance usually means that a prisoner is about to be nicked for some offence i cant think of any offence ive committed recently other than being in possession of a bottle of ribena smuggled in by doug mr vessey who never makes any attempt to be friendly asks me to accompany him and takes considerable pleasure in marching me out of the hospital and across the camp several prisoners stare in disbelief he eventually tells me my name has come up on the computer for a random mdt test he escorts me into a portacabin where i am locked in a room with five other prisoners three of them look relaxed and are happily chatting while the other two are silent twitchy and look distinctly nervous a few minutes later i hear a key turning in the lock and another officer joins us four of us came up on the computer for a random test while two others are here on reasonable suspicion the serial grasser has undoubtedly offered up their names the officer then reads his authority to carry out such a test see overleaf before asking who would like to be tested first i stand up and follow him into an adjoining room the procedure is then explained to me see page and i am requested to sign a form saying i agree to the test i am then asked to strip and put on a dressing gown mr vessey hands me a plastic beaker and asks me to go to the lavatory next door and fill it with at least ml of urine having managed this i hand the beaker back to mr vessey who unseals two plastic tubes in my presence and then pours half the urine into each tube after i have initialled both he seals them and places them in a plastic bag which he also seals the bag is then deposited in the fridge he points out that my name is not on the bag only my number ff mandatory drug test authorisation form prison service chain of custody procedure having completed this procedure i sign another form to confirm that i am satisfied with the way the test has been conducted i am then released to return to the hospital despite this being a humiliating experience its one i thoroughly approve of although ive never got on with mr vessey he is a professional who cannot hide his contempt for anyone involved in drugs especially the dealers am one of the inmates up in front of the governor this morning has been charged with illegal possession of marijuana but with a difference when his room was raided they found him trying to swallow a small plastic packet they wrestled him to the ground and extracted the evidence from his mouth had he swallowed the contents they would not have been able to charge him the packet was one of those we supply from the hospital containing six paracetamol pills this one had an ounce of marijuana inside and the inmate ended up with seven days added to his sentence pm mr hocking appears in the hospital carrying a large attaché case and disappears into lindas office a few minutes later they both come out and join me on the ward the large plastic case is placed on a hospital bed and opened to reveal a drugs kit twentyone square plastic containers embedded in foam rubber show the many different drugs currently on the market for the first time i see heroin crack cocaine ecstasy tablets amphetamines and marijuana in every form linda and mr hocking deliver an introductory talk that they give to any prison officer on how to recognize the different drugs and the way they can be taken mr berlyn and his security team are obviously determined that i will be properly briefed before i am allowed to accompany mr le sage when we visit schools its fascinating at my age sixtyone to be studying a new subject as if i were a firstyear undergraduate pm the new governor mr beaumont is making a tour of the camp and spends seven minutes in the hospital a flying visit he has heard the hospital is efficiently run by linda and gail and as long as that continues to be the case gives them the impression that he will not be interfering day saturday february am yesterday i was frogmarched off to do an mdt today theres an announcement over the tannoy that there are voluntary drugs tests for those with surnames beginning ae these are known as dip tests because once again you pee into a plastic beaker but this time the officer in charge dips a little stick into the beaker and moments later is able to give you a result i walk across to the portakabin supply another ml of urine and im immediately cleared which makes yesterdays test somewhat redundant i later learn that one of the bs came up positive and he had to call his wife to let her know that he wont be allowed out on a town visit this weekend as it was a voluntary test i cant work out why he agreed to be tested am surgery is always slow at the weekend because the majority of inmates who appear with various complaints during the week in the hope that they will get off work remain in bed while all those who are fit never visit us in the first place am carl and an inmate called jason who is only with us for two weeks motoring offence turn up at the hospital together we remove all the beds from the ward and push them into the corridor before giving the hospital a spring clean jason tells me that on the out hes a painter and decorator and could repaint the ward during his twoweek incarceration i shall speak to the governor on monday because at a week this would be quite a bargain you may well ask why carl and jason helped me with the spring clean boredom the spring clean killed a morning for all of us pm i watch the prison football team lose and witness two more pieces of unbelievable stupidity by fellow inmates our goalkeeper who was sent off by the same referee the last time we played shouts obscenities at him again and is surprised when hes booked i fear he will be back in prison within months of being released but worse our centre forward is a prisoner whos just come out of the pilgrim hospital after a groin injury and has been told to rest for six weeks he will undoubtedly appear at surgery on monday expecting sympathy its no wonder the nhs is in such crisis if patients behave so irresponsibly after being given expert advice day sunday february am if i had been given the same sentence as jonathan aitken i would have been released today jonathan was sentenced to eighteen months and because he was a model prisoner only had to serve seven half minus two months on tag tomorrow i will not be returning home to my wife and family because mr justice potts sentenced me to four years instead i will be meeting mark le sage an officer from stocken prison who visits schools in lincolnshire warning children of the consequences of taking drugs i will remain at nsc until i know the result of my appeal but for the first time in seven months since my mothers funeral i will be able to leave the prison and return to the outside world day monday february am mr le sage does not turn up for our meeting the governor of hmp stocken has decided that they should not have to bear the cost of my accompanying mr le sage on any school visit as it would no longer be a voluntary activity that mr le sage would normally pursue in his offduty time as so often is the case in prisons someone will look for a reason for not doing something rather than trying to make a good idea work i cannot pretend that ive become so used to this negative attitude that i am not disappointed mr berlyn is also unable to mask his anger and seems determined not to be thwarted by this setback he has decided that nsc will send its own officer mr hocking as my escort so that i might still attend mark le sages lectures as i wont know if this suggestion will be vetoed until mr berlyn has spoken to the stockens governor i will continue in my role as hospital orderly am alan purser the prison drugs counsellor comes across to the hospital to give me a copy of the management of drug misuse in prisons by dr celia grummitt dr grummitt will become my new bedtime companion pm mr vessey has charged chris lifer murder and david lifer murder with being on the farm in possession of four potatoes and a cabbage in normal circumstances this would have caused little interest even in our selfcontained world however this will be the new governors first adjudication which we all await with bated breath day tuesday february am mr beaumont dismissed the charges against chris and david as a farm worker came forward to say hed given them permission to take the potatoes and the cabbage pm as part of my preparation for talking to children about the dangers and consequences of drugs i have a visit from a police officer attached to the lincolnshire drug squad her name is karen brooks shes an attractive thirtyfiveyearold blonde and single mother of two i mention this only to show that she is normal karen has currently served two and a half years of a fouryear assignment attached to the drug squad having been a member of the force for the past fourteen years hardly the tv image of your everyday drug officer she gives me a tutorial lasting just over an hour and perhaps her most frightening reply to my endless questions and she is brutally honest is that she has asked to be transferred to other duties as she can no longer take the daytoday strain of working with drug addicts karen admits that although she enjoys her job she wishes shed never volunteered for the drugs unit in the first place because the mental scars will remain with her for the rest of her life her son aged twelve is a pupil at one of the most successful schools in lincolnshire and has already been offered drugs by a fourteenyearold this is not a deprived school in the east end of london but a firstclass school in lincolnshire karen then tells a story that brings her almost to tears she once arrested a twelveyearold girl from a middleclass professional family for shoplifting a pair of socks from woolworths the girls parents were horrified and assured karen it wouldnt happen again two years later the girl was arrested for stealing from a lingerie shop and was put on probation when they next met the girl was seventeen going on forty three years of experimentation with marijuana cocaine ecstasy and heroin and a relationship with a twentyyearold drug dealer had taken their toll the girl died last month at the age of eighteen the dealer is still alive and still dealing as karen gets ready to leave i ask her how many officers are attached to the drug squad five she replies which means that only about per cent of our time is proactive while the other per cent is reactive she says that shell visit me again in two weeks time day sunday march am yesterday i read celia grummitts pamphlet on the misuse of drugs in prisons and the following facts bear repeating a seven million people in britain take drugs on a regular basis this does not include alcohol or cigarettes b sixteen million people in britain smoke cigarettes c drugrelated problems are currently costing the nhs the police service the prison service the social services the probation service and courts the country eighteen billion pounds a year d if britain did not have a drug problem and by that i mean abuse of class a drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine we could close per cent of our jails and there would be no waiting lists on the nhs e in fewer than people were taking heroin today its and for those of you who have never had to worry about your children just think about your grandchildren day wednesday march am mark le sage the young prison officer from hmp stocken visits me at the hospital hes been in the prison service for the past twelve years and for the last eight has spent many hours as a volunteer addressing schools in the norfolk area mr berlyn joins us as it was his idea that i should attend a couple of marks talks before i venture out on my own as i have not yet passed my fled ill have to be accompanied by mr hocking who has also agreed to carry out this task in his own time as nsc do not have the funds to cover the extra expense an hour mr berlyn says that hell write to the governor of hmp stocken today as mr le sage comes under his jurisdiction am blossom traveller see page is at the high court today for his appeal hes currently serving a fiveandahalfyear sentence for stealing cars and caravans hes grown his beard even longer as hes hoping that the judge will think hes a lot older than he is and therefore shorten his sentence he intends to shave the beard off as soon as he returns this evening pm blossom returns from his appeal and announces that a year has been knocked off his sentence it had nothing to do with the length of his beard because he was only in the dock for a couple of minutes and the judge hardly gave him a second look he had clearly read all the relevant papers long before blossom showed up pm blossom has already shaved off the beard the other interesting piece of information to come out of blossoms visit to the high court was that three cannabis dealers had their sentences halved from seven to three and a half years a sign of things to come day saturday march am blossom comes in to see sister hes in a dreadful state his wife has written to let him know that his oldest son aged twentynine is on heroin he asks me to fill out a form so that he can apply for compassionate leave he tells me that hes already got hold of a pair of handcuffs and he plans to chain the boy to a water pipe until he comes off the drug hes quite serious linda tells him firmly that his plan is neither legal or practical nor of much value to his son pm blossom has been granted two days compassionate leave he is such a strange mixture of high moral values and low life hes quite happy to steal caravans and cars which has been the reason for several of his family ending up in prison but is devastated when he discovers his son is on heroin this is a man who has been married for thirtysix years has eleven children and countless grandchildren and until now none of his offspring has ever been involved in drugs day sunday march pm my visitors today are ed streator the former us minister to the court of st jamess and later american ambassador to nato and quentin davies mp who is currently shadow secretary of state for northern ireland the ninety minutes fly by as both men have so much to tell me about whats happening where you all are i had forgotten that quentin was pps to kenneth baker when he was home secretary during that period he developed strong views on the reform of our penal system after becoming aware of the drug problem both inside and outside of prison he talks with refreshing frankness and honesty about both subjects ed adds a view from the other side of the atlantic and when we debate smoking cannabis he reminds me that california has recently passed a law to prevent anyone under the age of twentyone purchasing tobacco let alone cannabis in fact he adds in california its virtually illegal to smoke anywhere except in your own home quentin suggests that if tobacco was discovered today cigarettes would be illegal possession two years tobacconists five years pm stephen is the latest member to join club hospital sundays pm to pm hes currently serving a twoyear sentence for theft perverting the course of justice and false accounting but there are several twists he is a former captain in the adjutant generals corps and after being courtmartialled was sent to colchester prison an army establishment for the first month but because his sentence was more than twentyeight days he was automatically transferred into the prison system to complete his term and now for the second twist a european court ruling has recently determined that the armed forces disciplinary system is invalid and all prisoners serving a sentence resulting from a court martial must be released not only might stephen be set free but he will also be entitled to in compensation as well as being reinstated as a captain our masters in the hague have decided that you should not be arrested charged tried and convicted by your peers stephen tells me that there are such prisoners currently in british jails and he hopes to learn the outcome of this ruling in the next few weeks the final twist just before he was arrested stephen received a letter from his commanding officer to tell him that he was being considered for promotion to major day monday march am a man comes into surgery whom i despise drink drivers are the staple diet of nsc of the prisoners currently resident around per cent have been sentenced with driving offences sadly tony is not untypical tony is in his early fifties the father of five children by four women he currently lives with another woman on a caravan park in scunthorpe he pleaded guilty to his latest charge of driving whilst being disqualified and uninsured surely the time has come for all motorists to display as they do in france an insurance disc as well as a road fund licence for this his latest offence tony was sentenced to twelve months which in real terms means that if he is granted a tagging facility he will be released after four now here is the rub during the past twenty years he has been charged with twelve similar offences and sent to jail on seven separate occasions hes been banned from driving for four years and happily tells anyone who will listen that as soon as they release him hell be back behind the wheel it gets worse hes currently employed by a local garage as a secondhand car dealer and therefore has access to a variety of vehicles and admits he likes to get tankedup at the pub across the road once hes closed a sale he displays no remorse and has no fear of returning to prison he considers nsc to provide a slightly higher standard of living than the one he currently enjoys on a scunthorpe caravan park perhaps the time has come to change the offence for those who are regularly convicted of drink driving to one of potential manslaughter carrying with it a custodial sentence of four years in a closed prison and treat such people like any other violent criminals noon alison tells me that the bbc has been in touch about a programme on bestselling authors called reading the decades while accepting the fact that i cant appear on camera they ask if i could do a telephone interview they already have contributions from king grisham le carre forsyth cooper and rowling i ask governor leighton for a view and he says that hell seek advice from the home office mr leighton is unable to make the decision himself he reports back the following day that the bbc had already been in touch with the home office and they have been turned down pm mr beaumont sent a circular to all the officers at nsc a few days before he arrived which i obtained recently it gives you a flavour of the man see opposite i cant believe his secretary ever checked the piece for grammatical mistakes even an elevenyearold would have spotted the error in the last line i cant wait to meet him day wednesday march am gail rushes in slightly flushed shes been doorstepped by a woman from the news of the world who has discovered from an inmate that shes leaving nsc to take up another post the journalist is looking for stories and asked are you leaving because of archer gail replied that i am working as a hospital orderly and that i take the job very seriously am popular with both the officers and the other prisoners and am learning about drugs and their relevance in prison gail innocently asked how much they would pay for a story to which the journalist replied a couple of thousand pounds more if it was a big story that would show archer in a bad light am i am called in for a voluntary drugs test you can refuse but should you do so your privileges town visits canteen cash and weekend leave are likely to be rescinded i discover that two prisoners have come up positive one for amphetamines the other for cannabis by the end of the morning that number had risen to five all will appear in front of the governor for adjudication tomorrow noon an officer comes into the hospital and tells me that he once worked on the sex offenders unit at whitemoor prison and he could tell me enough stories to fill another volume give me an example i ask topping up his coffee he pauses for a moment we once had a young prisoner on b block who used to keep a budgerigar in his cell and the little bird became the most important thing in his life another prisoner living on the same wing sensing the lads vulnerability threatened to kill the budgie unless he gave him a blow job the prisoner reluctantly agreed within days the first prisoner had become a prostitute and the second his pimp the pimp would charge two phonecards for the prisoner to give a blow job and three to be buggered the pimp ended up making a hundred pounds a week and the budgie survived that was until an inmate grassed on him in the hope that the pimp would be transferred to another prison and he could take over his lucrative position both prisoners were moved to separate establishments the following day that morning the budgie was strangled day friday march governor berlyn comes to the hospital this morning and tells me that despite his efforts i will not be allowed to accompany mark le sage whenever he addesses school on the problem of drugs the governor of hmp stocken has told mr le sage that he will not permit such excursions even if an nsc security officer accompanies me the nation is currently in the grip of a massive drug epidemic with children of twelve being offered heroin in our playgrounds as part of my rehabilitation i have volunteered to visit schools in the lincolnshire area and talk to them about the problem to date i have had assistance from the local police drug squad the lincolnshire education authority and the medical team at nsc lead by dr walling so i can only wonder why the governor of stocken would want to stop such a worthwhile project perhaps the home office knows the answer day sunday march pm its been a week for visitors last sunday henry togna and david watson monday gilly gray qc wednesday lords hayhoe and denham bertie my old chief whip so now im up to date on the lords reform bill foxhunting and the state of margaret thatchers health not to mention the euro and when the planned referendum might or might not be i put an idea to bertie on the lords reform bill when to my horror he withdrew from an inside pocket a small memo recorder i glance over to the desk to see the duty officers chatting to each other i was relieved when bertie put the recorder back in his pocket we dont need another member of the house of lords as a resident of north sea camp day monday march am the papers are full of stories about the model naomi campbell who has been awarded against the daily mirror and its then editor piers morgan for breaching her privacy however the judge also states that she had deliberately lied when in the witness box norman tebbitt has asked through the press if she will be tried for perjury or do these laws only apply to conservative politicians pm mr belford comes to the hospital clutching the results of my mdt see opposite pm peter arson set fire to a police station has so far served thirtyone years you may recall that i earlier reported his first town visit this morning two officers arrived outside his room and took him down to the segregation cells which can only mean one thing hes going to be shipped out to a closed prison today i suspect that one trip to boston will be the last time he ever sees the outside world when i first came to nsc some months ago peter swept the main road that runs from the gate through to the office block some yards away with a sixfootfourinch frame peter had a presence you could not easily avoid but zero social skills and thirtyone years in prison twentyeight of them behind bars ensured that it was never going to be easy for him to settle every morning he would break away from his sweeping and open car doors for members of the female staff he would then engage them in long conversations harmless enough you may say but several of the younger girls felt harassed and didnt complain for fear it might harm peters parole prospects unfortunately these episodes continued despite several warnings from officers governor berlyn who is in charge of the lifers was left with little choice but to take action to allay the staffs fears he took peter off his job as a road sweeper and asked him to be a reception orderly peter made the tea and helped officers with minor tasks it was beyond him he lasted a fortnight they next moved peter to the officers mess to assist with cleaning and occasional serving he lasted ten days before being transferred to the farm as a shepherd where he survived less than a week before being sent to the kitchen this was no more successful and he has ended up in segregation prior to being moved back to the bcat peter is in his sixties and has no hope of returning to a dcat in under five years if ever this case highlights a bigger issue dont we have some duty to a human being other than to lock him up for the rest of his life peter failed to come to terms with the system so the system has failed him when i am eventually released i am going to be asked so many questions to which i do not know the answer day monday april am i listen to an announcement over the tannoy anyone wanting to assist with the special needs group trip to skegness please report to the bus at the front gate the word please should have given it away prison officers rarely if ever say please however two inmates still report to the gate in the hope of boarding the nonexistent bus to skegness the april fool prank played on me took a different form mr hewitt the head of the works department purchased a jigsaw puzzle of the house of lords at a carboot sale and told me he expected me to finish it by the end of the week as part of my anger management programme it took me two hours just to finish the border i intend to draft in all the members of club hospital to assist me with this piece monster day saturday april dr susan edwards reader of law at buckingham university has completed her independent study showing the harshness of my fouryear sentence the full report was published in the criminal law review of august jeffrey archer former deputy chairman of the conservative party and bestselling author was convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice arising from a libel action over whether he spent a particular night with a monica coghlan for which following a not guilty plea he received a prison sentence of four years as jeffrey archers prison sentence is the longest passed in any case of civil perjury and the sentence length is comparable to prison sentences passed in the gravest cases of criminal perjury including murder and police corruption it requires some rather more detailed consideration gilbert gray qc has already warned mary that hell be able to predict the outcome of my appeal as soon as he knows the makeup of the threejudge panel what a dreadful condemnation of british justice that my future will not be decided on whether im innocent or guilty but on who judges me day tuesday april nsc like most prisons in britain is badly understaffed we have over inmates and only fulltime officers meaning that there are never more than officers on duty at any one time the following advertisement appears in several local papers every week and elicits few replies see overleaf im told its no different for any of the other prisons in britain its hardly an appealing career other than for the truly dedicated believers in justice or someone not quite tall enough to get into the police force day friday april am dr walling arrives a few minutes late when stephen sherbourne margaret thatchers former political secretary visited me i told him that if you reported sick between and am any morning monday to friday you were guaranteed to see a doctor at nine oclock the same day stephen asked if i could think of a crime for which he would be sentenced to two weeks so he could get all his medical problems sorted out am murderer weds prison psychiatrist is the sort of headline one might expect to read in the sun today andy a lifer who has served twelve years has been granted a weeks leave he has been a model prisoner and expects to be released some time next year while he was in his previous prison ashwell part of his rehabilitation course included regular meetings with the prison psychiatrist and as the months passed they struck up a relationship i think it right to point out at this stage that andy is thirtyfive six foot one with the dark swarthy looks of an italian film star when he was transferred to nsc the psychiatrist visited him regularly a report of her visit was passed back to her own prison and she subsequently had to resign from the service she found a new job in loughborough and her relationship with andy continued to blossom today they were married at a ceremony in boston attended by five officers and nine prisoners nsc currently has twentythree resident murderers and i think ive met every one of them three of them including andy are among the gentlest people i have ever come across pm one of the inmates is refusing to take an mdt its well known that hes a heroin addict and has found yet another way to beat the system if he refuses to take the test the governor can only add twentyeight days to his sentence whereas if he agrees to take it and then proves positive for heroin he could be sentenced to fiftysix extra days and even be shipped out to a bcat however mr vessey points out that should he refuse a second time they can ship him out the same day day saturday april the new chapel orderly committed an unusual crime on the out he was an accounts executive for a wellknown furniture company he became head of the complaints department whose responsibility it was to ensure that when customers returned goods they received a refund and the article was returned to the stores seconds department one christmas the chapel orderly purchased a sofa for his mother but she didnt like it he returned the sofa and applied for a refund giving his own name and address the money was refunded quite legally it was then that the man realized that only he and the computer were aware of the transaction using a false name but his own address he authorized and presented a bogus claim and the computer happily credited his account by changing the name every time he could make a claim once a week and during the following year he supplemented his income by over the chapel orderly and his girlfriend she unwittingly lived in comfort as he became more and more confident upping the sums on a weekly basis and even giving himself a bonus over the christmas rush so how was he caught a secretary mistakenly opened a random file on her computer and was surprised by what she found how could people living at the same address all require a refund for different pieces of furniture theyd ordered over the past year the accounts executive pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years he is now the chapel orderly at nsc day monday april as part of his rehabilitation into society one of the lifers malcolm armed robbery has just started an outside job as a cleaner at haven high school the first day turned out to be a bit of a culture shock when he discovered how mature and selfconfident modern young women have become he repeated a conversation hed had this morning with a fourteenyearold who approached him in the corridor are you a convict yes i am what are you in for armed robbery how many years have you served fourteen fourteen years without sex the girl said in mock disbelief yes he repeated to which the girl lifted up her skirt and said well you must be up for it malcolm ran out of the building had she reported him for even talking about sex he probably would have been transferred back to a bcat the same day day wednesday may am strange goingson in the camp today tony a wellknown drug dealer has collapsed after taking an overdose only hours before hes due to be released what kind of problems can he have on the outside that he considers suicide a better way out than the front gate tony has been a regular at the hospital over the past few weeks so theres no way of knowing if hes been storing up pills and how many he swallowed today rather than wait for an ambulance tonys been rushed into the pilgrim hospital in the prison minibus accompanied by two officers ill know more tonight pm tony has just returned to the camp to spend his final night in jail they pumped out his stomach so hell still leave us at am tomorrow but how long will he survive on the outside pm i have just returned from an hours walk around the playing field with the intention of watching hendry vs doherty in the quarterfinal of the world championship snooker i was president of the world snooker association until i was arrested when the board asked me to resign two other bodies expelled me the royal society of arts and the mcc when theres a knock on my door its tony clutching a letter that he wants me to hand to sister but he asks me to read it first its a twosided handwritten missive apologizing for his behaviour over the past few weeks and thanking sister for her kindness and understanding i promise to give it to her tomorrow morning tony is just about to leave when i ask him if hed be willing to answer a few questions about drugs i quite expect him to tell me what i can do with myself using the usual prison vernacular but to my surprise he takes a seat in the waiting room and says ask me anything you want jeff i dont give a fuck im out of here first thing in the morning during the next hour i ask him question after question all of which he answers with a brutal frankness did you try to commit suicide no i just odd how often do you take heroin while ive been here usually four times a day when i wake in the morning just after dinner then again after tea and just before i go to bed do you inject it sniff it or smoke it smoke it tony replies only fuckin morons inject it ive seen too many crackheads get hiv or hepatitis b by injecting themselves with someone elses needle while ive been in jail ive seen needles used by a hundred different inmates dont forget jeff people in britain are regular heroin users and if you consider their families over a million people must be involved heroin costs the nhs three billion a year how do you get the heroin into prison there are several ways but the most common is to pick it up from a dealer when youre out on a weekend leave and then pack a couple of ounces in a condom and stuff it up your rectum no officer enjoys checking up there a couple of ounces that was all i could afford this time my record on the out was coming back from holland with seven ounces of marijuana how much would that be worth if its pure the best you could be talking around a hundred grand so when you bring the drugs back into the prison are they just for you no no no i have to pay my supplier on the out im only a dealer dealers are either kings or pawns im a pawn a king rarely takes drugs just brings them in from abroad and distributes them among his pawns most of whom only deal so they can satisfy their own craving so how many of the two hundred inmates at nsc are on heroin he pauses to consider the question thirtynine that im aware of he says but thats around twentyfive per cent yeah he replies matteroffactly how do you pay back the king dealer while youre on the inside easy says tony i only sell to those inmates who have someone on the outside who will hand over cash direct to my dealer i never supply until the money has been received but that could take days and if youre in the grip of a craving it only takes one phone call and an hour later i check with the dealer and if hes received the cash then i supply if you were on the outside and not a dealer how much would you need to cover your own addiction three hundred quid a day but thats a hundred thousand pounds a year cash yeah but as a dealer i can earn twice that and still get my fix four times a day tony goes on to talk about his fears after hes released tomorrow morning his parents will come to pick him up at eight oclock they believe hes kicked the habit following a spell in special prison in devon where they weaned him off heroin for fifteen months but once he was considered cured they transferred him to a dcat in this case nsc where it was in his face and within weeks he was addicted again i wont live to see fifty tony says ill have been in jail for over half my life he pauses i wish id never taken that first freebie when i was fifteen youll pass ten of us in the street every day jeff and you wont have been aware perhaps you will from now on tony left the hospital at pm i handed his letter to sister the following morning day wednesday may am todays list of new inductees to see the doctor includes patel patel patel and patel its hard to believe that there isnt a story there somewhere when the prisoners appear it soon becomes clear we are dealing with a father and three sons i later discover that the mother is also in jail at holloway all five were charged with the same offence the patels are sikhs and have very strong family values so that when they discovered that their daughtersister was earning her living as a prostitute they formed a plan to kidnap her the laws views rescue her the patel familys value the first part of this plan was not too difficult to carry out for a bright reasonably determined team of sikhs they simply bundled the girl into a car and whisked her off to the family home however the pimp loverfriendi cant be sure which set out to rescue her so that she could be put back to work unfortunately for him he had not taken into account the resolution of the patel family so he ended up with a broken arm and nose after being beaten up the pimp reported the incident to the police which resulted in the father and three brothers being sentenced to two years for kidnapping and abh and the mother to eighteen months as an accomplice all five went to jail while the daughter was set free to continue to ply her trade as a novelist i can come up with a dozen scenarios as to what might happen when the patel family are all released in am among the prisoners who will be released today is daryl who is serving twelve months for burglary he has been a model prisoner no sign of any drugs never on report and whenever he visits the hospital hes always courteous and considerate so i was not surprised he had been granted his tag and would be leaving us after only four months once the doctor has checked him out and signed him off daryl thanks sister and shakes hands with me good luck i offer and add i hope we never meet again the traditional goodbye to those you consider unlikely to reoffend imagine my surprise when i learned this evening that daryl was back in jail it happened thus he was driven to boston station on the prison bus where he was handed a rail voucher for manchester and in cash every prisoner who is not picked up at the front gate is a travel voucher and if they have a known address to go to if they are of no fixed abode nfa they are handed and the address of a hostel in the area they are heading for after fourteen days if they have been unable to find a job they can go on the social service register and collect unemployment benefit back to daryl he boarded the train at boston but had to change at birmingham to catch another train to manchester during the stopover at birmingham he picked up some fish and chips before making his way over to platform six but as the train was not due to arrive for a few minutes he popped into w h smith and picked up a magazine to read on the journey the magazine rack is situated next to the bookshelf and his eye lighted on the a section he left a few moments later with a magazine and three paperbacks by the same author he was about to board the train when a station policeman arrested him for shoplifting when the police learned that daryl had been released from jail that morning on a tag he was immediately taken to gartree prison in birmingham where he will spend the next two months completing his sentence and whatever period of time is added because of the shoplifting daryl however does not hold the record for being back in custody the quickest following his release mr belford assures me that that distinction belongs to fingers danny of pentonville danny was released from pentonville at am on a cold november morning clutching his he headed off on foot to islington not in search of the nearest hostel but the nearest sainsburys he arrived just as they were opening the front doors he proceeded to fill a trolley with products and then walked slowly out of the shop without making any attempt to pay when the store detective approached him on the pavement danny made a dash for it but not too quickly danny was arrested and appeared in front of the magistrate at ten oclock that morning he pleaded guilty before sentence was passed danny threw in a few choice observations concerning the magistrates bald head his lack of charisma and his doubtful parentage ensuring that he was back in his cell at pentonville by midday however the difference between danny and daryl is that the irishman had planned the whole operation weeks before he was released after all it was november and where else could danny be guaranteed a bed in a warm cell three meals a day and the companionship of his friends during the festive season he put his release money in his canteen account day saturday may three inmates absconded yesterday its an hour to boston on foot about an hour and a half to skegness the first slater gbh had a sixyear sentence and had only been at nsc for four days even more inexplicable is the fact that he was due for parole in september and having been transferred to a dcat could expect to have been released slater was rearrested four hours after departing and taken off to hmp lincoln a bcat where he will spend the rest of his sentence two more years plus twentyeight days for absconding madness i am informed by an officer that the second inmate benson abh was anticipating a positive mdt back from the home office and as it was his second offence in three months the governor would have been left with little choice but to ship him out to a bcat so he shipped himself out he was picked up in boston early this morning and is now on his way to nottingham acat with twentyeight days added to his sentence the third inmate blagdon pub stabbing is a more interesting case he was due out in july having already served nine years he walked into a police station this morning and gave himself up after being on the run for only seven hours he is also now safely locked up in an acat however in blagdons case he never intended to make good his escape his cellmate tells me that he didnt think he could handle the outside world after nine years in jail eight of them in closed conditions banged up for twentytwo hours a day so now hell return to those conditions for at least a further five years at the end of which he will have to come up with another way of making sure he isnt set free because hell never return to a dcat am every day this week an inmate called jenkins has been popping into hospital to ask me how many new inductees we were expecting that day and added are any of them from hmp lincoln i assumed jenkins was hoping that one of his mates was being transferred to nsc on the contrary he is fearful of the imminent arrival of an old enemy yesterday morning the hospital manifest showed that six prisoners were due in from lincoln and when jenkins studied the list of names he visibly paled before quickly leaving the hospital that was the last i saw of him because he missed the am rollcall three hours later he gave himself up at a local police station he was arrested and shipped off to lincoln i sat next to jenkinss roommate at lunch who was only too happy to tell me that jenkins had been sleeping with the wife of another prisoner called owen whenever he was out on a fortnightly town leave he went on to tell me that owen manslaughter had recently found out that his wife was being unfaithful and she had even told him the name of her lover owen who had just been given dcat status after eight years in jail immediately applied to be sent to nsc and is due to arrive this afternoon now i understand why jenkins absconded pm a group of five prisoners arrive from lincoln but owen is not among them when they walk through the door i report to sister that we seem to have lost one oh yes owen she says looking down at her list he committed some minor offence this morning and had his dcat status taken away so hell be remaining at lincoln for the foreseeable future day monday may am a letter from the high court informs me that my appeal date is set for monday july in eight weeks time am a prisoner called morris arrived this morning he is thirtysix years old and serving a fouryear sentence for creditcard fraud morris has stolen over since leaving school and shows no remorse he tells me with considerable pride that he still has just under in cash safely stashed away and that he and his codefendant lead the good life they share a large flat in london drive a mercedes enjoy a wardrobe full of designer clothes and only stay at the best hotels they fly first class and work even while on holiday he is a career criminal for whom prison is a temporary inconvenience and as the authorities always transfer him to a dcat within three weeks of being sent down not that much of an inconvenience morris has been found guilty of fraud four times in the last ten years and received sentences of six months eight months twelve months and four years however he will have served less than three years in all by the time hes released next january in he anticipates that he and his partner will have cleared over a million pounds in cash and if they are caught he will be happy to return to nsc in dickenss time morris would have been known as a dip while the artful dodger stole handkerchiefs and fob watches morris purloins credit cards his usual method is to book into a fourstar hotel which is holding a large weekend conference he then works the bars at night when many of the customers have had a little too much to drink after a good weekend he can leave the hotel in possession of a dozen or more credit cards by sunday evening hes sitting in first class on a plane to vienna one card gone where he books into a fivestar hotel second card he then hires a car not with a credit card but with cash because he needs to travel across europe without being apprehended he will then drive from vienna to rome spending all the way before returning to england in a car loaded with goods he and his partner then take a short rest before repeating the whole exercise morris has several pseudonyms and tells me that he can pick up a false passport for as little as a thousand pounds he intends to spend another ten years rising to the top of his profession before he retires to warmer climes its a beautiful way of life he says i can tell you more jeffrey but i dont want to hear any more am a prisoner comes in asking to see the doctor urgently i explain that he left about an hour ago and sister is over at the administration block but he could see the doctor tomorrow he looks anxious so i ask if i can help ive just come back from home leave he explains and while i was out i had unprotected sex and id like to check that i havent caught anything did you know the girl i ask i didnt know any of them he replies any of them yes there were seven when i later tell sister she doesnt bat an eyelid just makes an appointment for him to see the doctor noon among the new receptions today is a prisoner called mitchell drink driving three months while im checking his blood pressure he tells me he hasnt been back to nsc since when it was a detention centre its changed a bit since then he adds mind you the hospital was still here but before you saw the doctor they hosed you down and shaved your head with a blunt razor to make sure you didnt have fleas how about the food i ask bread and water for the first fortnight and if you spoke during meals an officer called raybold banged your head against the wall i had to smile because i know one or two officers whod still like to pm the directorgeneral martin narey has issued a directive requiring all prison officers to address inmates with the prefix mr when an officer bellows across the car park get your fuckin arse over here archer i courteously point out to her that she must have missed the directorgenerals missive i dont give a fuck about the directorgeneral she replies ill fuckin well call you what i like one prisoner found an unusual way around this problem a few years ago he changed his name by deed poll to mister rogers but then he did have a twentyyear sentence pm if you work outside the prison you can earn up to a week which allows you to send money back to your wife partner and family which you certainly cant do on the amount you are paid working inside an added bonus is that some companies offer fulltime work on release to any prisoner who has proved himself while in their employ once youre qualified to work outside you must first complete a month of csv community service volunteer work partly as retribution and also to prove you are both fit and safe to work in the community once this has been completed you can then spend the rest of your sentence working outside so that when youre released in the best scenario its a seamless progression in the worst mike was only a few weeks away from that seamless progression when two prison officers turned up at his place of work and accompanied him back to nsc it seems that a young lady who worked at the same factory could do nothing to deter his unrequited advances her mother also worked there and reported him to the management the management quite rightly were not willing to condemn the prisoner simply on the mothers word and carried out their own investigation a few days later they sent a full report to the prison governor mike has subsequently been shipped out of nsc back to lincoln prison a tough bcat he was only a few weeks away from parole and the factory had already offered him a fulltime job on release he has now lost his dcat status lost his job lost his income and possibly lost any chance of parole i am reminded of robin williamss classic remark god gave man a penis and a brain but not enough blood to work both at the same time day tuesday may few prisoners turn down the opportunity to have weekly visits or the chance to be tagged and released two months early gary is the rare exception gary was sentenced to two years for theft of a motor vehicle bmw and because of good behaviour will only serve twelve months but why does no one visit him and why wont he take up his twomonth tagging option and serve only ten months none of garys family or friends knows that he is in prison his mother believes that he is working with his friend dave on a oneyear contract on an oil rig in mexican waters when he arrived in mexico dave sent gary a large selection of mexican scenic postcards gary pens a weekly card to his mother sends it back to his friend dave in mexico who then stamps it and forwards the missive to england gary will be released next week and seems to have got away with his little subterfuge because dave will fly back from mexico on the same day when they will meet up at heathrow and return to wolverhampton together during the journey dave will brief gary on what its like to work and live on a mexican oil rig now thats what i call a friend day thursday may north sea camp has five doctors who work a rota and one of them dr harris is also responsible for the misuse of substances unit in boston dr harris arrives at the hospital today accompanied by a male nurse nigel who is in his early thirties and is dressed in a black tshirt blue jeans with a ring in his ear has come to visit me because he is currently working with young people aged twelve to nineteen who have a heroin problem i can see why they would feel at ease with him nigel explains that he can only work with youngsters who want to work with him he listens to their questions offers answers but never judges theyve had enough of their parents telling them to grow up behave themselves and find a job he outlines the bare statistics they are terrifying there are currently heroin addicts in britain of which only per cent are involved in some form of detox programme one of the problems nigel explains is that if you apply to your local gp for a place on one of these programmes the wait can be anything up to six weeks by which time the client has often given up trying to come off the drug the irony is that if you end up in prison you will be put on a detox programme the following day nigel knows of several addicts who commit a crime hoping to be sent to jail so that they can wean themselves off drugs nigel works directly with a small group of seven addicts although he reminds me you cant save anyone you can only help those who want to help themselves he then guides me through the problems the young are facing today they start experimenting with cannabis or sniffing solvents then progress to ecstasy and cocaine followed by crack cocaine ending up on heroin he knows several seventeen year olds who have experienced the full gamut he adds ruefully that if the letter of the law were adhered to seven million britons would be in jail for smoking cannabis as possession currently has a twoyear tariff a gramme of an aclass drug costs about this explains the massive rise in street crime over the past decade especially among the young the danger is not just the drugs but also the needles often drug users live in communes and share the same needles this is the group that ends up with hiv and hepatitis b and c today for example nigel has appointments with two girls addicted to heroin one aged nineteen and the other seventeen who both want to begin a detox programme his biggest problem is their boyfriends who are not only responsible for them being on drugs in the first place but are also their suppliers so the last thing they want is for their girlfriends to be cured of the craving nigel tells me that there is only a chance they will even turn up for the appointment and if they do addicts on average make seven attempts to come off heroin before they succeed nigels responsibility is to refer his cases to a specialist gp so that they can be registered for a detox programme he fears that too many addicts go directly to their own gp who often prescribes the wrong remedy to cure them nigel displays no cynicism as he takes me through a typical day in his life and reminds me that hes not officially funded something he hopes the nhs will sort out in the near future he suddenly brings the problem down to a local level highlighting the national malaise nigel has seven heroin addicts on his books in a county that has on the drug its not a chip not a dent not even a scratch on the overall surface nigel leaves me to keep his appointment with a seventeenyearold boy who has for the past four years been visiting caravan sites so that he can feed his addiction he cuts the rubber hose and sniffs calor gas hes not even breaking the law other than by damaging property pm gail is searching for a bedboard for a new inmate with a back problem there are twelve boards out there somewhere the problem is that once youve allocated them you never get them back because when an inmate is released the last thing on his mind is returning a bedboard gail calls the south block unit only to discover that a replacement officer from lincoln is holding the fort she throws her hands in the air in despair but nevertheless tells him about her problem by crossreferencing with the prisoners files she can check those who are in genuine need and those who have just come into possession of a bedboard by default to her surprise the officer returns an hour later accompanied by seven of the offending bedboards i offer him a cup of coffee and quickly discover that his whole life is equally well organized he tells me about work at lincoln and one sentence stops me in my tracks ive developed a system that ensures i only have to work five months a year the officer has been in the prison service for just over seven years and has along with five other colleagues developed an onoff work schedule so he only needs to be on duty for five months a year for his salary he assures me that the system is carried out in most jails with slight variations he would be happy to work extra hours if he could get paid overtime but currently few prisons can afford the extra expense except for accompanied visits hospitals court or transfer this is the bit where you have to concentrate officers work the following shifts shift a the early shift or shift b a main shift day shift c the late shift or shift d the evening shift shift e a main shift night the officer and his colleagues swap shifts around and as there is no overtime they take time off in lieu every officer should work thirtynine hours per week but if they swap shifts with colleagues they can end up doing ac or bd or de and that way notch up nearly seventy hours per week while another colleague takes the week off add to this the twentyeight days holiday entitlement per year and they need work only five months while taking off seven three of his colleagues also have parttime jobs on the out and the officer assures me that a large percentage of junior officers supplement their income this way i can only assume this does not come as a surprise to martin narey currently the directorgeneral of the prison service im bound to say if my secretary housekeeper agent accountant publisher or doctor took seven months per year to do another job i would either reorganize the system or replace them day monday june as from today the home office have recategorized nsc as a resettlement prison in future all prisoners having served one quarter of their sentence and passed their fled will be eligible to move into one of the recently built blocks and start working outside the prison the thinking behind this is that by allowing prisoners to earn a living they will be less likely to reoffend when released two new blocks portakabins of forty rooms have been constructed on the playing fields near the gate for this purpose from today sixtytwo prisoners will be eligible to leave nsc from am and need not return until pm but and there are always buts in prison mr berlyn has posted a notice in both new blocks making it clear that this is to be considered a privilege and anyone who fails to keep to the guidelines will be suspended and put to work on the farm at a week two prisoners absconded during their first week at work both were caught and transferred to a bcat in nottingham two were found in a pub and are back working on the farm while three were sacked for inappropriate behaviour unwanted advances to the female staff and that was in the first week day friday june mr beaumont the governing governor has just marched into the hospital accompanied by mr berlyn dr walling david and i are watching england play argentina in the world cup and beckham has just scored from a penalty to put us in the lead i assume they had heard the cheering and popped in to find out the score however they dont even glance at the screen one look in my direction and they both stride out again i learn later that the governor had received a call from reuters asking him to confirm that i had committed suicide not while were in the lead against argentina am an officer drops in and tells me over coffee that there is disquiet among the officers and staff that sex offenders will in future make up a considerable percentage of our inmates officers fear the atmosphere may change from the relaxed state we currently enjoy to one of constant tension as regular offenders despise paedophiles it is even possible that one or two of the more violent inhabitants might take it upon themselves to administer their own form of justice most sex offenders when housed in an open prison are given a cover story should anyone ask what they are in for the officer goes on to tell me that a murderer at gartree shared a cell with a prisoner who was allegedly in for burglary but the lifer discovered from another prisoner who had been in a previous jail with his cellmate that he was in fact a sex offender who had raped his nineyearold daughter at rollcall the following morning the lifer reported to the main office his statement was simple and explicit he had stabbed his cellmate to death and left him on his bed the lifer was immediately placed in solitary confinement charged and later given another life sentence the judge added that on this occasion life meant the rest of his life pm i umpire this evenings cricket match between nsc and a local school i give the opening batsman from the visiting side out caught and bowled when i see the look of surprise on the batsmans face i immediately feel anxious because the bowler had taken the catch as he ran in front of me have i made a mistake the batsman is already heading towards the pavilion a small wooden hut when mo murder terrorist who is fielding at silly midon looks at me and says it was a bumpball jeff i call the opening batsman back and apologize for my mistake as the rest of the team applaud mos sportsmanship the visiting team go on to win thanks to a fine innings from the opening batsman funny old world day monday july its been a tense day as i wait to discover how much longer ill have to remain here my appeal against conviction took mr justice rose two minutes to dismiss which was no more than my counsel nick purnell qc had predicted the appeal against sentence was granted by mr justice brown so we had all felt more confident that mr justice rose would knock off at least a year possibly two allowing me to return home this evening at pm mr hocking walks slowly into the hospital looking grim as senior security officer he had already set in motion a plan to have me off the premises before the press could arrive he told me that alison had rung to say that my sentence had not been cut even by a day although mr purnell addressed the judges for over two hours mr justice rose returned to the court one minute and fortyeight seconds after nick sat down and read out a prepared statement that he must have written some days before mr justice rose could at least have had the courtesy to tell mr purnell not to bother as hed already made up his mind and wasnt interested in any new evidence so much for british justice day tuesday july the press are curious to know why mary didnt appear in court to hear my appeal she was being interviewed for the chairmanship of addenbrookes hospital at pm and the date had been fixed for some weeks i had told her that under no circumstances was she to request a change of dates as this was clearly the most important interview of her life addenbrookes attached umbilically to cambridge university is one of the countrys leading teaching hospitals it has a budget of some million per year and nearly doctors and nurses mary has been vicechairman for the past two years and on the board for eight and although she is up against a formidable shortlist i still feel shes in with a good chance we spent over an hour on the phone until i ran out of phonecards considering the likely questions that might come up i want mary to get this chairmanship job more than i want to be released from jail otherwise i would spend the rest of my life feeling that i was the reason she failed day wednesday july i call mary to confirm that she will be coming to pick me up on saturday and take me out on my first town visit a precursor to home leave i dont get a chance to ask any questions because everything is overshadowed by the news that she has been appointed chairman of addenbrookes im so delighted that i cant remember why i called day friday july there has never been a suicide at nsc despite the fact that there were seventythree suicides in british jails last year today an inmate made two attempts to take his life first he tried to cut his wrist and after being rushed to the pilgrim hospital and patched up he attempted to hang himself he failed hes a young man who recently lost his mother and last week his girlfriend sent him a dear john letter i later learned that during his trial he took paracetamol tablets and although they pumped his body out he has irreversibly damaged his liver his crime by the way was shoplifting for which he received six months and will serve three at most however one good thing came out of it the listeners who have been requesting a room for counselling for some time were allocated one this morning day saturday july am they have turned off the central heating today which is all you need to know about the way north sea camp is run am my first day out of jail for a year mary picks me up and as the press are waiting at the gatehouse we avoid boston we end up in a field of cows eating a picnic heaven even if the press do get the inevitable picture they did it was published in the sunday mirror the next day see overleaf over a lunch of turkey and ham salad followed by cheddar cheese helped down with a diet coke mary and i discuss her new responsibilities as chairman of addenbrookes hospital after a drive around the countryside mary takes me back to nsc just after five as she is flying to japan tomorrow to address a conference on your first town visit youre not allowed beyond the environs of boston ten miles and must return to the camp by pm next week assuming ive broken none of the rules strayed beyond the tenmile limit had a drink or committed a crime shoplifting the most common i will be allowed to travel an as the crow flies distance of fiftyfive miles which takes in cambridge and grantchester on returning to the hospital i decide to pick up a phonecard and call mary to thank her for all shes doing i go to the drawer by my bed to discover that my phonecards are missing its a few minutes before i can accept that a fellow inmate has broken into the hospital and stolen all my phonecards eight worth dont forget that i earn a week but when i check the window opposite my bed i notice that its not on its usual notch so now i know how the thief got in ill have to borrow a couple of cards from david two from stephen and two from tony if im going to survive the coming week day tuesday july am this morning four of the highpoint prisoners were put in a van and shipped out to lincoln bcat accompanied by six officers and a driver just before leaving nsc one of the prisoners attacked an officer the governor has made it clear that he will no longer accept prisoners from that establishment am five hm prisons inspectors arrive unannounced at the front gate mr beaumont the governing governor is on holiday in wales but rushes back to the camp along with several other staff during the next three days i come across all five inspectors and am impressed by how quickly they identify the good the bad and the simply indifferent they single out the kitchen and the hospital both run by women for high praise however the governor wasnt around to hear their final report as he had gone back to wales day sunday august as i have completed my first town visit without incident i am now entitled to travel to cambridge within a fiftyfivemile radius of nsc see below mary is in japan attending a conference and will is working at the kennedy center in washington dc so i spend the day with james as we drive into grantchester i yearn to see the old vicarage i spend the first hour strolling around the slightly overgrown garden our gardener has been on holiday for a couple of weeks admiring the flowers the lake full of koi carp and the sculptures that adorn the lawn james prepares lunch and after reading the sunday papers i settle down to slivers of melon with parma ham followed by spaghetti bolognaise my choice and a diet coke we would normally have a glass of red wine but not for another year after a cheese board i am only interested in the cheddar we once again stroll round the garden on a cloudless day before returning to the house to watch the commonwealth games what a triumph for manchester i leave at oclock as i have to report back before pm when i will be breathalysed and searched any sign that i had taken even a mouthful of wine and i would forfeit my job as the hospital orderly and would not be considered for a csv job in the future i would also have to return to a double cell on the north block and be put to work on the farm can anyone be that stupid two prisoners were shown to be over the limit on returning this evening they both lost all their privileges day tuesday august all prisoners who have passed their fled are eligible to work in the outside community as long as they are within twelve months of their parole date mine is july a prisoner can then work outside the camp between the hours of am and pm for five days a week and even have a sixth day of training once accepted for the resettlement programme a prisoner moves into one of the residential blocks located near the gate single rooms and is allowed to wear his own clothes at all times you can also drive your own car to work and have a mobile phone which cannot be taken out of the car the purpose of the resettlement programme is to help prisoners help themselves by earning a living wage a week if you are financially independent these rules do not apply however you are still able to work for a voluntary or charitable organization and the prison will pay you per week current salary as a hospital orderly per week governor berlyn head of resettlement has already turned down my application to work for dr walling at the parkside clinic as a trainee nurse he gives two reasons for his decision some of the camp staff are patients at the clinic and dr walling as head of the practice is technically a member of staff and therefore not permitted to employ me however mr berlyn has received a letter from a mr moreno at the theatre royal lincoln who has offered me a job assisting with the theatres community

i remained within the permitted radius of the prison had been with my wife hadnt drunk anything stronger than apple juice and returned to nsc well in time without offering me the chance to give an explanation i am marched to the segregation block and not even allowed to make a phone call the cold bleak room five paces by three has just a thin mattress on the floor against one wall a steel washbasin and an open lavatory day thursday september am i have not slept for one second of the ten hours i have been locked in this cell am my first visitor is dr razzak who assures me that she will

independent monitoring board who assures me that i will not be moved if my only offence was having lunch with gillian shephard am i am escorted to adjudication it quickly becomes clear that all decisions are being made in london by mr narey the directorgeneral of the prison service once i realize this i accept there is no hope of justice mr beaumont tells me that as a result of this breach of licence i am being transferred to bcat lincoln prison despite the fact that i have until now had an exemplary record and have never once been placed on report he adds that i have embarrassed the prison service following a press story the paper accused me of drinking champagne at a tory bash which paper i ask innocently the sun says mr beaumont thus revealing which paper mr narey reads each morning and which editorials help him make his decisions at north sea camp last week a prisoner who arrived back late and drunk was stripped of all privileges for a month another who brought vodka into the camp was grounded for a month only last week an nsc inmate nicknamed ginger went on home leave and returned three days late his excuse was that his girlfriend had held him captive this provoked a mixture of envy and hilarity among other inmates his only punishment was confinement to nsc for a short period several former inmates have since contacted my wife pointing out that they regularly visited friends and inlaws on their home leave days as well as taking their children on outings to the park or swimming pool and it was never once suggested this was against the regulations i was given no opportunity to appeal i learn later that dr walling the prisons senior doctor protested about my being put in segregation and moved to lincoln prison dr walling told me that he was warned that if he made his feelings public his days at nsc would be numbered pm one officer mr masters is so appalled by the judgement that he comes to the side of the group van to shake my hand back to hell pm the group sweat box drives through the gates of hmp lincoln just after pm lincoln prison is less than a mile from the theatre royal but may as well be a thousand miles away i am escorted into reception to be met by a mr fuller he seems mystified as to what i am doing here he checks through my plastic bags and allows me to keep my shaving kit and a pair of trainers the rest he assures me will be returned when im transferred to another prison or released he fills in several forms a process that takes over an hour while i hang around in a dirty smokefilled corridor trying to take in what has happened during the past twenty hours when the last form has been completed another officer escorts me to a double cell in the notorious a wing when i enter the main block i face the usual jeering and foul language we come to a halt outside cell fourteen the massive iron door is unlocked and then slammed behind me my new cellmate looks up from his bed smiles and introduces himself as jason while i unpack whats left of my belongings and make up my bed jason tells me that hes in for gbh he found a man in bed with his wife and thrashed him to within an inch of his life i wish id gone the extra inch he adds his sentence is four years jason continues to chat as i lie on my hard mattress and stare up at the green ceiling he tells me that hes trying to get back together with his wife he will be seeing her for the first time since his conviction ten weeks ago at a visit on saturday i also learn that jason served ten years in the airforce winning three medals in the gulf and was the rafs light heavyweight boxing champion he left the forces with an exemplary record which he feels may have helped to get his charge reduced from attempted murder to gbh i fall asleep but only because i havent slept for thirtynine hours day friday september i wake to the words fuck all screws echoing through the air from the floor above i havent eaten for two days and force down a slice of bread and an outofdate lemon sorbet when they let me out of the cell fortyfive minutes a day i phone mary an inmate from the landing above spits on me and then bursts out laughing despite the fact that the officers are friendly and sympathetic i have never been more depressed in my life i know that if i had a twentyfiveyear sentence i would kill myself there have been three attempted suicides at lincoln this week one succeeded a lad of twentytwo not yet sentenced jason tells me that hes heard i am to be moved to c wing he says that its cleaner and each cell has a television but and theres always a but in prison ill have to work in the kitchen if thats the case ill be stuck on a wing for however long im left in here jason passes over his newspaper the mirror gives a fair report of my lunch with gillian and tom shephard no one suggests i drank any alcohol the times adds that martin narey has said it will not be long before im moved it cheers me up a little and then i recall the reality of not long in prison the press in general consider ive been hard done by and the daily mail is in no doubt that the home secretarys fingerprints are all over the decision to take revenge on me i lie on my bed for hour after hour wondering if i will ever be free day saturday september noon im standing in line for lunch wondering if anything will be edible i spot an apple i must remember to write to wendy and congratulate her on the standard of the food at north sea camp a prisoner three ahead of me in the queue gruffly asks for some rice the server slams a ladlefull down on his tin tray is that all i fuckin get asks the inmate to which the server replies move along you fuckin muppet the prisoner drops his tray on the floor charges round to the back of the counter and punches the server on the nose in the ensuing fight the server crashes his heavy ladle over the other prisoners head and blood spurts across the food the rest of the queue form a ring around the two combatants prisoners never join in someone elses quarrel only too aware of the consequences but it doesnt stop them jeering and cheering some even taking bets the fight continues for over a minute before an alarm goes off bringing officers running from every direction by the time the officers arrive theres blood everywhere it takes five of them to drag the two men apart the two combatants are then frogmarched off to segregation one officer pushes the prisoners head down while another keeps his legs bent this is known as being bent up or twisted up in the rule book its described as control and restraint pm im not eating the prison food once again i have to rely on chocolate biscuits and blackcurrant juice and once again i have a supply problem which was taken care of at belmarsh by del boy i quickly discover lincolns equivalent devon devon is the spurs senior cleaner he tells me with considerable pride that he is fortyone has five children by three different women and already has five grandchildren i tell him my needs he smiles the smile of a man who can deliver within the hour i have a second pillow a blanket two bottles of water a kitkat and a copy of yesterdays times by the way like del boy devon is west indian as devon is on remand hes allowed far longer out of his cell than a convicted prisoner hes been charged with attacking a rival drug dealer with a machete gbh he cut off the mans right arm so hes not all that optimistic about the outcome of his forthcoming trial after all he says flashing a smile theyve still got his arm havent they he pauses i only wish it had been his head i return to my cell feeling sick pm i find it difficult to adjust to being banged up again for twentytwo hours a day but imagine my surprise when during association that fortyfiveminute break when you are allowed out of your cell i bump into clive do you remember clive he used to come to the hospital in the evening at north sea camp and play backgammon with me and he nearly always won well hes back on remand this time charged with money laundering as we walk around the yard he tells me whats been happening in his life since we last met it seems that after being released from nsc clive formed a company that sold mobile phones to the arabs who paid for them with cash he then distributed the cash to different banks right around the globe while keeping per cent for himself whys that illegal i ask there never were any phones in the first place he admits clive seems confident that they wont be able to prove money laundering but may get him for failure to pay vat i am pleased to learn that david the friendly schoolmaster at nsc who joined clives company on leaving prison quickly realized what he was up to and resigned during association i phone mary while shes briefing me on nareys attempts on radio and television to defend his decision to send me to lincoln another fight breaks out i watch as two more prisoners are dragged away mary goes on to tell me that narey is backtracking as fast as he can and the home office is nowhere to be seen the commentators seem convinced that i will be transferred back to a dcat fairly quickly it cant be too soon i tell her this place is full of violent drugaddicted thugs i can only admire the way the officers keep the lid on such a boiling cauldron there was a riot the week after i left and seventeen inmates ended up in hospital while i roam around association with jason he points at three lithuanians who are standing alone in the far corner theyre on remand awaiting trial for murder he tells me even the officers are fearful of them devon joins us and adds that they are hit men for the russian mafia and were sent to england to carry out an execution they have been charged with killing three of their countrymen chopping them up into little pieces putting them through a mincer and then feeding them to dogs day sunday september am the cell door is opened and an officer escorts me to the chapel anything to get out of my cell after all the chapel is the largest room in the prison the service is holy communion with the added pleasure of singing by choristers from lincoln cathedral they number seventeen the congregation thirteen i sit next to a man who has been on a block for the past ten weeks hes fiftythree years old serving a twoyear sentence its his first offence and he has no history of drugs or violence the home secretary can have no idea of the damage hes causing to such people by forcing them to mix in vile conditions with murderers thugs and drug addicts such men should be sent to a dcat the day they are sentenced i wrote this in a prison diary volume one belmarsh hell and the home office have shown scant interest there arent any votes in prisons noon i go to the library and select three books the maximum allowed i spend the next twenty hours in my cell reading pm i end the day with alfred hitchcocks stories to be read with the doors locked somewhat ironic day monday september am over the past few days i have been writing furiously but i have just had my work confiscated by the deputy governor so much for freedom of speech he made it clear that his orders to prevent me from sending out any written material came from the home office direct i rewrite my day and have this copy smuggled out not too difficult with nearly a hundred prisoners on remand who leave the prison to attend court every day am after breakfast im confined to my cell and the company of jason for the next eight hours pm mr marsh a senior officer who has a rare gift for keeping things under control opens the cell door and tells me i have a meeting with the area manager an area manager is senior to a governor and can have as many as fifty prisons under his remit he reports directly to the deputy directorgeneral i am escorted to a private room and introduced to mr spurr and ms stamp mr spurr explains that he has been given the responsibility of investigating my case as i have received some letters during the past four days every one of them retained every one of them expressing outrage at the directorgenerals judgment this doesnt come as a great surprise mr spurrs intelligent questions lead me to believe that he is genuinely interested in putting right an injustice i tell him and ms stamp exactly what happened on friday september the prison service announced that further serious allegations had been made against me it turned out these related to a lunch i had attended on wednesday september in zucchinis restaurant lincoln which is near the theatre royal with mr paul hocking then a senior security officer at north sea camp and pc karen brooks of the lincolnshire constabulary i explained to mr spurr that the sole purpose of the lunch as far as i was concerned was so that i could describe what i had seen of the drug culture permeating british prisons to pc brooks who had by then returned to work with the lincolnshire police drug squad after all id had several meetings with hocking and or brooks in the past on the subject of drugs i did not know that prison officers are not supposed to eat meals with prisoners nor is there any reason i should have known this moreover when a senior officer asks a prisoner to attend a meeting even in a social context a wise prisoner does not query the officers right to do so as for so hocking i have been distressed to learn that he was summarily forced to resign from the prison service on september under the threat of losing his pension if he did not do so since mr beaumonts suspension mr hocking has addressed the tribunal and made it clear that he was forced to resign by beaumont with the threat of being sacked but who bullied mr beaumont pc karen brooks was more fortunate in her employers her role was investigated comprehensively by chief inspector gossage and sergeant kent of the lincolnshire police and she remains with the force chief inspector gossage and sergeant kent interviewed me during their later investigation of the same lunch and made it very clear that they thought the prison service had acted hastily and disproportionately in transferring me to hmp lincoln as mr spurr leaves he assures me that he will complete his report as quickly as possible although he still has several other people to interview he repeats that he is interested in seeing justice being done for any prisoner who has been unfairly treated it was some time later that the daily mail reported that the home secretary had bullied mr narey into the decision to have me moved to hmp lincoln the sequence of events so far as i am able to establish them are as follows the sun newspaper telephoned martin nareys office on the evening of wednesday september and the following day published a highly coloured account of the gillian shephard lunch this provoked the home secretary to send an extraordinary fax see overleaf to martin narey demanding that the latter take immediate and decisive disciplinary action against me narey who had previously stood up against the presss attempts to portray my treatment as privileged buckled and instructed mr beaumont to transfer me forthwith to lincoln narey also went on a number of tv and radio programmes to criticize me in highly personal terms in what the independent on sunday described as an unprecedented attack on an individual prisoner especially in the light of later pious assertions that the prison service is unable to discuss individual prisoners in detail with third parties mr beaumont found himself in even more difficulty he had not asked me about the zucchini lunch so he could hardly make that the basis of an order to transfer me in the event the notice of transfer which he signed stated simply following serious allegations reported in the media and confirmed by yourself that on september you attended a dinner party rather than spend the day on a community visit in cambridge with your wife it is not appropriate for you to remain at hmp north sea camp any longer my licence did not restrict me to my home in grantchester while on release but an email was circulated within the home office which stated the prison hmp north sea camp had granted ja home leave but his licence conditions stipulated that he should not go anywhere else but home in light of this he has breached his licence conditions and will face adjudication at that time the copy of my master passbook a record retained by the prison which records all a prisoners releases on temporary licence contained no such stipulation nor did i ever face adjudication in respect of any breach of such a stipulation mr spurr later said in a letter he was unable to locate my master passbook when he conducted his investigation into my transfer a fact which he acknowledged as regrettable one has to wonder why and how this passbook disappeared however mr narey told me to stop writing to him on the subject as the matter was closed day tuesday october am a frequent complaint among prison officers and inmates with which i have some sympathy is that paedophiles and sex offenders are treated more leniently and live in far more palatable surroundings than the rest of us on arriving at lincoln you are immediately placed on a wing described quite rightly by the tabloids as a victorian hellhole but if you are a convicted sex offender you go straight to e wing a modern accommodation block of smart single cells each with its own television e wing also has table tennis and pool tables and a bowling green during the past few days i have been subjected to segregation transferred to lincoln placed in a block with murderers violent criminals and drug dealers in a cell any selfrespecting rat would desert offered food i am unable to eat and i have to share my cell with a man who thrashed someone to within an inch of their life all this for having lunch with the rt hon gillian shephard in the company of my wife when on my way back to nsc from grantchester sex offenders can survive in an open prison because the other inmates are on trust and dont want to risk being sent back to a bcat or have their sentences extended however these rules do not apply in a closed prison an officer recently reported to me the worst case he had come across during his thirty years in the prison service if you are at all squeamish turn to the next page because i confess i found this very difficult to write the prisoner concerned was charged and convicted of having sex with his fiveyearold daughter during the trial it was revealed that not only did the defendant rape her but in order for penetration to take place he had to cut his daughters vagina with a razor blade i know i couldnt have killed the man but i suspect i would have turned a blind eye while someone else did am i have a visit from a portuguese prisoner called juan he warns me that some inmates were seen in my cell during association while i was on the phone it seems that they were hoping to get their hands on some personal memento to sell to the press english is juans second language and i have not come across a prisoner with a better command of our native tongue and i doubt if there is another inmate on a block who has a neater hand myself included he is incidentally quietly spoken and well mannered he wrote me a thank you letter for giving him a glass of blackcurrant juice i must try and find out why he is in prison am an officer mr brighten unlocks my door and tells me that he needs a form filled in so that i can work in the kitchen to begin with i assume its a joke and then become painfully aware that hes serious surely the staff cant have missed that ive hardly eaten a thing since the day i arrived and now they want to put me where the food is prepared i tell him politely but firmly that i have no desire to work in the kitchen pm i look up at my little window inches from the ceiling and think of oscar wilde this must be the nearest ive been to living in conditions described so vividly by the great playwright while he was serving a twoyear sentence in reading jail i never saw a man who looked with such a wistful eye upon that little tent of blue which prisoners call the sky pm mr brighten returns to tell me that i will be placed on report if i refuse to work in the kitchen i agree to work in the kitchen day friday october the end of the second longest week in my life jason gbh has received a movement order to transfer him to hmp stocken in rutland ccat later this morning hes gutted as he hoped to be sent directly to a dcat however a conviction for violence will have prevented this by the way he and his wife did agree to get back together and she will now visit him every saturday am an officer unlocks my cell door and bellows gym twenty or thirty of us form a line by the barred gate at the far end of the brickwalled windowless room a few minutes later we are escorted down long bleak echoing corridors with much unlocking and locking of several heavy gates as we make our slow progress to the gym situated on the other side of the prison we are taken to a changing room where i put on a singlet and shorts clive money laundering and i enter the spacious gym we warm up with a game of paddle tennis and he sees me off in a few minutes i move on to do a thousand metres on the rowing machine in five minutes and end up with a little light weight training when an officer bellows five more minutes i check my weight twelve stone twelve pounds ive lost six pounds in six days i join my fellow inmates in the shower room and have my first pressbutton shower for a year bringing back more unpleasant memories of belmarsh as we are all escorted back to a block by mr lewis the senior gym officer we pass e wing paedophiles and not one of the inmates even looks in the direction of the staring faces why because we are accompanied by an officer prisoners are warned that any abuse shouting foul language will be treated as a disciplinary matter with the loss of daily gym rights as punishment when youre locked up for twentytwo hours a day thats incentive enough to remain silent whatever your thoughts pm the cell door is unlocked and my new padmate enters carrying the inevitable plastic bag jason is replaced by phil an amiable goodlooking despite the scar on his face twentyeightyearold he has been put in my cell because he doesnt smoke which is very rare in jail phil talks a great deal and tells me that he wants to return to work in the kitchen he certainly seems to know his way round the prison which turns out to be because hes paid several visits to lincoln during the past ten years he is only too happy to tell me the finer details of his record twentyeight other offences were taken into consideration before the judge passed sentence on phil this morning phil tells me never again he now has a happy family lifei dont ask how he explains his latest conviction and a good job to go back to he can earn a week laying concrete and doesnt need another spell in jail phil admits that his problem is a short fuse strike a match and i explode he adds laughing pm mr brighten unlocks the cell door to inform me that i start work in the kitchen tomorrow at eight oclock he slams the door closed before i can comment pm my cell door is unlocked again and phil and i along with three others are escorted to the hospital im told that i have to take a drugs test before im allowed to work in the kitchen despite the fact that i dont want to work in the kitchen phil tells me that five prisoners apply every day because the work is so popular phil and i pass the urine test to show we are drug free and the duty officer tells us to report to the kitchen by eight the other three fail pm during association i phone my agent jonathan lloyd he goes over the details of tomorrows announcement of the publication of volume one of these diaries i congratulate him on how well the secret has been kept not one newspaper has picked up that a prison diary by ff will be published tomorrow this is quite an achievement remembering that at least twenty people must have known at macmillan and ten or more at the daily mail day saturday october am this is my tenth day of incarceration at lincoln am the publication of a prison diary volume one belmarsh hell is the lead item on the news the facts are fairly reported no one seems to think that the home office will try to prevent the publication however the directorgeneral is checking to see if i have broken any prison rules mr narey is particularly exercised by the mention of other prisoners names i have only referred to prisoners surnames when they are major characters in the diary and only then when their permission has been granted two years and two prison diaries later and i have not received one letter of complaint from a prisoner or prison officer about the diaries despite receiving some letters in the last three years a representative of the prison officers association said on the today programme that as i hid in my room all day i wouldnt have anything worthwhile to say about prisons perhaps it might have been wiser for him to open his mouth after hes read the book when he would have discovered how well his colleagues come out of my experience am my cell door is unlocked so i can be transferred from a to j wing this is considered a privilege for that select group who work in the kitchen the cells are a lot cleaner and also have televisions my new companion is a grownup nonsmoker called stephen age thirtynine who is number one in the kitchen stephen is serving a sevenyear sentence for smuggling one and a half tons of cannabis into britain he is an intelligent man who runs both the wing and the kitchen with a combination of charm and example am a group of fourteen prisoners is escorted to the kitchens only two of the five who reported for drugs testing yesterday evening are still in the group i am put to work in the vegetable room to assist a young twentythreeyearold called lee who is so good at his job chopping potatoes slicing onions grating cheese and mashing swedes that i become his incompetent assistant my lack of expertise doesnt seem to worry him the officer in charge of the kitchen mr tasker turns out to be one of the most decent and professional men i have dealt with since being incarcerated his kitchen is like singapore airport you could eat off the floor he goes to great pains to point out to me that he only has per prisoner to deliver three meals a day in the circumstances what he and his staff manage to achieve is nothing less than a miracle day sunday october am on this my eleventh day i have a second visit from mr spurr and his colleague ms stamp they say they wish to tidy up a few minor points im impressed by mr spurrs grasp of whats going on at north sea camp and once again he gives the impression of being concerned he leaves promising that he will be able to tell me the outcome of his enquiry on friday day friday october am a particularly officious illmannered officer unlocks my cell door and thrusts some papers at me he tells me with considerable pleasure that i will be on a charge at oclock this afternoon i read the papers several times i dont have a lot more to do it seems that by publishing a prison diary i have broken prison rule para in naming staff such that they could be identified contrary to so para d am on leaving my cell to go to work in the kitchen i am surprised to find mr spurr and ms stamp awaiting me i am escorted into a side room mr spurr tells me that he has completed his enquiry and i will be transferred to hollesley bay dcat some time next week do you recall governor lewiss words whatever you do dont end up in hollesley bay am i take a break from peeling the spuds not that i can pretend to have done that many i notice that mr tasker is sitting in his office reading the daily mail he beckons me in and tells me to close the door ive just been reading about your time at belmarsh he says jabbing a finger at the centre pages and i see youre suggesting that seventy per cent of prisoners are on drugs and as many as thirty per cent could be on heroin he looks up gives me a pained expression and then adds youre wrong i dont comment expecting him to dismiss my claims and remind me of the official statistics always parroted by the home office whenever the question of drugs is raised which would you say is the most popular job in the prison mr tasker asks folding his newspaper the kitchen without question i reply and for all the obvious reasons youre right he says every day at least five inmates apply to work in the kitchen he pauses sips his coffee and adds did you take a drugs test yesterday yes i reply along with four others and how many of you were invited to work in the kitchen just phil and me i reply correct but what you dont know is that im entitled to have twentyone prisoners working in the kitchen but currently employ only seventeen he takes another sip of his coffee i have never managed to fill all the vacancies during the last ten years despite the fact that we never have fewer than seven hundred inmates mr tasker rises from his seat now im no mathematician he says but i think youll find that seventeen out of seven hundred does not come to thirty per cent pm the same officious illmannered lout who unlocked my cell door this morning returns to pick me up from the kitchen and escort me to segregation this time i am only left there for about forty minutes before being hauled up in front of mr peacock the governing governor mr peacock sits at the top of the table with the deputy governor on his right and my wing officer on his left the thug stands behind me in case i might try to escape the governor reads out the charge and asks if i wish to plead guilty or not guilty im not sure i reply im not clear what offence ive committed i am then shown the prison rules in full i express some surprise saying that i handed over every page of belmarsh hell to the prison censor and he kindly posted them on to my secretary and at no time did he suggest i was committing any offence the governor looks suitably embarrassed when i ask him to write down every word i have said he does so mr peacock points out that every inmate has access to a copy of the prison rules in the library yes but anyone who reads my diary he has a copy of belmarsh on the table in front of him would know that i wasnt allowed to visit the library or have access to education while at belmarsh i direct him to the passage on the relevant page at least he has the grace to smile adding that ignorance of the law is no excuse mr peacock then calls for my wing officer to make his report archer ff works in the kitchen and is a polite wellmannered prisoner with no history of drugs or violence the governor also writes these words down before clearing his throat and pronouncing sentence loss of all privileges for fourteen days and of canteen during the same period the governor pauses to be suspended for six months i rise thank him and leave i have a feeling hell be only too happy to see the back of me but more important the decision has been made not to remove my dcat status thus proving that they had no reason to send me here in the first place it was to be another six days before my transfer to hollesley bay in suffolk and even that simple exercise they managed to botch day friday october am i rise and pack my belongings into an hmp plastic bag as i prepare for my next move not unlike one does when leaving a nostar motel at the end of a rainy holiday while im gathering my possessions together i chat to my padmate stephen marijuana seven years who tells me that hes been granted his dcat status and hopes it will not be long before they transfer him to north sea camp am the cell doors on our wing are unlocked to allow stephen and his crew to be escorted to the kitchens and begin the days work i try inadequately to thank him for his kindness and help during the past ten days while wishing him luck for a speedy transfer am the cell door is thrown open for the last time to reveal a young officer standing in the doorway without a word he escorts me to reception its a protracted journey as i have to drag along two large heavy plastic bags and however many times i stop the officer makes no attempt to help me when we finally reach reception im placed in the inevitable waiting room from time to time im called to the counter by mr fuller so that i can sign forms and check through the contents of another six plastic bags that have been kept under lock and key these are filled with gifts mainly books sent in by the public during the past three weeks i sort out those that can be donated to the library including nine bibles and still end up with four full bags which will have to travel with me to suffolk its another thirty minutes before the final form is completed and i am cleared to depart for my next destination meanwhile back to the waiting room am two young officers from group appear in the corridor they are to accompany me and two other inmates from this hellhole not that the devils keepers have been unkind in fact with one loutish exception they have been supportive and friendly the group officers help me with my endless plastic bags before i am locked into a tiny cubicle in another sweat box i sit cramped up in silence awaiting a movement order am the electric gates swing slowly open and the van eases out onto the main road i stare from my darkened window to see several photographers snapping away all theyll get is a blackedout window i remain hunched up in my little box despite the fact that as a dcat prisoner i am entitled to have my wife drive me to hollesley bay in the family car but once again the home office has put a stop to that for the next five hours i am cooped up with two stale sandwiches and a bottle of water as we trundle through four counties on the endless journey to somewhere on the suffolk coast pm the van finally arrives at hollesley bay and comes to a halt outside a squat brick building the three of us step outside to be escorted into reception more form filling and more bag checking decisions to be made about what we can and cannot possess while my plastic bags are being checked the duty officer inadvertently gives it all away with an innocent remark its the first time ive checked anyone in from lincoln and worse the other two prisoners who came with me have only two weeks and three weeks respectively to serve before they complete their sentences this despite the fact that their homes are in north yorkshire they have been uprooted because the home office is prepared to mess around with their lives just to make sure i couldnt travel by car when all the red tape is completed i am accompanied to the north block by another officer who dumps me in a single room once again i begin to unpack once again i will have to find my feet once again i will be put through induction once again i will have to suffer the endless jibes and sullen stares never lowering my guard once again i will have to find a job once again epilogue for the past fourteen months i have been writing two thousand words a day nearly a million in all which has resulted in three published diaries although hollesley bay turned out to be quite different from north sea camp it was not dissimilar enough to warrant a fourth diary however there is one significant difference worthy of mention hollesley bay is an open prison not a resettlement establishment it was clearly selected to ensure that i couldnt work outside after i had completed my induction the director of genesis a mencap project in ipswich offered me a job his request was rejected by mr jones the prison governor despite there being three other inmates working at genesis at that time i appealed to the prison ombudsman about this blatant discrimination but he said he didnt have the authority to reverse the governors decision i reluctantly settled for the position of library orderly with a remit from mr jones to get more prisoners reading thirtytwo books were taken out in my first week as library orderly one hundred and ninety one in my last eight months later however as the library was only open to prisoners between and and and pm i was left with countless hours to occupy myself it doesnt take that long to replace on the shelves the twenty or thirty books returned each day i could have occupied those lifeless hours writing a fourth diary but as i have explained i felt it would have achieved little during those first few months of incarceration at hollesley bay i edited a prison diary volume two wayland purgatory and had it smuggled out on a weekly basis by a prisoner who was working in ipswich but even that demanding exercise did not fully occupy my time my next venture was to write nine short stories based on tales that i had picked up from all four prisons this collection will be published in under the title cat of nine tales unfortunately even this endeavour with its several rewrites only occupied me through to christmas leaving me another six months to kill before i was due to be released it was the death of an old friend that spurred me into action and once again gave my life some purpose a few months before my trial began i had lunch at mosimanns with chris brasher and a mutual friend john bryant the purpose of the lunch and chris always had a purpose was first to persuade me that i should run in the london marathon and attempt to break the world record for the amount raised for charity by an individual in this event and second that i should write my first screenplay while the marathon was postponed by events i suddenly found myself with time on my hands to write a screenplay chris brasher also knew the subject he wanted me to tackle and proceeded to tell me the story of george mallory an englishman who in climbed to within feet of the summit of everest dressed in a threepiece tweed suit with a coiled rope over one shoulder a fiftyfivepound pack on his back and carrying an ice axe in one hand and a rolled umbrella in the other at pm on july ascension day he and his young companion sandy irvine were enveloped in clouds and never seen again was mallory the first man to conquer everest it was the untimely death of chris brasher that bought the memory of that lunch flooding back i resolved to put into action his second suggestion statement by jeffrey archer i want to thank my wife mary and my sons william and james for their unwavering and unstinting support during this unhappy period in my life i should also like to thank the many friends who took the trouble to visit me in prison as well as countless members of the public who sent letters cards and gifts i shall not be giving any interviews for the foreseeable future however i have accepted an invitation to address the howard league for penal reforms conference at new college oxford in september and several requests to do charity auctions in the run up to christmas jeffrey to the tune of daniel by elton john jeffrey is leaving today down the lane i can see the paparazzi flashing away in vain oh and i can see jeffrey waving goodbye god it looks like jeffrey might have a teardrop in his eye oh ooh jeffrey our brother bet youre glad to be free now you can tell the world what you think of narey you did time well its now your time to tell jeffrey youre a star go on son give em hell i have not given an interview to the press or appeared on radio or television since during the last year i have addressed a dozen or so organizations since speaking to the howard league including the disraelian society trinity college oxford the thirty club the hawks club and the criminal law solicitors association i have also conducted twenty charity auctions raising just over a million pounds and run the flora london marathon hrs mins where i was overtaken by a camel a phone box a cake and a girl walking most of my spare time has been taken up with carrying out research for my next novel and continuing to work on the screenplay of mallory walking off the map jeffrey archer after lunch dean takes me across to view the more secluded quieter south block which is at the far end of the prison and houses the older inmates here there is a totally different atmosphere nsc has two blocks north and south with about prisoners resident in each now im in a dcat prison im allowed one visit a week after onethird of my sentence has been completed other privileges will be added heaven knows what the press will make of my first town visit however all of this could change rapidly once my appeal has been heard if your sentence is four years or more you are only eligible for parole whereas if its less than four years you will automatically be released after serving half your sentence and if youve been a model prisoner you can have another two months off while being tagged while tagged you must remain at home between pm and am i return to the north block for rollcall to prove i have not absconded doug assures me that it becomes a lot easier after the first couple of weeks when the checks fall from six a day to four my problem is that the final rollcall is at ten and by then ive usually fallen asleep you cannot escape from an open prison only abscond there are no walls just a car barrier at the entrance and a public footpath at the back most prisoners who abscond do so in the first two weeks nine out of ten are back behind bars within fortyeight hours mr new joins me in the kitchen for another cigarette break i learn that hes due to leave nsc in january when he will be transferred to norwich prison as a governor grade he then produces all the necessary forms for my transfer although hell speak to mrs mckenziehowe his opposite number at spring hill hes not optimistic not only are they full but its a resettlement prison and i dont need resettling im not looking for a job when im released or a home and as i have no financial problems i just dont fit any of the usual categories there are five grades of governor the top man or woman is known as the governing governor i still havent met one his first job after leaving university was as a volunteer at a museum in his home town he was happy there but soon decided he wanted to return to university that was when his mother contracted ms and everything began to go badly wrong after his mother was bedridden he and his sister took it in turns to help around the house so that his father could continue to work all three found the extra workload a tremendous strain one evening while at work in the museum matthew took home some ancient coins to study i havent used the word stole because he returned all the coins a few days later but the incident weighed so heavily on his conscience that he informed his supervisor matthew thought that would be the end of the matter but someone decided to report the incident to the police matthew was arrested and charged with breach of trust he pleaded guilty and was assured by the police that they would not be pushing for a custodial sentence his solicitor was also of the same opinion advising matthew that he would probably get a suspended sentence or a community service order the judge gave him fifteen months matthew will end up serving five and a half months north sea camp whose capacity is rarely has more than inmates at any one time as inmates have the right to be within fifty miles of their families being stuck out on the east coast limits the catchment area two of the spurs are being refurbished at the moment which shows the lack of pressure on accommodation the turnover at nsc is about fifteen prisoners a week what i am about to reveal is common to all dcat prisons and by no means exclusive to nsc on average one prisoner absconds every week unlawfully at large the figures have a tendency to rise around christmas and drop a little during the summer so nsc loses around fifty prisoners a year this explains the need for five rollcalls a day many absconders return within twentyfour hours having thought better of it they have twentyeight days added to their sentence a few often foreigners return to their countries and are never seen again quite recently two dutchmen absconded and were picked up by a speedboat as the beach is only yards out of bounds they were back in holland before the next rollcall this is only true in dcats open prisons when i entered the commons in at the age of twentynine i think i was the first elected mp not to have been eligible for national service i mention this because having won a byelection in louth lincolnshire i experienced six months of a fagend session of which almost every member had served not only in the armed forces but also in the second world war with half a dozen having done so in the first world war on the back benches generals admirals and air marshalls who could add mc dso and dfc to the letters mp were in abundance at lunch in the members dining room you might sit next to sir fitzroy mclean who was parachuted into yugoslavia to assist tito or airey neave who escaped from colditz a twoyear period of compulsory service in one of the branches of the armed forces which ceased to apply for anyone born after im back in my room undressing when a flash bulb goes off i quickly open my door and see an inmate running down the corridor i chase after him but he disappears out of the back door and into the night the door to each inmates room has a large glass panel in it covered in wire mesh on the outside is a green curtain to stop casual passersby peering in however during the night prison officers hold back the curtain to check youre in bed and havent absconded storr marches into the building waving a complaint form yesterday after returning from a town visit he failed a breathalyser test yes you can be breathalysed in prison without having driven in fact walking is quite enough storr protested that he never drinks even on the out and the real culprit is a bottle of mouthwash storr is sent back to the north block to retrieve the offending bottle which has about an inch of red liquid left in the bottom the label lists alcohol as one of several ingredients after some discussion mr new decides storr will be retested tomorrow morning if the test proves negative his explanation will be accepted he will then be subjected to regular random tests and should one of them prove positive he will be shipped back to his ccat storr accepts this judgment and leaves looking pleased with himself mr new banned all mouthwashes from the canteen following a similar incident a year ago as storr purchased the bottle at his last prison mr new is issuing a new directive that any new prisoners arriving at nsc with mouthwash will have the bottles confiscated i have a visit today from doreen and henry miller doreen is a frontbench spokesman in the lords having previously been a minister under john major she brings me up to date with news of the upper house and tells me that the latest lords reform bill is detested on both sides of the chamber the bill ignores john wakehams excellent royal commission report and doesnt placate the labour party because not a large enough percentage of peers will be elected and doesnt placate the tory party because it removes all the remaining hereditary peers it cannot doreen assures me reach the statute book in its present form because it will meet with so much opposition in both houses the government dropped the bill in march i phone james at work he tells me that mary has been on the move for the past few days oundle london and cambridge and then back to london this afternoon i never phone mary on her mobile because my twopound phone card is gobbled up in moments mr new calls spring hill to ask mr payne why my transfer is taking so long hes told that spring hill is about to face a public enquiry as a consequence of something that happened before he became governor mr payne fears that the press will be swarming all over the place and although he is quite willing to have me he cant let me know his decision for at least another couple of weeks i press mr new for the details of what could possibly cause so much public interest but he refuses to discuss it i wonder if its simply a ploy to keep me from being transferred no suggestion of a scandal at spring hill appeared in the national press during the next twelve months seven prisoners come through reception today two of them have been sent to nsc with only eleven and nine days left to serve why when moving to a new prison is a disorientating frightening and unpleasant experience because the last prison pays the expense of discharging a prisoner its marys birthday and shes wearing the emerald that sergio purchased for me from the green mountains after he returned to columbia i wanted to also give her the pot i made at wayland but they told me it shattered in the kiln see volume ii wayland purgatory youd think so replied the governor especially as the inmate was the only west indian on the camp he laughs the officer concerned might have even lived it down if it werent for the fact that neither the prisoner nor the stolen car has been seen since in belmarsh around per cent of the inmates were black in wayland per cent and currently at nsc we have four black prisoners out of im not sure what this proves possibly there might be more black prisoners involved in violent crime than in fraud during the morning we have visits from mr lewis and mr berlyn the new deputy governor who join linda for coffee mr hocking is the next to arrive with the news that five inmates have failed the breathalyser test two of them are csv workers who could lose all their privileges for example they could be put back to work on the farm for the rest of their sentence mr hocking tells me he doubts if the punishment will be that draconian but the warning will be clear for the future an inmate who completes a quarter of his sentence and proves to be a model prisoner is eligible for outside work first he must complete two town visits without incident the next step is to apply for community service volunteers work csv perhaps in an old peoples home or an oxfam shop once hes completed a month of csv without incident he can move on to a wageearning job making perhaps a week this gives a prisoner the chance to send money back to his wife or partner and to build up some savings to fall back on once released the prison service is committed to racial equality improper discrimination on the basis of colour race nationality ethnic or national origins or religion is unacceptable as is any racially abusive or insulting language or behaviour on the part of any member of staff prisoner or visitor and neither will be tolerated interesting grammatical error i watch raiders of the lost ark the last time i saw this film was with my two sons will was then nine and james seven it was produced by one of my oldest friends frank marshall frank flew from la to london to appear in my trial to deny a statement by angie peppiatt that i had been in rome with a mistress when in fact i had been with frank attending the world athletics championships not that i think mr justice potts gave a damn as by then he had already made up his mind that i was guilty will tells me that he wont be returning to the states until after the appeal he also reports that godfrey barker has had a change of heart and is no longer willing to help and may even leave the country rather than be forced to give evidence about the dinner party conversation that took place with mr justice potts his wife anne has said she will divorce him if he does mr and mrs barker are now separated mrs barker stood down from the parole board in september among those on the paper chase today is a young man who has not yet celebrated his thirtieth birthday but has been to jail eighteen times hes a smalltime burglar who has and this is the important point no fear of prison for him its a temporary inconvenience in his chosen career because he has no record of violence or involvement with drugs hes rarely sentenced to more than six months he spends a few days in an acat before being transferred to a dcat open prison nsc provides him with three meals a day a room and the company of fellow professionals when he leaves he will go on stealing until he is caught again he will then be arrested sentenced and return to nsc the nearest dcat to his home in boston he earns between fifty and a hundred thousand a year no taxes according to how many months he spends on the out in any particular year he was very distressed to learn last year that the home office was considering closing the prison three more manuscripts arrive in the post today with letters asking if i could critique them four publishers have turned one down another says his wife who is his sternest critic thinks its first class and the final one seeks my advice on vanity publishers socalled vanity publishers are only too happy to publish your book if along with the script you enclose a cheque for by the time i emerged from the bathroom hes disappeared his sheets and pillowcases folded neatly at the end of the bed by now hell be in reception signing his discharge papers and by eightthirty will be on his way a free man the prison is entitled to keep you until midnight on the day of your release but youre usually off the premises by nine oclock on the domestic front she has purchased a small victorian mirror for the hall and seeks my approval she goes on to tell me that baroness nicholson has written saying that she wants to end the feud claiming that she never intended anyone to think that i had misappropriated any funds in the first place in which case how did i end up in a cell three paces by five banged up for fourteen hours a day at wayland if the police and prison service misunderstood her baroness nicholson wrote to sir john stevens commissioner of the metropolitan police in july demanding an investigation into the involvement of jeffrey archer in funds raised and spent through the simple truth appeal this precipitated not only a police enquiry but a lengthy and expensive investigation by kpmg on behalf of the red cross baroness nicholsons insinuation that i had stolen money from the appeal was irresponsible and wholly without foundation and on january the police closed their enquiry in view of the lack of any evidence from the informant he tells the group that he stopped his car to go to the aid of a woman who was being attacked but for his troubles got punched to the ground by what turned out to be her boyfriend the two of them then drove off he returned home but was later arrested for road rage as the woman bore witness that he attacked her had he gone to the police station first and reported them for assault the other man would now be in jail not him he has lost his job with the pharmaceutical company hes been with for twentyone years and is worried about getting another one now he has a criminal record his wife has stuck by him and she hopes that one of his old firms rivals will want to take advantage of his expertise this brings me onto the subject of wives he later wrote to tell me that his old firm took him back the day he was released and treated the six weeks absence as holiday on full pay when i first arrived at nsc and worked as the orderly in the sentence management unit the tagging board of mr berlyn and mr simpson used to agree to about per cent of those eligible for this privilege now all eight are granted on the same day including a twentythreeyearold whos already been to prison four times lee admits that he was shocked when the board granted him tagging status as his offence was punching someone on the nose in a pub brawl and in any case he looks upon prison as a way of life in fact his last comment to linda before leaving us was see you towards the end of the year if not before he turns to me and adds lets hope youre out by then jeff caused by the problem of overcrowding b he could also trade his medication for other drugs the analgesic the inmates most commonly ask for is kapake which is a mixture of paracetamol and codeine the reason is that codeine will show up in mdt as an opiate and thus disguise illegal opiates the user can then protest but im taking kapake which the doctor prescribed prison doctors are now trying to limit the use of kapake and diazepam when a prisoner has a record of taking drugs alison tells me that the bbc has been in touch about a programme on bestselling authors called reading the decades while accepting the fact that i cant appear on camera they ask if i could do a telephone interview they already have contributions from king grisham le carre forsyth cooper and rowling i ask governor leighton for a view and he says that hell seek advice from the home office mr leighton is unable to make the decision himself he reports back the following day that the bbc had already been in touch with the home office and they have been turned down dr susan edwards reader of law at buckingham university has completed her independent study showing the harshness of my fouryear sentence the full report was published in the criminal law review of august i have just returned from an hours walk around the playing field with the intention of watching hendry vs doherty in the quarterfinal of the world championship snooker when theres a knock on my door i was president of the world snooker association until i was arrested when the board asked me to resign two other bodies expelled me the royal society of arts and the mcc but and there are always buts in prison mr berlyn has posted a notice in both new blocks making it clear that this is to be considered a privilege and anyone who fails to keep to the guidelines will be suspended and put to work on the farm at a week two prisoners absconded during their first week at work both were caught and transferred to a bcat in nottingham two were found in a pub and are back working on the farm while three were sacked for inappropriate behaviour unwanted advances to the female staff and that was in the first week an officer drops in and tells me over coffee that there is disquiet among the officers and staff that sex offenders will in future make up a considerable percentage of our inmates officers fear the atmosphere may change from the relaxed state we currently enjoy to one of constant tension as regular offenders despise paedophiles it is even possible that one or two of the more violent inhabitants might take it upon themselves to administer their own form of justice most sex offenders when housed in an open prison are given a cover story should anyone ask what they are in for mary picks me up and as the press are waiting at the gatehouse we avoid boston we end up in a field of cows eating a picnic heaven even if the press do get the inevitable picture they did it was published in the sunday mirror the next day see overleaf today my fourth sunday mary and i have been invited to lunch with gillian and tom shephard and a few of their friends at their home in thetford as thetford is on the way back to nsc and within the fiftyfivemile radius of nsc we decide to take separate cars so i can return to prison after lunch see map page we leave the old vicarage at pm i had no idea how important this lunch would turn out to be on the evening i wrote these words today i attend the pm dress rehearsal of annie at the liberal club and leave the cast after chris colby has run through his notes i wish them all luck and depart a few minutes before six i now feel not only part of the team but that im doing a worthwhile job when i first entered the liberal club an elderly gentlemen remarked prison is one thing jeff but the liberal club my first visitor is dr razzak who assures me that she will inform the governor i should not be moved on medical grounds i assume that mr beaumont was given dr razzaks advice if so he ignored it by the time the officers arrive theres blood everywhere it takes five of them to drag the two men apart the two combatants are then frogmarched off to segregation one officer pushes the prisoners head down while another keeps his legs bent this is known as being bent up or twisted up in the rule book its described as control and restraint clive seems confident that they wont be able to prove money laundering but may get him for failure to pay vat i am pleased to learn that david the friendly schoolmaster at nsc who joined clives company on leaving prison quickly realized what he was up to and resigned during association i phone mary while shes briefing me on nareys attempts on radio and television to defend his decision to send me to lincoln another fight breaks out i watch as two more prisoners are dragged away mary goes on to tell me that narey is backtracking as fast as he can and the home office is nowhere to be seen the commentators seem convinced that i will be transferred back to a dcat fairly quickly it cant be too soon i tell her this place is full of violent drugaddicted thugs i can only admire the way the officers keep the lid on such a boiling cauldron there was a riot the week after i left and seventeen inmates ended up in hospital the home secretary can have no idea of the damage hes causing to such people by forcing them to mix in vile conditions with murderers thugs and drug addicts such men should be sent to a dcat the day they are sentenced i wrote this in a prison diary volume one belmarsh hell and the home office have shown scant interest there arent any votes in prisons mr marsh a senior officer who has a rare gift for keeping things under control opens the cell door and tells me i have a meeting with the area manager i am escorted to a private room and introduced to mr spurr and ms stamp mr spurr explains that he has been given the responsibility of investigating my case as i have received some letters during the past four days every one of them retained every one of them expressing outrage at the directorgenerals judgment this doesnt come as a great surprise an area manager is senior to a governor and can have as many as fifty prisons under his remit he reports directly to the deputy directorgeneral as for so hocking i have been distressed to learn that he was summarily forced to resign from the prison service on september under the threat of losing his pension if he did not do so pc karen brooks was more fortunate in her employers her role was investigated comprehensively by chief inspector gossage and sergeant kent of the lincolnshire police and she remains with the force chief inspector gossage and sergeant kent interviewed me during their later investigation of the same lunch and made it very clear that they thought the prison service had acted hastily and disproportionately in transferring me to hmp lincoln since mr beaumonts suspension mr hocking has addressed the tribunal and made it clear that he was forced to resign by beaumont with the threat of being sacked but who bullied mr beaumont the publication of a prison diary volume one belmarsh hell is the lead item on the news the facts are fairly reported no one seems to think that the home office will try to prevent the publication however the directorgeneral is checking to see if i have broken any prison rules mr narey is particularly exercised by the mention of other prisoners names i have only referred to prisoners surnames when they are major characters in the diary and only then when their permission has been granted two years and two prison diaries later and i have not received one letter of complaint from a prisoner or prison officer about the diaries despite receiving some letters in the last three years
